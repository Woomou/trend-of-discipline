AB Many ecological economists have long been advocating that industrialised nations should abandon their growth predilection and initiate the transition to a steady-state economy. To demonstrate how a nation's transition to a steady-state economy might be usefully guided, Fisherian national income - one of the best known indicators of sustainable economic welfare - is calculated for Australia for the period 1967-1997. Also calculated for the study period is the changing physical scale of the Australian economy. By juxtaposing per capita Fisherian income and the growth of the Australian economy, it is shown that Australia surpassed its optimal macroeconomic scale in the mid-1970s. While, around this time, Australia began a transition to a lower rate of growth that arrested the steep decline in per capita Fisherian income, Australia had reverted back to a high-growth policy by the end of the study period. It chose not to continue the deceleration towards a steady-state economy, a policy stance that is likely to be detrimental to the sustainable economic welfare enjoyed by the average Australian.

AB The present study uses emergy methodology to evaluate environmental aspects of integrated production systems of grains, pig and fish in small farms in the South region of Brazil. New emergy parameters that use partial renewability factor of each input were used to improve emergy accounting. These parameters were already applied to different case studies and are very appropriate for use in emergy assessment of integrated agricultural systems. The following indicators were calculated for the integrated production system of grains, pig and fish: transformity: 948,000 sej/J; renewability: 24%; emergy yield ratio: 1.44; emergy investment ratio: 2.28; environmental loading ratio: 3.13 and emergy exchange ratio: 6.8. These values were compared with results calculated for grains, pig and fish production subsystems working in a separated way. The results obtained signalize that an integrated system has better emergy efficiency, is more sustainable and is less stressful on the environment in comparison with separated production subsystems. The emergy indicators presented are discussed in the text and they will be useful in further work to assist the formulation of public policy, and also to recommend better management practices to farmers.

AB A bio-socio-economic model was developed to simulate (a) biological interactions related to traditional fishing, aquaculture, and the physical marine ervironment and (b) coastal labour market interactions and the regulatory environment. The model was calibrated using published information on fish farms, fishing, fished stocks and labour activity. Fished stocks were considered as a single unit undergoing constant natural regeneration. Aquaculture production was described by a standard Cobb-Douglas production function. The labour force in the coastal community was taken to comprise four components: (a) traditional fishing, (b) aquaculture, (3) other employment, and (4) the unemployed labour. Simulations investigating the effect of stricter regulation of traditional fishing and aquaculture on biomass, fish production and employment suggested that while stricter regulation of fishing inevitably leads to declining employment in fisheries, increased regulation of aquaculture will not necessarily stem growth in that sector. The importance of aquaculture as an alternative source of employment is emphasised. Nevertheless, the present model ignores the potential adverse effects of catastrophic stochastic events on the fishing and aquaculture sectors (e.g. recruitment failure in wild fish populations, loss of farm stock) and the relatively optimistic outlook suggested for the aquaculture industry should therefore be viewed with caution.

AB The 'sustainability debate' has had a profound influence on contemporary Landscape Ecology. This paper explores the implications of the second global summit for the research agendas that developed after the Rio Summit (1992), and argues that although the Declaration from Johannesburg 2002 restates the earlier summit concerns, the messages it sends to the research community are subtly different to those a decade earlier. The growing body of literature, which identifies the need for a new kind of sustainability science, is reviewed, and its relevance to Landscape Ecology is discussed. Although recent commentators have argued for a more transdisciplinary approach to Landscape Ecology that appears to meet the requirements of this new science we still lack ways of taking this forward. The paper concludes by proposing a new paradigm for Landscape Ecology based on the concept of ecosystem goods and services, or natural capital. It is argued that in the decade since the Rio Summit, a key focus of the future research agenda for the discipline should be an exploration of the 'sustainability choice space' defined by the interaction of biophysical limits and social and economic values at the landscape- scale. The paper provides a conceptual model (the tongue model) that describes how biophysical and socio-economic constraints can be combined in sustainability planning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB In order to reconcile landscape conservation with changing demands on land use and natural resources, it is essential that the ecological. socio-cultural and economic values of the landscape be fully taken into account in planning and decision-making., This paperpresents a comprehensive framework for integrated assessment of ecological services and socio-economic benefits of natural and semi-natural ecosystems and landscapes. The framework can be applied at different scale levels to different ecosystems or landscape-units and basically consists of three steps: (1) Function-analysis: translates ecological complexity into a limited number of ecosystem (or landscape) functions, which, in turn, provide a range of goods and services; (2) Function valuation: includes ecological. socio-cultural and economic valuation methods; and (3) Conflict analysis: to facilitate the application of function-analysis and valuation at different scale levels, it is important to integrate analytical valuation methods with stakeholder participation techniques.
   The framework presented in this paper facilitates the structured assessment of the (total) value of the goods and services provided by a specific area (landscape) and to analyze the costs and benefits involved in trade-offs between various land use options. The last section of this paper gives some conclusions and recommendations for application-possibilities of function-analysis and valuation to achieve more sustainable landscape use and maintenance of our "natural capital".

AB As landscapes change continuously in a more or less chaotic way, the concept of sustainable landscapes could be viewed as a utopian goal. New landscapes emerge with changing life-styles. Decision making for landscape planning, conservation and management use the concept of sustainability widely. To make it operational, many new associated and more specific concepts have been proposed such as natural and social capital, conservation economy and quality of life capital. Most of these are inspired by economic thinking and rarely refer directly to the landscape. This article reviews the background and meaning of these concepts and shows that landscape is not seen here as an integrating, holistic concept. As landscape changes, also its meaning and significance changes and consequently its management. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new paradigm of Natural Capital and Sustainable Landscapes has been suggested. It implies the integration of economic, environmental and social-cultural qualities in a physical setting while focusing on functions in terms of goods and services for people. Due to its anthropocentric perspective it pays less attention to landscape structure and spatial arrangement compared to the widely applied patch-matrix concept. The matrix of land use elements provides the key to understanding land use systems and land use changes and it can play an important role in understanding land use pattern and their dynamics. But one of the remaining constraints for a direct application of landscape ecological concepts in practice is the lack of agreed ways to combine environmental, socio-economic and societal/cultural views. This paper examines both paradigms, asking: does the spatial arrangement of land use types add specific qualities beyond statistical measures of their existence and quantity? For instance, can a landscape be sustainable, as long as 20% of the land use is extensive, 10% is protection area, etc., no matter where the respective patches are, which typical size and shape they have, how connected patches are and how often incompatible land use types are adjacent? This paper elucidates spatial concepts for sustainable landscapes with an emphasis on the role of GIs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The establishment of the Common Agricultural Policy has dramatically transformed the relationship between the natural environment and agriculture in the UK. Accordingly, the Government now acknowledges that our stock of 'natural capital' is being managed unsustainably and is undertaking Common Agricultural Policy reforms to provide a more sustainable form of agriculture. Such reforms will be based on the economic rationale of payment in return for the provision of natural capital benefits such as biodiversity, carbon sequestration, landscape and recreation. A basic lower tier payment is proposed for general environmental practices, with higher tiers of payments being available for 'benefit generating' habitat maintenance and creation. In order to maximise the benefits of such habitat creation, some form of spatial targeting is required. Using geographical information systems (GIs), a suite of spatially explicit criteria are adopted to measure how the potential benefits of native woodland creation vary across the agricultural landscape of the Chilterns natural area. Rather than regarding habitat conservation solely in terms of biodiversity benefits, a more holistic natural capital benefit approach is thus adopted. Public preference on the provision of each benefit is integrated into the GIS-based suitability analysis through multicriteria evaluation. We demonstrate how such a targeted approach leads to large improvements in the delivery of natural capital benefits, with the attainment of biodiversity, landscape and recreation benefits being particularly complementary. As such, the targeted pursuit of natural capital benefits does not compromise the attainment of biodiversity goals, but actually aids in their achievement. However, due to limitations in data availability and accuracy, GIs should be regarded as a decision support tool, with validation of targeted sites being undertaken throuah a farm audit system.

AB Habitat suitability modelling has shown itself to be an important decision support tool for those concerned with the problem of where to target habitat and landscape restoration efforts. However, present approaches generally focus upon the biophysical characteristics of habitats and sites, and tend to ignore the social values associated with landscapes and habitat features. As a result current approaches only partially resolve the problems we face when dealing with a multifunctional landscape. In this paper, we examine how these limitations of current approaches may be overcome. The paper shows that present approaches to suitability modelling can be broadened by linking them to ideas about natural capital and landscape function. The approach is illustrated by means of a case study from the South Downs of England. It is suggested that by using the approach to model the spatial aspects of the natural capital associated with a given landscape, we may provide the user community with a framework that more fully addresses management issues that arise in the context of a sustainable, multifunctional landscape. In the case of the South Downs we show that restoration strategies that seek to take account of the multiple functions of downland differ from those which focus exclusively on enhancing or restoring the biodiversity of these areas.

AB This paper presents a methodological synthesis of two congruent approaches into a common landscape change trajectory analysis and the assessment of landscape dynamics and sustainability. The emphasis of the analysis is on the retrospective relationship between the past and the present-day landscape patterns and associated key biotopes. The example key biotopes, oak woodlands and grasslands, represent valuable habitats in the hermboreal landscapes of Finland and Sweden. The paper presents a conceptual stepwise approach for change trajectory analysis utilising multiple spatio-temporal data and techniques available in image processing and geographical information systems (GIS) including the following steps: (I) specification of spatio-temporal data and their representation of target objects, (II) the choice of direct or indirect change trajectory analysis, (III) hierarchical structuring of landscape information, (IV) compilation of landscape information into a GIS database, and (V) identification of paths for landscape change trajectory analysis. In this case study, we have focused on three interlinked trajectory analysis approaches, and their role in the assessment of landscape sustainability from a potential biodiversity perspective. We conclude that proposed landscape change trajectory analysis can improve the assessment of the key biotopes as well as present-day landscape characteristics, in maintaining biodiversity and related ecological values by providing information on landscape stability, continuity, change processes and boundary dynamics. This approach can be useful in the assessment of natural capital, but requires data-specific and context sensitive data processing and analysis solutions. The results should be interpreted as an approximation and generalisation of the spatio-temporal complexity of landscape reality and therefore be used in conjunction with additional habitat function measures.

AB In this paper, we propose the ecological network concept as a suitable basis for inserting biodiversity conservation into sustainable landscape development. For landscapes to be ecologically sustainable, the landscape structure should support those ecological processes required for the landscape to deliver biodiversity services for present and future generations. We first show that in multifunctional, human-dominated landscapes, biodiversity conservation needs a coherent large-scale spatial structure of ecosystems. Theory and empirical knowledge of ecological networks provides a framework for the design of such structures. Secondly, ecological networks can bridge the paradox between reserve conservation (fixing nature in space and time) and development, which implies change. This is because ecological networks can change structure without losing their conservation potential. Thirdly, ecological networks facilitate stakeholder decision-making on feasible biodiversity goals. They help to focus on an effective spatial scale. We conclude that extending the ecological network concept with multifunctional indicators is a promising step towards sustainable landscape development and stakeholder decision-making.

AB The future implementation of improved and sustainable control strategies for the major equine parasites will be dependent on a greater insight into their basic biology, pathogenicity and epidemiology together with an enhanced ability for accurate diagnosis. This paper will provide a review of the current molecular methods under development for the detection of equine parasites and their application to current scientific questions. In particular, the strongyles are recognised as important pathogens of horses and recent advances made in the study of this parasitic group at the single species level will be addressed. The ribosomal (r)DNA region of the parasite genome has been employed to distinguish between closely related species. Molecular probes designed to this target region were used in combination with PCR technology to allow the identification of individual species within mixed infections. They have been applied to all parasite stages to look at the role of individual species in natural infection, disease and drug resistance. Similar techniques have been developed to detect other equine parasites and these will also be discussed. Further opportunities for employing existing techniques and the need for new diagnostic tools will be highlighted. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB [1] Synthesis of ideas and theories from disparate disciplines is necessary for addressing the major problems faced by society. The best motivation for broad, effective synthesis is the "big idea'' that is sufficiently important and inspiring to marshal the appropriate collaborative efforts. Groundwater quality sustainability is posed as an example of one such idea that would potentially unify research efforts in both the sciences and social sciences toward a common, pressing objective.

AB Water quality and shrimp production were monitored in extensively managed ponds which were fed a 25% (P25) or 40% (P40) dietary protein, each diet complemented with or without carbohydrate (CH) addition. The experiment was carried out in 6-m(3) concrete tanks, with a mud bottom and stocked with 7 post larvae (PL 20) of Penaeus monodon per m(2). Tapioca flour was used as carbohydrate source. CH addition reduced total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrite-nitrogen (NO2--N) in the water column and TAN in the sediment (P < 0.001). CH addition also increased the total heterotrophic bacterial (THB) count in water column and sediment (P < 0.05). Lower specific growth rate (SGR) and higher feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded in P25, compared to all other treatments (P < 0.05). The 160 g m(-2) shrimp yield in treatment P25+CH was similar to the 157 g m(-2) yield in treatment P40, which was much higher than the 114 g m-2 yield in treatment P25 (P < 0.001). CH addition to treatment P40, did not result in a higher yield (P > 0.05). The protein efficiency ratio (PER) was higher (P < 0.001) in treatment P25+CH compared to other treatments. Survival of the shrimps was not affected by treatment (P > 0.05). A system nitrogen budget revealed that 16% to 21% of the total nitrogen input was retained in the shrimp, 0.22% to 0.49% in the water, 67% to 71% in the sediment, and 2.1% to 2.7% was lost through water exchange. The quantity of nitrogen not retained in shrimp biomass to produce 1 kg of shrimp ranged between 109.2 and 164.0 g N. The total water based N-loss (final pond water N+exchange N-loss) from an extensive type of shrimp culture system was within the range of 2.7% to 3.2% of the total input nitrogen. The percentage non-retained nitrogen was reduced by CH addition (P < 0.01). In summary, CH addition to the water column under extensive shrimp culture conditions (1) increased the nitrogen retention in harvested shrimp biomass (2) reduced the demand for feed protein (3) reduced the concentration of TAN and NO2--N in the pond, and (4) reduced nitrogen discharge making extensive shrimp farming more ecologically sustainable and economically viable.

AB Fed fish farms produce large amounts of wastes, including dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. In China, fish mariculture in coastal waters has been increasing since the last decade. However, there is no macroalgae commercially cultivated in north China in warm seasons. To exploit fish-farm nutrients as a resource input, and at the same time to reduce the risk of eutrophication, the high-temperature adapted red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis (Bory) Dawson from south China was co-cultured with the fish Sebastodes fuscescens in north China in warm seasons. Growth and nutrient removal from fish culture water were investigated in laboratory conditions in order to evaluate the nutrient bioremediation capability of G. lemaneiformis. Feasibility of integrating the seaweed cultivation with the fed fish-cage aquaculture in coastal waters of north China was also investigated in field conditions. Laboratory seaweed/fish co-culture experiments showed that the seaweed was an efficient nutrient pump and could remove most nutrients from the system. Field cultivation trials showed that G. lemaneiformis grew very well in fish farming areas, at maximum growth rate of 11.03% day(-1). Mean C, N, and P contents in dry thalli cultured in Jiaozhou Bay were 28.9 +/- 1.1%, 4.17 +/- 0.11 % and 0.33 +/- 0.01 %, respectively. Mean N and P uptake rates of the thalli were estimated at 10.64 and 0.38 mu mol g(-1) dry weight h(-1), respectively. An extrapolation of the results showed that a 1-ha cultivation of the seaweed in coastal fish fanning waters would give an annual harvest of more than 70 t of fresh G. lemaneiformis, or 9 t dry materials; 2.5 t C would be produced, and simultaneously 0.22 t N and 0.03t P would be sequestered from the seawater by the seaweed. Results indicated that the seaweed is suitable as a good candidate for seaweed/fish integrated mariculture for bioremediation and economic diversification. The integration can benefit economy and environment in a sustainable manner in warm seasons in coastal waters of north China. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The reproductive biology of Arca noae (L.) was investigated to assess its aquaculture potential and exploitation as a sustainable fishery. A. noae was sampled monthly from Mali Ston Bay, south Adriatic Sea, from November 2001 to October 2002 and from January to December 2004. A total of 590 individuals ranging in shell length from 9.7 to 80.8 mm was analyzed using standard histological techniques.
   Results indicate that males dominate small shell length categories with females becoming more predominant as size increases suggesting that some individuals may undergo protandric development. The overall male to female ratio was 1.0 : 1.3 (chi(2) = 9.529, p =0.002). A number (2.2%) of hermaphroditic animals were also identified. The smallest sexually mature A. noae had a shell length of 12 mm. Gametogenic development began in October (female) and November (male), with spawning occurring during summer (July to August). Results of a size frequency analysis of oocyte diameters agreed with a qualitative analysis of gonadal development stages, confirming the occurrence of one annual spawning peak. There was no correlation between mean gonad index and environmental conditions. Data on the reproductive characteristics of A. noae obtained in this study give an insight into the biology of this species and are crucial for initiating its aquaculture.

AB Internal parasitism constitutes one of the greatest disease problems in grazing livestock worldwide. Control of these parasites is now becoming a serious concern, particularly in the small ruminant industries, due to the widespread and rapid development of resistance to chemotherapy. The broad-spectrum drugs (anthelmintics) used in the control of nematode parasites fall into just three classes viz. the benzimidazoles, imidothiazoles and macrocyclic lactones. Resistance to all three drug classes now occurs in the major nematode parasites of sheep and goats throughout the world. This is largely the result of a more-or-less complete reliance on anthelmintics for worm control. By analogy then, any specific parasite control method may be unsustainable when used in isolation. The more choices and the greater variety of controls used in combination, rather than relying almost solely on anthelmintics, the longer effective worm control can be expected. Grazing management strategies and biological control offer two non-chemical methods of parasite control, which have proven effectiveness. These should form part of integrated nematode parasite control programmes for grazing livestock with the objective of maintaining long-term sustainability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB PEM fuel cell systems are considered as a sustainable option for the future transport sector in the future. There is great interest in converting current hydrocarbon based transportation fuels into hydrogen rich gases acceptable by PEM fuel cells on-board of vehicles. In this paper, we compare the results of our simulation studies for 100 kW PEM fuel cell systems utilizing three different major reforming technologies, namely steam reforming (SREF), partial oxidation (POX) and autothermal reforming (ATR). Natural gas, gasoline and diesel are the selected hydrocarbon fuels. It is desired to investigate the effect of the selected fuel reforming options on the overall fuel cell system efficiency, which depends on the fuel processing, PEM fuel cell and auxiliary system efficiencies. The Aspen-HYSYS 3.1 code has been used for simulation purposes. Process parameters of fuel preparation steps have been determined considering the limitations set by the catalysts and hydrocarbons involved. Results indicate that fuel properties, fuel processing system and its operation parameters, and PEM fuel cell characteristics all affect the overall system efficiencies. Steam reforming appears as the most efficient fuel preparation option for all investigated fuels. Natural gas with steam reforming shows the highest fuel cell system efficiency. Good heat integration within the fuel cell system is absolutely necessary to achieve acceptable overall system efficiencies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Huperziaceae is comprised of two genera, Huperzia and Phlegmarittrus. Because of the content of Lycopodium alkaloids like huperzine A, which are used to treat a number of human ailments, plants of the Huperziaceae are experiencing a rapid decline in China, mostly due to over-harvesting. Because of this trend, we engaged from 1995 to 2001 in an investigation of the natural resources of the Huperziaceae in China. The main objectives of this study were: to catalog Huperziaceae plant resources including the occurrence, general distribution, and abundance of the various Huperziaceae species in China; and to determine traditional use and pharmaceutical values of each species. Twenty-nine species, 2 varieties, and 2 forma of Huperzia and 19 species of Phlegmariurus were identified through field investigation, collection, visits with local traditional doctors, and review of specimens in herbaria and of the literature. Ethnobotanical studies of these plants revealed that 33 of these species are used by the local communities for medicinal purposes. One species, Huperzia serrata, is one of the most popular. As a result, it is observing the greatest decline, mandating a change in collection practice and general attitude towards these plants. Introduction of conservation plans and training of the local communities regarding appropriate collection practices of these plants and their marketing in China are required to reverse the trend of decline among these species. In addition, development of cultivation or other propagation practices, such as in vitro propagation, would have the added benefits of socio-economic uplift of the local communities and sustainability of this important source of huperzine A.

AB Sustainable development requires an integrated evaluation of both economic and environmental dimensions. The ensuing debate on the topic, however, was focused on its environmental aspects, as if they were fully independent from the social and economic conditions of sustainability. In this paper, we intend to present a primal approach to develop an exergy-economic accounting allowing to overcome the limits of each analytic discipline through its integration in a sound economic scheme such as environmental accounting; this scheme will be adapted to sea-coastal systems. In order to complete the approach mentioned a specific indicator will be proposed aimed to evaluate the relationship between ecosystem quality and economic added value stemming from the anthropic use of the system.

AB With the aim to utilize a vegetable oil epoxy, a product from a sustainable resource, for improving the properties of polymethacrylic acid (PMAA), the blends of the latter with the epoxy of linseed oil were prepared in solution by mechanical mixing of the requisite amounts of the two components in climethylsulphoxide. Freestanding films of the blend were cast. The miscibility of the two components was investigated by viscosity, ultrasonic, and density measurements which showed that the two components were semicompatible in solution. The compatibility in solid phase was also examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which revealed that linseed oil epoxy (LOE) and PMAA were incompatible. The films of blend of all compositions were found to be sticky, which was caused by the oozing of LOE. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Sustainable utilization of forest resources has been widely adopted as a conservation strategy, but that sustainability has rarely been empirically tested. Plant resource extraction from Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP) by local communities has been legalized and controlled in areas called multiple use zones (MUZs). Through a series of systematic transects and plots, we determined harvest impacts of two mostly harvested medicinal plants of Rytigynia kigeziensis VERDC.l and Ocotea usambarensis Engl in BINP. The plots were placed in MUZs and non-MUZs. Data on biomass production and population dynamics were collected from the plots. We also analysed forest society records for the past 3 years to determine annual plant resource offtakes from BINP. Bark production of the two plants in MUZs and non-MUZs are not significantly different, suggesting an insignificant change in bark production because of bark harvest. Annual bark harvests of the two plants are between 0.26-1.64% of available bark stock. These are too low to cause any noticeable negative impacts and are sustainable. Annual bark harvest of R. kigeziensis and O. usambarensis should be increased from the original 1% to about 3% of available bark stock to allow more involvement of the marginalized poor people like Batwa in BINP.

   livelihoods; environmental degradation; technology adoption
AB Considerable agreement exists among researchers, development practitioners, and policymakers regarding the goals of sustainable agricultural intensification (SAI). They include: achieving agricultural productivity growth, household food security, and improved rural livelihoods and employment, while simultaneously mitigating environmental degradation. However, the multiplicity of these objectives, as well as the choice of approaches to achieving them and the site- and context-specificity of specific technological and institutional interventions, assures that the research and policy challenges to achieving SAI will remain considerable. This article summarizes the contributions of the articles in this Special Issue in four areas of the literature. First, labor market constraints, the labor intensity of specific agricultural technologies and practices, and labor's substitutability, or complementarity, with other inputs are shown to widely influence their viability and related input efficiencies. Second, the articles identify specific tradeoffs and synergistic relationships that arise in the attainment of these multiple goals stemming from technologies, management practices, and policies introduced under specific agroclimatic, market, and institutional conditions. Third, these papers contribute to the literature on agricultural technology adoption by furnishing additional empirical evidence on the determinants and effects of investment behavior and adoption of specific technologies and management practices. Finally, the articles in this Special Issue emphasize that there is no single policy nor technological, management, or institutional innovation that unambiguously promotes SAI. Preferred policies must be contextualized and sensitive to initial biophysical, market, and institutional conditions.

AB This article presents a bio-economic household model, which has been developed to assess the potential impacts of agricultural intensification efforts on economic and ecological indicators in eastern Uganda. A study region in the Lake Victoria Crescent was selected with comparative advantages for intensive agricultural production: high agricultural potential, high market access, and high population density. However, current production is characterized by low input-output systems revealing a discrepancy between development opportunities and actual development outcomes. Based on a farmer participatory research approach, production methods were introduced in the study region aimed at fostering sustainable agricultural development. Data from two community surveys, two comprehensive household and plot level surveys, and farm-trial data were used to develop and calibrate bio-economic models for four representative household types. Model scenarios reveal that farm households in eastern Uganda would not pursue sustainable intensification under current socio-economic conditions. The market environment has to be improved substantially, i.e., transaction and transportation costs have to be reduced, innovative credit schemes for smallholders have to be introduced, and alternative forms of labor acquisition have to be promoted, to provide sufficient economic incentives for the adoption of environmentally sound production methods. In addition, agricultural service provision needs to be reformed and more agricultural research is needed for new and better-targeted technologies.

AB In this article, we use data for 376 households, 1,066 parcels, and 2,143 plots located in 95 villages in the hillside areas in Honduras to generate information needed by decision makers to assess the needs and opportunities for public investments, and design policies that stimulate natural resource conservation. We develop a quantitative livelihood approach, using factor and cluster analysis to group households based on the use of their main assets. This resulted in seven household categories that pursue similar livelihood strategies. We use a multinomial logit model to show that livelihood strategies are determined by comparative advantages as reflected by a combination of biophysical and socioeconomic variables. While 92% of the rural hillsides population in Honduras lives on US$1.00/capita/day or less, households that follow a livelihood strategy based on basic grain farming are the poorest because they often live in isolated areas with relatively poor agro-ecological and socioeconomic conditions. Opportunities for off-farm work tend to be limited in these areas and household strategies that combine on-farm work with off-farm work earn higher incomes. Per capita incomes can be increased by improving road infrastructure, widening access to land, policies that reduce household size and dependency ratios, and adoption of sustainable land management technologies that restore soil fertility. We used probit models to show that the latter can be promoted by agricultural extension programs and land redistribution. Investments in physical assets should be directed toward households that pursue livelihood strategies based on off-farm employment or coffee production, while agricultural training programs are best focused on livestock producers.

ID TERM CROP RESPONSE; LAND-USE SYSTEMS; FERTILIZER; SOIL
AB Strategies for poverty alleviation and sustainable natural resource management usually focus on land use options for improving yields. Increasing the returns to critical factors requires possibilities for input substitution. Inadequate timing of input applications or nonavailability of complementary factors can seriously hinder this substitution. Such constraints particularly apply in less-favored areas where soil organic matter content is too low for enabling efficient nutrient uptake and soil structure limits water infiltration and moisture retention.
   This article focuses attention on the importance of labor for crop management activities and input applications that enhance input efficiency in highland area cropping systems of Northern Ethiopia. Given the inherent complementarities between labor and nutrient supply during critical phases of the plant growth process, input efficiency strongly depends on labor use. We present a semiparametric bioeconomic modeling approach to analyze the available options for improving input efficiency in agricultural production. Input response equations are used that consider the returns per unit of land and labor as a function of specific combinations of material inputs and management practices. Critical trade-offs may arise when opportunity costs for labor are considered or when complementary factors appear as binding constraints. The model enables assessment of feasible pathways for enhancing sustainable intensification and poverty alleviation in typical settings of the East African highland region.

AB Land degradation poses a serious problem for the livelihoods of rural producers. Furthermore, there is rarely enough private investment taking place to commensurate the scale of the problem. This article examines the role of tenure insecurity, resource poverty, risk and time preferences, and community-led land conservation on differentiated patterns of household investment in land conservation in northern Ethiopia. We control for biophysical, household characteristics, market access conditions, and village level factors. Investments in soil bunds and stone terraces are specifically studied so as to capture the link between these various factors and the durability of conservation investments. We introduce the distinction between the determinants of the decision to invest and how much to invest in conservation. Regression results show that publicly led conservation programs seem to significantly stimulate private investment. A host of plot-level variables and household perceptions of returns on conservation investments, expressed in terms of perceived improvements in land quality and increased crop yields, were found to be critical to the decision to invest and intensify soil conservation. The evidence on the significance of households' attitudes toward risk aversion suggests the important role of risk and the household's risk-bearing capacity in the decision to intensify conservation measures. At the same time, tenure security indicators and households' resource endowments (resource poverty) had weaker effects in increasing willingness to invest and the level of investment made. The policy implications of these results point to the importance of agricultural research and extension efforts that target technologies which reduce household risk and poverty while enabling sustainable investments in conservation measures by individual households.

AB The Lore Lindu region in Indonesia-as in many forest frontier areas in Southeast Asia-has experienced rapid deforestation due to agricultural expansion in the uplands, at the forest margins. This has resulted in aggravated problems of erosion and water availability, threatening agricultural productivity growth. At the same time, technical progress is promoting agricultural intensification in the lowlands. In this article, we examine how improved technologies for paddy rice cultivation in the lowlands have affected agricultural expansion and deforestation in the uplands. The question of a "forest-saving" or "forest-clearing" effect related to technical innovation is important from a sustainable development perspective and remains a controversial issue in the literature. We address this question for the Lore Lindu region with an empirical model in which expansion in the lowlands and the uplands is estimated simultaneously. We use data from an extensive village survey conducted in the region, combined with GIS data. To guide the empirical analysis, we develop a theoretical framework based on a Chayanov-type agricultural household model. The model analyzes farmers' land allocation decisions, taking into account the lowland-upland dichotomy in the agricultural sector. The empirical findings, corroborated by the analytically derived results, show how technical progress for lowland production affects land use at the forest margins and how these effects depend on the factor-intensity of the technology. The findings imply specific rural development policies for sustainable agricultural intensification in forest frontier areas.

TI Water buffalo and cattle ranching in the Lower Amazon Basin: Comparisons

SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS

DE Brazilian Amazon; water buffalo; cattle ranching; floodplains; conflicts
AB From 1975 to 2000, the water buffalo population in the Brazilian Amazon increased at nearly 13% per year, making it one of the fastest growing herds in the world. On the floodplains of the Amazon River buffalo are managed in a similar manner to cattle, but often earn superior production figures. This production advantage, however, is tempered by the role buffalo play in conflicts between landowners; buffalo are prone to altering the floodplain environment and interfering with production activities such as fishing and farming. In this research, we show that buffalo are kept on the floodplains 24% longer than cattle throughout the year, and 37% longer than cattle during periods when landowner conflicts are most likely to occur. We also show that buffalo productivity is greater than cattle in this system, which gives an opportunity to design management regimes for buffalo that may increase production costs, but that will lower the environmental and social problems that involve buffalo. Specifically, when the waters begin to rise, buffalo should be removed from the floodplains at the same time as cattle. Although this will not lessen the damage done while the buffalo is on the floodplain, it will place buffalo on the floodplain during the dry season when the erosion potential is at its lowest, and reduce the time that buffalo may interfere with other production activities such as fishing. The additional production costs incurred by early removal will not dissipate the production advantage over cattle. Without specific management that addresses the socioeconomic and environmental problems caused by buffalo, the continued high growth rate for the buffalo population on the Amazon floodplains may not be sustainable and conflicts will become commonplace.

ID SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB While questions about the environmental sustainability of contemporary farming practices and the socioeconomic viability of rural communities are attracting increasing attention throughout the US, these two issues are rarely considered together. This paper explores the current and potential connections between these two aspects of sustainability, using data on community members' and farmers' views of agricultural issues in California's Central Valley. These views were collected from a series of individual and group interviews with biologically oriented and conventional farmers as well as community stakeholders. Local marketing, farmland preservation, and perceptions of sustainable agriculture comprised the primary topics of discussion. The mixed results indicate that, while many farmers and community members have a strong interest in these topics, sustainable community development and the use of sustainable farming practices are seldom explicitly linked. On the other hand, many separate efforts around the Valley to increase local marketing and agritourism, improve public education about agriculture, and organize grassroots farmland preservation initiatives were documented. We conclude that linking these efforts more explicitly to sustainable agriculture and promoting more engagement between ecologically oriented farmers and their communities could engender more economic and political support for these farmers, helping them and their communities to achieve greater sustainability in the long run.

AB In the short- to medium-term, agfi-environment schemes are potentially the key rnechanism for reversing farmland bird declines across Europe. The Arable Stewardship Pilot Scheme (ASPS) was designed to test the delivery of resources by a suite of management options for a range of farmland taxa, in two lowland farmland regions of England (East Anglia and West Midlands). The impact of ASPS on breeding farmland birds was tested in a replicated farm-scale experiment, in which changes in numbers of breeding birds over 5 years were compared between scheme and control farms. Additionally, the impact of specific ASPS options on breeding bird distribution was assessed at the fieldscale, using data collected after the options had been deployed for 5 years. At the field-scale, presence/absence of both field nesting and boundary-nesting species was associated with the presence of certain ASPS options. Many of these responses can be explained in terms of abundance of/access to nest sites or invertebrate/seed food resources provided by the ASPS options. However, despite showing significant positive responses at the field-scale, most species showed no response at a farm-scale. Between-year changes were significantly more positive on scheme than control farms for only three species in East Anglia and one species in West Midlands. The importance of these results is discussed with respect to the value of further research on the scale of options required to produce farm-scale effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Runoff production and herbicide loss in surface runoff were studied on a pastoral hillslope of 1050 m(2) located in the Pukemanga catchment (New Zealand) during two rainfall events using a large sprinkler-type rainfall simulator. Simulated rainfall was applied for approximately I h at an average intensity of 35 min h(-1), 1 day after the herbicide application. In late autumn, the herbicide Pasture Kleen (TM) was applied at the recommended pasture application rate of 2 L ha(-1) (active ingredient 1050 g ha(-1) 2,4-D ethylhexylester), while the pasture was treated with 4 L ha(-1) MCPB 400 before the spring event (active ingredient 1600 g ha(-1) MCPB sodium salt). The event-averaged MCPB concentration, normalised by the concentration of the solution applied, was twice the normalised 2,4-D concentration, reflecting the higher mobility of the MCPB sodium salt. However, the exported 2,4-D loss in autumn totalled 75 g ha(-1), which equals 7% of the applied mass, and compared to only 4% for MCPB (61 g ha(-1)) during the spring event. Loads carried by sediments were calculated to be negligible. Herbicide loss was clearly determined by runoff volume, which was six times higher in autumn than in spring. The difference in runoff response in the two events could be explained by different pre-event soil water conditions. Saturation-excess with a variable contributing area in the convergent area of the hillslope section was identified as the main runoff generating process. Due to additional input of water by downslope lateral flow, saturation first developed close to the weir gradually extending further upslope. Further research on herbicide loads in subsurface lateral flow and on the spatial distribution of runoff response on the hillslope could identify high risk areas for herbicide loss through runoff. These critical areas could be managed better and for example excluded from herbicide applications to ensure environmentally sustainable agricultural management practices.

AB Among the objectives and goals of the Programa de Certificacion de Derechos Ejidales y Titulacion de Solares Urbanos (PROCEDE), are those of delimiting the social property (ejido and communal) of the entire country, and emitting the corresponding titles and certificates; these actions will permit the celebration of association contracts (rent, share tenancy, partnership), which will propitiate increased investments in the rural sector and also to resolve conflicts over land possession. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate its impact on the economic and social aspects, as well as those of sustainability, in Fresnillo. Zacatecas, Mexico. This zone was selected due to the fact that the certification process in the region had already concluded. To obtain data, 120 questionnaires were applied to an equal number of agrarian subjects, who were selected through simple random sampling. The aspects analyzed were productive reconversion, the solution of conflicts and organization within the agrarian centers, and problems of conservation of natural resources and practices for their solution. The calculation of frequencies was used for the data analysis. It was found that the legal security in land possession was insufficient for producing a change in the crop pattern, but it did contribute to an easier access to governmental programs such as PROCAMPO, and to the solution of conflicts. However, it also propitiated other problems, such as the disintegration of the agrarian centers. which implicitly leads to an increase in the disorganization of the producers. The scarce perception of the deterioration of natural resources is a determining factor in the lack of practices for their conservation and improvement.

AB Doubts exist about the effectiveness of establishing trees near saline discharge areas on farmland to manage dryland salinity. These centre on low rates of water uptake from saline water tables, salt accumulation in tree root zones and the consequent poor growth and survival of trees. Despite this, trees still survive in many plantations established adjacent to saline discharge areas and land-holders often favour such locations, as they do not compete for arable land such as that occurs with plantings in recharge areas. Tree performance and salt accumulation were assessed in three experimental plantations established adjacent to saline discharge areas 20-25 years ago. These were all in the 400-600 mm rainfall zone of south-western Australia. Mean soil salinity, within 1 m of the surface, ranged from 220 to 630 mS m(-1), while permanent ground-waters occurred within 2-5 m of the surface and had electrical conductivities ranging from 175 to 4150 mS m(-1). The study confirmed the low growth rates expected for trees established over shallow, saline water tables in a relatively low rainfall environment, with estimated wood volumes in Eucalyptus cladocalyx, E. spathulata, E. sargentii, E. occidentalis and E. wandoo of between 0.5 and 1.5 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1). Values of up to 3 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1) were obtained on soils with low salinity (< 200 mS m(-1)). The excellent survival (> 70%) of several Eucalyptus species confirms that discharge plantations species can persist, despite increasing soil salinity. However, the long-term sustainability of such plantings (50-100 years) without broader landscape treatment of the present hydrological imbalance must be questioned.

   and attitudes
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The low proportion of forested land and continuing degradation of existing forest cover are serious threats to the sustainability of forestry in Pakistan. Farm forestry has been identified as a feasible solution, particularly in the plain areas. Applying the Theory of Planned Behaviour in a survey of 124 farmers in Dera Ismail Khan district of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province showed that farmers' willingness to grow trees on their farms is a function of their attitudes towards the advantages and disadvantages of growing trees, their perception of the opinions of salient referents and factors that encourage and discourage farm level tree planting. Farmers viewed farm forestry as economically beneficial and environmentally friendly. Tree planting was perceived as increasing income, providing wood for fuel and furniture, controlling erosion and pollution and providing shade for humans and animals. Farmers saw hindrance in agricultural operations and the harbouring of insects, pests and diseases as negative impacts of tree planting; however, these were outweighed by their perceptions of positive impacts. Tree growing decisions of farmers were influenced by the opinions of family members, owners/tenants, fellow farmers and village elders. The factors that significantly predicted farm level tree planting were availability of barren land, lack of markets, lack of nurseries and damage caused by animals and humans. Farm forestry programmes are more likely to be successful if they acknowledge and address the factors which underlie farmers' reasons for planting or not planting trees.

AB Collecting marine organisms for the discovery and development of pharmaceuticals has been perceived variously as sustaining and threatening conservation. Our initial expectations that marine bioprospecting might pose conservation challenges were largely not confirmed. Thousands of marine species have been collected for initial assessment, but usually only in very small amounts. Very few compounds are sufficiently promising to provoke re-collections, where volumes can be much larger. This is where conservation concerns may arise, particularly if the organism is rare, has a restricted distribution, or is targeted in one narrow area. However, industry generally seeks to avoid dependency on small populations, for economic as well as ecological reasons. Alternative supply strategies to wild capture include synthesis and culture. Mandatory collection protocols and environmental impact (stock) assessments are useful routes for management to achieve sustainable use where extraction is desirable. In general, the scanty information available suggests that marine bioprospecting for pharmaceuticals may have minimal impacts on the environment, particularly compared with those created by other pressures.

AB The revision of species-rich genera underpins research and supports the sustainable use and monitoring of biological diversity. One fifth to one quarter of the diversity of all seed plant species occurs in such genera, but difficulties with the revision of species-rich genera has resulted in many of them being ignored since the late 1800s. Pilea, with 600-715 species is in need of revision. The only realistic approach is in manageable subunits, which requires confirmation of monophyly and identification of monophyletic subdivisions. Parsimony analyses of trnL-F, ITS, and morphology data were used to test the monophyly of, and explore intrageneric relationships within, Pilea. Analysis of trnL-F data confirms and recovers two morphologically diagnosable monophyletic clades that include all of the taxa within Pilea. Overlaying geographic distribution on a most parsimonious tree indicates a strong association between geography and phylogenetic relatedness. It is suggested that a strategic revision within the framework of morphologically and geographically diagnosable units might enable the revision of the group using an iterative approach. Analysis of the outgroup taxa supports the inclusion of Poikilospermum within the Urticaceae and suggests that the Urticaceae tribes could be placed into two clades that are supported by floral morphology.

AB Public sector health systems that provide services to poor and marginalized populations in developing countries face great challenges. Change associated with health sector reform and structural adjustment often leaves these already-strained institutions with fewer resources and insufficient capacity to relieve health burdens.
   The Strategic Approach to Strengthening Reproductive Health Policies and Programs is a methodological innovation developed by the World Health Organization and its partners to help countries identify and prioritize their reproductive health service needs, test appropriate interventions, and scale up successful innovations to a subnational or national level. The participatory, interdisciplinary, and country-owned process can set in motion much-needed change.
   We describe key features of this approach, provide illustrations from country experiences, and use insights from the diffusion of innovation literature to explain the approach's dissemination and sustainability.

AB Viruses can occasionally emerge by infecting new host species. However, the early phases of emergence can hinge upon ecological sustainability of the virus population, which is a product of both within- host population growth and between- host transmission. Insufficient growth or transmission can force virus extinction before the latter phases of emergence, where genetic adaptations that improve host use may occur. We examined the early phase of emergence by studying the population dynamics of RNA phages in replicated laboratory environments containing native and novel host bacteria. To predict the breadth of transmission rates allowing viral persistence on each species, we developed a simple model based on in vitro data for phage growth rate over a range of initial population densities on both hosts. Validation of these predictions using serial passage experiments revealed a range of transmission rates for which the native host was a source and the novel host was a sink. In this critical range of transmission rates, periodic exposure to the native host was sufficient for the maintenance of the viral population on the novel host. We argue that this effect should facilitate adaptation by the virus to utilize the novel host - often crucial in subsequent phases of emergence.

AB Whiteness enables the coherence of an alliance organized to promote community food security and sustainable farming. This unnamed presence shapes a discourse identifying the focus of struggle as well as resource allocation, conference form and content, list serv discussions, staffing and programming. Unacknowledged white privilege gives the lie to the movement's rhetoric of justice, good intentions and sustainability. And yet it is clear that racism is an organizing process in the food system: people of color disproportionately experience food insecurity, lose their farms and face the dangerous work of food processing and agricultural labor. Critical analyses of social movements argue that a failure to confront difference undermines progressive change efforts. The paper provides evidence of how the community food movement reproduces white privilege and proposes ways it might engage with anti-racism.

AB Animal welfare science has pioneered in interdisciplinary work in many ways. However, this work has mainly taken place among researchers from the natural sciences. This paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using broad interdisciplinary approaches to scientific animal welfare questions, including collaboration between the natural and social sciences. The word "interdisciplinary" has been interpreted in various ways: we discuss the conceptual framework associated with research across disciplinary boundaries on different levels. Among the advantages of such work is that it may enhance the understanding of issues and result in better problem-solving. It can also be used to obtain methodological gains, that is. models and concepts from one discipline can be applied to another. We give examples of both kinds of successful combinations. The challenges of an interdisciplinary approach are also discussed, for example methodological and cultural differences among disciplines, and communication problems among researchers from different fields. We present examples of fruitful interdisciplinary approaches, e.g., studies of the human-animal interaction combining ethology, physiology and psychology. Recommendations are outlined for how collabora-tion can be increased among disciplines and between the natural and social sciences in order to further advance animal welfare science.
   Animal welfare is a multi-faceted issue including important scientific, ethical, economic and political dimensions, and we conclude that dealing with such complex problems requires an integrated approach that utilises conceptual and methodological skills from many disciplines. Natural scientists will continue to be central for achieving improvements in animal welfare, but it also is necessary to include social scientists for better understanding of the role of human behaviour and animals' roles in society, as well as for implementing solutions in order to achieve animal welfare in practice. This kind of work needs better support among academic leaders, scientific publishers, and funding bodies, and training in interdisciplinary thinking needs to be introduced as early as in undergraduate education. An important aspect is that all participants need to learn to communicate and to learn the language of discourse of different disciplines so as to understand the issues and to appreciate the value of their contributions.

ID CORN STOVER
AB The amount of corn stover and wheat straw that can be sustainably collected in North Carolina was estimated to be 0.64 and 0.16 million dry t/yr, respectively. More than 80% of these crop residues are located in the coastal area. The bioethanol potential from corn stover and wheat straw was estimated to be about 238 million L (63 million gal/yr) in North Carolina. The future location of ethanol plant in North Carolina was estimated based on feedstock demand and collection radius. It is possible to have four ethanol plants with feedstock demand of 400, 450, 500, and 640 dry t/d. The collection radii for these four ethanol plants are 46, 60, 42, and 67 km (28, 37, 26, and 42 miles), respectively. The best location for a bioethanol plant includes four counties (Beaufort, Hyde, Tyrrell, and Washington) with feedstock demand of 500 t/d and collection radius about 26 mile.

AB Field-collected tetrasporophytes of Palmaria palmata were tumbled in 300-L outdoor tanks from January to August at ambient daylength or in a constant short-day (SD) regime (8 h light per day), both at 10 or 15 degrees C. Tetrasporangia were massively induced after 2.5 months under SD conditions at 10 degrees C and completely lacking at 15 degrees C, both under SD or ambient daylength conditions, with a few tetrasporangia present at 10 degrees C and ambient daylength. Elongation rates of tagged tetrasporophytic thalli peaked from March to April in all four conditions, when the biomass densities in the outdoor tanks were close to 2.5 kg fresh weight m(-2). Under all four conditions, juvenile proliferations started to appear in June from the margins of the old fronds, and attained approximately 1 cm in length by the end of July.
   Approximately 80% of the tetraspores were released during the first three dark phases in a light/dark regime, and the remaining 20% during the light phases. A minimum of 10 min darkness was observed to trigger spore release. White light inhibited tetraspore release, while a similar number of spores were released in continuous red light or in the light/dark regime, although with no significant differences of spore release during subjective days and nights. Sporelings were successfully derived from the released tetraspores for mass propagation of the male gametophyte in 2000-L outdoor tanks in a greenhouse. Mass production of male gametophytic sporelings of P. palmata was completed two times by SD induction of tetrasporangia at 10 degrees C, release of spores in darkness and culturing the sporelings until they were ready to be propagated vegetatively in greenhouse tanks. One experiment lasted from January to October 2001, with spore release in June, and the second from September to April 2003, with spore release in January. These results may support the development of sustainable, year-round Palmaria farming. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potential of the red agarophyte Gracilariopsis longissima as biofilter for phosphate and ammonium in effluents outflowing intensive marine fish cultures was assessed at different scales. Previous studies showed that both laboratory (microscale level) and outdoor cultivation (mesoscale level) were feasible, with a maximum sustainable yield of 270 g fresh wt m(-2) day(-1) approximately, at a biomass higher than that predicted in a logistic model, a deviation attributable to an improvement of the culture conditions during the monitoring period. At a mesoscale level, a 34-h cycle suggested that the nitrification rate on the seaweed fronds showed diel fluctuations, with rates peaking early in the morning, when ammonium uptake rates were negligible. Mean nitrification rates were similar to ammonium uptake rates, suggesting that nitrifyers outcompete G. longissima for the use of ammonium; especially when mean biofiltering efficiencies were less than 15% during the 34-h period.
   G. longissima thrives naturally in different earthen ponds of a fish farm in Cadiz Bay Natural Park, Southern Spain, especially in the outflowing reservoir earthen ponds, where biomass reached values up to 278 g dry wt m(-2) during the spring. A field cultivation system for G. longissima (macroscale level) was designed to find the best scenario in terms of earthen pond, season or current conditions. The best cultivation method was the growth of vegetative cuttings on suspended braided nylon ropes. The highest growth rates (up to 6% day(-1)) and biomass (up to 10 g fresh wt cm(-1) rope) were obtained in ponds receiving outflow waters, suggesting a nutrient effect. The net P production reached 24.9 mu g P cm(-1) rope day(-1) and was also higher on braided nylon suspended ropes placed at the outflowing reservoir earthen ponds. A similar result was found regarding net N production. However, in this case, mean production (approximate to 170 mu g N cm(-1) rope day(-1)) was similar in the different earthen ponds and channels. The increase in P and N biomass suggested that G. longissima was biofiltering efficiently nutrient wastes from the fish farm.
   The results pointed out the high potential ability of G. longissima to biofilter waste waters from a fish farm, encouraging a large scale cultivation of this species. Future practices using this macroalgae may be implemented in local fish farms, resulting in both environmental and economic advantages. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. The coral reefs across the international border between Kenya and Tanzania, Where historical differences in government policy and socio-economic conditions created two different management systems, were examined: a large permanent closed area and a collaborative fisheries management project that used gear management and small voluntarily and temporary closed areas, respectively. The diversity and ecology of the reefs in these two management systems were compared spanning a seven-year period to evaluate the effectiveness of the management and to assess the ecological response to a large-scale water-temperature anomaly in 1998.
   2. Comparisons of rates of predation on sea urchins and of herbivory, using a seagrass assay, were made along with measures of benthic cover and fish abundance and diversity.
   3. The collaborative fisheries management system was successful in increasing fish stocks, reducing erect algae, and maintaining ecological diversity and stability across the thermal anomaly. This management system, however, was not successful in protecting the expected full biodiversity of fish, predation rates on sea urchins, or the sensitive, branching coral species. Management of the fishery also increased fish stocks in the adjacent, large, permanently closed area, compared to Kenyan parks Without this management.
   4. The large, permanently closed area in the other system maintained high diversity, high predation rates on sea urchins and high herbivory rates, which maintained erect algae abundance and diversity at low levels. The temperature anomaly was destructive to a number of the dominant delicate branching coral species, but overall coral cover and diversity were maintained, although dominance switched from branching Porites spp. to Seriatopora spp. over this period. The large closed area system protected the undisturbed ecology of these reefs and associated ecological processes, and the full diversity of fish and coral, including sensitive species such as branching corals and slow-growing fish.
   5. Collaborative fisheries and large permanent closed area management have different attributes that, when combined, should achieve the Multiple purposes of sustainable fisheries, ecosystem functions and protection of fishing-sensitive species. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB 1. SECORE (SExual COral REproduction) Project is an initiative of public aquariums and research institutions to produce and exchange sexual coral recruits for the sustainable management of ex situ populations. Here we present the results of the initial three years (2002-2004).
   2. Primary polyps (n=501) of corals (Acropora tenuis, Agaricia humilis, Favia fragum) were transported from Rotterdam Zoo to Cologne, Burgers', Hagenbeck and London Zoos, where development of juveniles was monitored for 10 months. All polyps were produced at Rotterdam Zoo from laboratory colonies (A. humilis, F. fragum), and from larvae generated from field collected gametes at Akajima, Okinawa, Japan (A. tenuis). Additionally, planulae of A. tenuis (n = 1440) were transported from Rotterdam Zoo to Burgers' Zoo and to London Zoo to obtain primary polyps.
   3. Larval settlement (A. tenuis) was observed to be 3.00 +/- 2.57% (mean +/- SD; n = 1480) in 2002 and 17.36 +/- 6.01%, (mean +/- SD; n = 1480) in 2003, significantly lower compared to settlement at Rotterdam Zoo (57.84 +/- 11.01% in 2003; mean +/- SD. n = 1480). High post-transport survival rates of 95.18 +/- 4.86% (mean +/- SD; n = 501) were observed in primary polyps of all species.
   4. Juvenile survival (t=10 months; A. tenuis: 18.4-86.2%; A. humilis: 0-19.7%; F. fragum: 13.3-72.7%) differed significantly between institutions. Mean colony sizes (measured 10 months after transportation) were, in all cases, similar or higher to those reported from literature.
   5. The results demonstrate the potential of this method to serve as an economical and sustainable alternative to existing mostly exploitative techniques for aquarium stocking. The use of sexual recruits provides an effective and low cost alternative, which is, in principle, applicable to all coral species.
   6. The project was extended from 9 to 28 institutions across Europe, the USA and Japan in 2004. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

SO ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN

DT Article
AB The architectural tradition of the West is fundamentally characterised by substantial structures and building typologies that link tectonics with function and representation. It has been focusing on the relation between the material constituents that frame space and its direct relation to programme on the one hand, and to social formations on the other. Interior environments are largely homogenised, a preference inherited from Modernist open-plan arrangements and facilitated by vast paraphernalia of electrical and mechanical equipment. Here, Michael Hensel and Achim Menges argue for an ecological understanding of architecture that promotes the differentiation of environmental conditions through a morphological intelligence, which promises not only a new spatial paradigm for architectural design, but also a far more sustainable one that links the performance capacity of material systems with environmental modulation and the resulting provisions and opportunities for inhabitation.

AB The advanced material and morphogenetic digital design techniques and technologies presented in this journal call for a higher level methodological integration, which poses a major challenge for the next generation of multidisciplinary architectural research and projects. This collaborative task encompasses the striving for an integrated set of design methods, generative and analytical tools and enabling technologies that facilitate and instrumentalise evolutionary design, and evaluation of differentiated material systems towards a highly performative and sustainable built environment. Michael Hensel and Achim Menges describe recent progress towards a higher-level design synthesis of material self-organisation, digital morphogenesis, associative parametric modelling and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) on the basis of two works produced within the context of the Emergent Technologies and Design Masters programme at the Architectural Association in London, and a recent competition entry by Scheffler + Partner Architects and Achim Menges.

AB The history and current status of polar bear (Ursus maritimus) conservation hunting in the Canadian Arctic, where trophy hunts by non-local hunters have steadily increased in number over the past three decades, have been influenced by local and international factors. Although polar bear hides taken in the subsistence hunt have commercial value, revenues from nonresident trophy hunting provide a much greater economic return to the Inuit. Research suggests that these greater cash returns and the increased local interest by Native hunters in outfitting and guiding do not threaten community cultural values, which continue to emphasize subsistence and the conservation of local wildlife resources. These outcomes suggest that community-based polar bear trophy hunts provide an example of a successful conservation-hunting program that contributes to wildlife management and sustainable economic and community development in the Canadian Arctic.

DE ethics; water use; water sustainability; Water Framework Directive
AB The modern debate on water use and sustainability starts with the assumption that protecting the water environment is an ethical imperative, but rarely questions the basis for this viewpoint. This paper aims to identify some of the bases that could underlie such a position, seeking to locate value in the natural world beyond anthropocentric utilitarianism. Only when there is a clear basis for this discussion is it possible to discuss and resolve issues and conflicts that arise in the management of water: between present and future users, between human and non-human users, or between competing human users. We then attempt to develop a 'water ethic', parallel to the famous 'land ethic' of Aldo Leopold, in which we see water as the centre of the web of life in the landscape. Protecting water, its quality and its availability, for all present and future users, is one touchstone for the evaluation of environmental action and policy.

AB The existing paradigm of UK flood risk management that privileges structural solutions over non-structural ones is evolving in response to threats posed by climate change and higher environmental standards required by the EC Water Framework Directive. This paper examines the contrasting reactions of DEFRA and the Scottish Executive. The Scottish 'experiment', which embraces a strong definition of sustainability, is contrasted with a weaker version emerging in England and Wales. Divergent levels of risk and histories of managing that risk explain many of these contrasts. Scotland's more radical approach has the potential to become a new paradigm.

AB Adipocyte-specific secretory factor (ADSF)/resistin, a hormone, is a small cysteine-rich protein secreted from adipose tissue and has been implicated in modulating adipogenesis in humans and rodents. The objective of this study was to clone a gene encoding ADSF/resistin and to characterize its function in Korean Native Cattle (Hanwoo), The coding sequence was 330 base pairs and it encoded a protein of 109 amino acids. An NCBI BLAST-search revealed the cloned cDNA fragment shared significant homology (82%) with the cDNA encoding the human ADSF/resistin. The nucleotide sequence homology of the Hanwoo sequence was 73% and 64% for the rat and mouse, respectively. A 654 bp ADSF/resistin gene promoter was cloned and putative binding sites of transcription factors were identified. Tissue distribution of ADSF mRNA was examined in liver, skeletal muscles (tenderloin, biceps femoris), subcutaneous fat, and perirenal fat by RT-PCR. ADSF mRNAs were detected in fat tissues but not in liver and muscles, suggesting that ADSF/resistin expression may be induced during adipogenesis. Although, the physiological function of ADSF/resistin in the cow remains to be determined, these data indicate ADSF is related to the adipocyte phenotype and may have a possibly regulatory role in adipocyte function.

AB In this paper we will present the Everyday Water project as a case study of recent cultural research on domestic water use and its application to natural resource policy and practice. This project is innovative not only because it is a research partnership between a development company and a university but also because of the cultural research approach the project brings to the issue of water resource sustainability and management. The Everyday Water project moves away from thinking of water as a discrete resource or utility, and instead understands its consumption in terms of shifting definitions and uses of services, cultural traditions, and the intersection of everyday practices and expectations with socio-technical systems. The findings so far indicate that while people are prepared to take some DIY measures to save water while they are 'stuck' within current socio-technical systems, many can imagine alternatives, and would be prepared to do more with improved knowledge, better leadership, fewer obstacles, and more incentives to bring about a shift to a different kind of water culture.

AB This paper aims to improve preparation of stakeholders and affected interests for participation in natural resource management (NRM) processes. It argues that a reframing of relationships in multicultural NRM systems can improve individual and institutional capacities to think about and respond to intercultural domains. We argue that the professional toolkit needed to enhance the efficacy and openness of NRM must go beyond technical competence in science and economics to include a refined intercultural capacity amongst all involved. This does not refer to a unidirectional education of those perceived as lacking education, but a multi-directional capacity to reframe relationships, behaviours and practices. By reflecting on our diverse experiences of teaching and learning at the Comalco bauxite mine in far northern Queensland and in the university classroom in Sydney, we argue that a literacy in cultural landscapes is fundamental to this reframing of relationships. To use a metaphor that draws together a concern with both natural resources and geographical scale, it is simply not good enough to deal with both the forests and the trees: we also need to recognise the cultural landscapes in which both are embedded, and the cultural frames that give them different meanings.

AB Background. Contemporary health care systems are constantly challenged to revise traditional methods of health care delivery. These challenges are multifaceted and stem from: (1) novel pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments; (2) changes in consumer demands and expectations; (3) fiscal and resource constraints; (4) changes in societal demographics in particular the ageing of society; (5) an increasing burden of chronic disease; (6) documentation of limitations in traditional health care delivery; (7) increased emphasis on transparency, accountability, evidence-based practice (EBP) and clinical governance structures; and (8) the increasing cultural diversity of the community. These challenges provoke discussion of potential alternative models of care, with scant reference to defining what constitutes a model of care.
   Aim: This paper aims to define what is meant by the term 'model of care' and document the pragmatic systems and processes necessary to develop, plan, implement and evaluate novel models of care delivery.
   Methods: Searches of electronic databases, the reference lists of published materials, policy documents and the Internet were conducted using key words including 'model*', 'framework*', 'models, theoretical' and 'nursing models, theoretical'. The collated material was then analysed and synthesised into this review.
   Results: This review determined that in addition to key conceptual and theoretical perspectives, quality improvement theory (eg. collaborative methodology), project management methods and change management theory inform both pragmatic and conceptual elements of a model of care. Crucial elements in changing health care delivery through the development of innovative models of care include the planning, development, implementation, evaluation and assessment of the sustainability of the new model.
   Conclusion: Regardless of whether change in health care delivery is attempted on a micro basis (eg. ward level) or macro basis (eg. national or state system) in order to achieve sustainable, effective and efficient changes a well-planned, systematic process is essential.

AB The process of translating strategic sustainability objectives into concrete action at project-specific levels is a difficult task. The multidimensional perspectives of sustainability such as economy, society, environment, combined with a lack of structured methodology and information at various hierarchical levels, further exacerbate the problem. This paper (Part I of a two-part series) proposes an analytical decision model and a structured methodology for sustainability appraisal in infrastructure projects. The paper uses the 'weighted sum model' technique in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and the 'additive utility model' in analytical hierarchical process (AHP) for multicriteria decision making, to develop the model from first principles. It discusses the development of key performance indicators encapsulated within the analytical model. It concludes by discussing other potential applications of the proposed model and methodology for process automation as part of integrated sustainability appraisal in infrastructure design and construction. Pail 2 uses a case study to demonstrate the model application in infrastructure sustainability appraisal at design stages. The paper also discusses the challenges for sustainability research, and gives recommendations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Robotic Construction Crew (RCC) is a heterogeneous multi-robot system for autonomous acquisition, transport, and precision mating of components in construction tasks. RCC minimizes use of resources constrained by a space environment such as computation, power, communication, and sensing. A behavior-based architecture provides adaptability and robustness despite low computational requirements. RCC successfully performs several construction related tasks in an emulated outdoor environment despite high levels of uncertainty in motions and sensing. This paper provides quantitative results for formation keeping in component transport, precision instrument placement, and construction tasks.

DE robot colonies; self-reliance; self-sustainability; graceful degradation
AB Self-reliant mobile robots have the potential to perform useful and productive work in remote and hostile environments. A colonial architecture, comprising a population of both static operations robots and modular mobile robots, enables self-reliance. Sustainability extends operational life and enables continued operation beyond disabling events. Polymorphism enables performance of multiple roles at optimal efficiency. In this paper, we present algorithms enabling fault detection, identification and rectification whilst achieving and maintaining mobile robot build orders within an error prone environment. Modules that exhibited faulty behaviour are identified and replaced. When a robot is not required then it is disassembled for storage or polymorphed into a new role. Near optimal physical graceful degradation is demonstrated on a robot module scale. The application described in this research is the automated deployment of a large scale off-world human habitat for 10 to 50 personnel from site clearing to radiation shielding.

LA English
DT Article
ID VIRTUAL-REALITY EXPOSURE; FOLLOW-UP; PHOBIA
AB This study examines the long-term efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for fear of flying (FOF) after a catastrophic fear-relevant event, the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Participants (N = 115) were randomly assigned to and completed treatment for FOF using 8 sessions of either virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE) or standard exposure therapy (SE) prior to September 11, 2001. Individuals were reassessed in June, 2002, an average of 2.3 years after treatment, with a response rate of 48% (n = 55). Analyses were run on the original data and, using multiple imputation procedures, on imputed data for the full sample. Individuals maintained or improved upon gains made in treatment as measured by standardized FOF questionnaires and by number of flights taken. There were no differences between VRE and SE. Thus, results suggest that individuals previously treated for FOF with cognitive-behavioral therapy can maintain treatment gains in the face of a catastrophic fear-relevant event, even years after treatment is completed.

TI Optical/packet transport convergence
SO BELL LABS TECHNICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Today's optical networks are designed to carry fixed-rate telephony and private line traffic in a reliable and resilient manner Over the last decade, service providers have experienced tremendous growth in data services with the aggregate demand for data traffic now exceeding circuit-oriented traffic. As a result, service providers are challenged to bring their cost structure down so they can generate sustainable margins on competitive services. Lowering the cost structure of data services involves a reduction in capital expenditures, but even more importantly, it necessitates a reduction in operational expenses as well. Global optical/packet transport systems, such as Lucent Technologies' Universal Packet Mux (UPM), are among the network elements addressing this need. They integrate classical synchronous optical network/synchronous digital hierarchy (SONET/SDH) capabilities with multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) transport features on one platform. These new devices can support either connection-oriented or connectionless transport services. This paper describes the applications and value of a new type of universal packet transport system (UPT) for optical/packet networks. (c) 2006 Lucent Technologies Inc.

AB Although natural disturbance has been widely adopted as a template for forest management that protects biodiversity, this hypothesis has not been adequately tested. We compared litter-dwelling arthropod assemblages (Coleoptera: Carabidae and Staphylinidae; Araneae) in aspen-dominated stands originating as clear-cuts or wildfires across three age classes (1-2, 14-15, and 28-29 years old) to test whether the post-harvest and post-fire assemblages converged following disturbances, and to compare faunal succession. These findings were compared to data about epigaeic arthropods in old and mature pyrogenic aspen stands (> 70 years old) to determine whether diversity and community composition of arthropods from the younger age-classes approached what may have been typical predisturbance conditions. The resulting data-set of almost 27,000 arthropods and 230 species showed convergence in most taxa, and some general similarities between 28- and 29-year-old stands and old and mature stands. However, not all taxa responded similarly, and faunal succession following clear-cutting appeared to progress more rapidly than following wildfire. Rarefaction-estimated diversity was elevated in 1-2-year-old stands, compared to unharvested stands, reflecting a mix of closed-canopy and open-habitat species. Nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling ordinations showed that samples from young wildfire disturbed stands (1-2 years old) included more variable assemblages than all other study sites, and contained species that may depend on unique post-fire habitat characteristics. The fauna of old and mature stands exhibited low diversity, but contained species with limited dispersal abilities, and species tied to old-growth habitats such as dead wood. Harvesting systems that do not allow adequate recovery following a first harvesting pass, or do not maintain microhabitat features associated with older fire-origin forests, may threaten persistence of some elements of boreal arthropod faunas.

AB Inoculants are of great importance in sustainable and/or organic agriculture. In the present study, plant growth of barley (Hordeum vulgare) has been studied in sterile soil inoculated with four plant growth-promoting bacteria and mineral fertilizers at three different soil bulk densities and in three harvests of plants. Three bacterial species were isolated from the rhizosphere of barley and wheat. These bacteria fixed N-2, dissolved P and significantly increased growth of barley seedlings. Available phosphate in soil was significantly increased by seed inoculation of Bacillus M-13 and Bacillus RC01. Total culturable bacteria, fungi and P-solubilizing bacteria count increased with time. Data suggest that seed inoculation of barley with Bacillus RC01, Bacillus RC02, Bacillus RC03 and Bacillus M-13 increased root weight by 16.7, 12.5, 8.9 and 12.5% as compared to the control (without bacteria inoculation and mineral fertilizers) and shoot weight by 34.7, 34.7, 28.6 and 32.7%, respectively. Bacterial inoculation gave increases of 20.3-25.7% over the control as compared with 18.9 and 35.1% total biomass weight increases by P and NP application. The concentration of N and P in soil was decreased by increasing soil compaction. In contrast to macronutrients, the concentration of Fe, Cu and Mn was lower in plants grown in the loosest soil. Soil compaction induced a limitation in root and shoot growth that was reflected by a decrease in the microbial population and activity. Our results show that bacterial population was stimulated by the decrease in soil bulk density. The results suggest that the N-2-fixing and P-solubilizing bacterial strains tested have a potential on plant growth activity of barley.

AB Post-logging seedling regeneration density by big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), a nonpioneer light-demanding timber species, is generally reported to be low to nonexistent. To investigate factors limiting seedling density following logging within the study region, we quantified seed production rates, germinability, dispersal patterns, and seed fates on the forest floor through germination and the first seedling growing season in southeastern Amazonia, Brazil. Fruit production rates were low by three logged and one unlogged populations compared to reports from other regions. Commercial-sized trees (> 60 cm diameter) were more fecund than noncommercial trees (30-60 cm diameter) at two sites, averaging 14.5 vs. 3.9 fruits/tree/year, respectively, at Marajoara, a logged site, over 8 yr. Fruit capsules contained an average of 60.3 seeds/fruit, 70 percent of which appeared viable by visual inspection. Sixty-seven to 72 percent of apparently viable seeds germinated in nursery beds 2.5 mo after the dispersal period, when wet season rains began. Dry season winds blew most seeds west-northwest of parent trees, with median dispersal distances of 28 and 9 m on west and east sides of parent trees, respectively. Nearly 100 percent of seeds fell within an area of 0.91 ha. On the forest floor beneath closed canopies, mammals, invertebrates, and fungal pathogens killed 40 percent of apparently viable seeds, while 36 percent germinated. Nine months after seedling establishment-midway through the first logging season following seed dispersal-14 percent of outplanted seeds survived as seedlings, representing 5.8 seeds/fruit. We conclude that seedlings are likely to survive in logging gaps at appreciable densities only in rare cases where previous year fruit production rates by logged trees were high (4-12.5% of commercial-sized trees/year at Marajoara) and where tree crowns were felled in west or northwest directions.

AB Sustainable development includes socio-economic and environmental targets and concerns all sectors of human activity. The main reasons for green building are to reduce energy consumption, green house gases emission, water use, waste production etc. The choice of materials used for the construction of a building has a direct impact on the environment. A material with a low life-cycle cost (LCC) and high technical performance reduces the impact of the building on the environment. Cob is a traditional material with a low LCC; its thermal performances are studied here and compared with the thermal performances of stone walls and of insulated concrete block walls. A first type of simulation concerns a wall model with an interior temperature set at 19 degrees C and a second type of simulation concerns a whole building, the wall model is then coupled with a zone model. Three types of buildings are simulated: a conventional building and two efficient buildings. One of the efficient buildings is a block of flats that is part of the European programme CEPHEUS: Salvatierra. The simulations show that, for south-facing walls, the thermal behaviour of a 50-cm-thick cob wall is about the same as that of insulated concrete blocks wall with 7.5 cm of insulation. With a 5-cm-thick insulation added, the thermal behaviour of a south-facing cob wall is then about the same as that of an insulated dense concrete block wall with 15 cm of insulation. Cob is, thus, a traditional material that can be used in modern constructions. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID HEALTH; DEATH
AB The increased attention to tracking progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), including Goal 4 of reducing child mortality, has drawn attention to a number of interrelated technical, operational and political challenges and to the underlying weaknesses of country health information systems upon which reliable monitoring depends. Assessments of child mortality published in 2005, for almost all low-income countries, are based on an extrapolation of the trends observed during the 1990s, rather than on the empirical data for more recent years. The validity of the extrapolation depends on the quality and quantity of the data used, and many countries lack suitable data. In the long run, it is hoped that vital registration or sample registration systems will be established to monitor vital events in a sustainable way. However, in the short run, tracking child mortality in high-mortality countries will continue to rely on household surveys and extrapolations of historical trends. This will require more collaborative efforts both to collect data through initiatives to strengthen health information systems at the country level, and to harmonize the estimation process. The latter objective requires the continued activity of a coordinating group of international agencies and academics that aims to produce transparent estimates - through the consistent application of an agreed-upon methodology - for monitoring at the international level.

TI Status of periurban agriculture in Setif (Algeria): Land reserve or
   urban project?
SO CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
LA French
DT Article
DE suburban agriculture; land rights; land development (urbanization);
   sustainable development
AB Setif, a mid-sized city located on the Algerian highlands, was founded in 1847; its agriculture was soon wholly devoted to large-scale grain farming without any green belt to feed its inhabitants. Setif is growing rather quickly today and takes mainly periurban farmland for new construction. Moreover, new towns are planned to surround Setif, at 2 to 5 kms from the city limits, which ultimately threatens the ring of farmland between them and the central city. This paper analyzes the possible role of periurban agriculture in the urban policy of Setif: is the loss of farmland a problem from the city's point of view? Annual urban expansion has been about 50 ha since 1966. Government policy has sometimes been oriented towards urban planning, sometimes more market-oriented and liberal. Agriculture is still directed mainly towards the Algerian market, not only for cereals, but also for new products, Such as ornamentals; trends for the urban area are very similar to those for the entire wilaya (administrative region). Moreover, one effect of globalisation is the reduced necessity for farmland. There is thus not really any local interest in preventing construction of farmland. Until now, neither farmers, as owners as well as new city dwellers, nor urban planners have been sensitive to the urban values of agriculture (landscape, green belt, etc.). Nevertheless, some signs of other points of view are now discernible: some people seek local production for its specific qualities (especially freshness), and some families want gardens for their own consumption. At the same time, a new concept of rural amenities is emerging, as seen in oued Boussellam valley or Zenadia forest, now designed as green belt. On a larger scale, the Algerian government is again anxious to improve food security, which today depends mainly on importation. We concluded that although farmland today is considered only a land reserve for construction, local planning policies may soon take other, newer concepts into account.

AB PROBLEM ADDRESSED Family medicine is a vital part of health care in Canada. The decline in numbers of new family physicians being trained bodes ill for a sustainable and efficacious health care system. We need to recruit young people more effectively into careers in primary care. Early outreach to high-school students is one approach that holds promise.
   OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM To provide high-school students with exposure to and appreciation for careers in medicine, particularly family medicine.
   PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Family medicine residents in the University of Alberta's Rural Alberta North Program initiated an outreach project that was implemented in rural and regional high schools in northern Alberta. The program consisted of visits to high schools by residents who gave interactive presentations introducing medicine as a career. The regional hospital subsequently hosted a career day involving medical and paramedical professionals, such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and physical and occupational therapists.
   CONCLUSION Physicians' visits to high-school students could be an effective way to increase interest in careers in rural family medicine.

TI The UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Program in Australia: constraints and
   opportunities for localized sustainable development
SO CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN
LA English
DT Article
AB Since their creation under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program in 7976, biosphere reserves have provided an international framework for linking protected areas with their associated working landscapes. In Australia, twelve biosphere reserves were added to the World Network between 1977 and 1982. That initial flurry of activity has been followed by twenty-five years of limited interest and development in biosphere reserves in this country, although evidence suggests that new energies are being directed to it. After sketching the origins of the biosphere reserve concept and its central tenets, we explore those environmental, cultural and institutional factors that may be promoting renewed interest in the program. We then review the initial implementation and current status of the Australian Biosphere Reserve Program. Factors supporting the limited success that exists in the program in Australia are highlighted, and the new form of biosphere reserve is illustrated with reference to Australia's recent and only urban biosphere reserve, at the Mornington Peninsula, in the state of Victoria. We speculate that prospects for biosphere reserves in Australia are brighter because of the provision for biosphere reserves under the Commonwealth of Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (DEH 1999), the conceptual relevance of the biosphere reserve to bioregional and catchment management more generally and the continued success of existing model biosphere reserves.

TI Integrating marine protected areas with catch regulation
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID RESERVES; FISHERIES; MANAGEMENT
AB Previous models of marine protected areas (MPAs) have generally assumed that there were no existing regulations on catch and have frequently shown that MPAs, by themselves, can be used to maintain both sustainable fish stocks and sustainable harvests. We explore the impact of implementing an MPA in a spatially structured model of a single-species fish stock that is regulated by total allowable catch (TAC). We find that when a stock is managed at maximum sustainable yield, or is overfished, implementation of an MPA will require a reduction in TAC to avoid increased fishing pressure on the stock outside the MPA. In both cases, catches will be lower as a result of overlaying an MPA on existing fisheries management. Only when the stock is so overfished that it is headed towards extinction does an MPA not lead to lower catches. In a TAC-regulated fishery, even if the stock is overfished, MPA implementation may not improve overall stock abundance or increase harvest unless catch is simultaneously reduced in the areas outside the MPA. Models that consider differential adult and larval dispersal need to be explored to see if these results are found with the more complex biology of a two-stage model.

TI Policies and practices to sustain soil productivity: perspectives from

DT Article
ID SITE PRODUCTIVITY; QUALITY; INDICATORS; PRINCIPLES; MANAGEMENT;
   STANDARDS
AB The USDA Forest Service, the Canadian Forest Service, and US and Canadian forest products industries are committed to the principles of sustainable forestry with a major focus on protecting soil productivity. The USDA Forest Service has developed and adopted soil quality standards to evaluate the effects of forest use and management activities on forest soils and, if necessary, prescribe remedial or preventive actions to avoid adverse impacts on soil productivity. Similarly, the Canadian Forest Service has adopted a series of criteria and indicators with which to monitor the impacts of management on soil resources. The policies of both public agencies reflect the recommendations of the Montreal Process Working Group (1999). Many forest industries have adopted the Sustainable Forestry Initiative developed by the American Forest and Paper Association (2000). Standards of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative clearly state the vision and direction for achieving sustainable forest management, goals, and objectives to be attained and performance measures for judging whether a goal or objective has been achieved. However, both public and private entities recognize that current standards, criteria, and indicators represent first approximations. Continuing revision and adjustment based on information from long-term research studies are vital to protecting soil productivity while deriving optimum public benefits from our forest-based resources.

AB Paper industry is facing today the challenges of being simultaneously flexible towards customers, efficient in the use of capital intensive assets, and ecologically sustainable both when using resources and utilities and with respect to waste handling. However, the production lines are not flexible enough to meet today's requirements because of some complex dynamics and rigid operational practices. The benefit of applying modelling and simulation techniques in pulp and papermaking manufacturing processes will favour a better understanding of the mechanism involved in the processes and their control loops. This will allow papermakers to find solutions for currently pending problems in the paper industry, such as fast grade changes, improvement of paper quality, optimising the wet end chemistry, enhancing runnability and reducing emissions by improving process design, process monitoring and decision support during operation. Due to the importance of the topic at European level, a COST Action has been initiated for promoting the development and application of modelling and simulation techniques in pulp and paper manufacturing processes. In this paper, a review of the state-of-the-art on modelling and simulation in the pulp and paper industry is presented, alongwith further research needs.

TI Environmental and economic comparison of waste solvent treatment options
SO CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY

DE waste solvent treatment; life cycle assessment
ID DESIGN
AB The sustainable development and consumption need more efficient use of natural resources. As a consequence, the use of industrial solvents demands their recovery instead of end-of-pipe treatment. It is not always clear, however, which treatment alternative should be applied. Based on an industrial case study, the environmental and economic evaluation and comparison of the treatment alternatives of a non-ideal solvent mixture containing azeotropes is investigated for determining the preferable option. For the recovery of the industrial solvent mixture, two different separation alternatives are evaluated: a less effective alternative and a novel design based on hybrid separation tools. An end-of-pipe treatment alternative, incineration, is also considered and the split of the solvent mixtures between recovery and incineration is investigated. The environmental evaluation of the alternatives is carried out using 'Eco-indicator 99 life-cycle impact assessment methodology'. Economic investigation is also accomplished. The economic features clearly favour the total recovery, however, the environmental evaluation detects that if a recovery process of low efficiency is applied, its environmental burden can be similar or even higher than that of the incineration. This motivates engineers to design more effective recovery processes and reconsider the evaluation of process alternatives at environmental decision making.

TI The struggle continues: Challenges for a Post-Navy Vieques
SO CENTRO JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB In recent years the decades-long struggle to stop the U.S. Navy from bombing Vieques, Puerto Rico, end military occupation of most of the island, has made international headlines. However, concerns about Vieques's future once the bombings ceased and the bases closed have aroused less publicity. In the early 1990s some Vieques activists committed themselves to working on the island's greatest challenges, by advocating the "Four Us: Demilitarization, Decontamination, Devolution (return of lands), and (community-based, sustainable) Development." This article examines the new phase of the struggle for an economically, socially and ecologically healthy Vieques, and its implications for similar struggles elsewhere.

SO CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development; growth problems; pro-growth polices;
   redistribution with growth
AB China's economy in 2005 chalked up another year of 9.9 percent surging growth. In 2005 the government's attention was focused on the many negative consequences of China's past unbridled economic growth, from rural poverty to environmental degradation and wide income disparities, calling for more "sustainable growth" or "balanced development". The new development paradigm fit nicely into President Hu Jintao's concept of "scientific development", and was embraced by the 11th Five-Year Program (2006 - 2010).
   The year 2006 might go down in China's economic history as an important turning point, as the Hu-Wen leadership will start new development strategies to fix problems previously associated with strong economic growth. Strictly speaking, many of China's "growth problems", from regional disparities to environmental degradation, are actually quite inevitable - as a part of the development process. But their gravity has often been aggravated by poor governance, blatantly pro-growth policies, and local corruption.
   Overall, the Chinese leadership has come to realize that its past development patterns are physically unsustainable, and politically and socially unacceptable. It has embraced the need to change. But all development changes will take a long time to yield concrete results.

AB With the acceleration of the urbanization and industrialization of China, it is inevitable that cultivated land converts to built-up land for industrial, commercial and residential uses, which would impose pressure both on food security and on the sustainability of urbanization itself for such a country with large population and few cultivated land. Based on the three-time Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) digital images and statistic data of Hebei Province, the general facts of cultivated land conversion and its driving forces were analyzed by establishing econometric model in this paper. Some conclusions were drawn as the following: during 1985-2000, the rate of cultivated land converting to built-up area in Hebei was 4.01% or 0.27% per year. Of all the converted cultivated land, 20.96% was converted to built-up area and of all the new built-up areas, 83.4% was converted from cultivated land; meanwhile the conversion is uneven not only in time but also in space; factors such as edge length shared by cultivated land and built-up land, agricultural value per hectare, non-agriculture value per hectare, GDP, total population, farmer's net income per capita and time had significant effects on this conversion.

DE sustainable livelihood; ecological shelter construction; Zhaotong
AB Sustainable livelihood theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the interactions between livelihoods of peasant households and regional environment change in low-income areas. Based on field survey and 946 questionnaires from peasant household conducted in the case study area of Zhaotong, Yunnan Province, the paper has analyzed the basic characteristics of the rural livelihoods, including the asset base status, the income-generating activities, the energy consumption pattern, and the fertility behavior, in the upper reaches of the Chanjiang ( Yangtze) River. The micro-level findings show the conflicts among extensive agricultural development models, rural energy consumption structures heavily relying on biomass and the environment protection. The conversion of cropland to forest and grass program (CCFGP) has exerted an important influence on the livelihoods of the peasant households, but its design has given little considerations to their long-term livelihood sources, which will affect its sustainability to a great extent. From the perspective of sustainable livelihoods framework, the objectives that must be addressed in the ecological shelter construction in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River should include, first, facilitating access of peasant households to credit, technology and public services, second, encouraging the peasant households to adopt agricultural technology with environmental benefits and strengthen resources-conserving investments, and third, paying close attention to the rural energy problems and the long-term livelihood sources of the households with CCFGP. Given the weak asset base and difficulties of livelihood strategies shift, ecological shelter construction in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River will take a long time.

ID DESIGN
AB Urban utilities are overcrowding underground space. Therefore, future sustainable underground strategies will consist of the ability to reduce the use of traditional trenching. During the last century, there was an increasing interest in utility tunnels for urban areas as a problem-solving technique to avoid congestion of the street subsurface. Utility tunnels or utilidors are joint-use underground facilities that may contain multiple utilities such as water, sewerage, gas, electrical power, telephone, and central heating in various combinations or in some cases all together. The key advantage of utilidors is the substantially lower environmental impact when compared with trenching alternatives. Their construction presents no new problems of an engineering nature. However, implementing these subsurface tunnels is retarded most by first-cost, compatibility, and liability problems. These underground facilities are highly complex and difficult to manage because of synergistic effects. Utility tunnels, as a major capital investment in urban development, should be considered in the broad context of the urban planning strategy. This research work has focused on utility tunnel feasibility and its practical application in urban areas.

ID FORESTRY PROJECTS
AB Collateral impacts of land use and land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) projects, especially those concerning social and environmental aspects, have been recognized as important by the Marrakech Accords. The same applies to the necessity of assessing and, if possible, of quantifying the magnitude of these impacts. This article aims to define, clarify and structure the relevant social, economic and environmental issues to be addressed and to give examples of indicators that ought to be included in the planning, design, implementation, monitoring, and ex post evaluation of LULUCF projects. This is being done by providing a conceptual framework for the assessment of the sustainability of such projects that can be used as a checklist when dealing with concrete projects, and that in principle is applicable to both Annex I and non-Annex I countries. Finally, a set of recommendations is provided to further develop and promote the proposed framework.

TI Palliative care in Europe: an emerging approach to comparative analysis
SO CLINICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE development; Europe; history; hospice care; palliative care
AB At the national level, hospice and palliative care activities have been developing in Europe since the late 1960s. International organisations to support palliative care have been in existence since the late 1980s. It was only in the late 1990s, however, that the first comparative studies of European palliative care development were conducted. This article reviews this history and highlights the main studies and initiatives that have focused on the growth of palliative care in Europe. Evidence to date shows huge variations in the levels of palliative care provision that exist in different countries, as well as some differences in the preferred models of care. The extent to which palliative care provision is integrated with wider health and social care policies appears to be a crucial determinant of success. A sustainable evidence base on palliative care provision in Europe is needed, and there are encouraging signs that this is beginning to develop through close cooperation between key organisations and initiatives in the field.

AB A multi-day hydrographic Survey cruise was conducted to acquire spatially extensive, but temporally limited, high-resolution, three-dimensional measurement Of Currents, temperature, salinity and turbidity off West Maui in the summer of 2003 to better understand coastal dynamics along a complex island shoreline with coral reefs. These data complement long-term, high-resolution tide, wave, Current, temperature, salinity and turbidity measurements made at a number of fixed locations in the study area starting in 2001. Analyses of these hydrographic data, in conjunction with numerous field observations, evoke the following conceptual model of water and turbidity flux along West Maui. Wave- and wind-driven flows appear to be the primary control oil flow over shallower portions of the reefs while tidal and subtidal currents dominate flow over the outer portions of the reefs and insular shelf. When the direction of these flows counter one another, Which is quite common, they cause a Zone of cross-shore horizontal shear and often form a front, with turbid, lower-salinity water inshore of the front and clear, higher-salinity water offshore of the front. It is not clear whether these zones of high shear and fronts are file cause or the result of the location of the fore reef, but they appear to be correlated alongshore over relatively large horizontal distances (orders of kilometers). When two flows converge or when a single flow is bathymetrically steered, eddies can be generated that, in the absence of large ocean Surface waves. tend to accumulate material. Areas of higher turbidity and lower salinity tend to correlate with regions of poor coral health or the absence of well-developed reefs, Suggesting that the oceanographic processes that concentrate and/or transport nutrients, contaminants, low-salinity water or suspended sediment might strongly influence coral reef ecosystem health and sustainability.

AB Objective: To describe the sustainable growth rate history and calculations and why the present approach is not sustainable.
   Background. The sustainable growth rate was created to help control the growth rate in healthcare expenditures. Presently, it is responsible, at least in part, for reductions in physician payment. Two components of the sustainable growth rate make it unsustainable in its present form. These components are 1) the inability to go back and correct for values based on the wrong assumptions and 2) the inclusion of drug-related costs into the sustainable growth rate.
   Discussion: Few physicians have a full grasp of how their payment is structured from a mechanistic standpoint. A significant component of determining physician payment is established by the relative value unit, and how these are derived has been discussed in another article in this supplement. Once the relative value unit has been established, it is multiplied by the established conversion factor. A major component of the conversion factor is the sustainable growth rate. This article attempts to explain how the sustainable growth rate came into being, how it is calculated, and how it is flawed and contributing to decreasing physician payments. A few possible remedies are discussed, and the potential ramifications of those remedies on the physician community and the premiums of Medicare patients are examined.

AB A time data series of catch data reported at the Gulf of Nicoya for the semi-industrial white shrimp trawling fleet between 1990 and 2003, and population parameters obtained for that species, were both used in an analysis implemented in a semi-automated, age-structured simulation model (FISMO). Based on the strong seasonality of shrimp stocks, we explored the possibility to find evidence of overfishing as a result of fishing effort after the main reproductive peaks. It was found that the current fishing intensity (F) is only 26% with respect to that required for the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but it is almost three times more profitable. These results lead us to conclude that further increases in fishing effort should not be encouraged: in this way the spawning stock may be maintained at relatively high levels for successive years and the fishery would have more chances to be sustainable in the long term.

AB The effect of the agroecosystems natural grassland, protein bank and sugarcane on the dynamics of the populations of L. terrestris was studied in a completely randomized design with three treatments (agroecosystems): natural grassland, protein bank and sugarcane in a factorial arrangement 3 x 3 x 2. The experiment was conducted in 1999, 2000 and 200 1, at the beginning and end of the rainy season. The results showed significant (P < 0.001) interactions of the agroecosystems with the years. There was stability in the population density (earthworms m(2-1)), with average at the third year of the study 128.75 and 86.25 in the natural grassland and the sugarcane, respectively. In the protein bank, there were differences between the first and the last year, with 98.75 individuals m(2-1) at the end of 2001. In regards to the interactions of the agroecosystems with the season (P < 0.05), no differences were observed between the natural grassland and the protein bank. The latter did not differ from sugarcane, compared to the samplings at the end of the rainy season. At the beginning of this season, there were no differences between the agroecosystems. Likewise, there were no differences between the seasons for each agroecosytem. The interactions of the years with the seasons (P < 0.001) showed differences between the first and the last year within each season, with an average of 99.16 and 137.00 individuals at the end of the rainy season and its beginnings, respectively. It is concluded that the agroccosystems natural grassland and sugarcane kept the earthworm density and they were increased in the protein bank, in agreement with the agroecological principles. The survival and density of these individuals in the different seasons allow confirming their great ecological flexibility, as well as the appropriate management of the agroecosystems studied.

AB Conventional feminist political analysis has considered male interests as historically institutionalized by the state, thereby claiming that women are largely 'edged out' in state programmes. By studying a state programme of granting ancestral domain tenurial rights to the Kalanguya in the northern Philippines, this article argues instead that women also edge themselves out. Kalanguya village women have linked with markets and are less interested in tenurial struggles with the state since such struggles underscore their indigeneity and their special role as resource managers, an identity they wish to discard. Men, for their part, attach themselves to the past and identify themselves as being 'indigenous' to make claims on land in the present, strategically aligning themselves with the state agenda on sustainable resource management. This article explores perspectives that provide more nuanced understandings of the different ways in which women and men may position and identify themselves as 'indigenous' as they engage with state programmes and markets, and argues that, under certain conditions, women through their agency may not be the natural constituency for natural resource management-related programmes that they are often assumed to be.

ID LOCAL COMMONS; DEFORESTATION
AB Many of the world's most valuable biodiverse areas are successfully managed by indigenous communities, often under peculiar property rights structures. In many cases, these communities are economically disadvantaged, even by local standards. But can particular local property rights regimes which are ecologically successful also allow communities to compete productively in market economies ? The extractive reserves of the Brazilian Amazon offer an opportunity for investigating the connections between property rights, conservation and development in the context of tropical forests. This article aims to analyse whether the existing property rights in these reserves - an idiosyncratic mixture of public, collective and private property rights - can support the explicit development aim of a competitive, yet sustainable, exploitation of the area's natural resources. The analysis identifies three promising development paths open to extractive reserves, but points to a fundamental contradiction between the static structure of the property rights system and the dynamic nature of two of these paths. The current design of internal property rights fails to take into account the broader economic context in which reserves must generate a viable revenue stream. If extractive reserves are expected to develop without reliance on external aid, then changes to the property rights structure both inside and outside the extractive reserves have to be explicitly considered.

AB Reducing losses to weather-related disasters, meeting the Millennium Development Goals and wider human development objectives, and implementing a successful response to climate change are aims that can only be accomplished if they are undertaken in an integrated manner. Currently, policy responses to address each of these independently may be redundant or, at worst, conflicting. We believe that this conflict can be attributed primarily to a lack of interaction and institutional overlap among the three communities of practice. Differences in language, method and political relevance may also contribute to the intellectual divide. Thus, this paper seeks to review the theoretical and policy linkages among disaster risk reduction, climate change and development. It finds that not only does action within one realm affect capacity for action in the others, but also that there is much that can be learnt and shared between realms in order to ensure a move towards a path of integrated and more sustainable development.

AB This paper examines the topic of financing adaptation in future climate change policies. A major question is whether adaptation in developing countries should be financed under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or whether funding should come from other sources. We present an overview of financial resources and propose the employment of a two-track approach: one track that attempts to secure climate change adaptation funding under the UNFCCC; and a second track that improves mainstreaming of climate risk management in development efforts. Developed countries would need to demonstrate much greater commitment to the funding of adaptation measures if the UNFCCC were to cover a substantial part of the costs. The mainstreaming of climate change adaptation could follow a risk management path, particularly in relation to disaster risk reduction. 'Climate-proofing' of development projects that currently do not consider climate and weather risks could improve their sustainability.

AB Climate change, although a natural phenomenon, is accelerated by human activities. Disaster policy response to climate change is dependent on a number of factors, such as readiness to accept the reality of climate change, institutions and capacity, as well as willingness to embed climate change risk assessment and management in development strategies. These conditions do not yet exist universally. A focus that neglects to enhance capacity-building and resilience as a prerequisite for managing climate change risks will, in all likelihood, do little to reduce vulnerability to those risks. Reducing vulnerability is a key aspect of reducing climate change risk. To do so requires a new approach to climate change risk and a change in institutional structures and relationships. A focus on development that neglects to enhance governance and resilience as a prerequisite for managing climate change risks will, in all likelihood, do little to reduce vulnerability to those risks.

AB Kollicoat SR 30D is a unique 30% aqueous dispersion of polyvinvyl acetate stabilized by polyvinyl-pyrrolidone intended for preparation of sustained release products. Detailed evaluation of this polymer dispersion as a sustained release coating for active pharmaceutical ingredients of two diverse classes of drugs was studied. A water insoluble drug (ibuprofen) and a water soluble drug (ascorbic acid) were selected as model active drugs. Ibuprofen was granulated using a GPCG-1 fluid bed processor prior to tableting, to improve the particle size and particle flow properties. In this process a 2(3) factorial design was implemented to evaluate the optimum process parameters such as spray rate, inlet air temperature and the inlet air velocity. The statistical model selected was Y-ijkl = mu + tau(i) + beta(j) + theta(k) +(tau beta)(ij) +(beta theta)(jk) +(tau theta)(ik) +(tau beta theta)(ijk)+ epsilon(ijkl). The factorial design showed that the spray rate, inlet air temperature, and inlet air velocity had a significant effect ( p value < 0.05) on the particle size. Significant improvement was observed in the flow properties of the granules. The granules were coated with Kollicoat SR30D dispersion using top spray method in the fluid bed processor. The dissolution studies showed that the release of ibuprofen decreased with an increase in the coating levels of Kollicoat SR 30 D. In the case of ascorbic acid, preparation of sustained release coated commercial granules was not possible due to the difficulty in coating a highly soluble drug particle. However, the coated granules when compressed into tablets showed some sustainability. Ibuprofen tablets manufactured with coated granules with a 15 g polymer for 300 g batch showed dissolution parameters of t(50) and t(90) at 4.2 hr and 7.5 hr, respectively. An approximate zero-type of release was observed when the polymer content was increased to 45 g for 300 g batch. Ascorbic acid tablets made with coated commercial granules having a total polymer content of 45g per a 500 g batch showed an average dissolution t(50) and t(90) at 1.0 hr and 4.55 hr, respectively. When the total polymer content was increased to 60 g, per 500 g, the average dissolution t(50) and t(90) delayed to 1.40 hr and 7.20 hr, respectively.

TI Economic policy mix in Slovenia and the road to the European Monetary
   Union
SO EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID ACCESSION COUNTRIES; DEMAND; SHOCKS; MODEL
AB As one of the few new EU member countries to enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism H in June 2004, Slovenia decided to implement the fast-track approach for joining the European Monetary Union. Although it limits a number of exchange rate and macroeconomic risks, the strategy of quick euro adoption simultaneously requires a highly orchestrated domestic economic policy intervention. The weakest part of this integration agenda is a sustainable disinflation policy. Results of various economic policy scenarios imply that when domestic monetary policy is oriented toward precluding exchange rate variability, the existing dynamics of inflation have to be managed by an adequate mix of wage deindexation, sustainable fiscal adjustment, and rigorous price policy in segments of the Slovenian economy in which insufficient competition creates lasting price pressures, through higher costs or wage increases not based on productivity gains. Lowering inflation in Slovenia to comparable euro area levels will be evidence that the gradual approach to economic transformation after the 1990s, as it has been practiced in the Slovenian economy, is compatible with swift monetary integration and ultimate adoption of the euro.

AB Integration of shelter forest and herbage into a silvo-pastoral system with sustainable management can improve the ecological and economic sustainability of shelter forest in coastal China. Sustainable management of tree density and forage grasses planting was studied by establishing five experimental treatments through selective logging of the forest. The tree density at the five treatments was 5.00, 2,50, 1.67, 1.25, and 1.00 ind./100 in 2, respectively. The density of 1.25 ind./100 m(2) (Treatment 4) is the best for introduced forage plants (Sorghum sudanense, Lolium multiflorum, and Medicago sativa) and mature Populus to integrate into a silvo-pastoral system, while the density of 1.00 ind./100 m(2) (Treatment 5) is the best for the native grass (Setaria faberi and Arthraxon pricnode) and mature Populus. The planting experiment presented the best combination of planting practices (seed amount, planting depth, and fertilizer amount) for each introduced grass. The silvo-pastoral system has been run successfully for 3 years and has been very profitable for the local farmers. In the silvo-pastoral system, simple cultivation practices change the local dominant species of grasses. Furthermore, a new result is found about tree-grass interaction that change of tree density can alter species of forage plants under trees. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DESIGN
AB Ecological, soil bioengineering, and traditional techniques were integrated to obtain a structurally sound, ecologically sustainable and socio-economically beneficial method for restoring the riverbanks at the Airport Town, Shanghai, which was the first project applying soil bioengineering to riverbank restoration in China. Soil bioengineering is the use of living plant materials to construct structures that perform some engineering and ecological functions and can provide an effective means for slope stabilization and site restoration of riverbanks. The restoration and management strategy was based on a plan to integrate the natural landscape using live staking, live fascines, brush layer, vegetated geo-grids and geo-gabions, along with native vegetation for riverbank preservation. Ecological parameters including root characteristics and their biomass, species and habitat diversity, and soil moisture and shear stress were measured for site characterization and evaluation of a demonstration project The riverbank erosion was reduced significantly, along with an increase in species and habitat diversity, and improvement in aesthetics and water quality after a ten-month project implementation period, when compared to the control site. Our project of ecological restoration of riverbanks can be viewed through the perspective of the 19 principles presented by Mitsch and Jorgensen, which shows also how the principles and methods of soil bioengineering, and the concepts of ecological engineering that have recently been much developed in the West have been absorbed into Chinese practices of ecological engineering and can be applied to ecological restoration of riverbanks in China.

AB Grassland degradation is widespread and severe on the Tibet Plateau. To explore management approaches for sustainable development of degraded and restored ecosystems, we studied the effect of land degradation on species composition, species diversity, and vegetation productivity, and examined the relative influence of various rehabilitation practices (two seeding treatments and a non-seeded natural recovery treatment) on community structure and vegetation productivity in early secondary succession. The results showed: (1) All sedge and grass species of the natural steppe meadow had disappeared from the severely degraded land. The above-ground and root biomass of severely degraded land were only 38 and 14.7%, respectively, of those of the control. So, the original ecosystem has been dramatically altered by land degradation on alpine steppe meadow. (2) Seeding measures may promote above-ground biomass, particularly grass biomass, and ground cover. Except for the grasses seeded, however, other grass and sedge species did not occur after seeding treatments in the sixth year of seeding. Establishment of grasses during natural recovery treatment progressed slowly compared with during seeding treatments. Many annual forbs invaded and established during the 6 years of natural recovery. In addition, there was greater diversity after natural recovery treatment than after seeding treatments. (3) The above-ground biomass after seeding treatment and natural recovery treatment were 114 and 55%, respectively, of that of the control. No significant differences in root biomass occurred among the natural recovery and seeded treatments. Root biomass after rehabilitation treatment was 23-31% that of the control.

CULTURAL, PRACTICAL, AND ECONOMIC VALUE OF WILD PLANTS: A QUANTITATIVE STUDY IN THE BOLIVIAN AMAZON. Economic Botany 60(1):62-74, 2006. Researchers have developed several indices to estimate the significance of plant species for humans. We build on previous methods in ethnobotany and anthropology to develop a new way to value plant species along three dimensions: cultural, practical, and economic. We used interview and observational data on the use of wild plants by the Tsimane', a foraging-horticultural society in the Bolivian Amazon. We calculated the Cultural, practical, economic, and total values of 114 plant species from 46 families. We found a low correlation between the practical and the cultural values of species: some species rarely, used were frequently mentioned in interviews, whereas some species frequently used were rarely, mentioned in interviews. Indices of cultural, practical, and economic value measure different dimensions of the importance of plant species to society. The combination of the three indices offers a more comprehensive valuation of the significance of plants for humans than the use of only, one index.

AB The humidification dehumidification desalination process is viewed as a promising technique for small capacity production plants. The process has several attractive features, which include operation at low temperature, ability to utilize sustainable energy sources, i.e. solar and geothermal, and requirements of low technology level. This paper evaluates the characteristics of the humidification dehumidification desalination process as a function of operating conditions. A small capacity experimental system is used to evaluate the process characteristics as a function of the flow rate of the water and air streams, the temperature of the water stream and the temperature of the cooling water stream. The experimental system includes a packed humidification column, a double pipe glass condenser, a constant temperature water circulation tank and a chiller for cooling water. The water production is found to depend strongly on the hot water temperature. Also, the water production is found to increase upon the increase of the air flow rate and the decrease of the cooling water temperature. The measured air and water temperatures, air relative humidity and the flow rates are used to calculate the air side mass transfer coefficient and the overall heat transfer coefficient. Measured data are found to be consistent with previous literature results. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we provide a methodology for decomposing international inequalities in per capita CO2 emissions into Kaya (multiplicative) factors and two interaction terms. We use the Theil index of inequality and show that this decomposition methodology can be extended for analyzing between- and within-group inequality components. We can thus analyze the factors behind inequalities in per capita CO2 emissions across countries, between groups of countries and within groups of countries. The empirical illustration for international data suggests some points. Firstly, international inequality in per capita CO2 emissions is mainly attributable to inequalities in per capita income levels, which helps to explain its recent reduction, while differences in carbon intensity of energy and energy intensity have made a less significant contribution. This result is strongly influenced by the performance of China and India. Secondly, the between-group inequality component, which is the biggest component, is also largely explained by the income factor. Thirdly, the within-group inequality component increased slightly during the period, something mainly due to the change in the income factor and the interaction terms in a few regions.

ID OF-THE-ART; INVESTMENT; EAST
AB Limits to leapfrogging in energy technologies? One of the most attractive notions in the field of sustainable energy development is the concept of energy-technology "leapfrogging". Leapfrogging through international technology transfer can be especially problematic because often developing countries do not have the technological capabilities to produce or integrate the advanced energy technologies themselves. Until they have acquired the capabilities to produce the advanced technologies themselves, most late-industrializing countries buy their new technologies from industrialized countries, usually through licensing or joint-venture arrangements. Empirical case studies of the three main Sino-US passenger-car joint ventures reveal that until the late 1990s, little energy or environmental leapfrogging occurred in the Chinese automobile industry as the result of the introduction of US automotive technology. An improvement in Chinese capabilities and more stringent Chinese energy and environmental policies are needed to induce energy leapfrogging in the Chinese automobile industry. Foreign firms also have a social responsibility to contribute to China's sustainable industrial development. In order to realize the promise of the leapfrogging, the limits to leapfrogging must be identified and acknowledged so that strategies can be devised to surmount the barriers to the introduction of advanced energy technologies in developing countries.

AB The security of energy supply to the EU is examined in the context of two storylines. Markets and Institutions exemplifies an economically and politically integrated, multilateral world with effective institutions and markets, Regions and Empires involves a world broken up in rival political and economic blocks, competing for resources and markets via political, economic and military power. It is shown that these storylines have a significant impact on the development or the energy market, on the way in which energy Supply may be secured and on the effect and applicability of the several types of instruments available. The current EU is geared towards enlargement and a deepening of economic integration, based on the tenets of the post-1945 Multilateral world system. The present world tends towards Regions and Empires and Suggests that the EU may have to reorient its energy security policy. Energy Policy Must become an integral part of EU external trade and foreign relations and security policy. The EU should develop its own strategy, actively investing in dialogues with producer countries in the Persian Gulf and Africa and with Russia. Sustainable prosperity and governance in these regions will Support EU energy security. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent times the two major international endorsements of the elements of sustainable development the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), have recognized universal access to energy as an important goal. In India, with a population of over a 1000 million people, it is estimated that a mere 43.5% of the households have access to electricity. The choices that the country makes towards energizing the remaining population will have a significant impact on other Sustainable Development parameters Such as agriculture, water, health, and even biodiversity. India has set itself a target, going beyond the MDGs, of energizing all households by the year 2012. In view of the differentiated responsibilities of the various ministries to the Government of India, the strategy for reaching this target may not address itself to the larger development goals.

AB In this paper I interrogate the relationship between environmental science and local governance in the United Kingdom. Effectively linking science and policy is critical to sustainable planning, and within the rhetoric of evidence-based policy it is often assumed that science conducted in a locality will feed linearly into the governance of that locality. This assumption is unpacked through the detailed study of an end-user-oriented environmental research project. I argue that the reproduction of separate scientific and political spheres prevented the research from being relevant to the governance of that locality. Theoretical and practical approaches to the spatialities of the research-policy interface are considered in order to politically reconstruct the local as a meaningful field of environmental governance.

   farming

DE aquaculture; biodiversity; ecological impacts; shellfish
AB Little is known about the impacts of intensive shellfish farming on intertidal ecosystems. To assess such impacts, several indices of ecosystem structure and select geochemical characteristics were contrasted among three intertidal regions, which represented a gradient of shellfish farming activities, namely (1) no active aquaculture, (2) actively farmed for three years and (3) actively farmed for five years. All three intertidal regions were located in Baynes Sound (British Columbia, Canada) and were geographically similar. Among the three beaches, species richness, community composition, bivalve abundance, biomass, distribution, and composition and surficial sediment per cent organic matter (carbon) and silt were compared. The intertidal regions that had been used for farming for three and five years had lower species richness, different bivalve composition, abundance and distributions, and a foreshore community dominated by bivalves, as compared to the intertidal region where no active farming occurred. Beaches that were actively farmed also had greater accumulations of organic matter and silt. Simplification of the intertidal benthic community, coupled with accumulations of organic matter and increased siltation, may have altered the ecology of the foreshore region used for intense shellfish harvesting. To access the foreshore for shellfish farming in a sustainable manner, studies are needed to determine the scale to which intensive use of the foreshore for shellfish purposes alone is feasible without undue harm to the environment.

AB Yasuni National Park and Biosphere Reserve in Ecuador's Amazon basin is home to the Huaorani and an area of high conservation value. As a result of oil development in the early 1990s, a road was constructed in the northern region of the Park. Three Huaorani communities have since been established in proximity to the road, two of them when the road was built, ten years prior to this study, and the third in a previously uninhabited area. This allowed for a natural experiment comparing harvest compositions across communities of different ages at one point in time. Harvest profiles suggest that the spider monkey Ateles belzebuth is facing local depletion near the two old communities and the howler monkey Alouatta seniculus may also be depleted near one of the old communities. That the two oldest communities still harvested a relatively high number of other vulnerable species is attributed to their use of the road to increase forest access. The spider monkey appears to be the first species to become depleted in persistently hunted areas.

AB Recreational fisheries are the dominant or sole user of many coastal and most inland fish stocks in industrialized societies. Recreational angling can negatively affect fish populations, but appropriate management approaches to address these impacts are often lacking. Overall, privately-governed European recreational fisheries systems offer suitable conditions to reconcile resource use with resource conservation because access restriction is possible, decision-making structures are simple and management scales are small. This increases the, hope that the race to fish may be less pronounced than in open-access commercial fisheries. To achieve harmony between use and conservation values, a thorough understanding of the human dimension is paramount, yet approaches including this are underrepresented in contemporary recreational fisheries science and management. Based on theoretical considerations, literature review and personal experiences, this paper presents key human obstacles to the reconciliation of recreational fishery resource use and resource conservation, with emphasis on private fishing rights regimes of central Europe. Nine obstacles are identified: (1) lack of social priority; (2) lack of integrated approaches; (3) lack of cooperative institutional linkages; (4) lack of systems thinking, (5) lack of research and monitoring; (6) lack of shared values and dominance of stereotyped perceptions; (7) lack of consideration for regional fish-angler dynamics; (8) lack of objective communication of scientific findings; and (9) lack of critical self-reflection among individual anglers. Potential solutions to overcome the identified constraints briefly discussed include: (1) evaluation of the socioeconomic benefits of angling; (2) rehabilitation of ecosystem structure and function on larger scales; (3) facilitation of structured cooperation between stakeholders and management units; (4) application of complex systems approach; (5) increased funding for long-term monitoring; (6) fostering of common values of different stakeholders; (7) active adaptive management of angling effort on regional scales; (8) intensified communication of research findings; and (9) conviction of anglers to meet personal targets by more restrictive regulations. Increasing research and management efforts related to the social component of recreational fisheries will improve reconciliation of resource use and resource conservation in traditional recreational fisheries management. It is a matter of societal values whether it is judged necessary to do so on a broader scale.

TI Karst groundwater protection in the Kupa River catchment area and
   sustainable development
SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Kupa River catchment area; Karst springs; protection system;
   groundwater; hydrogeology; Croatia
AB One of the most significant water resources in the Republic of Croatia is the catchment area of the Kupa River, located in the region bordering the Republic of Slovenia. About 88% of the total amount of water in this catchment originates in Croatia and just 12% from Slovenia; therefore, the largest part of the catchment area (about 1000 km(2)) is on the Croatian side of the border. It is a typical karst area of the Dinarides with aquifers characterized by a relatively rapid water exchange, high groundwater flow velocities and aquifers open to human impact from the surface. Consequently, the aquifers are highly vulnerable and at risk. Due to the availability of large quantities of high-quality spring water (about 6 m(3)/s), the entire area has a strategic importance within the context of any future development strategy pertaining to the western part of Croatia. The catchment area on the Croatian side was investigated using a wide range of research methods that included a classical hydrogeological approach, the detailed hydrologic calculation of water balance to the hydrogeochemical analyses and modelling. The objective was to determine protection zones and protection measures for the whole area. The difficulties are increased due to the fact that the karst catchment area is crossed by major traffic corridors, oil pipelines and a railway and that many settlements and a highly developed wood industry are present. The combination of protecting water resources with adequate prevention measures and necessary remedial activities that should satisfy the very strict requirements necessary for the protection of the karst aquifers while still allowing for present and future human activities is difficult - but not impossible - to achieve. One good example is the present highway with a closed dewatering system and waste water treatment before the water passes into the karst underground system.

   accounting; British Columbia
AB Business reviews of the forest industry in British Colombia, Canada, typically portray an unequivocally positive picture of its financial and economic health. In doing so, they fail to consider the following six categories of social impacts and costs: (1) direct and indirect subsidies; (2) government support through investment; (3) community dependence; (4) the maintenance of public order; (5) aboriginal title; and (6) the overestimation of employment. Our findings show that conventional economic and financial accounting methods inflate the industry's net contribution to the economy We make a number of recommendations to address this shortcoming to improve future accounting and reporting procedures.

DE indirect environmental impact valuation; environmental impact
   assessment; ecological footprint; strong sustainability; guide land
   values
AB All economic activities impact on the environment but not all environmental impacts are assigned values and taken into consideration in development budgets. At project level, the environmental consequences of proposed economic activities have to be evaluated by conducting an environmental impact assessment. Threshold levels in physical terms are outlined in corresponding laws and regulations. Projects fulfilling the necessary environmental assessment requirements (threshold levels) tend to be permitted without predicting the expected environmental impacts in monetary terms. The economic valuation of environmental impacts tends to be affected by uncertainties. The following example of indirect monetary valuation of environmental impacts uses the Ecological Footprint (EF) concept to calculate the total land use of projects. According to the strong sustainability concept it is assumed that every additional direct or indirect utilisation of land caused by a project requires corresponding offset areas. The offset areas required by different project alternatives are valued with relevant regional guide land values. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

LA English
DT Article
DE strategic environmental assessment; SEA; methodology; matrix; Taiwan;
   Asia
AB This paper discusses the current SEA procedures and assessment methodologies, aiming to propose strategies that can lead to effective improvement in a newly industrialized Asian country, Taiwan. Institutional and practical problems with regard to the regulations and tools of SEA in Taiwan are compared to those in other countries. According to the research results, it is suggested that extra evaluation processes should be incorporated into the current assessment procedures to improve their scientific validity and integrity. Moreover, it is also suggested that the sustainability appraisal approaches be included in the SEA framework. In this phase, revised evaluation indicators associated with corresponding targets can be the first attempt for modifying the SEA system. It is believed that these can promote the operability in practice and also lead the whole assessment procedures to a direction closer to sustainable development. The trails that Taiwan has followed can help other countries that are going to adopt SEA to find a more effective and efficient way to follow. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
AB One of the fundamental challenges of project-based environmental assessments (EA) has been to deliver on the promise of meaningful public participation leading to decisions that put affected societies on the path to sustainability. The record to date has been less than promising, leading the authors to propose that it is time to consider a different approach to legislating public participation in project assessments, one that starts with the ultimate objective of cooperation and consensus building. The authors work back from this objective and propose an EA process specifically designed to encourage all participants to participate constructively. In the process, the authors identify how the proposed process will address various criticisms made of the traditional approach to EA by proponents, government officials and members of the public alike. Through a Fundamental shift from process requirements to a focus on the outcomes of EA, the authors propose a way forward for project-based EA to deliver on the promise of becoming a central tool on the path to sustainability.

ID CITIES; CHINA; SUSTAINABILITY; GOVERNANCE; TRANSITION; CONTEXT
AB This article critically reviews the evolution of urban environmental management in Shanghai since 1978. Established in a transitional postsocialist economy and shaped by a spectacular urban redevelopment process, the current environmental management framework of Shanghai has succeeded in mitigating major industrial pollution and improving urban amenities with unprecedented pace and magnitude. However, it generally failed to take social equity and environmental justice issues into consideration. Based on Haughton's models of sustainable urban development, this article proposes four priorities and five principles within the framework of a fair shares cities model for the future environmental management of Shanghai and briefly discusses their policy implications and implementation issues. The authors argue that Haughton's approach is relevant to Shanghai's case because the essence of his argument-the multidimensional equity principles-is the core of the concept of sustainable development.

AB Fish habitat loss has been prevalent over the last century in Canada. To prevent further erosion of the resource base and ensure sustainable development, Fisheries and Oceans Canada enacted the habitat provisions of the Fisheries Act in 1976. In 1986, this was articulated by a policy that a "harmful alteration, disruption, or destruction to fish habitat" (HADD) cannot occur unless authorised with legally binding compensatory habitat to offset the HADD. Despite Canada's progressive conservation policies, the effectiveness of compensation habitat in replicating ecosystem function has never been tested on a national scale. The effectiveness of habitat compensation projects in achieving no net loss of habitat productivity (NNL) was evaluated at 16 sites across Canada. Periphyton biomass, invertebrate density, fish biomass, and riparian vegetation density were used as indicators of habitat productivity. Approximately 63% of projects resulted in net losses in habitat productivity. These projects were characterised by mean compensation ratios (area gain:area loss) of 0.7:1. Twenty-five percent of projects achieved NNL and 12% of projects achieved a net gain in habitat productivity. These projects were characterised by mean ratios of 1.1:1 and 4.8:1, respectively. We demonstrated that artificially increasing ratios to 2:1 was not sufficient to achieve NNL for all projects. The ability to replicate ecosystem function is clearly limited. Improvements in both compensation science and institutional approaches are recommended to achieve Canada's conservation goal.

ID SOIL-EROSION; CONSERVATION; HIGHLANDS
AB Land degradation by soil erosion is a socioeconomic and environmental problem facing many developing countries. Application of stonewall terraces for soil moisture conservation is vital to reducing the environmental impacts of this phenomenon. To this end, a field plot experiment was conducted in the study area along with the use of a closed-ended questionnaire. The object of the experiment was to study the socioeconomic impacts of soil erosion on local farmers and their adoption of the stonewall terrace technique. The study showed a higher net profit in areas that had implemented terrace conservation practices than in areas that had not (i.e., 3.5 to 6 times higher net profit). Correlation analysis indicated that the farmers' perceptions, land ownership, and geomorphology were significantly related to the farmers' incentives and willingness to adopt terraces as soil conservation measures (P < 0.05), although the correlations were negative. Smallholder farmers (52% of the interviewed farmers) were involved in the sale of the agricultural land for urban uses, largely because of the high price and immediate returns offered. However, the associated land use changes warrant greater involvement of both the private and public sectors. This cooperation may be accomplished through the introduction of a long-term agricultural loan system and the development of proper legislation accompanied by a comprehensive and durable infrastructure and service system with the goal of reducing the negative impact of land use changes and encouraging sustainable use of resources.

AB Unprecedented rates of human-induced changes in land use and land cover (LULC) at local and regional scales lead to alterations of global biogeochemical cycles. Driving forces behind LULC changes mainly include rapid growth rates of population and consumption, lack of valuation of ecological services, poverty, ignorance of biophysical limitations, and use of ecologically incompatible technologies. One of the major ecological tragedies of the commons in a Mediterranean region of Turkey is the loss of Lake Amik at the expense of increasing the area of croplands, which used to provide vital ecosystem goods and services for the region. In this study, we aimed at quantifying the effects of past land-use transitions on soil organic carbon (SOC) pools (0-20 cm) in a Mediterranean region of 3930 km(2), between 1972 and 2000. LULC changes were quantified from a time series of satellite images of Landsat-MSS in 1972, Landsat-5 TM in 1987, and Landsat-7 ETM+ in 2000 using geographic information systems. The study showed that the increase in croplands between 1972 and 1987 took place at the expense of the irreversible losses of Lake Amik and its related wetlands of over 53 km(2). In the period of 1972 to 2000, croplands, settlements, and evergreen forests increased by 174%, 106%, and 14%, respectively. The increase in settlements occurred mostly to the detriment of croplands. Given the average rates of all the land-use transitions, and associated changes in SOC density for the study region of 3930 km(2), total SOC pool was estimated to decrease by 14.1% from 130.1 Mt in 1972 to 111.7 Mt in 2000.

AB Background, Aim and Scope. To better address the requirements of the changing multilateral order, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Cleaner Production Programme, in 2004, developed the new Sustainable Industrial Resource Management (SIRM) approach. This approach is in accordance with the principles decided at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. Unlike the traditional approaches to environmental management, the SIRM concept captures the idea of achieving sustainable industrial development through the implementation of circular material and energy flows in the entire production chain and reduction of the amount of material and energy used with greater efficiency solutions. The SIRM approach seeks to develop new models to encourage a shift from selling products to supplying services, modifying, in this manner, the supplier/user relationship and resulting in a win-win situation for the economy and the environment. Chemical Leasing represents such a new service-oriented business model and is currently being promoted by UNIDO's Cleaner Production Programme.
   Main Features. One of the potential approaches to address the problems related to ineffective use and over-consumption of chemicals is the development and implementation of Chemical Leasing business models. These provide concrete solutions to the effective management of chemicals and on the ways negative releases to the environment can be reduced. The Chemical Leasing approach is a strategy that addresses the obligations of the changing international chemicals policy by focusing on a more service-oriented strategy. Mexico is one of the countries that were selected for the implementation of UNIDO's demonstration project to promote Chemical Leasing models in the country. The target sector of this project is the chemical industry, which is expected to shift their traditional business concept towards a more service and value-added approach. This is being achieved through the development of company specific business models that implement the above-indicated Chemical Leasing concept with the support from the Mexican National Cleaner Production Centre (NCPC).
   Results and Conclusions. The implementation of Chemical Leasing in Mexico has proven to be an efficient instrument in enhancing sustainable chemical management and significantly reducing emissions in Mexico. Several companies from the chemical industrial sector implement or agreed to implement chemical leasing business models. Based on the positive findings of the project, several Mexican companies started to negotiate contents of possible Chemical Leasing contracts with suitable business partners. The project further aimed at disseminating information on Chemical Leasing. It successfully attracted globally operating companies in the chemicals sector to explore possibilities to implement Chemical Leasing business models in Mexico. At the international level, the results of the UNIDO project were presented on 20TH September 2005 during a side event of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) Preparation Conference in Vienna.
   Recommendations and Outlook. To facilitate the promotion and application of Chemical Leasing project at international level, UNIDO is currently developing a number of tools to standardize Chemical Leasing projects. These include, among others, Chemical leasing contract models; Chemical Leasing data base to find partners for chemical leasing; and guidelines to implement Chemical Leasing projects and work programmes.

AB On a site contaminated decades ago with Cu from a wood treatment facility, we can observe that the decomposition of soil organic matter has been slowed. This represents an exceptional data set, and it allows us to address many challenges faced by regulators and risk assessors who are trying to derive appropriate soil quality criteria. These data are representative of a field study with a very well-equilibrated contamination and allow the derivation of chronic toxicity threshold values for the inhibition of microbial respiration. Soil respiration is the main determinant of the carbon balance, and it is assessed using the accumulation of soil organic matter (SOM) in this case. Using data derived from a 70-year-old field study also has the advantage of not being subject to risk assessment uncertainty factors arising from the potential aging effects of spiked soil or to the uncertainty caused by laboratory-to-field differences, both of which are very difficult to address. The resulting toxicity thresholds for an inhibition of SOM degradation are 154, 193, and 285 mg Cu/kg dry soil for inhibition levels of 10, 20, and 50%, respectively. Setting those thresholds correctly is critical for a proper risk assessment relative to sustainable development and agriculture.

AB This study provides the first quantification of the population food intake of the litter-consuming mangrove crab Ucides cordatus (Ocypodidae, L. 1763) in a New World mangrove forest. Diet, feeding periodicity, gastric evacuation rates and size-dependent consumption were determined for this intensively exploited semi-terrestrial crab in different types of mangrove forest.
   Unlike many other crabs Ucides cordatus is a continuous feeder, as shown by gastrointestinal contents over a day's cycle. Starvation experiments revealed that most gastric evacuation occurs during the first 12 h after feeding, following an exponential decay function. Evacuation rates (0.35 h(-1) and 0.31 h(-1)) for small (carapace width CW 2.5-3.5 cm) and large (CW 6.5-7.5 cm) crabs, respectively, and the mean daily gastrointestinal contents were used to calculate the daily food intake (DFI) of U. cordatus for both sexes and different size classes. DFI was strongly correlated to body size and ranged from 19.8 to 6.0% of body dry weight in small and large crabs, respectively. The daily energy intake of U. cordatus (37.6 kJ for a 65 g wet weight specimen) was high when compared to other leaf-eating crabs.
   Litter fall and propagule production were calculated as 16.38 t ha(-1) y(-1), corresponding to a daily mean of 4.49 gm(-2) in a high intertidal Rhizophora mangle forest stand. The estimated population food intake of Ucides cordatus (4.1 g dw m(-2) d(-1)) corresponds to 81.3% of this production. This high litter removal rate, a low litter quantity in burrows and high consumption rates during field experiments suggest that the local crab population is food-limited in many parts of the study area. The very efficient coupling of forest litter production and crab litter consumption is possible due to the high crab density and the low inundation frequency of the mangrove forests, allowing for prolonged foraging periods. By processing the major part of the litter, U. cordatus helps to retain nutrients and energy within the mangrove ecosystem. The impact of this species on litter turnover in a New World mangrove is similar to or even higher than that of litter-feeding sesarmid crabs in the Indo-West Pacific region. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

ID RISK PERCEPTION
AB Sustainable development has been conceptualised as a "commonwealth of values" lying at the intersection of environmental, economic and social goals (Alternatives 17 (3) (1990) 14). This captures well the approach taken by the present study, which examines the cultural, environmental and economic components of sustainable development and framed within cultural theory. People do not perceive the world through clear eyes, but through perceptual lenses coloured by their worldview. Cultural theory provides an alternative to the conventional attitude-driven approaches to environmental perceptions. This study sought to test the relationship between the four worldviews of cultural theory (hierarchy, egalitarianism, individualism and fatalism) in the context of their Cultural, environmental and economic domains, with particular reference to the costs and benefits of car use. Questionnaires, designed to measure cultural, environmental and economic worldviews, attitudes towards car use and socio-dernographic indices (A theoretical and methodological examination of cultural theory applied to environmental issues. Unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Department of Psychology, University of Surrey (2002)) were sent to residents of a prosperous town in the south-east of England and where car ownership levels are significantly higher than the national average. The findings of this study support the predictions of cultural theory. The results are discussed in terms of their significance both for future research on understanding the predictors of environmental perceptions, attitudes and behaviour, as well as environmental interventions.

AB Of all the countries in the world, why did you choose Taiwan to pursue your study? It is a question that I (comments of the first author) have answered a thousand times. My first visit to a laboratory at National Taiwan University opened my eyes to the possibilities of herbal medicine research, especially in the area of veterinary medicine. It became my ambition to link the knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda from the Indian subcontinent and their integration with other systems of medicine, including Western medicine (WM), to achieve the concept of Sustainable Medicine, firstly for animals and then for humans. The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has implemented a technology development program to quickly establish the key technologies, and this is a moment of opportunity for Taiwan's traditional herbal medicine industry to upgrade and transform itself. This paper, initially intended to be a student's narration, has evolved into a multi-author treatise on the present state and likely future scenario of herbal medicine research in Taiwan.

TI The sustainability of inclusive school reform
SO EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN
LA English
DT Article
AB For over a decade, University of Florida researchers worked with middle schools in a large urban and suburban south Florida district, as they developed and then worked to sustain inclusive reform. One middle school Socrates, was notably successful, having built its inclusion model on a foundation of previous reform and a school culture characterized by shared decision making, collaboration, and teaming. For 4 years, we studied Socrates and the sustainability of its program. Inclusion was not sustained; our analysis of teacher and administrator interviews revealed three primary factors that he explain why: leadership change, teacher turnover, and state and district assessment policy change. Reduced support for the program, a by-product of the primary factors, also contributed to the lack of sustainability.

ID COMANAGEMENT
AB Despite the possession of a highly productive inland water area of about 45,000 km(2), the continuing decrease in fish catch increasingly threatens the livelihoods of more than 12 million fishers in Bangladesh. The government's open access and leasing policies have been identified as the principal causes of catch decline. Conflicting demands on the inland aquatic area also accelerate drastically the destruction of aquatic resources. Barriers to the access of fishers in the management of inland fisheries resources and over-exploitation by the relatively wealthier non-fisher population are reducing the options for sustaining the livelihoods of fishery dependent communities. The government has pursued a range of initiatives to arrest this continued decline but none has appeared to be appropriate. In this study we investigated the present fisheries management crisis of Bangladesh and justified the opportunities for existing fisheries management to evolve towards community based fisheries management (CBFM) to support the sustainable use of fisheries resources in future.

AB Incorporating biodiversity objectives into industrial forest activities is a required part of sustainable management initiatives. In many temperate-forest environments, bats represent a large portion of the vertebrate species diversity, but for most locations we lack basic data regarding habitat needs. We describe characteristics of diurnal roost trees and stands used by radio-tagged bats in the sub-boreal forest of central British Columbia. We tracked 12 female Myotis lucifugus, 2 M. volans, and 1 M. septentrionalis to 33-day-roosts and found 4 additional roosts by random observations and inspecting cavities for guano. The 37 roosts occurred primarily in two species of trees, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta; n = 18) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides; n = 17). In lodgepole pine, trees were in early stages of decay and bats roosted under bark, usually alone. Trembling aspen more typically contained groups of roosting bats (henceforth communal roosts; n = 14 trees). Communal roosts were all in vertical cracks that were formed from a combination of trauma causing a wood scar and decay fungi. Other species of trees used as roosts included black cottonwood (P. balsamifera; n = 1) and hybrid white spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii; n = 1). We constructed logistic regression models for conifer and deciduous roosts used by M. lucifugus and M. volans to determine selection characteristics. Results from our analyses suggest that in sub-boreal forests, management of bat habitat should focus on the maintenance of: (1) mature stands; (2) individual lodgepole pine trees with exfoliating bark, few missing limbs, and free of potential obstructions to roost entrance; (3) large diameter trembling aspen, with long vertical cracks, in stands with fewer stems per hectare. No roosts were located in cavities excavated by woodpeckers, which implies that in our study area management plans that incorporate bats as secondary cavity users may not be sufficient to maintain populations.

AB Tropical dry forest in Mesoamerica has long been disturbed by the extraction of different forest products by local inhabitants. Bursera glabrifolia (white "copalillo") is a dry tropical forest tree extensively used in several communities of the State of Oaxaca, Mexico, for the elaboration of folk-art woodcarvings called "alebrijes". Historically, the extraction of B. glabrifolia had not been regulated; however, in October 2002, the first management plan for this species was implemented in San Juan Bautista Jayacatlan, based on abundance, distribution and dasonomic data. However, no demographic information is available on which to base a sounder management plan that would guarantee the ecological sustainability of this extractive activity. Thus, we studied the population dynamics of this species over a 2-year period in Jayacatlan, where no tree extraction had taken place since 1998. We used stem expansion rates and observations on survival and fecundity to build size-based population projection matrices. The projected population growth rate values (lambda) were 1.14 and 1.04 for the 2001-2002 and the 2002-2003 periods, respectively. These values suggest that the B. glabrifolia population at Jayacatlan shows a growing trend. Several harvesting scenarios were simulated to theoretically assess the impact on population dynamics of harvesting whole trees and, in particular, to ascertain whether the extraction regime recommended by the management plan (8 trees/ha/yr) is sustainable. For this purpose, we used an average population matrix where specific entries were modified to simulate different extraction levels. The results suggest that the harvesting regimes established in the management plan for B. glabrifolia are sustainable. However, resource managers should not exceed the amounts recommended by the management plan and should avoid extrapolating our results to other regions of the country where no demographic studies have been carried out. The need for long-term demographic studies and their incorporation in 'adaptive management plans' is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The role of industry participation in collaborative ecosystem approaches to management initiatives has received limited attention. We first review the literature describing the role of industry in ecosystem management (EM) collaborations, and present a framework for investigating the motivations for industry participation. In order to better understand the incentives for forest industry companies to participate in EM projects, we also conducted a survey of the 38 largest U.S. forestry companies. These companies collectively own or control over 50 million acres of land. Our survey results indicate that companies' efforts to more effectively manage their resources, a desire for positive public relations that may result from EM collaborations, and the building of partnerships with other stakeholders are the most significant motivating factors. Personal satisfaction on the part of involved individuals and a perception that EM is an attractive alternative to litigation are also important incentives. Moreover, companies with larger resource management staffs are more likely to participate in EM collaborations, whereas the size of land holdings appears to be inversely related with the likelihood of participation.

AB The outcome from a stakeholder workshop on pest management methods describes the elements of a national S&T strategy to address the issues of ecological integrity, sustainable management of forests and the need for collaboration ill forest stewardship. The workshop looked beyond current problems to prepare the forest sector for the challenges of sustainable and competitive wood supply in the face of new and varied demands on the forest coupled with the anticipated impacts of climate change. Workshop participants emphasized the need for forest pest management as an essential component of sustainable forest management and identified several themes and goals to achieve sustainability. Participants developed a vision for Our forests that incorporates social and economic sustainability, of ecologically healthy forests providing fibre, while demonstrating that we live in harmony with our forest environment.

AB This paper presents experimental results on co-firing of 'as-received' sugar cane bagasse and rice husk in a conical fluidized-bed combustor (FBC) using silica sand as the bed material. Axial temperature, O-2, CO2, CO and NO concentration profiles in the conical FBC operated at 82.5-82.8 kg/h fuel feed rate and various values of excess air (of about 40, 60, 80 and 100%) for different rice husk energy fractions (of 0.60, 0.85 and 1.0) are discussed. The bed temperature, CO and NO emissions from the combustor, as well as the heat losses and combustion efficiency, are also provided for the above operating conditions. The axial temperature profiles in the conical FBC were almost independent of excess air but noticeably affected by the rice husk energy fraction. The CO emissions were found to reduce for higher values of excess air and rice husk energy fractions. Meanwhile, the NO concentrations at all the points over the combustor volume and, accordingly, NO emissions from the reactor increased with higher excess air and energy contributions by rice husk. The co-firing of these fuels in the conical FBC at the rice husk energy fractions greater than 0.6 resulted in the sustainable combustion, with 95-96% combustion efficiency, and lower NO emissions compared with those for firing pure rice husk. Through co-firing with rice husk, an effective use of 'as-received' sugar cane bagasse becomes feasible for energy conversion in the fluidized-bed combustion systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biomass is a promising sustainable energy source. A tar-free fuel gas can be obtained in a properly designed biomass gasification process. In the current study, a tar-free biomass gasification process by air was proposed. This concept was demonstrated on a lab-scale fluidized bed using sawdust under autothermic conditions. This lab-scale model gasifier combined two individual regions of pyrolysis, gasification, and combustion of biomass in one reactor, in which the primary air stream and the biomass feedstock were introduced into the gasifier from the bottom and the top of the gasifier respectively to prevent the biomass pyrolysis product from burning out. The biomass was initially pyrolyzed and the produced char was partially gasified in the upper reduction region of the reactor, and further, char residue was combusted at the bottom region of the reactor in an oxidization atmosphere. An assisting fuel gas and second air were injected into the upper region of the reactor to maintain elevated temperature. The tar in the flue gas entered the upper region of the reactor and was decomposed under the elevated temperature and certain residence time. This study indicated that under the optimum operating conditions, a fuel gas could be produced with a production rate of about 3.0 Nm(3)/kg biomass and heating value of about 5000 kJ/Nm(3). The concentration of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane in the fuel gas produced were 9.27%, 9.25% and 4.21%, respectively. The tar formation could be efficiently controlled below 10 mg/Nm(3). The system carbon conversion and cold gasification efficiency reached above 87.1% and 56.9%, respectively. In addition, the investigation of energy balance for the scale-up of the proposed biomass gasification process showed that the heat loss could be recovered by approximately 23% of total energy input. Thus, partial fuel gas that was produced could be re-circulated and used to meet need of energy input to maintain the elevated temperature at the upper region of reactor for tar decomposition. It was predicted the heating value of product fuel gas would be 8000 kJ/Nm(3) if the system was scaled up. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PLANNING-THEORY
AB Baldacchino [Baldacchino, G., 2002. Jurisdictional self-reliance for small island territories: considering the partition of Cyprus, The Round Table, 365, 349-360] has argued that the 'troika' of smallness,. insularity and peripherality may incline island peoples (rather more than mainlanders?) to question the effects of economic globalization and be especially disposed to innovative approaches to development. He views jurisdictional capacity as integral to that task. Much of the literature on such issues relates to island nations, but this work focuses on Australia's smallest and only island state of Tasmania, and thus on a sub-national jurisdiction. In what follows I explore the effects of an attempt to enrol Tasmanians in the creation and stabilization of a '2020 vision' meant to be global in its reach, to focus on the particular strengths of the island state, and be innovative in advancing sustainable development. Known as Tasmania Together, the 20-year strategic vision outlines diverse economic, social and environmental goals assembled over two years via widespread consultations with the island's communities of place and interest. For a time Tasmania Together generated significant debate about what it means to be an island people, and whether and to what extent Tasmanians' future will be secured through economic globalization or localized endeavours premised on sustainability principles. Important to Tasmanians as well as to island studies, these rhetorics of social and spatial engagement also have salience beyond the borders of the island state, highlighting larger questions about the technologies of governmentality.. agency and the performance of identity.

AB Susutainable development relies on fundamental shifts in the attitudes held by individual citizens towards the environment, and their use of natural resources. Accordingly this article examines the work that has been indertaken by a range of researchers from a variety of disciplines examining the links between enviromental attitudes and behaviours. The development of a conceptual framework for organising the various barriers and motivations for individual environmental action is outlined. A case example of waste minimisation behaviour in Devon is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach adopted. The results indicate that fundamentally different factors predict a willingness to minimise waste, as opposed to actual behaviour. This is related to the growing social acceptance of environmental action among members of the public, which is not necessarily reflected in behaviour. The article positions this research in geography on sustainable lifestyles, which has been focused primarily on the use of culturally-derived theories and qualitative methodologies.

DT Article
AB Conventional energy resources will be used for many more future decades. The demand will increase by 60% compared to 2004. The supply of energy in Germany in a sustainable way forces an increasing mix from conventional and renewable sources. The more renewables are used the more independent Germany will be from imported fossil fuels. Geothermal energy, generated by near-surface heat pumps can be expected to give a significant amount of substitution. Geological surveys can offer geological information for optimising the dimensioning process of underground heat-pump systems. Processing these data using hydrogeological methods consequently, near-surface heat pumps are to be expected a promising contribution to the German energy demand for heating.

TI Prospects for historic neighborhoods in atypical Islamic cities: the
   view from Amman, Jordan
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE historic neighborhood development; urban development; Islamic cities;
   Jordan
AB What is the function and future prospect for older and more historic neighborhoods in an atypical Islamic city? This study case from Amman, Jordan, identifies three main factors that have circumscribed the neighborhood's urban development: changes to landuse, rent-control bylaws, and processes of land succession. A survey of the ownership registry for 666 plots for the period 1946-2002 reveals that inheritance plays an important role in the processes of land succession. Such processes, based as they are on Islamic thinking about inheritance, are expected to be the most persistent factor affecting the future form and function of the neighborhood. The effect of such processes of land succession may be compared to the function observed elsewhere for waqf property in terms of contributing to the sustainability of traditional crafts and trades in old bazaars; in the case presented here, however, processes of land succession, are contributing to the creation of opportunities for development and redevelopment by freeing a sizeable percentage of available land, built or unbuilt, with the passing of every generation. Thus, in contrast to the often cited adverse effect such processes have in rural areas when leading to the fragmentation of agricultural farming areas, the same processes are here found to be conducive to urban regeneration and redevelopment.

TI Urban conservation in Istanbul: evaluation and re-conceptualisation
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Istanbul; globalisation; urban conservation; regeneration; earthquake
   threat; EU harmonisation
AB Istanbul's world-class heritage resources are under serious threat as a result of ineffective conservation planning. The limited achievements of urban conservation in Istanbul can only be satisfactorily explained by an analysis that encompasses both the actions of local decision-makers and the structural economic and political forces which shape the constraints and opportunities within which they act. This perspective underpins an evaluation of urban conservation in Istanbul since the 1980s and an assessment of prospects for improving practice. New policy drivers, particularly increased awareness of earthquake risk and the European Union (EU) harmonisation process, are creating the opportunity to move towards more effective policies for sustainable urban regeneration.
   In the context of the city's changing planning agenda and priorities, it is argued that the prospects for more effective conservation planning are improving. It is concluded that more will be achieved if traditional urban conservation planning is re-conceptualised as a component of sustainable urban regeneration. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We examine the relationship between country-level average costs and coverage levels for diptheria-pertussis-tetanus (DTP) vaccines. Coverage data are from the World Health Organization, and cost data are from financial sustainability plans filed with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) by forty countries from 2000 to 2003. In this data set, average costs are lower for countries that vaccinate more children. At the highest numbers of covered children, there was no trend toward higher average costs. Vaccine programs in this set of poor countries have not yet scaled up to the point at which diminishing marginal returns are observed.

AB To explore the process of public involvement in planning primary health care.
   Recent policy in the UK promotes public involvement in planning health but there have been difficulties in engaging communities in the process. Surveys of health service organizations have found that there has been a failure to adapt to new approaches. It has become important to understand why this has occurred if policy initiatives to encourage involvement are to succeed.
   Qualitative study. Data collected through individual interviews and focus groups.
   Two new primary healthcare developments in deprived areas in Bristol and Weston-Super-Mare.
   Thirty-six professionals and 23 local residents in Bristol; six professionals and three local residents in Weston-Super-Mare.
   Three themes were identified: process, partnership and power. The main findings were that exceptional people with a shared commitment to public involvement were necessary to motivate others and develop partnerships. Local people were drawn into the process and with increased confidence became powerful advocates for their community. Creative and varied methods to involve the public were important in achieving balance between professionals and lay people. However, conflicts over practical decisions arose from a lack of clarity over who had power to influence decisions.
   Most of the participants were enthusiastic about their experience of public involvement in planning primary health care. Features crucial to sustainable involvement included a commitment from leaders within statutory agencies, support over a long period to build the confidence of local people, willingness to use informal approaches that are in tune with local culture, and a recognition of the concerns of both service users and providers.

TI Healthy nature healthy people: 'contact with nature' as an upstream

AB Whilst urban-dwelling individuals who seek out parks and gardens appear to intuitively understand the personal health and well-being benefits arising from 'contact with nature', public health strategies are yet to maximize the untapped resource nature provides, including the benefits of nature contact as an upstream health promotion intervention for populations. This paper presents a summary of empirical, theoretical and anecdotal evidence drawn from a literature review of the human health benefits of contact with nature. Initial findings indicate that nature plays a vital role in human health and well-being, and that parks and nature reserves play a significant role by providing access to nature for individuals. Implications suggest contact with nature may provide an effective population-wide strategy in prevention of mental ill health, with potential application for sub-populations, communities and individuals at higher risk of ill health. Recommendations include further investigation of 'contact with nature' in population health, and examination of the benefits of nature-based interventions. To maximize use of 'contact with nature' in the health promotion of populations, collaborative strategies between researchers and primary health, social services, urban planning and environmental management sectors are required. This approach offers not only an augmentation of existing health promotion and prevention activities, but provides the basis for a socio-ecological approach to public health that incorporates environmental sustainability.

AB This paper explores the complexities and contradictions of frontline practice that pose problems for personalised social care through enhanced choice. It draws on semi-structured interviews with community care workers, social workers, occupational therapists and care managers in a social service department. Practitioners interviewed were asked about their current assessment and documentation system, including the assessment documents currently used; how they approached information gathering and the topics they explored with service users; and their experience of documenting assessment and care management. The paper argues that the validity and sustainability of personalised social care in frontline practice relies on developing a thorough understanding of the complex and implicit assessment processes operating at the service user/practitioner interface and the inevitable tensions that arise for practitioners associated with the organisational context and broader service environment. The findings demonstrate the variability among practitioners in how they collect information and more importantly, the critical role practitioners occupy in determining the kinds of topics to be explored during the assessment process. In so doing, it shows how practitioners can exert control over the decision-making process. More importantly, it provides some insight into how such processes are shaped by the constraints of the organisational context and broader service environment. Complexities and contradictions may be an inherent part of frontline practice. The issues discussed in this paper, however, highlight potential areas that might be targeted in conjunction with implementing personalised social care through enhanced choice for people with disabilities.

ID UNIVERSITY
AB South African higher education institutions are increasingly under scrutiny to produce knowledge that is more relevant to South Africa's social and economic needs, more representative of the diversity of its knowledge producers, and more inclusive of the variety of the sites where knowledge is produced. Only a small percentage of South Africans are graduates of universities or technology institutes, and these graduates are not representative of the diversity of the South African population. As a result there is a shortage of skills to address the country's reconstruction and developmental needs. This places a burden on higher education institutions to expand access to their programmes, and to ensure that their programmes are relevant to the developmental context. Policy makers have found in the Gibbons [Gibbons, M., et al. (1994). The New Production of Knowledge. The Dynamics of Science and Research in Contemporary Societies. London Sage Publishers] thesis on 'Mode 2 knowledge production' a rationale for the transformation of higher education through the inclusion of practices which are less abstract, less discipline bound and closer to those processes which characterise the diversity and distribution of knowledge production in the wider society. Nowotny et al. [Nowtony et al. (2001). Re-thinking Science. Knowledge and the Public in an Age of Uncertainty. Cambridge: Polity Press.] have taken Gibbons' thesis further and have described society itself as becoming increasingly 'Mode 2'. In a Mode 2 society, differentiation is replaced with integration, and networks of knowledge producers conduct their work in transdisciplinary teams across widely distributed sites. Such 'transgressivity' both pushes knowledge production systems forward and distributes and diffuses knowledge more widely throughout society. In this paper, it is argued that there is a need for higher education practitioners to engage critically - and constructively - with the knowledge bases of policy directives to ensure that the new teaching and learning processes and systems adequately prepare students for the complexity and diversity of South African society, and enable them to contribute meaningfully to its reconstruction and development.

ID POLICY
AB This paper sets out the argument that housing renewal has a major role to play in economic and social regeneration in areas of council owned housing. It considers the role that housing stock transfer, with the shift of ownership from local authorities to Registered Social Landlords (RSLs), might have, not only in generating the investment needed to improve the quality of housing and environments, but also in terms of creating wider regeneration benefits. Using the Welsh policy context, it examines how the first large-scale housing transfer is being used to secure broader regeneration objectives.

AB The appropriate relationship between efforts to conserve biological diversity and promote development initiatives that contribute to improving the quality of life of indigenous people has proven contentious, and discussions often seemed more oriented toward staking out positions than defining areas of shared interest upon which alliances that could shape rural land use might be constructed. The Capitania de Alto y Bajo Isoso, the indigenous organization representing the interests of the Guarani people in the Isoso region of Bolivia's Chaco, and the Wildlife Conservation Society, a US-based conservation organization, have developed a partnership over the course of more than 15 years, which has made important contributions to conserving biological diversity and supporting the initiatives of indigenous people to improve their quality of life. This article discusses what have been crucial elements in building and maintaining the partnership, and suggests lessons that might be applied in other settings.

TI Radical HRM innovation and competitive advantage: The Moneyball story
SO HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID HUMAN-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION; DETERMINANTS;
   ADOPTION; STRATEGY; LESSONS
AB Moneyball (Lewis, 2003), a New York Times bestseller, is a book about baseball. When read through a broader lens, however, Moneyball is also a book about innovation, resistance to change, competitive advantage, achieving excellence, and, of most relevance here, human resource management. While many would agree that the radical innovation described in Moneyball represents a "new vision of management" in baseball, this article describes how Moneyball lessons might contribute to a "new vision of HRM" in various types of organizations. The focus of the article is on what HR executives and scholars can learn from the Moneyball phenomenon. More specifically, the authors address a number questions related to the Moneyball story that have relevance to successfully implementing HRM innovations; these questions have to do with overcoming resistance to the implementation of radical innovation and how HRM innovation can contribute to sustainable competitive advantage.

TI Groundwater irrigation and its implications for water policy in semiarid
   countries: the Spanish experience

AB Over the last decades, groundwater irrigation has become commonplace in many arid and semiarid regions worldwide, including Spain. This is largely a consequence of the advances in drilling and pumping technologies, and of the development of Hydrogeology. Compared with traditional surface water irrigation systems, groundwater irrigation offers more reliable supplies, lesser vulnerability to droughts, and ready accessibility for individual users. Economic forces influence the groundwater irrigation sector and its development. In Spain's Mediterranean regions, abstraction costs often amount to a very small fraction of the value of crops. In the inner areas, groundwater irrigation supports a more stable flow of farm income than rainfed agriculture. The social (jobs/m(3)) and economic (Euro/m(3)) value of groundwater irrigation generally exceeds that of surface water irrigation systems. However, poor groundwater management and legal controversies are currently at the base of Spain's social disputes over water. A thorough and transparent assessment of the relative socio-economic value of groundwater in relation to surface water irrigation might contribute to mitigate or avoid potential future conflicts. Enforcement of the European Union's Water Framework Directive may deliver better groundwater governance and a more sustainable use.

   relations; western United States
ID NEW-MEXICO
AB Over the last several decades, water users in the western United States have increasingly turned to groundwater resources to support economic development, but few institutional arrangements were in place to govern groundwater use. Over time, numerous groundwater problems have emerged. Two closely related explanations for this are explored. Surface water sources were the first to be developed, and institutional arrangements to allocate surface water were the first to be devised. These arrangements are not particularly well suited for governing groundwater. Furthermore, the physical differences between rivers and aquifers lead to differences in the development of each type of water, and in production and organization costs. Groundwater development involves low upfront production costs, which individual water users can cover. Once groundwater users have individually invested in productive activities problems emerge, such as declining water tables. Thus, unlike surface water users, groundwater users are faced with devising institutional arrangements to coordinate their water uses after they have invested in and developed productive economic activities. Most western states regulate pumping, although groundwater users, in general, resist pumping limits. The discussion concludes with proposals for modifying the prior appropriation doctrine to better accommodate the active management of groundwater basins for long-term sustainability.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Water resources sustainability hinges on interrelated physical, chemical, biological, and human processes, all of which may affect the quantity and quality of available water supplies. California's decades-long transition process from intensive and often unmanaged groundwater development toward more effective, sustainable integrated water resources management has resulted in important lessons. The process offers insights to other countries that seek to achieve sustainability. Long-term systematic groundwater and surface water monitoring programs and ongoing assessment of regional groundwater systems are an integral part of management. On local to global scales, the need for fundamental data, regional resources assessments, and increased support for scientific and technological advances is becoming increasingly apparent. The scientific community must enhance society's understanding of the essential links between basic data needs and the advancement and application of scientific approaches for effective water management. Correspondingly, scientific and political communities must coordinate common interests in endeavors toward sustainable management. Public outreach is a necessary complement to achieve sustainability goals and garner support for the programs needed to develop water policies based on sound science, manage water resources, and meet future water demands while avoiding unacceptable impacts.

AB Currently, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is the primary species being developed for commercial culture, with activities concentrated around the North Atlantic. In addition, closed life cycles have been established for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), pollock (Pollachius pollachius), and hake (Merluccius australis), but production of these species (in Canada, Spain, and Chile) is rather modest. In the short- to medium-term, Atlantic cod will be the dominant gadoid species in culture, and it is believed that production can reach levels similar to those of farmed salmon within the next 15-20 years. This development is possible because methods for year-round production of juveniles and significant hatchery capacity have been established. Also, there is a demand for farmed cod to fill the gap between increasing market needs and diminishing supply from fisheries. However, challenges must be met if cod fanning is to reach its anticipated potential. Juvenile production must become more reliable in terms of survival and quality. For the on-growing phase, the supply of cost-efficient feeds produced from sustainable raw materials is of utmost importance. Consumer markets need to be developed with an emphasis on quality and food safety. Relatively little is known about health management for gadoid species.

AB A major aim of the aquaculture industry in Norway is to develop sustainable farming of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L. A great deal of research, including fanning trials and stock enhancement, has been performed on this species in Norway during the past two decades. The success of domestication of a new species depends on the genetic variability of the wild broodstock and the selection of appropriate genotypes for the fanning environment. Growth experiments under fanned conditions, including genetic analyses, were started as early as 1983 after the breakthrough of cod juvenile production in mesocosm systems. At later stages (1988 and 1992 year classes), more detailed studies were conducted under farmed conditions. Based on individual tagging and genotyping (blood and white muscle biopsy sampling), estimates of growth performance (specific growth rate, SGR) of the various genotypes within six polymorphic protein loci were obtained. In general, the SGR in the two experiments varied through the year as a function of temperature and body size. In the 1988 year-class experiment, only a few statistically significant differences (ANOVA) were detected among genotypes, measured as mean weight and SGR. The 1992 year-class experiment included two different cod stocks, Northeast Arctic (NE) and Norwegian coastal (NC) cod, which were reared for about two years in the same net pen. Further, during this experiment, only a few genotypes exhibited significantly different growth within the NE group. No consistency was found in the variation with regard to protein loci investigated, growth periods studied, and relationship with temperature variation.

AB A protocol for the induction of somatic embryogenesis from immature zygotic embryos of Rosa bourboniana, a scented rose species, was established. Somatic embryos were induced after 8 wk of inoculation of zygotic embryos on MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (5-15 mu M). In addition to 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid concentrations, somatic embryogenesis was also influenced by the month of collection of the explant and the stage of maturity of the hip. Maximum embryogenic response (16.6%) was observed using 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (15 mu M), from green hips in the month of September. The use of l-proline (800 mg l(-1)) was found to be optimum for secondary embryogenesis. On periodic subculturing, the cultures formed somatic embryos sustainably over a period of 18 mo. For somatic embryo germination, 6-benzylaminopurine (5 mu M) was found to be most suitable. Rooted plants were transferred successfully to soil and appear morphologically normal under greenhouse conditions. Transfer of plants for hardening was most suitable during the active growth period between June and September.

AB It is very valuable to know the surface characteristics of phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin with lignin to promote the utilization of lignin that is sustainable organic materials. The surface characteristics of PF resin with lignosulfonale and kraft lignin were determined by contact angle measurement and inverse gas chromatography (IGC). In the contact angle measurement, the three-liquid method was utilized to determine the Lifshitz-van der Waals components (gamma(LW)), electron-acceptor (gamma(+)), and electron-don or parameter (gamma(-)) of the prepared resins. It wits found that the gamma(LW)(S) and gamma(-)(S) of the prepared resin increased with the substitution of lignin for phenol. This may be due to the chemical component change, e.g. introduction of side chains of the lignin and sulfonic acid group. The acid-base component of the work of adhesion between water and the resins increased with the amount of lignosulfonate Substituted. This agreed well with the fact that phenol-formaldehyde-lignosulfonate resin has lower resistance to water than phenol-formaldehyde resin. In IGC, the same gamma(LW) trends were obtained from the contact angle measurement. However, the absolute values of gamma(LW) obtained from the two methods were quite different. This may be due to the fact that IGC measures the surface energy by means of zero coverage adsorption, whereas a multilayer adsorption is utilized in contact angle measurement. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

ID BIOBASED MATERIALS; STARCH
AB Packaging waste forms a significant part of municipal solid waste and as such has caused increasing environmental concerns, resulting in strengthening of EU Regulations in order to reduce amounts of packaging waste. Among other materials, a huge range of oil-based polymers is currently used in packaging applications. They are largely non-biodegradable and particularly difficult to recycle or reuse due to mixed levels of contamination and complex composites. In recent years, the development of biodegradable packaging materials from renewable natural resources (e.g. crops) has received increasing attention, particularly in EU countries. Significant progress has been made to produce biodegradable materials with similar functionality to that of the oil-based synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that. as the materials are from renewable resources and biodegradable, they would contribute to sustainable development and if properly managed Would reduce their environmental impact upon disposal.
   This paper discusses the potential impact of biodegradable packaging materials on waste management in terms of landfill, incineration, recycle/reuse and composting. A comparison is also drawn to the oil-based polymer packaging materials. It is the view of the authors that biodegradable packaging materials are most suitable for single use disposable packaging applications where the post-consumer use packaging can be locally composted as a means of recycling the materials. Establishment of appropriate collection, transportation and treatment technologies are considered crucial to the success widespread applications of biodegradable packaging materials.

AB A management theory known as the resource-based view of the firm states that resources foster organizational success. Our study of e-commerce retailers applied this theory to examine the effects of human, business, and e-commerce technology resources on firm competitiveness. An e-mail and Web-based survey used 458 responses from site managers. Business and e-commerce technology resources, as well as the individual business resource of process redesign, were found to predict e-commerce performance, whereas human resources did not. E-commerce performance, in turn, predicted firm performance. These findings partially support the resource-based view and coincide with differences between physical and e-commerce retailing.

TI The case for mandatory inclusion of ethics within the zoological
   sciences curriculum
SO INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

   ethics; MAP matrix; sustainability
AB Traditionally, undergraduate science curricula include little or no "ethics," either as theory or practice. However, zoologists are currently enjoying considerable media exposure: some of it positive (as in conservation practice), but more often negative (pertaining to issues such as the use of animals for testing of drugs, and genetic engineering). More than ever before, zoologists are being asked to make value judgments, and many of these involve moral assessment; if we accept that zoologists (along with other scientists) are professionals, then we must accept that they are responsible for any decisions they make, and it then follows that they are accountable, which can have serious ramifications in cases of malpractice. Ethics involves the application of morality in a professional setting. In light of this, teaching ethics is mandatory in degree programs such as engineering and medicine. This paper contends that a key output of zoological education is the undergraduate who is cognizant of the ethical framework and constructs within which he/she must function. The paper concludes with comment on the nature and style of delivery of ethics education.

AB In Venezuela, around 70% of cultivable land presents limitations by acid pH and low availability of P and N in the soil. Sustainable N-replenishment strategies, particularly for low-to medium-input systems oil acid soil of savannas, could make use of biological N-2-fixation. The object of this study was to estimate the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) potential of various tropical legumes grown in acid soil from Venezuelan savannahs by N-15-techniques. The results suggest that the Cajanus cajan is a legume with high capacity for N-2 fixation (79% N derived from the atmosphere), providing a positive N balance into the fallow system. The estimation of BNF in all legumes varied with the non-N-2 fixing reference crops used, confirming that the use of all inadequate reference crop call result in erroneous estimates of BNF especially when the level of N, fixation is low The legume Indigosphera lespediciodes shows potential for use as all alternative green manure because of high total N accumulation and N derived from the atmosphere (62-71%). The results demonstrate that in acid soil it is possible to promote sustainability of agrosystems through the use of conservationist management practices.

TI HIV/AIDS financing: a case for improving the quality and quantity of aid
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA
AB There is no doubt that increasing amounts of funding are needed to provide a full package of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and mitigation interventions to Africa. However, even the existing funding flows are posing considerable challenges at a national level. In the quest for rapid results, donors have too often chosen to alleviate the lack of local capacity by bringing in foreign technical assistance or building parallel systems for delivering commodities such as drugs that may not be sustainable over the long term once external assistance stops. Even when such interventions may be relevant, they do not address the biggest challenge, namely how to build up the capacity and the systems needed for large-scale implementation of the AIDS response. This article argues that to attain the needed efficacy in HIV/AIDS mitigation programmes, further sustainable increase in external financing is certainly required (particularly for treatment programmes), but even more important is the need to implement them.

TI What is the future for African forests and forestry?
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE outlook; driving forces; scenarios; agrarian society; forest management
AB Forests in Africa have been rapidly disappearing and recent assessments suggest that progress towards sustainable forest management has been rather disappointing. While this may appear to justify increasing efforts to improve forest management, this paper highlights the limitations to such an approach. Current trends in African forestry are symptomatic of the larger social and economic situation and interventions in the sector may not be able to address many of the underlying problems in the sector. The impact of key driving forces on future developments suggests that continued forest loss is probably inevitable for at least the next one to two decades. Slow progress towards sustainable forest management is also likely to persist, due to a multitude of constraints. These trends and driving forces present a major dilemma for the forestry sector in Africa, which is that whatever is done to improve forest management may have only a marginal impact. Therefore, it will be essential to assess what is feasible given current levels of social and economic development.

DE African humid dense forests; sustainable management; forest
   conservation; forest legislation
AB Africa's humid dense forests cover approximately 260 million ha and shelter a population of more than 200 million inhabitants. They represent an enormous potential for conservation and development of both the states and the populations concerned. But these forests can only contribute effectively to sustained development if they, themselves, are managed in a sustainable manner. However, these forests continue to be the subject of constant degradation resulting from the pressure exerted by a generally poor population that is constantly growing and carrying out various activities which are incompatible with environmental protection.
   The management of Africa's humid dense forests is confronted with many difficulties of which the most important are: an insufficient knowledge of the resources available, a lack of technical options regarding sustainable management and conservation, conflict with populations, and institutional weakness in the majority of the countries, characterized by insufficient human and material capacity to permit forest administrations to face the requirements of a sustainable forest management.
   Significant efforts to address these problems have been made in recent years and if current efforts are maintained and supported by the international community, and if firm measures are taken to ensure a greater participation of the populations and the private sector, then it is possible that the management of the humid dense forest in Africa is, at a positive turning point in its history.

AB In natural resource-dependent economies such as those in Africa, land, forests, and water are the primary environmental goods and sources of livelihoods. This paper focuses on land and forests, and examines how, where, and under what conditions the absolute and relative lack of access to and/or misuse of these resources can trigger, cause, and amplify conflict. The paper underlines the importance of increased investment in sustainable land and forest management and the value of integrating environmental security into the national development policy agenda as key strategies that will facilitate progress towards the attainment of enduring peace and sustainable development.

DE sustainable forest management; concessions; reduced impact logging;

AB The African resource, and in particular the Congo Basin contains the world's second largest forest area, after the Amazon, and there is a global concern for it to be sustainably managed. Practical solutions are essential if sustainable forest management is to be achieved, considering the costs and technical capacity involved. However, a certain number of difficulties must be overcome such as ill-adapted forestry laws, lack of necessary technical capacity amongst the managers and the actual cost of management. Solutions for sustainable forest management therefore include training and negotiations to better adapt legislation as well as practical issues such as reduced impact logging and the promotion of secondary species which will not only have a positive effect on the regeneration and management of the forest, but which are also more efficient in terms of costs. Certification is also a means of achieving a premium to offset the increased costs of sustainable forest management.

DE Liberian forestry; UN sanctions; forest sector reform; good governance;
   multi-donor partnership
AB The imposition of UN sanctions on Liberian timber helped shut down Liberia's highly corrupt timber sector and bring an end to its long civil war in 2003. As part of its overall effort to support reform and reconstruction in Liberia, the U.S. Government in 2004 established the Liberia Forest Initiative (LFI), a cross-cutting approach to forest sector reform intended to build transparency, sustainability and good governance in the management of the three branches of Liberian forestry: the commercial sector, conservation, and community forestry. The effort quickly attracted strong support from the international community, including the World Bank, FAO, IUCN, EC, CIFOR, and Fauna and Flora International. LFI now functions as an informal multi-donor partnership, working closely with Liberian authorities and civil society to implement far-reaching reforms and establish conditions that could permit the lifting of UN sanctions. The LFI partnership has achieved significant successes in terms of multi-donor coordination, consensus building, engagement with host country authorities, and interaction with civil society, some of which may serve as a model for action in other countries.

AB The paper provides an overview of experiences in Tanzania to date in 'scaling up' Participatory Forest Management (PFM) from what has until recently been a 'project-driven' approach to one that is mainstreamed and embedded within national and local government institutions. It highlights the valuable role that projects have played in influencing policy, developing new models and tools, but also some of the pitfalls of the project approach, particularly with regard to local expectations, the lack of sustainability and failure to integrate within local institutions and systems. In addition, the paper assesses the degree to which different models of Participatory Forest Management (PFM) have delivered on their two main policy objectives-sustainable forest management and improved rural livelihoods. The paper outlines some of the enabling factors as well as constraints to further dissemination and scaling-up of PFM in Tanzania-looking at political, institutional, social and economic dimensions.

AB A fundamental reason for the advocacy of women's literacy is its contribution to the attainment of citizenship, that is the claiming and use of public space and power. Following a presentation of basic trends and public policies in literacy, this article reviews the diverse theoretical understandings of literacy. It discusses normative arguments regarding the provision of emancipatory and sustainable literacy programs for women and the development of an expanded view of citizenship that considers not only the public space but also the private realms of everyday life. Such objectives, the article asserts, can be attained only if literacy is conceived as part of a political project that encourages dialogue and reflection to foster individual and collective agency.

ID GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEMS
AB Notwithstanding impressive developments in SDI in exchange, sharing, accessibility, and use of spatial data, its operational implementation appears sometimes problematic. This paper explores conditions and factors for effective and sustainable use of SDI and suggests that the inherent complexity of SDI requires a multi-faceted way of monitoring and evaluation rather than confinement to the limited scope of objective oriented performance only. Critical issues, challenges, and dilemmas can be identified while looking at SDI as facilitator of communication, as networked infrastructure, as socio-technical actor-network, as common-pool resource, and as community of practice. Finally, the paper suggests institutionalization of SDI within a spatial data community as a unifying concept towards effectiveness and sustainability of SDI initiatives while recognizing their inherent complexities. Institutionalization is the process in which the SDI will gain an institutional (structural) role within the spatial data community in which it is embedded and consequently contributes to effective exchange, sharing, accessibility, and use of spatial data. The paper also discusses some operational conditions to this end.

AB The issues pertaining to human resource development (HRD) of professionals(1) in emerging/developing economies have not received sufficient attention in the literature. This is in spite of the strategic importance of the role of competent professionals in economic development. Using the construction industry in Tanzania as a case study, this study provides a review of the extent of the neglect of HRD for professionals in emerging/developing economies and what needs to be done to address the problem. In particular, it explores why there is no systematic integrated industry-wide training programme for professionals in the industry. It reveals that the existing programmes are fragmented and lack overall strategy and continuity, coordination and sustainable funding. The lack of sustainable funding is identified as the main obstacle to both the creation and sustainability of a training programme for professionals. To overcome this problem, the study suggests the establishment of an industry-specific training levy for professionals. But it warns that in an emerging/developing country environment there is the need to ensure that both the training programme and the administration of finance are not derailed by bureaucratic bottlenecks and other constraints, such as corruption. This study is of both organization and public policy relevance and, in additions, attempts to fill the gap (indicated above) in the HRD literature.

AB Household water treatment using sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) has been recognized as a cost-effective means of reducing the heavy burden of diarrhea and other waterborne diseases. especially among populations without access to improved water supplies. Sodium dichlorolsocyanurate (NaDCC) which is widely used in emergencies, is ail alternative source of chlorine that may present certain advantages over NaOCl for household-based interventions in development settings. We summarize the basic chemistry and possible benefits of NaDCC, and review the available literature concerning its safety and regulatory treatment and microbiological effectiveness. We review the evidence concerning NaDCC in field studies, including microbiological performance and health outcomes. Finally, we examine studies and data to compare NaDCC with NaOCl in terms of compliance, acceptability, affordability and sustainability, and suggest areas for further research.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. Wood has many applications and it is often in competition with other materials. Chipboard is the most common item of wood-based materials and it has attained the highest economical development in recent years. Relevant up-to-date environmental data are needed to allow the environmental comparison of wood with other materials. There are several examples of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) evaluations of some wood products and forest-technology systems, but no comprehensive Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data for particleboard manufacture is available in the literature. The main focus of this study is to generate a comprehensive LCI database for the manufacture of resin-bonded wood particleboards.
   Methods. In this work, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards and Ecoindicator 99 methodology were considered to quantify the potential environmental impact associated to the system under study. A Spanish factory considered representative of the 'state of art' was studied in detail. The system boundaries included all the activities taking place inside the factory as well as the activities associated with the production of the main chemicals used in the process, energy inputs and transport. All the data related to the inputs and outputs of the process were obtained by on-site measurements.
   Results and Discussion. LCI methodology was used for the quantification of the impacts of the particleboard manufacture. The inventory data of the three defined subsystems are described:
   Wood preparation: a comprehensive inventory of data including storage, debarking, particle production, storage and measurement of particles, drying and combustion of the bark for energy purposes.
   Board shaping: data related to particle classification, resin mixing, mattress formation and the pressing stage.
   Board finishing: cooling data, finishing, storage and distribution of the final product.
   The system was characterised with Ecoindicator 99 methodology (hierarchic version) in order to identify the 'hot spots'. Damage to Human Health was mainly produced by the subsystem of Board finishing. The subsystem of Board shaping was the most significant contributor to damage to the Ecosystem Quality and Resources.
   Conclusions. With the final aim of creating a database to identify and characterise the manufacture of particleboard, special attention was paid to the inventory analysis stage of the particleboard industry.
   A multicriteria approach was applied in order to define the most adequate use of wood wastes. Environmental, economic and social considerations strengthen the hypothesis that the use of forest residues in particleboard manufacture is more sustainable than their use as fuel.
   Recommendations and Outlook. In this work, particleboard was the product analysed, as it is one of the most common wood-based materials. Future work will focus on the study of another key wood board: Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF). Moreover, factors with strong geographical dependence, such as the electricity profile and final transport of the product, will be analysed. in addition, the definition of widespread functional unit to study the use of wood wastes at the end-of-life stage may be another issue Of Outstanding interest.

AB Piperazine- modified fatty amide (PMF) was prepared from N,N-bis(2 hydroxy ethyl) linseed oil fatty amide and piperazine through condensation polymerization. It was further cured with butylated melamine formaldehyde in different phr ( parts per hundred part of resin) (PMF-BMF). PMF and PMF-BMF systems were subjected to spectroscopic analysis to ascertain their structure and curing scheme. Thermal studies and curing behavior of these resins were carried out by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The physico-mechanical performance and chemical resistance of PMF-BMF coatings were evaluated by standard methods. The effect of BMF content and curing temperature ( ambient and elevated) on aforementioned coating properties was also investigated. It was found that PMF resin with 80 phr BMF cured at 120 degrees C showed the best performance among all compositions.

AB Two decades of awareness-raising and dialogues have clearly spelled out the water-related challenges the world is facing. Still, not enough concrete improvements have been realized on key issues, such as the coverage of potable water and sanitation Services, and an adequate balance between water for food and ecosystems. Addressing these problems remains a continuous challenge that can only be confronted with an integrated approach, comprising knowledge generation, permanent communication between very different stakeholders, adequate capacity-building and continuous learning, and innovative technology development. With a view to the Fourth World Water Forum in Mexico, this contribution reviews such issues, drawing lessons from experience in a program on Water for Food and Ecosystems (funded by Netherlands Partners for Water initiative) and related on-going work in this area carried out by Wageningen University and Research Centre working closely with partner institutions inside and outside the Netherlands. The debate is structured around three key dimensions (i) balancing human and natural values of water, (ii) multiple stakeholder involvement, (iii) technological innovation. Visualized in the Triangle of Sustainability, the study recognizes the advances made in integrating political processes such as multi-stakeholder negotiation in water resource management as a way of achieving a better balance between the values of water, but warn against neglecting the potential for technical advances that can help increasing the size of the 'cake' as a whole.

TI More sustainable participation? Multi-stakeholder platforms for
   integrated catchment management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper argues for realistic expectations of Multi-Stakeholder Platforms (MSPs). MSPs are currently a hot topic in the water policy community, despite voices of disillusionment with participation in development work. Research carried out in Peru, Argentina, India, South Africa and Belgium suggests that platforms certainly can prove helpful networks in communication on and management of competing claims to water, managing coordination problems, coalition-building and/or visioning. However, experience has put paid to implicit and explicit expectations front platforms, especially with a view to the integration of knowledge and actors. It makes no sense to separate distributive negotiation and politics ('bad') from integrative negotiation and social learning ('good'). Platforms mix both modalities of negotiation, and actors may strategically withhold or contribute their knowledge. Second, no significant power sharing (vertical inclusion) takes place. A typology of MSPs ranked by influence finds no platform with a significant mandate. It is suggested that MSPs are an institutional bargaining space that is especially useful for visioning and information exchange, but cautioned not to insist that 'water MSPs' confine themselves to water issues only, and to institutionalized groups only. For some stakeholders, the communication and information process itself is good enough, but others will want results: 'food on the table'. Some stakeholders will never join as they do not see how it benefits them and/or because they find it more advantageous to work around the platform. Initiators of platforms for stakeholder involvement in water management should therefore be very clear on what the participatory process aims at and can realistically achieve.

AB In regions where water is more scarce than land, the water productivity concept (e.g. crop yield per unit of water utilized) provides a useful framework to analyse crop production increase or water savings in irrigated agriculture. Generic crop and soil models were applied at field and regional scale, together with geographical and satellite data to analyse water productivity in Sirsa District (India). In this district certain parts show a serious decline in groundwater levels and water shortage, while other parts experience a serious rise of groundwater levels, causing waterlogging and salinization. The regional analysis showed a large spatial variability of water productivity, net groundwater recharge and salinization. Scenario analysis showed that improved crop husbandry, reallocation of canal waterfront fresh to saline groundwater areas and reduction of seepage losses in saline groundwater areas art, effective measures to increase the overall water productivity, and to attain sustainable irrigation in Sirsa District.

ID TAXATION
AB Between 1995 and 2001, the share of green tax revenues in the EU-15 GDP slightly declined. This is a surprising evolution but there are, however, strong economic efficiency arguments to set environmental taxes at low levels, and hence below the Pigovian or marginal pollution damage level. This paper presents an alternative to re-launch the debate on green tax reform in Europe; consumption taxes that are differentiated according to the environmental impact of products. Given the long tradition of consumption taxes in Europe, this instrument requires less institutional innovations than emission taxes. We show that a pragmatic classification of products in a sustainable and hence low VAT category can strongly limit the economic costs of the tax reform while the price reduction for green products can limit undesirable distributional consequences.

TI Biodiversity, traditional management systems, and cultural landscapes:
   examples from the boreal forest of Canada
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a relationship between biodiversity conservation and the cultural practices of indigenous and traditional peoples regarding land and resource use. To conserve biodiversity we need to understand how these Cultures interact with landscapes and shape them in ways that contribute to the continued renewal of ecosystems. This article examines the significance of traditional knowledge and management systems and their implications for biodiversity conservation. We start by introducing one key traditional ecological practice, succession management, in particular through the use of fire. We then turn to the example of the indigenous useof boreal forest ecosystems of northern Canada, with a focus on the Anishnaabe (Ojibwa) of northwestern Ontario. Their traditional practices and cultural landscapes provide temporal and spatial biodiversity, and examples of the mechanisms that conserve biodiversity. Learning from traditional systems is important for broadening conservation objectives that can accommodate the sustainable livelihoods of local people. The lens of cultural landscapes provides a mechanism to understand how multiple objectives (timber production, non-timber forest products, protected areas, tourism) are central to sustainable forest management in landscapes that conserve heritage values and support the livelihood needs of local people. The use of broader and more inclusive definitions of conservation and multiple, integrated objectives can help reconcile local livelihood needs and biodiversity conservation.

TI Environment and peoples in French Guiana: ambiguities in applying the
   laws of the French Republic
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB French Guiana is geographically part of Amazonia. It features a high degree of cultural diversity and it is integrated politically into France and Europe. For this reason it is subject to the same legislation as the rest of the French Republic. Locally, the diversity of the cultures and forms of knowledge results in different perceptions of sustainable management and the conservation of biodiversity. Now these questions are being raised at the worldwide level, they are as much a matter of the collective action of the State as of the individual consciousness of each citizen. In a multi-ethnic context they must in addition take account of the local communities, both to integrate their diverse experiences and to ensure their well-being. However, the way in which the rules decided upon in Paris are applied takes scanty account of the specificities of this overseas territory. Through various examples taken from matters concerned with the compulsory attribution of French citizenship and territorial planning, we will address the major environmental issues currently subject to disagreement: the maintenance of the traditional activities of the local forest-dwelling populations, the development of their knowledge and know-how, the sustainable development of inland communes, the management of protected areas, and even the project of creating a vast national park. Finally, avenues worth exploring will be proposed as a way to get out of this impasse.

TI Local products and geographical indications: taking account of local
   knowledge and biodiversity
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The debate and negotiations in progress at the international level concerning the protection of geographical indications (GI) are of direct interest to the local agricultural products and foodstuffs called terroir products. Beyond the protection of the use of their name, which is the founding principle of this system, and the legal and economic considerations this system implies, new questions are being raised about these products concerning the diversification of farming and sustainable development. More and more, and in a favourable context, another major issue is becoming apparent: the biological and cultural diversity linked to these products. This questioning concerns the status and the future of these local resources in our societies and whether or not GIs can help maintain this diversity. Protecting local and traditional products through the GI system can contribute to conserving biodiversity at various levels: domestic animal breeds, plant varieties, microbial ecosystems, and landscapes. This is also a way of maintaining in a formal way shared knowledge and practices, since they underpin the protected resource. Taking account of these elements offers an opportunity to think about agriculture differently and leads us to propose an innovative approach to local products. Several examples taken in France will help show how links can be established between the protection of GI, cultural biodiversity, and local knowledge.

TI Moken traditional knowledge: an unrecognised form of natural resources
   management and conservation
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This article presents the traditional knowledge of an ethnic group of sea nomads generally known in Thailand as Chao Lay. The Moken once led a nomadic marine life. They have developed their traditional knowledge and belief system over several centuries. This practical knowledge has been obtained through interaction with local ecosystems and from observation and experimentation in everyday life. The Moken have intimate knowledge relating to the sea and the forest, and they have elaborated boat-building skills and other technologies that allow them to make their living from the sea, coastal areas, and islands. This traditional knowledge and attendant practices represent a form of natural resources management and conservation. It comprises: 1) knowledge and skills that depend upon simple technologies that have minimal impact on the natural environment and its resources; 2) a nomadic life with frequent displacements that allow the Moken to rotate their foraging grounds and prevent overuse and degradation of specific areas; 3) knowledge about numerous forest and marine species - their characteristics, behaviour, habitats and eco-niches - which enables the Moken to make use of a diversity of local ecosystems; 4) a hunter-gatherer livelihood focusing primarily upon subsistence, with little accumulation of material goods, and finally 5) a philosophy and belief system that holds that natural resources are not individually owned, but rather are to be shared by everyone without restrictions on access. The sharing ethic is very strong in the Moken community and resources are shared not only with fellow humans but with supernatural beings as well. This system of traditional knowledge, know-how and representations has never been recognised nor respected. Rather than a form of natural resources management and conservation, it has been misinterpreted as part and parcel of a "primitive", underdeveloped, and materially poor livelihood. For mainstream society, development for the Moken necessarily requires the termination of their "primitive" life and the embracing of modernity. Through this pathway to development, however, the Moken are likely to lose their traditional knowledge and the sustainable livelihood that has ensured their physical and cultural well-being for centuries.

TI Conditions that influence the economic viability of ethanol from corn
   stover in the midwest the USA
SO INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Biomass feedstocks, such as corn fiber, corn stover, bagasse, and rice straw contain cellulose, which can be converted into ethanol. The supply and sustainability of cellulosic feedstock will depend on the agricultural production methods employed. Given the low density of biomass feedstocks, facilities need to be located near where the production of feedstocks occurs. The objectives of this research are to provide a methodology and estimates of the potential number of ethanol plants that can be established in the ten major corn producing states of the United States. Three major models were incorporated into the analysis to account for feedstock availability, plant size performance and plant location. The study showed that the number of feasible ethanol plants in each state could vary substantially based on the prices of ethanol and corn stover and plant size. The smaller plant size is much more sensitive to the prices of ethanol than is the larger plant. When considering ethanol at $1.35/gallon for a 2,000 MT/day plant, an estimated 72 plants would be constructed, but if the feedstock farm gate price increases by 30%, the number of plants declines to 68.

TI The challenge of linking research and practice
SO JOURNAL FOR RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This article discusses the challenge of improving the interrelationships between research and practice in mathematics education, and it outlines actions being taking to respond to that challenge. The need for improvement is bidirectional. The practice of classroom mathematics teaching needs to be better informed by an understanding of the implications of existing bodies of research, and researchers need to learn more from the insights and knowledge of practitioners. Building on its series of initiatives designed to use research to guide mathematics teaching and learning, NCTM has made a new commitment to a flexible, nimble, and sustainable initiative that will strengthen the bidirectional link between research and practice. This initiative includes the development of Research Analyses, Briefs, and Clips (ABCs), research syntheses designed through collaboration of teacher leaders and researchers to inform instructional leaders and policy-makers about research perspectives on critical issues of practice.

AB This paper studies the prospects for sustainable growth and economic development in Gabon, in the face of a severe decline in its main source of income and growth, i.e. oil. A simple Computable General Equilibrium model is used to simulate the development of the non-oil economy under various assumptions. The results of the simulations underline Gabon's dependence on foreign financing-especially private-and its vulnerability to variations in oil prices. The importance of adequate real exchange rate management is also underlined.

AB Identification of efficient animals in the postweaning growth phase for use in selection for improved feed efficiency is important to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of the beef cattle industry. Progeny testing using group-fed animals in commercial feedlots is the most common and practical method used to evaluate postweaning growth on large numbers of animals. We developed the Cornell Value Discovery System (CVDS) to dynamically predict growth rate, accumulated weight, days required to reach target body composition, carcass weight, and composition of individual beef cattle fed in group pens. Observed BW, ADG, BW at 28% empty body fat (EBF), breed type, environmental conditions, and dietary ME concentration are used by the CVDS to predict, for each animal in a pen, the feed DM required for maintenance (FFM), the feed DM required for gain, and the total DM required for maintenance and gain (DMR). The CVDS then computes DMR-to-ADG ratio (DMR:ADG), which is a feed conversion measure, and ADG-to-DMR ratio (ADG:DMR), which is a feed efficiency measure, for each animal. This study used the observed F:G ratio of 362 individually fed steers to evaluate CVDS-predicted indicators of feed efficiency and the Kleiber ratio. A subset of 37 data points was used to evaluate residual feed intake (RFI) as an indicator of feed efficiency. The database included 4 published studies, each with detailed individual animal description, environment, diet, and body composition information. The CVDS-predicted DMR:ADG accounted for 84% of the variation in the actual F:G ratio with a mean bias of 1.94% (P = 0.20). The predicted FFM to actual DMI ratio had a high correlation with actual ADG (R-2 = 0.76), and indicated a decay-type nonlinear dilution of FFM as ADG increased. The CVDS-predicted ADG:DMR and the Kleiber ratio had a significant (R-2 = 0.88) logarithmic relationship. In an analysis of a contemporary group within the database, RFI was highly correlated with the F:G ratio (r = 0.71). There was a positive relationship between RFI and EBF. The RFIM (DMI - DMR) was moderately correlated with DMI and ADG (0.37 and -0.38; respectively), suggesting that selecting for low RFIM would decrease DMI and increase ADG in this database. We conclude that the CVDS model can be used to identify differences in the F:G and G:F ratios by predicting DMR for individual growing cattle fed in groups.

SO JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS

DE Argentina; fiber; mobile-corral trap; mortality; wildlife use
AB Guanaco (Lama guanicoe) populations declined after the introduction of domestic sheep and the emerging conflicts with sheep breeders and their livestock. Apart from conflicts with sheep ranching, guanacos have declined due to poaching, legal overhunting, and lack of sound management schemes. Guanacos have been proposed as a key species for rural development in Latin America, so research oil tools for their sustainable use is required. We tested a mobile corral trap (MCT) designed for live-trapping and shearing free-ranging guanacos at four ranches along Patagonia. We assessed mortality and injury rates related to our procedures and calculated and compared roundup and capture efficiencies. We captured a total of 55 guanacos (13 females, 38 males, and 4 calves), and live-sheared 30. No mortalities were recorded. Average roundup and capture efficiencies were 11.9 guanacos roundup(-1) (range 8-20) and 11% (range 0.3-31.5%), respectively. Mean fleece weight was 307 +/- 15 g for females and 338 +/- 12 g for males. The MCT employed seems promising for capturing and shearing free-ranging guanacos for their sustainable use. Management implications include: (1) sheep ranches may obtain benefits, generating a positive perception toward guanacos; (2) guanaco populations may increase and even colonize devoid areas due to an increased protection level.

AB Sheep herd sustainability in Patagonia is limited by reproductive efficiency. As the herds graze on natural vegetation year round, efficiency is constrained by biophysical factors. Our aim was to characterize the environmental controls over effective lambing rate in northwest Patagonia. We related remotely sensed data [surf ice temperatures and Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a surrogate for forage availability] and climatic information to lambing rates. A spatial model explained 63% of the variability in mean lambing rate, based on mean annual NDVI and mean spring surface temperature. The relative inter-annual variability in lambing rates was of similar magnitude to that of annual NDVI. Both lambing rate and NDVI were less variable than climatic factors. Two regional temporal models explained approximately 25% of the variability, based on NDVI values representative of ewes' nutrition during late gestation and lambing. These models predicted, with 65% and 76% accuracy respectively, the occurrence of better-than-average and worse-than-average yearly lambing rates. These results provided insights into the factors limiting reproduction, and they form the basis for important decision tools for ranch managers. Prediction of lambing rates based on remotely sensed data will reduce the uncertainty and risk in sheep production, increasing the economic sustainability of sheep production. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Aim: The Brazilian Atlantic forest covers c. 10% of its original extent, and some areas are still being logged. Although several ecological studies in Atlantic forest have been published over the past two to three decades, there has been little research on forest dynamics and there is a particular lack of information on the effects of disturbance. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of selective logging on forest structure, floristic composition soil nutrients, litterfall and litter layer in a seasonally dry Atlantic forest.
   Location: The Mata do Carvao is located in the Guaxindiba Ecological Reserve in Sao Francisco do ltabapoana district (21 degrees 24' S, 41 degrees 04' W), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Methods: Four plots (50 x 50 m) were set up in 1995 in each of two stands: unlogged and logged. In each plot, all trees >= 10 cm d.b.h. were enumerated, identified and measured. Vouchers were lodged at UENF Herbarium. Five surface soil samples were collected in each plot in the dry season (in October 1995). Litterfall was collected in eight traps (0.50 m(2)) in each plot over a year from 14 November 1995 to 11 November 1996. The litter layer was sampled in eight quadrats (0.25 m(2)) in each plot in the dry and wet seasons. Soils were air-dried, sieved, and chemically analysed. The litter was dried (80 degrees C), sorted into six fractions, weighed and bulked samples analysed for nutrients.
   Results: Forest stands did not differ in stem density and total basal area, with a total of 1137 individuals sampled in 1996 (564 unlogged and 573 logged), and a total basal area of 15 m(2) (unlogged) and 13.0 m(2) (logged). However, unlogged stands had more large trees (>= 30 cm in d.b.h.) and greater mean canopy height. Among the families, Rutaceae and Leguminosae were the most abundant families in both sites, although the Rutaceae had a higher density in unlogged and Leguminosae in the logged stand. The species diversity index was similar between stands. Late-successional species, such as Metrodorea nigra var. brevifolia and Paratecoma peroba, were less abundant in the logged stand. Selective logging did not affect nutrient concentrations in the soil or in the litter. However, quantities of the nutrients in the total litterfall and in the leaf litterfall and litter layer were higher in unlogged than in logged stands, mainly as a result of fallen M. nigra leaves. Metrodorea nigra was considered a key species in the nutrients dynamics in Carvao forest.
   Main conclusions: Despite the fact that effects on tree diversity and soil nutrients were not clear, selective logging in this Atlantic forest altered canopy structure, increased the relative abundance of some early-secondary species and decreased the litter input and stock of nutrients. Detailed information on the influence of logging on the distribution and structure of plant populations and in nutrient processes is fundamental for a sustainable logging system to be developed.

AB In this work, we consider a logistic fishery model and discuss the selective impulsive harvesting of fish above a certain age or size by incorporating a time delay in the impulsive harvesting term. It is proved that there exists an asymptotically stable positive periodic solution x*(l1) (t) when the catchability coefficient h is less than some critical value h*(l). It is concluded that h*(l) and x*(l1), are increasing with respect to l. Simulations shows that the delayed harvesting is advantageous to the sustainability of the population.

   Central America? A case study on coffee
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH

DT Article
DE coffee; sustainable production; economics; Central America
AB In order to alleviate the impacts of the low coffee prices in recent years, sustainable coffee production and certification have been a logical strategy for many producers to: a) differentiate their product in the market place; and, b) shift their production cost structure away from more input intensive techniques. This paper explores the two most widely recognized certification schemes (organic and "fairtrade") to determine whether certification to these systems is actually benefiting producers. It then explores the principal differences in production costs and price premiums for the two systems and their effect on different categories of producers. Finally, it considers the dynamics of the conventional and sustainable coffee markets to assess the likely medium to long-term economic outlook for producers involved in the certification schemes. The research is based on a combination of published sources and detailed primary source data (interviews and surveys) gathered by the CIMS Foundation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Cancer is a leading cause of mortality in the US Associated Pacific Island Nations (USA PIN) due to few resources for prevention, screening, and treatment. Methods. We describe the formation of the Pacific Cancer Initiative (PCI), and the Cancer Council of the Pacific Islands (CCPI) to address the rising cancer burden in USAPIN. Since their inception, PCI and CCPI have conducted cancer needs assessments, developed strategic cancer plans, and acquired additional cancer program funding for USAPIN. Results. We emphasize the importance of international/regional partnerships and participatory development in assuring sustainability of cancer programs in USAPIN. Conclusions. The USAPIN speak with a unified voice.

DE concrete construction; frames; framed structures; performance
   characteristics
AB Despite its enormous potential to improve performance, hybrid concrete construction (HCC) is currently underutilized. To demonstrate the benefits of using HCC (sometimes referred to as "mixed" construction) within the industry, it is essential that transparent criteria to assess this structural frame type against alternatives be determined, defined, and evaluated. Following a thorough review of literature in the building performance domain, a survey of U.K. experienced practitioners including clients, engineers, architects, quantity surveyors, and main contractors was conducted to obtain their perceptions regarding the importance of structural frame performance criteria (SFPC). A factor analysis of SFPC revealed seven dimensions, interpreted as "physical form and space," "construction process," "long-term sustainability..... establishing confidence," "building impact..... physical appearance," and "client satisfaction." These dimensions should improve the decision making process when selecting an appropriate structural frame during early project stages by providing a simple list of performance criteria to be considered. Although these SFPC and dimensions were originally developed to ensure that the benefits of using HCC were apparent during the frame selection process, they are equally applicable to all frame choice comparisons. As such, they may provide a valuable tool for ensuring added value and client satisfaction.

AB Empirical analyses of labor tax and public debt processes provide prima facie evidence for imperfect government insurance. This paper considers a model in which the government's inability to commit to future policies or to report truthfully its spending needs renders government debt markets endogenously incomplete. A method for solving for optimal fiscal policy under these constraints is developed. Such policy is found to be intermediate between that implied by the complete insurance (Ramsey) model and a model with exogenously incomplete debt markets. In contrast to optimal Ramsey policy, optimal policy in this model is consistent with a variety of stylized fiscal policy facts such as the high persistence of labor tax rates and debt levels and the positive covariance between government spending and the value of government debt sales.

AB Because organic N fertilizers must be mineralized before they become plant-available, application designs should consider time and temperature effects on N release as well as crop N requirements. This study presents deterministic (DOpt) and stochastic (SOpt) linear optimization models to determine sustainable land application schedules. The easily solved models minimize the amount of N that is applied while assuring than crop N demands are met as they develop. Temperature effects on N mineralization were included by using the Arrhenius equation to create a temperature-adjusted time series. Uncertainties associated with mineralization rates and the temperature-adjustment (Q(10)) factor are considered by SOpt. Examples are presented for a summer maize (Zea mays L.) and winter triticale (Triticum aestivum L. x Secale cereale L.) rotation operated by a hypothetical dairy operation in Stanislaus County, California. Monte Carlo simulations were used to test the models. A closed-form solution for estimating the time until steady state is presented and steady-state conditions were reached within 7 yr after applications were initiated. Because of temperature effects, DOpt solutions were 12% greater during the winter and 29% lower during the summer than a reference approach that applied liquid manure at 130% of the crop N demand. Stochastic linear optimization values were 1.7% greater than DOpt values in the summer and 6.2% greater in the winter. Surplus N estimates from Monte Carlo simulations averaged 104 kg ha(-1) for DOpt and 126 ka ha(-1)for SOpt, but SOpt was much less likely to result in crop N deficits. Linear optimization is a viable tool for scheduling organic N applications.

TI Effects of the freshwater aquarium trade on wild fish populations in

AB Base-line data were collected to examine the possible effects of the aquarium trade on Amazon fish populations in differentially-fished locations in the Departmento of Loreto, Peru. Fish abundance, species diversity (richness) and biomass were quantified at three locations with differential fishing pressure, including the Rio Nanay (high pressure), Rio Apayacu and Rio Arambassa (medium) and Rio Yanayacu-Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve (low). Seining results indicated that the location with the highest fishing pressure had reduced fish abundance, species diversity and biomass compared to the other locations. A similar trend was seen using minnow traps. There was no significant difference in abundance, diversity and biomass between the medium and low fishing pressure locations. Habitat differences (pH and conductivity) among the three locations accounted for < 13% of the observed variation, and thus it seemed possible that some of the decline in the Rio Nanay location could be tentatively attributed to increased fishing pressure. Although effects of pollution and habitat alteration could not be ruled out, this is one of the first studies to provide quantitative data on the effect of the freshwater aquarium trade on wild fish populations. While results suggest success in the protection of fishes for the aquarium trade in Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, it also may be sustainable to establish limited levels of fishing, as was found in the medium fishing pressure locations, in order to promote economic opportunities and incentives for habitat preservation for indigenous communities.

AB Iodine, vitamin A, and iron deficiencies are important public health problems in developing countries and often coexist in vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women and young children. Food fortification can be a sustainable, cost-effective strategy to combat these deficiencies. In remote, rural areas of subsistence farming, salt may be 1 of few regularly purchased food items and is therefore likely to be a good food vehicle for fortification. However, fortification of salt is challenging due to the white color and highly reactive impurities, and added micronutrients often cause color changes. Encapsulation may prevent or reduce these reactions. Potassium iodate, retinyl palmitate, and ferric pyrophosphate were microencapsulated in hydrogenated palm fat by spray cooling. The size and morphology of the sprayed microparticles and losses of iodine and vitamin A during spraying were analyzed. The microcapsules were added to local salt in Morocco. During storage for 6 mo, color change in the triple fortified salt (TFS) was acceptable, and iodine losses were approximately 20% comparable to the iodized salt (IS). Stability of retinyl palmitate was excellent, resulting in losses of only about 12% after 6 mo of storage. Sensory tests were performed with typical Moroccan dishes cooked with either TFS or IS by triangle testing. No sensory difference was detectable, and overall acceptability of the salt was good. Encapsulation by spray cooling produces highly stable microcapsules containing iodine, vitamin A, and iron for salt fortification in Africa. Such capsules may also be used to fortify other dry matrices (for example, sugar, flour).

AB The aim of this retrospective study was to compare results and five-year surgical outcome of laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) in patients younger than 65 years and elderly patients aged 65 years or older. From january 1992 to December 1998, 2684 patients underwent LARS in 31 surgical units; 369 elderly patients (group 1) were compared with 2315 younger patients (group 2). Elderly patients have a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score (mean, 2.38 versus 1.98). The conversion rate was higher in group 1 (10.2%, n = 38 versus 6.1%, n = 142), as was the morbidity rate (7.6% in group 1 versus 4.5% in group 2). Mean hospital stay was longer for group 1 (7.6 +/- 5.6 days versus 5.9 +/- 2.8 days). Functional evaluation was excellent in both groups (91-93%) at 3 months and 2 and 5 years. LARS in the elderly is a safe and efficient procedure. Good results appear to be sustainable in the long term.

TI The rapid growth of Egypt's agricultural output, 1890-1914, as an early
   example of the green revolutions of modern South Asia: some implications
   for the writing of global history
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB The article uses comparative Indian material from British India and, later, the Pakistani Punjab to ask new questions of the standard accounts of Egypt's post-1890 cotton boom. It also argues for the particular relevance of the rich Punjabi green revolution data to the Egyptian case, and more generally, for the rewards to be obtained from an academic dialog between selected aspects of late nineteenth and of late twentieth century globalization. Topics analyzed include the impact of the various agricultural revolutions on social and regional inequalities, the issue of sustainability, the role of experts and the impact on health of long-term environmental degradation.

TI SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGIES FOR OVERVIEW OF PROTOTYPE GREEN-BUILT HOUSE
   DESIGN
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB Guy Architects, Ltd. reviewed the ways in which green technologies could be incorporated into the general housing market. The following is a review of sustainable technologies we considered for incorporation in to a prototype housing design. The litmus test for the selections of systems included the following:
   Are the systems easy to maintain?
   Are the materials durable and the layouts flexible?
   Does the design have curb appeal to attract a broad range of homeowners?
   Does the design encourage a more widespread use of Green Design principals in the construction sector?
   Does the design use familiar off-the-she technology?
   The prototype was designed for southern Canada where farms and industry are available to provide the materials needed for the unite mass production. The design incorporates long-lasting materials to extend the building life to an estimated 80 years. By doing this, the house could provide multi-generation abodes for families, while amortising the initial cost of the unit over a longer period of time. The flexible plan has dynamic spaces, which can accommodate a variety of lot orientations. We anticipate that the unite construction cost would be between $200K and $300K depending on the configuration.

TI USING LIFE CYCLE COSTING AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO "SELL" GREEN
   BUILDING FEATURES
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB The title, and basic theme, of this article probably will raise the ire of many design professionals. We all know and preach that sustainable design requires an integrated design approach, and that the design works together as a whole. A sustainably-designed building cannot be cut back in piecemeal fashion and expected to provide the benefits for which it is touted. However, as design professionals we know and experience regularly the wrenching effects of last-minute Value Engineering (VE) efforts undertaken to bring a project back to within an Owner stated budget. During the typical VE exercises, the Owner looks at (supposed discrete) elements of the design and appraises each for its "cost effectiveness." The Owner scans down the line items on the Bid Tabulation (or latest design cost estimate) and asks "Where can I save money?" His perspective is that of someone ordering off an la carte menu. The bottom line is simply the sum of all the elements. Ensuing discussions of the "integrated design" and how it cannot be "violated" usually end up with the Own er glazed-over look, and his ultimate response, again, comes forward: "Where can I save money?" This pap er describes how a little basic sensitivity analysis can be used to show the appropriateness of the original design and can stave off the often ravaging effects of the typical VE process. It also shows that such sensitivity analysis is necessary if on e is to obtain a good understanding of the design options available and the relative merit of each.
   First, lets review with basic tools of sustainable Design: (a) Building Energy Simulation (BES) using computer modeling and (b) Life Cycle Costing (LCC) techniques. These are basic to any Sustainable Design Professional "tool kit." We will also see how the two of these are used in conjunction with each other to create a BES/LCC model that allows one to quantify design decisions. Owners are not familiar with BES, LCC, or the combination of these into a BES/LCC model, certainly not to the degree that design professionals are. Owners need to be educated in all these areas so that they can be made aware of the value of green design.

TI THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE 4C'S BUILDING
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB The Haliburton 4C's Food Bank and Thrift Store building, shown in Figure 1, was designed and built in June through August 2005. The structure combines an impressive variety of sustainable design options, while meeting specific functional and financial goals. The vision for the building was for it to serve as a working food bank and thrift store, while being a demonstration of the applicability of various alternative building materials and design options for a public building located in a very "traditional" neighbourhood.
   The Haliburton 4C's (Christian Concern Community Centre) is a non-profit, charitable collaboration of four Haliburton Churches that work to provide food and second-hand clothing for members of the community who require moderate support. The food bank and the Lily Ann second-hand clothing store are the two main components of the operation, with the clothing store providing funding for the food bank. A partnership was created between the 4C's and the Sustainable Building Design & Construction Program of Sir Sandford Fleming College. The goal was to create a cost-effective and sustainable home for the Haliburton 4C's group.
   The use of alternative building materials and design techniques has traditionally been limited to private residences, with public use restricted to a small number of projects utilizing only a few of the many sustainable building options available. The reason for this is a general lack of knowledge in the area of sustainable design and construction, and a false belief that sustainable construction leads to a structure that is not aesthetically pleasing, and has limited functionality. One goal of the 4C's project was to showcase sustainable building in a public structure, and thus to dispel the negative perceptions that may exist regarding alternative building. This goal was achieved in conjunction with the needs of the Haliburton 4C's group, and the requirements of the Sir Sandford Fleming Sustainable Building Design and Construction Program.
   In this paper, the conceptual design for the building is outlined, with an emphasis on describing the sustainable and unique wall design, which included the use of hemp bale construction, earthen plasters, and an earthbag stacked footing. In order to obtain building code approval, testing of the proposed wall system was required. This was carried out at Queen University in Kingston, Ontario. Further testing was carried out to better understand the structural performance of some of the materials used in the building design.

TI INTEGRATED SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAICS FOR BUILDINGS
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB Photovoltaic (solar) cells (Corkish 2004) are semiconductor devices that directly create electric current and voltage from the collection of photons (quanta of light). They convert sunlight to electricity silently and without moving parts, require little maintenance, are reliable, are being sold with warranties of tip to twenty-five years, generate no greenhouse gases in operation, and are modular, rapidly deployable and particularly suited to urban rooftops, facades, and similar applications. Hence, they are easily located close to where electricity is consumed.
   Solar cells of 15% efficiency covering an area equivalent to just 0.25% of the global area under crops and permanent pasture could meet all the worlds primary energy requirements today (Archer and Hill 2001), yet most or all of that area could be otherwise alienated land, such as on buildings, for example. "On any given day, the solar energy falling on a typical oilfield in the Middle East is far greater than the energy contained in the oil extracted from it." (CarbonFree 2006).
   However, solar cells remain an expensive option for most power generation requirements, relative to fossil and nuclear sources, especially if the natural environment is attributed little or no value, and relative to some other sustainable options, such as the enhancement of energy efficiency, solar thermal (e.g., solar water heating) or wind energy. Photovoltaics are synergistic with efficiency enhancement and solar thermal use and are usually more easily applied in urban situations than are wind turbines.
   Here, we aim to acquaint practising architects, builders, and engineers with the fundamentals of solar photovoltaic energy production and devices and building-related applications (Green 1995; Wenham et al. 2006; Prasad & Snow 2005; Strong et al 2005; Sick 1996).

TI GREEN CONSTRUCTION: CONTRACTOR MOTIVATION AND TRENDS IN AUSTIN, TEXAS
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
DE green builders; green building programs; sustainable development
AB The purpose of this paper is to describe and assess one of the first comprehensive residential green-builder programs in the U.S. It compares trends of items used in residential construction during the past five years and reports why participating builders chose to incorporate specific items and their level of commitment to the program. This description provides a baseline of strategies to investigate the effect of this program in developing sustainable communities. The builder study population was derived from a database of registered "green" residences built during 1998-2002 in greater Austin, Texas (2,335 homes and 73 listed builders). Almost half the builders constructed just one "green" home, whereas two builders built almost 75% of the green homes during the 5-year study period. Less than 1% of the homes received a perfect 5-star rating, whereas 87% were rated I or 2 stars. The frequency of implementing the 122 green features were compared over time and analyzed for correlation with cost and their associated star-value. Cost was the primary factor determining item use frequency. Participating builders generally concurred that the program was successful and beneficial to homeowners but that the additional work required for participation provided little financial reward for builders. While much can be done with low-cost interventions to reduce the negative environmental impacts of residential construction, builder participation may be enhanced by promotion of some of the higher cost features. In addition, public education about the long-term benefits of green homes is needed to increase homeowner participation, and encourage builders to incorporate more environmentally friendly features in the homes they construct.

TI SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES OF FUNCTIONALLY OBSOLETE BRIDGES
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING

DT Article
DE bridges; management; sustainability
AB Interest in long-term durability and sustainability of bridges has challenged the development of modern bridge management. The structural condition and performance of bridges have drawn much economic and engineering attention. In comparison, the effective functionality of bridges is another major sustainability concern, affecting their safety, mobility, and life span. To reach cost-effective planning and systematic management, consideration of functionally obsolete bridges is essential This article discusses the critical aspects of evaluation, traffic mobility, and congestion cost of functionally obsolete bridges. A methodology was developed for bridge functional obsolescence evaluation. Actual bridge inventory and conditions databases were studied to compile practical data that generates focused insight for decision-making. A forecast was developed to predict the number of functionally obsolete bridges in the future. Practical cost components of traffic congestion were discussed to facilitate consideration of better original design and construction versus reassignment design and work. The resulting study is practical for transportation agencies, offlcials, and researchers to support sustainable bridges by planning financial resources, management policies and strategies, design methods, and implementation practices.

ID STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR
AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of self-cementing fly ashes derived from combustion of subbituminous coal at electric power plants for stabilization of soft fine-grained soils. California bearing ratio (CBR) and resilient modulus (M-r) tests were conducted on mixtures prepared with seven soft fine-grained soils (six inorganic soils and one organic soil) and four fly ashes. The soils were selected to represent a relatively broad range of plasticity, with plasticity indices ranging between 15 and 38. Two of the fly ashes are high quality Class C ashes (per ASTM C 618) that are normally used in Portland cement concrete. The other ashes are off-specification ashes, meaning they do not meet the Class C or Class F criteria in ASTM C 618. Tests were conducted on soils and soil-fly ash mixtures prepared at optimum water content (a standardized condition), 7% wet of optimum water content (representative of the typical in situ condition in Wisconsin), and 9-18% wet of optimum water content (representative of a very wet in situ condition). Addition of fly ash resulted in appreciable increases in the CBR and M-r of the inorganic soils. For water contents 7% wet of optimum, CBRs of the soils alone ranged between 1 and 5. Addition of 10% fly ash resulted in CBRs ranging between 8 and 17 and 18% fly ash resulted in CBRs between 15 and 31. Similarly, M-r of the soil alone ranged between 3 and 15 MPa at 7% wet of optimum, whereas addition of 10% fly ash resulted in M-7 between 12 and 60 MPa and 18% fly ash resulted in M, between 51 and 106 MPa. In contrast, except for one fly ash, addition of fly ash generally had little effect on CBR or M, of the organic soil.

AB In order to establish a sustainable society, with practical material recycling, it is appropriate to focus on a range of guiding "Earth Principles", including the character and application of hydrothermal processes. In this paper, it is demonstrated that information obtained from the study of fundamental Earth Principles can be used to inspire the development of new methods for material recycling, such as the following:
   (1) Hydrothermal hot-pressing processes, simulating the formation of sedimentary rock sequences, can be used for the solidification of toxic and hazardous materials.
   (2) Organic materials could be formed from CO2 under hydrothermal conditions (using Fe and Ni metals, and low valence Fe oxides), at temperature and pressure conditions consistent with a subduction (tectonic) setting, such as (under Japan) where the Pacific Plate sinks beneath the (Eurasian) continental plate.
   (3) Diamond-structured carbon may be formed from toxic chlorinated hydrocarbon, in very high pressure regions of the Earth, and at high alkaline hydrothermal conditions, where magma formation may occur.
   (4) High temperature dry steam in rock fractures (at near critical conditions - i.e. below saturated vapor pressure, but relatively high pressure) is not only a source/carrier of noble metals, including gold, silver and copper, but also ceramic materials, silica and alumina. Its laboratory simulation may also be a guide for the formation of thin layer silicate ceramics on metal plates (e.g. SUS-304 nickel alloy).
   (5) To design an underground boiler in hot dry rock, non-equilibrium dissolution and deposition hydrothermal processes may be studied using a tube reactor, which simulates fluid flow and temperature gradients in fractured hot rock. (c) 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

ID GROWTH; MARKETS; INTERMEDIATION
AB This paper presents a model of financial and economic development which assumes the consumption of real resources by the financial sector. Financial development occurs endogenously as the economy reaches a critical threshold of economic development. Compared to financial autarky, financial intermediaries allocate savings, net of their costs of operation, to more productive investments. Whenever the technology financed by intermediaries is more capital-intensive than that operated in financial autarky, the growth effect of financial development is ambiguous. As a result, financial development may be unsustainable. However, when financial development is sustainable, the credit market becomes more competitive and more efficient over time, and this could eventually contribute to economic growth. Nonetheless, given monopolistic competition in the financial sector, the level of entry into the credit market is generally inefficient. For instance, with diminishing returns to specialisation, entrants might be too few at the early stages of economic development and too many later on. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To design and pilot a questionnaire for assessing youth attitudes about the food system.
   Design: Nutrition educators provided important topics for food system education through a survey using the Delphi method. The resulting questionnaire of attitude scales was piloted with high school students.
   Setting: The Delphi Survey of nutrition educators was conducted through the mail and electronically. A paper and pencil questionnaire was administered to high school Students in Family and Consumer Science classes.
   Participants: Delphi participants were members of the Society for Nutrition Education's Division of Sustainable Food Systems. A convenience sample of high school Students completed the pilot questionnaire.
   Variables Measured: Scales measured attitudes about farmland protection, participation in the local food system, hunger in the United States, organic agriculture, and environmental issues related to food.
   Analysis: Factor analysis was used to identify constructs. The internal consistency of each resulting scale was assessed using Cronbach's alpha.
   Results: Reliability of attitude scales ranged from .59 to .73.
   Conclusions and Implications: Attitude scales were created for the purpose of assessing Youth thoughts and beliefs about the local or regional food system. Such assessments can serve as a starting point for food system educators interested in developing effective Curricula on food system topics.

TI International linkages and environmental sustainability: The
   effectiveness of the regime network
SO JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CENTRALITY; DEMOCRACY; TRADE
AB While the literature on environmental regime effectiveness has focused on particular regimes considered in isolation, the overall effects of the system of regimes are more relevant. First, regimes are connected because they often share institutional architecture, deal with different aspects of the same problem, frame issues using similar legal and policy principles, and are subject to attempts to coordinate across issues by groups of nations, NGOs and international agencies. Thus, the network of regimes has social capital that can be applied to particular issues. Second, owing to ecological interconnectedness, regimes can have both positive and negative side-effects on environmental issues that they do not explicitly deal with. Allowing for political interconnectedness using concepts drawn from social network theory and for ecological interconnectedness using broad measures of sustainability, this article argues that nations more central to the network of environmental regimes should score higher on measures of sustainability. This is because the social capital in the regime network can more easily be brought to bear on centrally placed nations to make them cooperate and because they are more likely to be aware of negative regime side-effects. Measures of network centrality do, indeed, positively impact on nations' performance on four sustainability indicators. The analysis also finds that a nation's position in the general international system further positively impacts on its sustainability scores. This leads to the suggestion that the environmental regime network is supported by social capital in more general international networks.

AB Since the 1960s, one of the great strengths of social history has been its willingness to respond to contemporary concerns. However, as environmental issues have pushed their way to the top of the global political agenda, social historians have been slow to meet this new challenge. This paper examines reasons for this reluctance and, more importantly, explores the opportunities for integrating social and environmental history. It is divided into three main parts. The first section deals with the failure of social history to strike up a dialogue with environmental history. Section two aims to show that social and environmental history are basically compatible and complementary fields, and argues for increased collaboration by making human-environment relations a key theme for future research. Drawing on studies-both rural and urban-that have begun to establish common ground between the two fields, section three outlines new areas for investigation, including: the interconnections between social inequality and environmental degradation; environments and identities; and consumption and the environment. By focusing attention on how ordinary people interacted with their environments in the past, social historians could make a significant contribution to current discussions about a sustainable future.

AB The presence of crop residue is an important component of dryland cropping systems management in the semiarid environment where soil erosion by wind is a major soil degradation process. Residue also affects precipitation capture and runoff. Long-term residue quantity dynamics of different cropping systems has not been studied in the semi-arid environment of the western Great Plains. Long-term studies were conducted to determine the interaction of no-till cropping systems, soils, and climatic gradient on the production, retention, and disappearance of crop residue over a 12-year period. The cropping systems evaluated were winter wheat (Triticum aestivum)-summer fallow (WF), winter wheat-corn (Zea Mays) or sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)summer fallow (WC/SF), winter wheat-corn/sorghum-millet (Panicum miliaceum) -summer fallow (WC/SMF), and continuous cropping (CC). A soil surface residue base was achieved in a few years (four to five) and changed little over time. However, as cropping intensity increased the total crop residue retained on the soil surface increased as the proportion of fallow time decreased; a general trend was for residue levels to increase slowly. However, in the winter wheat-summer fallow system residue levels showed a trend to decrease after the initial base was achieved. Greater residue production and retention occurred on the toeslope soil position because these soils are deeper, have greater water holding capacity, and receive run-on water from upslope positions. Residue disappearance was less in the fallow period before corn planting compared to before wheat planting due to the greater fallow period, which included summer fallow in the wheat system. Residue loss was greater during the crop production periods as compared to the fallow periods. The levels of residue present on the soil surface in our intensive no-till cropping systems were generally adequate to control erosion by wind. However, at our high potential evapotranspiration site the residue levels were "marginal" for adequate wind erosion abatement, particularly in the winter wheat-summer fallow system. A combination of no-till management and increased cropping intensity (greater than winter wheat-summer fallow) is the key to sustainable production and soil conservation in this semiarid environment.

AB Background. The authors conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a biopsychosocial intervention for patients who were at high risk (HR) of progressing from acute to chronic temporomandibular disorder (TMD)-related pain.
   Methods. The authors classified subjects' risk using a predictive algorithm and randomized them into an early-intervention (EI) or a nonintervention (NI) group. The EI included cognitive behavioral skills training and biofeedback. The authors assessed pain and psychosocial measures at intake and at a one-year follow-up. Subjects' self-reported pain levels were measured on an analog scale and as a response to palpation.
   Results. At one year, El-group subjects had significantly lower levels of self-reported pain and depression. At one year, more NI-group subjects than EI-group subjects had utilized health care for jaw-related pain. NI-group subjects were 12.5 times as likely to have a somatoform disorder, more than seven times as likely to have an anxiety disorder, and 2.7 times more likely to have an affective disorder at one year, compared with EI-group subjects.
   Conclusions. EI-group subjects had reduced pain levels, improved coping abilities and reduced emotional distress at one year.
   Clinical Implications. The TMD-related pain experience is complex and requires early identification with a biopsychosocial EI to achieve maximal, sustainable results.

ID BRADEN-SCALE; QUALITY; PREVENTION
AB Objective: Quality improvement (QI) processes in nursing homes are highly variable and often ineffective. This study evaluated an innovative QI process to reduce pressure ulcers (PUs) in a nursing home with a high rate of PUs.
   Design: This was a 48-week, longitudinal study comparing the incidence of PUs during 12-week baseline and intervention and post-intervention periods.
   Setting: Not-for-profit, 136-bed nursing home in urban Western Pennsylvania.
   Patients or Other Participants: All residents and all staff at the nursing home participated in this study.
   Interventions: The intervention consisted of 3 components: Ability enhancement, incentivization, and management feedback. To enhance ability, all staff members completed a computer-based interactive video education program on PU prevention and were mandated to use penlights to promote early detection. Incentivization included $75 for each staff member if the desired reduction in PU incidence was achieved. Management feedback provided real-time information of staff"s adherence to the mandated training.
   Main Outcome Measures: Outcome measures consisted of staff's adherence to mandated training and the incidence of new PUs during the baseline period compared to the intervention and post-intervention periods.
   Results: Management responded to noncompliance with training with both rewards and stepped discipline. Adherence to protocol, as measured by training compliance, was 100%. There was a significant reduction (P < .05) in the incidence of stage 2 or worse PUs during the intervention period. During the post-intervention periods, the effect was lost.
   Conclusion: An innovative QI initiative resulted in a significant decrease in PUs in 1 facility. This intervention was not sustainable when the 3 components of the QI intervention were no longer actively maintained.

ID VACANT
AB During redevelopment, dilapidated and obsolete buildings must often be removed to make way for new construction. One way to achieve this is through deconstruction, selectively disassembling buildings rather than demolishing them mechanically. This approach can yield new jobs, workforce skills training, and small business development, and can conserve natural resources. Thus deconstruction may meet the goals of sustainability by making optimal use of existing economic, physical, and social resources. In this article, we consider existing and potential policies that support the use of deconstruction in redevelopment projects.

AB The purpose of this paper is to analyze the international development of the low cost airline model. The paper examines and seeks to characterize the factors which have encouraged and inhibited the spatial and temporal spread of low cost carriers. A typology of low cost carriers is developed to illustrate the diversity of practices identifiable under the generic low cost banner. The authors of this paper identify stages of development with respect to time and compare the development of low cost operations in different countries of the world. The economic and political impacts of the spread of the low cost model are examined and the sustainability and future patterns of growth considered. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We consider the hold-up problem between a foreign direct investor and the government(s) in a host country with weak governmental structure and lack of power to commit. Using "Nash threats," we show that an efficient investment level can be sustained for a sufficiently high discount factor and ask whether a vertically disintegrated government structure makes collusion more or less sustainable. We show that collusion between the government and the investor is easier to sustain if the host country is vertically more integrated. or if the different vertical layers of government can commit to fixed tax-sharing rules.

TI Case study: Design and operation of sustainable urban infiltration ponds

SO JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT

ID CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; DRAINAGE; QUALITY
AB Combined wetlands and infiltration ponds are cost-effective 'end of pipe' drainage solutions that can be applied for local source control as part of urban development and regeneration. The aims of this case study were to assess constraints associated with the planning, design, and operation of these ponds, the influence of aquatic plants on infiltration rates, and the water treatment potential. Storm runoff was first stored and treated in a constructed wetland before it overflowed into parallel infiltration ponds of which one was planted and the other one was unplanted. Three international best management practice design guidelines failed in practice. The presence of macrophytes in one infiltration pond had no significant influence on the drainage properties. The water quality of both ponds was not acceptable for water reuse directly after the system setup. Filamentous green algae within the unplanted pond were blooming in spring and summer creating an aesthetically unpleasing pond surface area. After I year of operation, barley straw and Carassius auratus (common goldfish) were introduced successfully to control the growth of algae.

AB A research project was conducted to manufacture eco-cement for sustainable development using cement kiln dust (CKD) and granular blast furnace slag (GBFS). In the project, the burning process and mineral compositions of CKD clinker were investigated. Different mineralizer such as CaSO4 and CaF2, sulfur and alkali content were considered. The strength of CKD and GBFS eco-cement were evaluated. The results indicate the CKD clinker can not only form ordinary cement clinker minerals such as C3S, C2S and C(4)AF, but also form such high-reactive minerals as C(4)A(3)S and. C(11)A(7) (.) CaF2. The CKD and GBFS eco-cement will have the similar Strength to the Portland cement grade 32.5 when blend proportion is properly applied.

AB In Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, peri-urban livelihood strategies have increasingly become recognized as important survival mechanisms for a wide range of actors in the context of rapid urban population growth. Based on field research, which illuminates local actors' knowledge and perceptions of land degradation, this paper identifies some of the key forces that are currently shaping the process of peri-urban change. The paper seeks to examine the social, economic and cultural contexts of land degradation in peri-m-ban areas, with specific reference to recent developments in and around the bourgeoning city of Kano in northern Nigeria. Particular issues of concern include the competition for key resources and its impact on the environment, together with related implications for levels of poverty, livelihoods and peri-urban food security. Since the concept of land degradation is a social construction, with different meanings for different individuals, a more critical evaluation of how the knowledge, understanding and perceptions of local actors drive behaviour and affect land-use decisions at the micro-level is essential if sustainable environmental policies for the future are to be initiated.

AB According to Fred Curtis (2003, p. 83), 'the road to environmental sustainability lies in the creation of local, self-reliant, community economies', a phenomenon he has labelled 'eco-localism'. Eco-localism focuses on place-specific responses to place-specific challenges, set at the scale of the community, with its place-specific history, culture, social fabric and local ecosystem. It argues the need for a local social economics, which has the capability to protect, maintain, enhance or rehabilitate local resources and environments. Curtis identifies a need to explore the means and potential for taking the eco-localism idea from principle to practice. This paper seeks to add some empirical meat to Curtis's theoretical bones. The paper uses a case study from North-East Thailand to describe the sequential 'crowding out' and 'clawing back' of social institutional control of local development and its social and environmental consequences. It places worsening problems of environmental degradation, resource depletion and social differentiation in the context of the dynamics of spatial integration and modern economic development. It then describes how processes of neo-localism, congruent with recent changes in the wider Thai and international context, have been responsible for reversing a number of ecological problems and strengthening sammakee, or communal harmony, principally by means of Buddhist institutions and principles. The empirical case-study fits very neatly with Curtis's theoretical eco-localism construct. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In Tigray (Northern Ethiopia, significant achievements were made, mainly from 1994 to 2002, on the development of agriculture through irrigation by employing seasonally harvested runoff using earth dams. However, most of the implemented schemes are not serving the intended purpose well because of constraints associated with both pre- and post-implementation. Sediment deposition in reservoirs is a serious off-site consequence of soil erosion in the region. However, the extent of the problem is not well studied. Moreover, there are no sufficient and reliable sediment-yield data for Northern Ethiopia, which are important for designing new reservoirs and for implementing soil conservation practices. This study addresses those problems by undertaking: (1) a survey and evaluation of the general characteristics and problems of 54 recently built reservoirs and the characteristics of their respective catchments; and (2) a detailed sediment survey in ten reservoirs and related catchment characteristics. A field survey in 2002-2003, a review of technical reports and interviews were the bases for this study.
   Most of the reservoirs are under risk of insufficient inflow, excessive seepage and sediment deposition. These problems are mainly attributed to the use of a poor database on hydrology and sediment yield, and the lack of adaptable methodologies for assessing controlling factors at the planning stage.
   The reservoir survey, which is the first of its kind in Ethiopia, also indicates that specific sediment yield (SSY) varies significantly between catchments: i.e. from 237 to 1817 t km(-2) y(-1) with an average of 909 ( 500) t km(-2) y(-1). The high spatial variability is mainly associated with differences in lithology, cover, extent of gully network and human activities. Therefore, adapting an average SSY value for the whole region is not recommended for future planning purposes. The sediment deposition problem is significant: i.e. 70 per cent of the study reservoirs have important siltation problems so that they will end their useful life well before the dam design period. Hence, sediment management in reservoirs could be an effective approach towards maintaining the existing storage capacity.
   For the realization of sustainable land and water development in Tigray, sufficient and reliable database building, development and standardization of appropriate methodologies for predicting sediment yield and capacity building of designers needs to be given top priority. Moreover, awareness creation among policy makers, donors and beneficiaries is also important for action. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Energy input and output of a rural village in China - The case of the
   "Beijing Man village"/District of Beijing
SO LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE

   safety
AB The rapid development of the economy has created an increasing demand for energy in China. The limited resources of fossil energy are a risk for the development of China. Sustainable agriculture with biomass energy - as done in developed countries like Germany - is an option to reduce these risks. In China, agriculture is not energy efficient, and the intensive fanning is not sustainable. The scientific challenge is to develop sustainable farming systems which can fulfill national food security, food safety and considerable renewable energy production without harming the environment, and are acceptable to the people and the economy. The protection and intelligent utilization of resources is the core of rural village development.
   To explore the potential of recent Chinese agriculture for the development towards a multi-functional farm for food and energy production, a village in the adjacent area of Beijing has been selected: the "Beijing Man village". About 1,900 people live in the village and 140 hectares of the 240 hectare total land ate available for farming. The major agricultural activity is pork production (capacity of 10,000 pigs per year) and dairy farming (40 dairy cows).
   In 2004, the energy input and output of this village was evaluated and taken as a basis for a model of sustainable farming for food and biogas production. The study explored that the gross energy production from crops in the "Beijing man village" was about 19,103 GJ/year. It was obvious that the crop production was not sufficient for the feed demand of the animal husbandry (pigs and cows). 60 % of the corn used as feed stuff was purchased on the market. The reason was, that the purchasing of corn was cheaper than the own production. The low competitive crop production due to the low efficiency resulted in the decrease of cultivated crop land from 140 ha to 80 ha in the past four years (two harvests per year).
   On the other hand, there was much more manure produced as suitable and applicable for crop production. Therefore manure was exposed in open air in a pond like waste. This is risky for public hazards like ground water contamination and zoonosis diseases. Therefore the fanning system is not sustainable, risky and not efficient. There is a potential of the optimization of the cropping and animal husbandry interaction as well as the development of renewable energy production in the village. The main development chains are the improvement of the energy efficiency of crop production, the reduction of animal husbandry to a sustainable animal-land-ratio and the introduction of biogas production with manure and cropping by-products.

TI The information literacy education readiness of public libraries in
   Mpumalanga province (South Africa)
SO LIBRI
LA English
DT Article
AB This study examines if public libraries in a province in South Africa are ready to assume an enhanced responsibility for information literacy education, specifically that of students, and, if so, what inhibiting and facilitating factors might exist. The public libraries in the rural province of Mpumalanga provide the case site. "Readiness", at one level, refers to physical capacity and, on a second level, to more subjective attributes such as staff attitudes and beliefs. The paper reports on the first phase of the study - in which both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered by means of a questionnaire/interview survey of 57 public librarians in 46 sites. The study finds that Mpumalanga public libraries are indeed heavily engaged in serving school learners. Shortcomings in certain physical facilities, such as the lack of space and absence of retrieval tools, are inhibiting factors with the heritage of apartheid still impacting on the availability of and quality of service. The low level of professional education of public library staff is found to impede innovation in library programming. The prevailing information literacy education model largely comprises one-to-one support, although there is a fair amount of source-based group library orientation. Moving towards information literacy education will depend on a shift in conceptions of the educational role of public libraries. In the absence of recognition of their curricular role by public library authorities and educators, many public librarians are not sure that their services to school learners are legitimate. There is, however, dawning recognition that present approaches are not meeting the needs of school learners and that more effective communication with educators is required. This recognition comes from public librarians' frustrating encounters with learners rather than from insight into information literacy education theory and experience. The fundamental conclusion is that sustainable information literacy education in public libraries will depend on more dynamic leadership and on a vision of a new model of public library.

AB We consider an age-structured discrete time modeling of a renewable resource, controlled by the harvesting of the mature class. A harvesting policy is considered to be sustainable if a minimum harvesting threshold can be guaranteed at any time, taking into account availability constraints. For the characterization of such policies, viability analysis reveals the intrinsic compatibility of the dynamics within a given threshold. Formulae for the maximal sustainable threshold that can be maintained by the resource, viability kernels and the set of corresponding sustainable feedbacks are obtained. We then propose explicit management rules, maximizing the sustainable threshold, and illustrate them with numerical simulations for two kinds of resources. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Yodzis discusses how the differing biological assumptions as to predator interference on the forms of predator-prey models can influence the conclusion to be drawn from multispecies population models with respect to the way predators affect human harvesting of natural populations. To deal with these intricacies related to biological assumptions and fishery management policies, a specific management strategy called threshold policy is proposed. It is shown that its application to the same models analysed by Yodzis leaves the behaviour of the managed population less sensitive to the underlying biological features and assumptions as well as parameter uncertainties. The same management strategy is proposed for the same models in the context of the timely issue of predator culling in fisheries. Interestingly, the fishery yield for each model is exactly the same despite their different biological assumptions.

AB An important issue for designing any conservation programme aimed at preserving genetic diversity is estimation of the scale at which genetic structuring occurs. Additional relevant factors include distinguishing whether or not population structuring is expected to be stable as predicted by the member-vagrant hypothesis, or alternatively, whether populations are more prone to local extinction-recolonization processes, as predicted by the metapopulation evolutionary model. In this study, the population genetic structure of Atlantic salmon from 11 locations within or nearby the Varzuga River tributary system was assessed using 17 microsatellites. Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed a significant isolation-by-distance signal within the tributary system as well as a negative association between the level of genetic diversity and waterway distance from the river mouth, indicating that dispersal is less likely to occur to populations deep in the tributary system. Individual-level spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that the majority of migration occurred between populations situated within 20 km of each other. The relatively high level of genetic structuring and significant isolation-by-distance signal observed in the Varzuga tributaries are concordant with the predictions of the member-vagrant evolutionary model. However, one subpopulation in particular revealed signs of instability which may be due to its location in the tidal zone, or due to the fact that it is more affected by human impacts. The results suggest that preservation of a number of spawning sites spaced throughout the tributary system is recommendable for ensuring sustainable fishing tourism in the river.

Our PC business is deployed based on the two pillars of the global and life environments and factors that affect these environments are to be monitored throughout their lifecycles. This paper is intended to introduce our measures including those aimed at compliance with the European RoHS Directive. Also covered are measures that target hazardous substances such as efforts for the use of halogen-free and phosphor-free plastics, those for the use of bioplastics to prepare for the depletion of oil resources, those for noise reduction using the water-cooling technology and those for dealing with VOCs (Volatile organic Compounds).

ID RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; INDIA
AB Community forest management (CFM) has received increasing worldwide attention from governments, researchers and educational institutions over the past two decades. Many governments, especially in developing countries, have prioritized CFM over traditional forest management systems. In Thailand, CFM is not recognized by the legal system; however, there are de facto CFM practices under common property resource regimes. CFM has in essence been practiced here for hundreds of years by local people, and represents an important aspect of Thai culture. This study aims at evaluating CFM in Thailand in the context of sustainable development. To meet the objective, the study gathered information through focus group discussions with various stakeholders: academics, Forest Department staff, and members of the Chang Tok Tay community forests. From the study, it emerged that forest resources are critical for the livelihoods and survival of rural people, and so they have protected forests to ensure sustainable livelihoods. This study identified that prospects for sustainable CFM in Thailand are bright because: (i) community members are highly motivated and are sufficiently interested to protect trees because they are well aware that their livelihoods are under threat from depleting forests; (ii) tradition and culture of rural people support their relation with nature; (iii) non-timber forest products (NTFPs) play a crucial role in local livelihoods for subsistence and necessitate protection of the forest watershed, which is vital to support their occupations; (iv) spiritual rituals such as those where Buddhist monks bind yellow cloth on trees play a vital role in protecting trees, something rare in other countries. The study further identified various hindrances to achieve sustainable CFM: (i) legal support for CFM is absent; (ii) the Royal Forest Department (RFD) cannot transfer appropriate technology to community people due to lack of legal support; (iii) scope for developing effective strategies for sustainable CFM by combining traditional knowledge with existing scientific knowledge is limited; (iv) a formal institutional arrangement for CFM does not exist; and (v) community members' access to the hard technology of CFM is limited. Therefore, in addition to legalizing CFM, a formal institutional framework for elaboration, implementation and control of CFM is essential to achieve sustainable CFM in Thailand.

AB Water quality monitoring in Toenepi Stream, New Zealand, started in 1995 in a study of dairy farming influences on lowland stream quality and has continued since then with brief interruptions. Surveys have provided information about changes in farm and soil management practices as they relate to environmental sustainability. Although average water quality in Toenepi Stream has changed little during 1995-2004, there have been some notable improvements. Water clarity measured by black disc has improved from 0.6 m to 1.5 m, and median ammonia-N and nitrate-N concentrations have declined by 70% and 57%, respectively. The frequency and magnitude of extreme concentrations have declined-most notably for nitrogen (N) forms, which also had decreased mean values. Specific yields for suspended solids (SS) and phosphorus (P) forms in 2002-04 were 47-67% of 1995-97 values, mainly because of lower water yields. Reduced specific yields for N forms in 2002-04 (34-37% of 1995-97 yields) were also attributable to lower mean concentrations in stream water. Faecal bacteria concentrations have not abated and are on average 2-3 times, recommended guideline values for contact recreation. Fewer dairy farms and an increased proportion irrigating dairyshed effluent to land, rather than discharging it to the stream via two-pond systems, were likely causes of improvement in water quality. Water quality targets were developed for Toenepi Stream to achieve contact recreation criteria for the Piako, River (downstream) and for intrinsic habitat values for Toenepi Stream. A range of mitigation measures has been formulated to meet these targets, but substantial uptake of sustainable fanning practices is needed to improve water quality in Toenepi Stream.

AB Partnership and capacity building have become popular strategies among intermediary nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Partnership is viewed as a cure for centrally managed bureaucratic NGOs and capacity building as a measure for strengthening local NGOs. This article examines the case of an intermediary NGO that followed a unique strategy combining capacity building through partnership. Through this, it reveals the trade-offs involved in the choice of an appropriate governance structure. It was found that although the decentralized network form of governance proved to be a powerful innovation, it presented a paradox. Especially in this case where the goal was transmission of specific values and perspectives about sustainable development, such a strategy posed a complex set of trade-offs. Drawing from the experience of this organization, the author suggests that a "plural form" organization may provide maximum governance efficiency for intermediary NGOs like the one examined here. These insights may also apply to social movement organizations.

AB Logging residues were inventoried in a 14-county region of southern I-Vest Virginia during the summer of 2002. A total of 70 sites that were harvested in 2000-2001 were sampled. The average overall weight of wood residue left after hat-vest in the region was 10.4 tons per acre (T/ac). Oak (Quercus spp.) was the most prevalent species group by weight, averaging 5.0 T/ac over the study area. Miscellaneous hardwoods, Yellow-poplar, and maple species (Acer spp.) followed the oaks with 2.7, 1.2, and 1.2 T/ac, respectively. The average large-end and small-end diameter of the pieces measured on intensive lines was 9.2 and 4.9 in., respectively. The average length of all logging residue was 20.4 ft. Wood residue loads after timber harvesting in West Virginia continue to be substantial. Although yellow-poplar and other soft hardwood residues alone do not provide an adequate fiber resource to supply new engineered wood products facilities, these residues can supplement current needs. Attention should be given toward increasing the use of these residues in West Virginia, especially in attracting industry that can use oak and mixed hardwood logging residues in a sustainable fashion.

AB Sustainable management for existing Amazonian forests requires an extensive knowledge about the limits of ecosystem nutrient cycles. Therefore, symbiotic nitrogen (N-2) fixation of legumes was investigated in a periodically flooded forest of the central Amazon floodplain (Varzea) over two hydrological cycles (20 months) using the N-15 natural abundance method. No seasonal variation in N-15 abundance (delta N-15 values) in trees which would suggest differences in N-2 fixation rates between the terrestrial and the aquatic phase was found. Estimations of the percentage of N derived from atmosphere (%Ndfa) for the nodulated legumes with Neptunia oleracea on the one side and Teramnus volubilis on the other resulted in mean %Ndfa values between 9 and 66%, respectively. More than half of the nodulated legume species had %Ndfa values above 45%. These relatively high N gains are important for the nodulated legumes during the whole hydrological cycle. With a %Ndfa of 4-5% for the entire Varzea forest, N-2 fixation is important for the ecosystem and therefore, has to be taken into consideration for new sustainable land-use strategies in this area.

AB Wood-energy, mainly used for private heating, industrial boilers and heating networks, includes high unexploited potentials as resources or consumers. In this perspective of development, the following work deals with the study of 18 wood fed boilers providing a power between 20 kW and 4 MW and several independent heating devices providing around 10 kW. As carbon monoxide is a very relevant indicator of the quality of combustion, we used this measurement to qualify the devices and to follow the influence of parameters such as the shape of the fireplace, the system of regulation or the quality of the fuel on the results of combustion. Indeed, the use of wood as a source of energy is considered as renewable and interesting for sustainable development only, if the pollutant emissions are low and under control. Nowadays, all installations respect and pass the norms of restriction for pollutant emissions, but it is now necessary to carry on with improving in order to reach the same thermic and environmental performances as those using fossil fuels.

DE resilience; communities; disasters; vulnerability; risk
AB Many societies in the world live with different types of risks and the threat of disasters has always presented a major challenge to devise ways to achieve sustainable development by reducing patterns of vulnerability. Disaster reduction is therefore crucial and must have a place in national policies in order to create favourable conditions for effective and efficient hazard mitigation at various levels. This con help in increasing the resilience among communities at risk by enabling them to withstand shocks, cope with emergencies as they bounce back from the impact and adopt in new ways to cope with future threats.
   The aim of this paper is to explore the concept of resilience in general and what this means before, during, and after disaster impact. Case studies ore cited to indicate how resilience operates or foils to occur and why, The study defines how resilience con be developed to create sustainable systems and structures that focus on robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness and rapidity.

DE ecomaterials; low-cost housing; disaster; vulnerability; risk management
AB Cuba has recently endured the impact of hurricanes Lili(1996), George (1998), Irene (1999), Michelle (2001), Isidore (2002), Lili (2002), Charlie and Ivan (2004). The provinces of Villa Clara, Matanzas and Pinar del Rio hove suffered the major damage, basically in coastal towns where thousands of houses hove been destroyed, and families displaced from their homes.
   Tackling this problem proves to be complicated. Decision-makers face two choices: (a) to concentrate the scarce resources - including post disaster aid - on emergency actions to reduce only the damages caused by the hurricane, or (b) to improve in a sustainable way existing houses through better and more efficient material supply. In both cases, the possibility of local production of building materials becomes a crucial factor.
   The Centre for Investigation and Development of Structures and Materials (CIDEM) has been involved in disaster-response projects in the area since 1996. The thrust has been the manufacture of ecomoteriols such as micro concrete roofing (MCR) tiles, pozzolonic cement CP-40 and hollow concrete blocks, which provide the means to build affordable and hurricane safe houses. These materials ore produced on the basis of local row materials and labour in small workshops based directly in the communities.
   The widespread use of ecomaterials on the northern coast of Villo Clara province has been a key aspect in decreasing the vulnerability of the houses against hurricanes. The fact that these materials hove withstood the impact a various hurricanes without significant damage has drown the attention of local governments, communities and donors. The presentation of case studies in this paper will illustrate this experience.

TI Post-disaster housing reconstruction for sustainable risk reduction in

SO OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL

DE reconstruction; risk management; disasters; construction technology;
   Peru
AB Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG) recently completed the systematisation of their reconstruction projects which were implemented between the early 1990s and the year 2003 in the poor areas of Peru affected by disasters or internal war. Within these projects, technological housing reconstruction schemes were designed and validated as port of on effort to reduce the vulnerability of the affected population. 7,300 houses were built during 5 years; 600 houses between April 7 1992 and April 7 994 and 700 houses between July 200 7 and July 2003. The key factors for successful risk reduction identified during post-disaster reconstruction were: the location of reconstructed housing, the construction procedures and materials employed, the improvement of people's self-construction techniques, and the improvement of local risk-management skills.
   ITDG's first experience in Alto Mayo during the early 1990s involved participatory management at a local level and the use of the so-called improved "wattle and daub technology" (i.e. structural reinforcement of mud, wood and cone buildings). This technique is more earthquake-proof than the construction technology predominating in Peru (i.e. cement and iron-bosed structures). The experience in Ayacucho, which concluded in 200 7, provided the opportunity to apply the so-called "improved adobe technique" (i.e. structural reinforcement of mud buildings), as well as to install community water supply systems. The reconstruction work in Moquegua and Tacna, completed in 2003, was based on the organisation of workshops geared towards encouraging the participation of women in the use of various housing construction technologies and providing the facilities for them to adopt such technologies to traditional architecture.
   This article highlights the ITDG approach and experiences to past-disaster reconstruction: the main activities carried out in preparation for and during the implementation of the projects, the lessons obtained during these experiences, and the monitoring and evaluation procedures recommended for future reconstruction projects.

TI Integrating risk reduction, urban planning and housing: Lessons from El
   Salvador
SO OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE disasters; risk reduction; urban planning; housing; El Salvador
AB Increasingly, attention has been given to the need to mainstream risk reduction in development work in order to reduce the vulnerability of the urban poor. Using El Salvador as a case study, the paper analyses the mainstreaming process in the developmental disciplines of urban planning and housing. The overall aim is to identify how the existing separation between risk reduction, urban planning and housing can be overcome and integration achieved.
   Since Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and especially after the 2001 earthquakes, not only relief and development organisations, but also social housing organisations hove initiated a shift to include risk reduction in their fields of action in order to address the underlying causes of urban vulnerability. The factors that triggered the process were: 7) the negative experiences of organisations with non-integral projects, 2) the organisations' increased emphasis on working with municipal development, 3) political changes of national level, and more importantly, 4) the introduction and promotion of the concept of risk reduction by international and regional aid organisations. However, required additional knowledge and institutional capacities were mainly built up independently and internally by each organisation, and not through the creation of co-operative partnerships, thus duplicating efforts and increasing ineffective competition.
   Whilst positive experience has been gained through the implementation of more integral projects, the creation of adequate operational, organisational, institutional and legal frameworks is still in its initial stage. Unfortunately, four years after the 200 7 earthquakes, emergency relief funding for post-disaster risk reduction is coming to on end without the allocation of resources for following up and consolidating the initial process. Based on the findings, on integral model is proposed which shows how mainstreaming risk reduction in urban planning and housing could be dealt with in such a way that it becomes more integrated, inclusive and sustainable within a developmental context.

TI Saving Shimla, North India, from the next earthquake

AB Shimla is a teeming city, with a population of 140,000. It is located in the north Indian Himalayas, in on area of high seismicity that was rocked by a devastating earthquake 6 hundred years ago. However, it is oblivious of the ticking time bomb below its foundations. Initiating risk reduction in this fast growing urban economic hub is on enormous challenge. A national non-governmental organisation (NGO) called SEEDS (Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society) started working in the city just before the earthquake centenary, with the aim to identify ways of reducing earthquake risk through actions that could be carried out by the citizens and the local government.
   The experience has been unique, and has led to further refinement of the community action planning approach that SEEDS (Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society) has picked up and worked with over the lost ten years in different vulnerable communities in the region. What emerges from the experience is a mix of tools for the improvement of technical aspects, community-based working approaches and governance for risk reduction. It is evident that community-local govemment-NGO partnerships ore the key to solving such acute problems as earthquake safety in a resource stropped, vulnerable city. The assessment and planning phases initiate the building of these partnerships in the early stages of the process.
   This paper is on attempt to shore the experience of developing and testing a community based urban risk reduction approach for a city at extreme earthquake risk.

TI Integrating slum upgrading and vulnerability reduction in Mozambique
SO OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
DE slum upgrading; vulnerability reduction; floods; participatory approach;
   Mozambique
AB Due to its location, Mozambique suffers from cyclical flooding associated with heavy rains and cyclones. In recent years, extreme flood events affected millions of people, disrupting the economic recovery process that followed the peace agreement in 1992. Despite this natural threat, most of the population continues to live in flood prone areas both in rural environment, due to the dependency on agricultural activities, and in urban environment, since unsafe zones ore often the only affordable option for new settlers.
   This paper presents a brief analytical review on different issues related with urban informal settlements, or slums, based on different project activities developed by the United Notions Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) in Mozambique. The aim is to identify applicable strategies to reduce vulnerability in urban slums, where approximately 70 percent of the urban population live. The implemented project activities target different organisational levels in on integrated manner, seeking for active involvement of the Government, local authorities and communities at each implementation stage, from decision-making to practical implementation. They consist of three main components: 7) supporting policy-making in order to ensure sustainable urban development, 2) delivering a comprehensive training and capacity building based on the mainstreaming concept of "Learning How to Live with Floods" as valid alternative to resettlement, and 3) facilitating participatory land use planning coupled with physical upgrading interventions of the local level.
   In the long-term, the intention of UN-HABITAT is to progressively focus on community-based slum upgrading and vulnerability reduction activities, coordinated by local authorities and actively monitored by central institutions, in improving and managing basic services and infrastructures (i.e. water supply, drainage, sanitation, waste management, rood network, etc). This type of bottom-up experiences should then represent a basis for setting up a slum upgrading intervention strategy to be applied at the national level.

ID POVERTY REDUCTION
AB The Millennium Declaration and the Hyogo Framework for Action point towards the need for methods to identify urban vulnerability to disaster risk as a pre-cursor for the development of benchmarks with which to track policy progress for urban sustainability and risk reduction. This paper responds to this call by assessing the state of the oil in urban vulnerability and risk assessment tools. It presents a review of the conceptual frameworks, methodologies and comparative advantages of ten tools. These ore categorised into deductive and inductive approaches, with inductive approaches in turn separated into those that use social-survey and participatory methods. The tools examined vary in the focus of their interests between those concerned with the vulnerability of places (cities or buildings) and people (either as pre-defined vulnerable social groups or identified through household livelihood sustainability).
   The paper calls for a deeper conversation between the emerging community of practitioners working on urban disaster risk management and the existing urban development community. For example, disasters ore typically defined as exceptionally large, single events, which odds to analytical clarity, but misses the cumulative impact of multiple small, local events on household sustainability and urban infrastructure, ultimately distorting planning guidance. There is also a need for natural hazard specific vulnerability assessment tools to be interpreted alongside, or to incorporate social, economic and political sources of danger to livelihoods and human health. For forward looking policy relevance, tools ore also needed that con assess adoptive or coping capacity. This is essential for the building of a holistic approach to urban risk management. An approach that coherently tackles the multiple hazards and vulnerabilities faced by urban dwellers, and seeks to avoid the shining of risk burdens between populations and the movement of people from one kind of threat to another.

AB As the Green Chemistry(1,2) movement has gained momentum, definitions of Green Chemistry have been dominated predominantly by academic viewpoints. Green Chemistry concepts, however, apply to an incredible diversity of scientific endeavor, which has invariably led to differences between and amongst both academia and industry regarding what constitutes Green Chemistry. Speaking primarily of the pharmaceutical industry and considering the advances achieved toward promoting Green Chemistry globally,(3) it is surprising how diverse the answers can be when executives, engineers, biologists, and chemists are asked the seemingly simple question "What is Green Chemistry?" Perhaps this should he expected considering that individual priorities change based upon a specific endeavor, altering the focus of Green Chemistry and consequently the message, making general definitions difficult. A common impression obtained appears to be that many do not accurately know or fully understand the true motivations, drivers, and deciding factors that serve to inspire and define Green Chemistry, and in particular Pharmaceutical Green Chemistry. This commentary seeks to shed light upon key aspects with regard to the philosophy of Pharmaceutical Green Chemistry.

ID ENVIRONMENTALISM; DEATH
AB In a widely read article, Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus critiqued the environmental movement for focusing on piecemeal technocratic solutions and failing to articulate a broader political vision, declaring it irrelevant if not already "dead." To get off the defensive, they argue, it needs to reframe its solutions to global warming and related environmental problems by appealing to core progressive values and to reformulate itself as part of a larger progressive movement. This repackaging, they say, will create a broader coalition with a shared political vision and greater political power There is much to be said for their critique of traditional technocratic environmentalism, much of which we agree with. However we will argue, their focus on rhetorical reform without addressing other aspects of environmental strategy is logically flawed and also undermines their commitment to democratic values.

DE livestock; urban; household; survival strategy; Sub-Saharan Africa
ID FARMERS MARKETS; FOOD
AB Urban household livestock production (UHLP) as a livelihood strategy is discussed with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper is based on a literature study and two large-scale surveys (cities of Brazzaville and Ouagadougou). The results are discussed in relation to three theoretical concepts, that is, the Sustainable Urban Livelihood model, economic integration theory and non-linear system thinking. The first considers various assets, livelihood outcomes and constraints Of UHLP rather than focusing on one aspect only. The second highlights three modes of economic integration, namely market exchange, redistribution and reciprocity. The third introduces notions of non-linearity to help explain how systems vary and repeat themselves at different scales. The paper shows the complexity of urban and peri-urban livestock production, which comprises a wide variety of animal species and production systems. UHLP has many interfaces and has to be considered within a broader urban-rural continuum. The paper concludes that the dynamics of urban livestock cannot be understood by looking at parts only. A narrow focus on the food value of urban livestock misses issues such as income and disease; looking only at public hygiene overlooks the essential role of urban livestock in making and keeping local communities 'healthy'.

AB This paper describes the use and role of trade-off analysis as a decision-making tool in the implementation of new technologies and sustainability evaluation. As an example, soils in the Purhepecha region in Mexico have been eroding for decades and crop residue retention has been suggested as an effective method to reduce soil loss; but it is not widely implemented. The effect of crop residue retention on systems' sustainability indicators have been investigated using trade-off analysis. The system used by most farmers (35% crop residue retention with free-grazing) reduced soil loss substantially, led to self-sufficiency in forage and maximized net income.

TI The Swedish experience with pension reform
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sweden is one of few countries in Europe to have introduced a comprehensive pension reform. In 1998, Sweden passed legislation that transformed its public pension system to a notional defined-contribution (NDC) plan- that is, a defined-contribution plan financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. In addition, a second tier of funded individual accounts was introduced. The reform had broad political support with more than 80 per cent of the votes in parliament. This paper discusses the trends in retirement in Sweden and assesses the experience with pension reform. The objective was to design a fiscally sustainable system tied to economic growth with a clear link between contributions and benefits. We discuss the challenges in meeting this goal, the extent to which the Swedish reform has succeeded, and how the system affects beneficiaries. The paper evaluates the experience of the individual funded accounts to date and concludes with an outlook for the future.

TI Killing five birds with one stone: Inward foreign direct investment in
   post-crisis Korea
SO PACIFIC AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY; MODEL
AB This paper analyzes Korean attitudes towards inward foreign direct investment (IFDI) before and after the 1997 financial crisis, within the context of the debate on the costs and benefits of IFDI and intensifying global competition to attract inward investment. The Korean experience sheds light on the forces driving the liberalization and deregulation of inward. investment by countries that had previously restricted and controlled IFDI and on the problems inherent in implementing these policy changes. For more than three decades, the South Korean government maintained a negative or passive attitude towards inward investment, which, despite its potential economic benefits, was seen as a less desirable option than using foreign loans to finance economic development. However, the 1997 crisis brought about a fundamental change in the Korean government's attitude, and led to sweeping policy changes that resulted in an investment boom in the immediate post-crisis period. After this initial success, the subsequent decline in FDI inflows prompted further measures to attract high-quality foreign investment. As the Korean government has discovered, while legal frameworks, promotional systems and structures can be reformed with relative ease, the issue of changing investors' perceptions of Korea and the Koreans' views of the role and value of inward investment is more problematic. Failure to resolve these problems and to develop strong locational advantages will put Korea at risk of losing crucial investments to regional competitors and will undermine efforts to enhance the global competitiveness of Korean firms and to promote sustainable economic growth and development in the years ahead.

TI Embedded institutionalization: sustaining rural tax reform in China
SO PACIFIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE institutional change; sustainability; interaction between institutional
   fields; rural tax reforms; government reforms
AB Sustaining early achievements in rural tax reforms and peasants' burden reduction is a major challenge facing Chinese leaders. Theoretical discussions over institutional change have noted the propensity of new-found changes to relapse, short of processes institutionalizing the changed, new order. Drawing from the experience of a Hubei county, the paper explores how the Chinese rural tax reform may be Sustained, and its achievements protected, through innovative changes in another institutional field: the personnel. Against conventional wisdom on the role of downsizing in government reforms, the paper argues that the crux lies with the performance of government officials, not their numbers or payroll size per se, and thus the importance of reforms targeting the former.

DE ceramic tile packaging; life cycle assessment; environmental
   performance; sustainable packaging
AB The overall goal of this study was to evaluate the environmental performance of the process currently used to package and palletize ceramic floor and wall tiles, and to propose and analyse improvements from an environmental point of view. After developing a life cycle inventory of the primary and tertiary packaging, the life cycle assessment was applied according to mandatory and optional elements of ISO 14042. The results are presented in three parts: the first quantifies the environmental behaviour of the current packaging system, the second examines strategies focused on minimizing the environmental burdens of such critical elements, and the third quantifies the environmental improvements, compared with the initial situation, that are obtained with the application of each improvement. The simultaneous incorporation of all the proposed improvements into the packaging system can reduce impact within the 18-45% range, depending on the impact method that is applied.

TI Fertilization management of paddy fields in Piedmont (NW Italy) and its

   quality
AB The fertilization management of the rice crop in Piedmont was analyzed at a regional scale, and the agronomic and environmental sustainability of the actual fertilization strategy of rice was evaluated through the analysis of its effect on the soils and waters quality.
   On average, a total amount of 127 kg ha(-1) of N, 67 kg ha(-1) of P2O5 and 161 kg ha(-1) of K2O were supplied to the rice crop.
   In most cases N and P fertilization was rather well balanced with crop removal. The N balance was in the range +/- 50 kg for 77% of the surface. The low concentration of N in the groundwater reflected the small N surplus. P fertilization resulted to be smaller than removal for 53% of the surface. Nevertheless, the soil extractable P was very high, probably because of former higher P inputs. This resulted in a high concentration in water courses and aquifers. The K fertilization was excessive (surplus > 100 kg ha(-1)) for 53% of the surface, but most soils showed a low K content. K is probably contributing to nutrient leaching to a great extent.
   The average soil organic matter (SOM) content of paddy fields was higher than that of normally-cultivated soils in Piedmont, and the C/N was higher, owing to the low mineralization rate in waterlogged conditions. The SOM content was in relation with the management of the crop residues, as the tradition of burning straw after harvest was still widespread on 65% of the paddy surface.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become the de facto tool for the management of coastal fisheries because of the relative ease of their implementation and presumed long-term benefits to both fisheries and conservation. However, such benefits may be negated if other interventions and restrictions are not applied, and MPA size and design are inadequate. To help promote good governance practices, a simple graphical Stella (R) model for determining MPA size is presented, using data from Tabina, Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines, as a case study. Aside from determining minimum MPA size for supporting fisheries, the model can also determine sustainable levels of catch and effort, and the minimum distance from shore that commercial fleets may operate. The model should afford managers and local officials a better appreciation of aspects of MPA deployment and provide fishery scientists and managers a framework when considering practical applications given the dynamic nature of ecosystem management. Results in Tabina showed that MPA deployments alone are not sufficient to manage coastal fisheries and suggest that the entry of commercial vessels nearer to shore may not be accommodated.

ID SYSTEM; IDENTIFICATION
AB Information on various agricultural resource parameters at various levels is essential for proper management and efficient resource allocation for sustainable agricultural development. Limitations in ground-based method have encouraged the use of satellite data coupled with geographical information system (GIS) in providing spatial as well as temporal information over large and inaccessible areas. In the present study, an attempt has been made to generate raster maps using remote sensing and GIS techniques to characterize the agroecosystem of South 24 Paraganas district of West Bengal, based on land utilization indices. Information on multi-season landcover derived from the analysis of the multi-temporal RADARSAT-1 SAR and IRS-1D LISS III data as well as other ancillary information in GIS environment are the basic inputs used in the study. The present analysis shows that northern and northwestern parts are more diverse in terms of agricultural intensification as compared to the southern and northeastern parts whereas the central parts show moderate density. In terms of carrying capacity, the high carrying capacity has been observed in the southern to northeastern parts whereas the northwestern and central parts show moderate and northern parts show low:carrying capacity. Overall, the characterization of agroecosystem using land utilization indices can be identified as major input to formulate a management plan for sustainable agriculture with concerns for the environment.

AB Development of crop varieties with high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is imperative for sustainable agriculture. Understanding how plant genes respond to low N stress is essential for formulating approaches to manipulating genes for improving NUE. In this study we analyzed the expression profiles of an indica rice cultivar Minghui 63 at seedling stage at 20 min, 1 and 2 h after low N stress with the normal N as the control, using a microarray of 11,494 rice ESTs representing 10,422 unique genes. While no significant difference was detected in the leaf tissue, a total of 471 ESTs were detected as responsive to low N stress in the root tissue with 115 ESTs showing up-regulation and 358 ESTs showing down-regulation. The analysis of expression profiles after low N stress identified following patterns: (1) the genes involved in photosynthesis and energy metabolism were down-regulated rapidly; (2) many of the genes involved in early responses to biotic and abiotic stresses were up-regulated while many other stress responsive genes were down-regulated; (3) regulatory genes including transcription factors and ones involved in signal transduction were both up- and down-regulated; and (4) the genes known to be involved in N uptake and assimilation showed little response to the low N stress. The challenges for future studies are to characterize the functional roles of the low N stress responsive genes in N metabolisms, including the large number of genes presently with unknown functions.

AB Practitioners who understand the broad-based concept of community engagement can improve their cultural competence and are better able translate medical science and information to the community level. A more comprehensive approach to address the root determinants of cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, depression, prostate cancer, domestic violence, alcohol and substance abuse, and many other health problems is required, an approach that involves community engagement in the problem definition and effective and sustainable management strategies. This article reports on several models of community engagement and health improvement initiatives.

DE floods & floodworks; risk and probability analysis
AB The Foresight Future Flooding project has analysed future flood risk in a scenario framework for the whole of the UK. The analysis predicts increasing flood risk unless current flood management policies and investment levels are changed, with up to a twentyfold increase in economic risk by the 2080s. The increase is attributable to a combination of climate change and increasing value of household, industrial and infrastructure assets. Potential responses are assessed in terms of the three pillars of sustainability: social, environmental and economic. The work described has formed much of the evidence base for the new government strategy for flood risk management in England, 'Making space for water'.

TI Sustainability assessment of Australian electricity generation
SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; indicators; electricity generation
AB Electricity generation systems have traditionally been evaluated using only a limited number of economic or environmental indicators, for example capital investment, generation cost or carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, the evaluations have generally been restricted to performance within the geographic boundary of the power station. This paper reports a sustainability assessment of power generation from Australian fossil fuels, notably black coal, brown coal and natural gas. A range of key sustainability indicators incorporating environmental, economic and social performance are included. The system boundary incorporates fuel extraction, fuel transport to the power station, generation of power, and transmission of electricity to the point of use. Most commonly employed existing technologies and some promising advanced technologies for power generation are considered. The cases of exporting Australian LNG and black coal to Japan for power generation in that country have also been considered. No one fuel or technology system was superior or inferior for every indicator. However the following generalizations can be made: Natural gas combined cycle systems have advantages for the majority of environmental and economic indicators, brown coal has an advantage in terms of value added, and black coal has relatively poor safety performance.

TI Sustainability metrics for coal power generation in Australia
SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

DE sustainability metrics; environmental impacts; human health; atmospheric
   acidification; photochemical (ozone) smog and eutrophication
AB The basis of this work was to investigate the relative environmental impacts of various power generators knowing that all plants are located in totally different environments and that different receptors will experience different impacts. Based on IChemE sustainability metrics paradigm, we calculated potential environmental indicators (P-EI) that represent the environmental burden of masses of potential pollutants discharged into different receiving media. However, a P-EI may not be of significance, as it may not be expressed at all in different conditions, so to try and include some receiver significance we developed a methodology to take into account some specific environmental indicators (S-EI) that refer to the environmental attributes of a specific site. In this context, we acquired site specific environmental data related to the airsheds and water catchment areas in different locations for a limited number of environmental indicators such as human health (carcinogenic) effects, atmospheric acidification, photochemical (ozone) smog and eutrophication. The S-EI results from this particular analysis show that atmospheric acidification has highest impact value while health risks due to fly ash emissions are considered not to be as significant. This is due to the fact that many coal power plants in Australia are located in low population density air sheds. The contribution of coal power plants to photochemical (ozone) smog and eutrophication were not significant. In this study, we have considered emission related data trends to reflect technology performance (e.g., P-EI indicators) while a real sustainability metric can be associated only with the specific environmental conditions of the relevant sites (e.g., S-EI indicators).

TI Nurturing a strong process safety culture
SO PROCESS SAFETY PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB Process safety management introduced a formal, structured, management systems approach to accident prevention that represented a "step change" improvement in identifying and reducing the potential for major process plant accidents. Although the process safety management elements have proven effective, the overall sustainability remains a challenge. This paper highlights the importance of a strong process safety culture that is needed to sustain a strong process safety performance. We use the Columbia Shuttle disaster incident as a backdrop to focus the attention on the significance of not having an optimal "Safety Culture." Examples have been included from our industry to further exemplify its broad applicability. The paper proposes an approach that will help organizations to self-assess the state of the process safety culture in their organizations, which can be an aid in their ongoing cultural improvement effort. Four important cultural themes are identified and described: (1) Create awareness and buy-in about process safety culture themes, (2) adapt process safety culture themes to your company experience, (3) use suggested indicators to identify specific areas of improvement, and (4) develop a strategic improvement plan to strengthen and sustain process safety culture.

SO R & D MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Research institutions in Ghana are facing various challenges. It is the contention that viable research and development institutions are needed for achieving sustainable change in areas of national importance. A key aspect of institutional viability is strong performance management. This implies clear and workable approaches to performance measurement. This paper looks at the initial experiences in a collaborative effort to develop a performance measurement framework for the Food Research Institute (FRI) and the application of the Balanced Score Card (BSC) at institutional level. The process of diagnosing and analysing institutional monitoring and evaluation capacity and systems is described using a mix of diagnostic tools. Stages in applying the BSC approach are documented and the added value of the scorecard perspectives in highlighting focal areas for performance measurement and management within FRI. These are placed in the context of ongoing changes in the external environment posing both threats and opportunities. Changes implied by the introduction of the concept are discussed in the context of current constraints and the way forward is mapped out in terms of enhancing FRIs' impact orientation through the application of improved performance measurement and management.

AB Understanding how stocking rate or grazing intensity affects the abundance of common plant species is fundamental to the sustainable management of rangelands. We had the unique opportunity to determine the impact of stocking rate on shrub canopy cover and grass basal cover in a sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia Tort.) grassland of the Southern Plains, United States. Treatments were imposed over a 20-year time span that included an entire precipitation cycle from wet to dry and back to wet conditions. From 1941 until 1951, continuous stocking treatments of 41, 53, and 82 animal-unit-days ha(-1) (AUD (.) ha(-1)) were imposed with straight-bred Hereford steers (initial weight of 213 kg +/- 11 SE) for about 320 days from mid-November to late September of the next year. From 1952 through 1961, the experimental pastures were grazed yearlong by cow-calf pairs at 45, 60, and 87 AUD (.) ha(-1). Canopy cover of shrubs and basal cover of grasses were measured by the line-intercept method in 1940, 1942, 1949, 1955, 1958, and 1961. Canopy cover of sand sagebrush was not affected by stocking rate. Individual grass species exhibited positive and negative responses to stocking rate in some years, but no grass species responded to stocking rate in a single direction over the entire length of this long-term study. Stocking rate effects were most obvious under favorable conditions of high precipitation, but these effects were absent during drought. Climatic variability and slope gradient exerted the primary controlling influences on sand sagebrush-grasslands in the Southern Great Plains when stocking rates were within the bounds tested in this study.

AB Soils perform a number of essential functions affecting management goals. Soil functions were assessed by measuring physical, chemical, and biological properties in a regional assessment of conventional (CON) and alternative (ALT) management practices at eight sites within the Great Plains. The results, reported in accompanying papers, provide excellent data for assessing how management practices collectively affect agronomic and environmental soil functions that benefit both farmers and society. Our objective was to use the regional data as an input for two new assessment tools to evaluate their potential and sensitivity for detecting differences (aggradation or degradation) in management systems. The soil management assessment framework (SMAF) and the agro-ecosystem performance assessment tool (AEPAT) were used to score individual soil properties at each location relative to expected conditions based on inherent soil-forming factors and to compute index values that provide an overall assessment of the agronomic and environmental impact of the CON and ALT practices. SMAF index values were positively correlated with grain yield (an agronomic function) and total organic matter (an agronomic and environmental function). They were negatively correlated with soil nitrate concentration at harvest (an indicator of environmental function). There was general agreement between the two assessment tools when used to compare management practices. Users can measure a small number of soil properties and use one of these tools to easily assess the effectiveness of soil management practices. A higher score in either tool identifies more environmentally and agronomically sustainable management. Temporal variability in measured indicators makes dynamic assessments of management practices essential. Water-filled pore space, aggregate stability, particulate organic matter, and microbial biomass were sensitive to management and should be included in studies aimed at improving soil management. Reductions in both tillage and fallow combined with crop rotation has resulted in improved soil function (e.g., nutrient cycling, organic C content, and productivity) throughout the Great Plains.

ID NORTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; AGRICULTURE; CYCLE
AB A goal in sustainable agriculture is to use fossil fuel energy more efficiently in crop production. This 12-year study investigated effects of two crop rotations and two crop production systems (organic versus conventional management) on energy use, energy output and energy-use efficiency. The grain-based rotation included wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-pea (Pisum sativum L.)-wheat-flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), while the integrated rotation included wheat-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-alfalfa-flax. Energy use was 50% lower with organic than with conventional management, and approximately 40% lower with integrated than with the grain-based rotation. Energy use across all treatments averaged 3420 MJ ha(-1) yr(-1). Energy output (grain and alfalfa herbage only) across treatments averaged 49,947 MJ ha(-1) yr(-1) and was affected independently by production system and crop rotation. Energy output in the integrated rotation was three times that of the grain-based rotation; however, this difference was largely due to differences in crop type (whole plant alfalfa compared with grain seed). Energy output was 30% lower with organic than with conventional management. Energy efficiency (output energy/input energy) averaged to 17.4 and was highest in the organic and integrated rotations. A significant rotation by production system interaction (P < 0.05) indicated that energy efficiency increases due to crop input reduction (i.e., shift from conventional to organic management) were greater in the integrated than in the grain-based rotation. Greater energy efficiency in the integrated rotation under organic management was attributed to the fact that the forage component was less sensitive to chemical input removal than grain crops.

AB Current production practices in the Red River Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota involve use of extensive tillage and/or herbicides to control weeds. Given the erosion potential, environmental concerns associated with herbicides, and herbicide-resistant weeds, alternative cropping systems that mitigate these problems need to be assessed economically. Furthermore, the role that government commodity programs play in the adoption of more ecologically friendly cropping systems needs to be determined. We evaluated 8 years of yield data (1994-2001) from field plots near Fargo, North Dakota, to compare the economics of two alternative cropping systems, reduced-input (RI) and no-till (NT), to a conventional tillage (CT) cropping system. The RI system relies on a more diverse rotation of soybean (SB), spring wheat (SW), sweet clover (SC) and rye, and uses fewer herbicide and fertilizer inputs than CT or NT. Both NT and CT systems rotate SB and SW. We found that CT returns averaged over $47 ha(-1) more than NT during the study period. Because SC yield data were not available, the economic competitiveness of RI was calculated using break-even yields and returns for SC. Historical SC yields in Cass County, North Dakota were not statistically different from the break-even yields. However, when government program payments were considered, break-even returns for SC increased by about $15 and $18 ha(-1) and break-even yields by 0.44 and 0.52 MT ha(-1) for RI to compare with NT and CT, respectively. These results indicate that CT management offers greater economic return than either RI or NT and that government program payments impede adoption of more environmentally friendly cropping systems in the northern Great Plains.

AB The technological advances have been accompanied by an enormous demand for energy. Non-renewable energy sources have supplied this energy so far, but it has also led to an erosion of the worldwide environment. The US/Mexico border region has some unique advantages and/or opportunities. The availability of high solar radiation, considerable amounts of non-potable water, and human and/or animal wastes can be used for generating hydrogen and biogas as alternative fuel sources.
   New technology can be used to produce hydrogen from salted water and this gas can be stored and later, used to fuel an electricity generator and consequently generate potable water as bi-product. Therefore, photovoltaic cells coupled to an electrolizer can be used to generate electricity in a sustainable manner.
   The research described here simulates complete energy systems based on commercial devices and developed using EXTEND software and has the capability to perform comparisons, predictions and evaluations among different processes for energy generation. In addition, it demonstrates alternatives in local energy production, and the feasibility of remote house hybrid system located in the El Paso/Juarez border area. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The East Sussex business excellence through resource efficiency (ES betre) waste minimisation club (programme) aimed to increase awareness of the benefits of improved resource efficiency and achieve reductions in waste, energy and water for SMEs in East Sussex, in South East England. The programme was delivered by EcoSys in partnership with the East Sussex Sustainable Business Partnership, a collaboration of all East Sussex Local Authorities, the Environment Agency and EcoSys. ES betre provided a range of free support and advice over a 2-year period including: 54 workshops, 6 newsletters, 30 environmental audits, 16 grants and 312 technical helpline enquiries. Information on environmental compliance and best practice for solid waste minimisation and recycling, energy and water efficiency was disseminated and activities linked with the government's best practice programmes, e.g. Envirowise, Action Energy and The Carbon Trust. Marketing activities were extremely successful in attracting businesses to join with 757 signing up, 60% of which then went onto become active service users. This is the most successful recruitment rate in the UK to date, making ES betre some 40 times larger than the average UK waste minimisation club. Excellent links with local business support/trade associations were built up and recruitment by personal recommendation became a feature. The project had a strong focus on smaller businesses (< 250 employees). Of the businesses that signed up to the project, 56% were Micro (< 9 employees) and 86% employed less than 50 employees (Small). The project reached 4000 local businesses regularly via newsletters and event mailings. Some 60% of the 757 businesses became actively involved and attended training events or had environmental audits. A total of 189 businesses identified improvement actions (1226) and of these, 123 businesses had implemented at least one improvement action by the end of the programme. These resulted in estimated cost savings of at least 263,000 pound per annum and just over half of these savings have already been achieved (March 2005). In addition, actions taken to prevent pollution and ensure compliance with environmental legislation will save businesses a further 297,000 pound in fines. These cost savings were larger than the cost of the project (298,000) pound. The environmental impact of the programme has been significant with reductions identified in waste (1915 t), water (17,352m(3)) and energy (1.2 million kWh). The savings quantified are thought to be conservative as it was found that many Micro and SMEs did not measure the impact of their actions. Previous experience indicates that, for projects involving smaller companies, cost savings are likely to be underestimated by at least 50%. As well as making it difficult to measure outputs, this lack of measurement means it is harder to demonstrate the need for change with the benefits of improved practice. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The UK Sustainable Development Strategy requires that society strive to make prudent use of natural resources so as to protect the environment and maintain high and stable levels of economic growth and employment. The Waste Strategy for England and Wales emphasises the need to reduce the amount of waste produced through the adoption of waste minimisation methodology. Waste minimisation clubs have been a key element in the UK programme to introduce more sustainable practice into industry and commerce. Northamptonshire, a county in the East Midlands of England, has benefited from 20 waste minimisation/resource efficiency projects, within a county programme, that have run between 1997 and 2004. This is the largest number in any county in England. This has been possible because of the formation of a large and inclusive partnership that contains all the key Local and Regional players. Performance Indicators have been developed to direct the county programme as it strives to introduce more sustainable waste management practice. The Northamptonshire model has led to a catalysed uptake of sustainable waste management practice in some 574 companies, some 13.4% of participating companies in England in same period, thereby contributing to the maintenance of stable levels of economic activity. However, an inherent limit has been reached with waste minimisation club provision. Future provision for resource efficiency must include the movement towards Industrial Symbiosis (IS) and ultimately Industrial Ecology (IE). The radical shift towards IS and IE will occur as a response to the increased quantification of the resource flows, in a given UK economic area, and the deeper understanding of the diversity and complexity of the systems.

ID GROWTH
AB This paper follows a previous work that identifies a consistent pattern of increasing materials consumption associated with economic growth, until a certain income threshold is reached [Canas A, Ferrdo P, Conceicao P. A new environmental Kuznets curve? Relationship between direct material input and income per capita: evidence from industrialized countries. Ecol Econ 2003:46;217-29]. Emphasis is given to the analysis of the economy's metabolism along the period of increasing material consumption, which is associated with transitional economies. Here, an empirical analysis is provided, based on the study of the development of the Portuguese economy, which during the last two decades of the 20th century has crossed this development stage.
   The mechanisms that induced this transition in material consumption for the Portuguese economy are discussed and the analysis is completed by closing the material balance for the year 2000 in order to understand how material flows have crossed the economy and were transformed in products, stocks, or environmental burdens.
   It is demonstrated that the development model for this transitional economy corresponds to an increase in materials consumption related to strengthening the infrastructures that are required to improve physical infrastructures. Understanding the metabolism of transitional economies is assumed to be particularly relevant to a global sustainable development, as large emerging economies may be entering in this process.

AB Mining activities promote severe environmental degradation in many parts of the world, and revegetation techniques with diverse plant species have been used for rehabilitation of these areas. Studies on the occurrence, efficiency and diversity of key microbial groups such as leguminosae-nodulating, nitrogen fixing bacteria (LNNFB) are essential because they are involved in nutrient cycling processes and, therefore, to the sustainability of these areas. Aiming to evaluate the efficiency and phenotypic diversity of LNNFB, soil samples were collected from different bauxite mining areas with distinct rehabilitation strategies and chronosequences in the summer of 1999. With these materials we installed experiments using bean and cowpea as trap species under greenhouse conditions. At flowering, the plants were harvested and the shoot dry weight, nodule number, nodule weight, nitrogenase activity, and phenotypic diversity of LNNFB isolates evaluated by culture characterization on 79 medium. There was no influence of the different rehabilitation strategies on the efficiency of LNNFB populations in promoting bean growth. After phenotypic characterization of 328 bean and 420 cowpea LNNFB isolates, it was found that the latter is better suited than bean for studies evaluating LNNFB nodulation, efficiency and diversity in these areas. Mining strongly decreases the LNNFB diversity, while there is little effect on nodulation of trap plants. Rehabilitation strategies contribute to increase LNNFB diversity in bauxite mined soils, mainly when legume species were introduced.

AB Several studies reveal that the substitution of native vegetation by agricultural systems results in decreases in the C and N soil organic matter pools. Aiming to test the hypothesis that management practices favoring organic residue inputs promote increases in the most sensitive organic matter pools, the present study intended to study areas of an organic management system of acerola fruit production and a conventional cultivation area cropped with carrot and beet in crop rotation with corn. These areas belong to the Farm Amway Nutrilite do Brasil and Central Pivot Farmers Association, respectively, both in the Chapada da Ibiapaba, Ceara State, Brazil. A pasture area on the former was also selected. Areas under native forest, located near the cultivation areas, were sampled. Samples of a Quartzipsamment soil were collected from the depths 0-5 and 5-15 cm. The total soil organic C, microbial C and N (Cmic and Nmic), light organic matter C and N (Cmol and Nmol) and the mineralizable C were determined. An accumulation of 0.0117 Mg ha(-1) was observed in the Nmic stock in the organic system soil in comparison to the native forest's, representing an increase of 585% in the Nmic stock. In addition, there was an accumulation of 0.211 Mg ha(-1) in the Cmic stock in the pasture area, which represented an increase of 514.6% in these pools. On the other hand, Cmic stocks in the conventional system were reduced by 59 and 53% in the 0-5 and 5-15 cm. layers, respectively, in relation to the native forest. In the upper soil layer, the organic systems presented an increment of 106% in the Cmol stocks, while in the conventional system a reduction of 31% was observed in the same organic matter pool. The results obtained demonstrated that soil management in the areas under organic cultivation with acerola fruit and pasture contributed to the maintenance and recovery of the C and N microbial biomass and the light organic matter contents. The increments and/or reductions of C and N in the MB and LOM pools, compared to the native forest, were proportionally larger than those of the total organic C and N stocks, mainly in the area under conventional system cultivation. This observation indicates that these compartments can be considered sensitive indicators of soil management alterations. In conclusion, the organic management systems and pasture areas represent important management strategies that should be considered for the conservation and/or increase of the soil organic matter and, consequently, for the improvement of the sod quality and C sequestration in the Chapada da Ibiapaba region.

AB Objective: The present study examined implementation issues in adopting cognitive-behavioral therapies in routine clinical settings in four countries reflecting diverse cultures, languages, settings, and traditions. Method: A Director's Systems Survey was administered prior to program implementation and one year later Therapist ratings on attitudes about evidence-based practices and satisfaction were also gathered. Results: All sites reported successful adoption of the program, although significant variations existed in fiscal support, family involvement, prior experience with cognitive-behavioral therapies, and plans for sustainability. Therapists' ratings indicated overall satisfaction with the implementation of the project. Findings from the Director's Systems Survey pointed to five factors facilitating implementation: 1) early adoption and guidance by innovative leaders (i.e., the Directors); 2) attention to the "fit" between the intervention model and local practices; 3) attention to front-end implementation processes (e.g., cultural adaptation, translation, training, fiscal issues); 4) attention to back-end processes early in the project (e.g., sustainability); and 5) establishing strong relationships with multiple stakeholders within the program setting. Conclusions: The implementation issues here mirror those identified in other studies of evidence-based practices uptake. Some of the obstacles to implementation of evidence-based practices may be generic, whereas issues such as the impact of political/economic instability, availability of translated materials, constitute unique stressors that differentially affect implementation efforts within specific countries.

AB Tourist activity in areas of Mountain tourism is threatened by the general increase in land and property values (probably exacerbated by the tourism phenomenon itself): land and property speculation is Such chat it goes against Sustainable tourism development. Furthermore, Such speculation is more profitable in the short term than the business activities of the tourism sector in general. The links between local power and the actors in land and property speculation are complex since the latter are generally well represented on municipal councils. In Such a context, is governance (Public/private partnership in its widest sense) a tool that can enable tourist destinations to make a living from tourism in a sustainable manner (accommodation, services, etc.) instead of living off land and property rents?

AB Civil engineering structures may suffer accelerated damage from the corrosion of their carbon steel reinforcement bars. This corrosion originates from the carbonatation of concrete that lowers the pH and from the diffusion of chlorides through the concrete. It generates heavy maintenance and repair costs and it significantly reduces the service life of the structures. These consequences can be avoided with the general or partial use of stainless steel reinforcement bars. This solution affords many advantages:
   Significant reduction of the maintenance costs. " Increased sustainability.
   Reduced service costs.
   Improved safety.
   Optimized concrete thickness.
   The limited extra cost of stainless steel rebars over carbon steel rebars is quickly overcompensated for by the savings that they allow on maintenance costs.

AB Many river restoration projects are focusing oil restoring environmental flow regimes to improve ecosystem health in rivers that have been developed for water supply, hydropower generation, flood control, navigation, and other purposes. In efforts to prevent future ecological damage, water supply planners in some parts of the world are beginning to address the water needs of river ecosystems proactively by reserving some portion of river flows for ecosystem support. These restorative and protective actions require development of scientifically credible estimates of environmental flow needs. This paper describes ail adaptive, inter-disciplinary, science-based process for developing environmental flow recommendations. It has been designed for use in a variety of water management activities, including flow restoration projects, and can be tailored according to available time and resources for determining environmental flow needs. The five-step process includes: (I) ail orientation meeting; (2) a literature review and summary of existing knowledge about flow-dependent biota and ecological processes of concern; (3) a workshop to develop ecological objectives and initial flow recommendations, and identify key information gaps; (4) implementation of the flow recommendations on a trial basis to test hypotheses and reduce uncertainties; and (5) monitoring system response and conducting further research as warranted. A range of recommended flows are developed for the low flows in each month, high flow pulses throughout the year, and floods with targeted inter-annual frequencies. We describe an application of this process to the Savannah River, in which the resultant flow recommendations were incorporated into a comprehensive river basin planning process conducted by the Corps of Engineers, and used to initiate the adaptive management of Thurmond Dam.

AB We have developed an efficient construction of spiro derivatives by anodic oxidation of the corresponding phenols, which enabled synthesis of spiroisoxazoline natural products as well as heliannuols, carrying chroman and benzooxepin structures. In addition to nucleophilic attack of hydroxyl or amino groups to the cation generated electrochemerically, it might be of interest to use a carbonyl oxygen as a nucleophilic center, which would provide hemiacetal-type spiro compounds.
   Gymnastatin A 1 was isolated from the strain of Gymnescella dankaliensis separated from the sponge Halichondria japonica, together with other gymnastatins. This marine natural product consists of the spiro structure between the dienone part including two chlorine atoms, and the tetrahydrofuran ring with a hemiacetal moiety, along with the fatty acid part having an asymmetric carbon center attached with the amino group. As part of our extensive electrochemical investigation of halogenated tyrosine derivatives, synthesis of the acetal-spiro derivatives and its application to gymnastatin A 1 was undertaken to develop further efficient and green sustainable methodology. In these investigations, construction of spiro compounds having hemiacetal moiety, and synthesis of gymnastatin A I was achieved successfully. In addition to the synthesis, biological assessment of synthetic samples was examined. Among them, 3, 5, 14, and 15 showed a wide range of inhibitory activity against Gram-positive, -negative bacteria, fungus, and Mycobacterium. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID SCIENCE; DEBATE; POLICY
AB In this paper, we report some reflections on science and education, in relation to teaching and research in the field of complex and controversial socio-environmental issues. Starting from an examination of the literature on the epistemological aspects of the science of controversial issues, and introducing the perspective of complexity, the article argues for a complexity of content, context, and method in understanding current problems. Focusing on a model of learning which includes dialogical and reflective approaches, the final part of the article reports on aspect of the authors' experimental practice with role-play for dealing with complex issues. The review of the literature and our experience of action-research introduce a view of education which promotes young people's awareness of multiple points of view, an ability to establish relationships between processes, scales, and contexts which may be nonlinearly related, and practice with creative and nonviolent forms of interrelations with others. Such an approach in science education is coherent with a scenario of planet sustainability based on ecological webs and equity principles. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Risk and governance in water recycling public acceptance revisited
SO SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES
LA English
DT Article
DE water recycling; institutional approach; risk; public acceptance;
   community engagement
ID LANDCARE
AB Public acceptance is often seen as a key reason why water-recycling technology is (accepted or) rejected. A common assumption is that projects fail because the general public is unable to comprehend specialist information about risk and the belief that if the public were better informed, they would accept change more readily. This article suggests that rhetoric about acceptance is counterproductive in progressing sustainability as it does not address issues relating to institutional arrangements and reinforces a dichotomy between expert and lay groups. Instead, it is argued that institutional change is needed to build opportunities for constructive public engagement. The failure to implement sustainable water use through recycling can be understood as the result of several factors including present cost structures for water, institutional conservatism, administrative fragmentation, and inadequate involvement of communities in planning. Achieving sustainable water use through recycling may require better coordination between agencies and integrated government policies.

AB This paper describes the Ka-band altimetry payload and system that has been studied for several years by CNES, ALCATEL SPACE and some science laboratories. Altimetry is one of the major elements of the ocean observing system to be made sustainable through the GEOSS ( Global Earth Observation System of Systems) and GMES ( Global Monitoring of the Environment and Security) programs. A short review of some mission objectives to be fulfilled in terms of mesoscale oceanography in the frame of the GEOSS and GMES programs is performed. To answer the corresponding requirements, the approach consisting in a constellation of nadir altimeter is discussed. A coupled Ka-band altimeter-radiometer payload is then described; technical items are detailed to explain how this payload shall meet the science and operational requirements, and expected performances are displayed. The current status of the payload development and flight perspectives are given.

AB Whilst it has long been known that improved protein nutrition can increase resilience, i.e. reduce the consequences of subclinical gastrointestinal nematode parasitism on sheep performance, improved protein nutrition can also increase resistance, i.e. immunity to parasites. This would be the case because expression of acquired immunity to parasites is often penalized at times of nutrient scarcity. A recently developed nutrient-partitioning framework postulates that this penalty arises from prioritized scarce nutrient allocation to growth and/or reproductive functions. A large body of evidence shows that at times of protein scarcity, an increased supply of protein, from a wide range of protein sources, can indeed reduce gastrointestinal nematode parasitism in both growing and periparturient sheep. As such, immunonutrition can play a vital role in sustainable, parasite control strategies, either on its own but more likely integrated with other non-chemical strategies, including genetic selection for increased resistance, vaccination and biological control.

AB The lower montane forest zone of Indonesia is undergoing rapid conversion of indigenous forests to agriculture. In this tropical region, however, the effects of forest conversion on soil N processes have not been investigated. Corn (Zea mays L.) and cacao (Theobronta cacao L.)--coffee (Coffea canephora Pierre ex Froehner) agroforestry are the main land use types in cleared lower montane forests in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Our main objective was to compare the soil N dynamics under agroforest systems and corn cultivation with indigenous forest. We measured the gross rates of N transformation processes using N-15 pool dilution. The agroforest systems and indigenous forests had higher gross N mineralization rates and faster turnover rates of NH4+ and microbial N pools than the long-term cultivated corn sites. Faster soil N turnover rates in agroforest systems suggest a more dynamic soil N cycling. Leguminous shade trees, which are important components of these agroforest systems, may have influenced the fast microbial N cycling through release of N-rich root exudates and plant residues. Our results show that compared with corn, agroforestry is a better option in terms of sustainability in the N-supplying capacity of the soil. In addition, we measured higher (NH4+)-N-15 recoveries than (NO3-)-N-15 recoveries after 15 min of N-15 addition in all our sites. Our measured rates of gross nitrification were very low to negligible, due to rapid disappearance of added (NO3-)-N-15. Such fast reaction of NO,- warrants further investigation, especially in tropical areas where N-15 studies are very few.

AB Sustainable management practices are needed to enhance soil productivity in degraded dryland soils in the northern Great Plains. We examined the effects of two tillage practices [conventional till (CT) and no-till (NT)], five crop rotations [continuous spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (CW), spring wheat-fallow (W-F), spring wheat-lentil (Lens culinaris Medic.) (W-L), spring wheat-spring wheat-fallow (W-W-F), and spring wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L.)fallow (W-P-F)], and a Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) on plant biomass returned to the soil, residue C and N, and soil organic C (SOC), soil total N (STN), and particulate organic C and N (POC and PON) at the 0- to 20-cm depth. A field experiment was conducted in a mixture of Scobey clay loam (fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Argiustolls) and Kevin clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argiustolls) from 1998 to 2003 near Havre, MT. Mean annualized plant biomass returned to the soil from 1998 to 2003 was greater in W-F (2.02 Mg ha(-1)) than in W-L and W-W-F, regardless of tillage. In 2004, residue cover was greater in CW (60%) than in other rotations, except in W-W-E Residue amount and C and N contents were greater in NT with CW (2.47 Mg ha(-1) and 963 and 22 kg ha(-1), respectively) than in NT with W-L and CT with other crop rotations. The POC at 0 to 5 cm was greater in W-W-F and W-P-F (2.1-2.2 Mg ha(-1)) than in W-L. Similarly, STN at 5 to 20 cm was greater in CT with W-L (2.21 Mg ha(-1)) than in other treatments, except in NT with W-W-E Reduced tillage and increased cropping intensity, such as NT with CW and W-L, conserved C and N in dryland soils and crop residue better than the traditional practice, CT with W-F, and their contents were similar to or better than in CRP planting.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB This study highlights the importance of economic profits (EVA) and their long-term effects on shareholder value (MVA). South African companies listed on the JSE were analysed and it is evident that the relative measure of internal performance (spreads) can be used to rank companies in terms of value creation. Individual companies and sectors were also placed on a financial strategy matrix, which evaluated companies according to spreads and cash management. The sales growth less the SGR percentage was used to indicate cash management. Statistical tests (regression analysis) were done on the data to test the validity of the financial strategy matrix model. The results showed that there is a positive relationship between spreads and shareholder value, but sales growth less the sustainable growth rate does not contribute significantly to shareholder value.

AB HALIOTIS MIDAE (PERLEMOEN) IS THE ONLY southern African species of abalone to be commercially exploited. Commercial farms are currently producing 750 tons per annum, making this an economically viable enterprise. Increasing world demand and dwindling natural populations have, however, necessitated the adoption of genetic management practices on South African abalone farms to remain sustainable. This can be done by means of DNA markers, which are employed to investigate various phenomena from genetic diversity, parentage and brood-stock contributions to linkage mapping an marker-assisted selection for genetic enhancement of the commercial species. The use of microsatellite markers for various abalone aquaculture applications is highlighted in this review.

AB We develop an approach to analyzing the sustainability of competitive advantage that emphasizes demand-side factors. We extend the added-value approach to business strategy by introducing an explicit treatment of how firms create value for consumers. This allows its to characterize how consumer heterogeneity and marginal utility from performance improvements on the demand side interact with resource heterogeneity and improving technologies on the supply: side. Using this approach, we address a variety of questions including whether technology substitutions will be permanent or transitory; the sequence in which new technologies attack different market segments; how rents from different types of resources change over time; whether decreasing marginal utility and imitation give rise to similar rent profiles; the extent of synergies within a firm's resource portfolio; the emergence of new generic strategies: and the conditions that support strategic diversity in a market. Our focus on consumer utility and value creation complements the traditional focus in the strategy literature on competition and value capture. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Quality of care in China: Scaling up a pilot project into a national
   reform program
SO STUDIES IN FAMILY PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB China's family planning program ranks as history's most intensive effort to control national population growth. Although advocates for global population control have lauded China's effort to limit births as a fundamental part of its sustainable development goals, the country's population policy has also generated much international criticism. As China enters the new millennium, a long-overdue reform of its approach to implementing its family planning program has begun to refocus the program on clients' needs, informed choice of contraceptives, and better-quality services. Originally inspired by the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo, the reform program began as a pilot project among six counties and has now become a blueprint for reorienting the national family planning program. This article reviews the process by which a small, innovative pilot project was scaled up into a national reform effort and the key lessons learned about scaling up sensitive but necessary innovation in a difficult political environment.

TI Taxonomic capacity can improve environmental and economic sustainability
   in biodiversity-rich shade coffee farms in El Salvador
SO SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
DE agroforest; biodiversity; conservation; El Salvador; natural history
   collections; shade coffee; taxonomic impediment
AB El Salvador has only 4.3% of its natural forest remaining. The loss of so much natural forest suggests that a large proportion of El Salvador's biodiversity and a number of ecosystem services are at risk. However, 11% of the country's land area supports shade agroforest for coffee production (based on Coffea arabica L.), and this has become the major forest resource for the country. We suggest that shade agroforest supports a considerable amount of native biodiversity but that the capacity to monitor and assess this diversity is lacking. Studies elsewhere in the world indicate that shade agroforest has levels of biological diversity of the same order of magnitude to that of natural forest. Shade agroforest for coffee should therefore play a central role in the conservation of biological diversity in El Salvador. The status of shade agroforest for coffee in national policies on biodiversity conservation is reviewed. We then identify and review the taxonomic capacity required to meet El Salvador's Biodiversity Action Plan and identify significant overlap with the capacity needed to conserve biological diversity in El Salvador's shade coffee farms. Currently, shade coffee is not economically sustainable and shade farms are under threat of conversion to non-forest systems. Developing the taxonomic capacity required to underpin the monitoring and inventory of biological diversity in shade coffee farms could also exploit a synergy between the biodiversity or environmental value and the economic sustainability of shade coffee production. Biological diversity inventory data could, therefore, not only support El Salvador's Biodiversity Action Plan but also generate added value to the coffee price through 'Biodiversity-friendly' and 'Migratory bird-friendiy' premium payments from the specialist coffee market, thereby providing some insurance against the volatility of the open market.

TI Product classification to support approximate life-cycle assessment of

SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
DE product classification; hierarchical clustering; life-cycle assessment;
   conceptual design; learning surrogate LCA models
AB Many companies are beginning to change the way they develop products due to increasing awareness of sustainable development. Designers, who play a key role in product development, are being asked to incorporate environmental criteria into the design process. The need for analytically based conceptual design methods for integrated life-cycle assessment (LCA) has motivated the development of an approximate life-cycle assessment concept based upon learning algorithms. Although preliminary tests on general approximate models showed promise, it was observed that grouping products to create specialized learning surrogate LCA models for different classes of products might further improve results. This paper presents work to develop an automated classification system to support the specialization of surrogate LCA models for different groups of products. Hierarchical clustering is used to guide a systematic identification of product groups based upon environmental categories. These groupings are then used to create automated classification schemes using the C4.5 decision tree algorithm. Although further data are needed to induce good generalization performance, resulting product classification systems are considered to be a viable approach to support specialized learning surrogate LCA models for different classes of products.

TI Embedded industrial production systems - Lessons from waste management
   in zinc production
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
DE embeddedness; zinc production; waste management
AB To meet the sustainability challenge private companies must implement corporate strategies and adopt novel technologies. The technical and social embeddedness of industrial production systems, however, complicates these systems' transition towards sustainability. In the paper, mechanisms and conditions are reported for the development and implementation of waste management options in embedded industrial production systems. The focus is on the Dutch zinc production industry, which had to deal with a major waste problem; the generation of jarosite. The industry's options were to increase the jarosite waste storage capacity, to develop a jarosite treatment process or to switch to a zinc-ore of low-iron content whereby no jarosite waste would be generated anymore. Required conditions appeared to be a combination of technological capability and technical embedding and favourable economics. Case study research, however, revealed that adequate stakeholder management is crucial to address social pressure exerted and to obtain external acceptance for any transition strategy. Whilst appropriate, internal technological capabilities are important, effective interactions with and enrolment of various firm-external actors are crucial. In the case of zinc, access to the heterogeneous external actor network was critical for the development of the jarosite treatment solution direction. In conclusion, both the technical, organizational and social embedding of new technologies are crucial for successful implementation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Industrial ecology and waste infrastructure development: A roadmap for
   the Dutch waste management system
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
DE industrial ecology; waste management; waste policy; recycling; residue
   grade; sustainability; infrastructure development; roadmap
AB Decision-making on waste infrastructures is difficult because waste management is a complex, politically loaded and emotionally charged issue that is neither well structured, nor well understood. While sustainability is the ultimate goal of the EU environmental policy, there is no commonly accepted approach for its realisation. Industrial ecology has been suggested as a roadmap to sustainability. Its prescriptive tier can provide organising principles for more sustainable practices: closed material cycles, cascaded energy use and flexible system configuration. The engineering concepts, grade and recovery, provide a simple yet powerful means to assess policies and infrastructure concepts with respect to sustainability. When combined, industrial ecology and engineering yield sound infrastructure design specifications and decision-making support for waste infrastructure. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

DE policy planning; public transport; sustainable transport; Taiwan
AB Over the past decade, the escalating roadway congestion and environmental deterioration due to heavy use of private vehicles have provoked the Taiwan government to realize the importance of public transport systems. Under the "carrot-and-stick" rationales, the government has formulated public transport policies and exercised a series of related initiatives by providing sufficient and higher quality of public transport services so as to attract more private vehicle users. In this paper, the planning philosophy and policy formulation of Taiwan's public transport development are highlighted. The most important initiatives, including the Five-year Enhancement of Mass Transportation Program and the upgrading public transport schemes in the National Development Plan are examined. Based on previous experience and lessons, we point out the most challenging issues that the government will encounter. Suggestions for the future of public transport planning are also addressed.

AB The paper compares selected life cycle-based (well-to-wheel) studies of fuel/propulsion alternatives for light-duty vehicles with a focus on lignocellulose-derived fuels (hydrogen, Fischer Tropsch liquids, and ethanol). Inter- and intra-study comparisons are completed and analyses are conducted to account for the variability due to differing assumptions surrounding energy accounting and vehicle characteristics. For lignocellulose-derived fuels used in relevant propulsion systems, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions are on average 96% lower for hydrogen, 91% lower for Fischer Tropsch liquids and 86% lower for ethanol as compared to the reference gasoline pathway. Key issues found to impact study results are assumptions regarding feedstock characteristics, vehicle propulsion system efficiency, land use changes and associated carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emissions due to agricultural practices, co-product allocation, energy accounting practices, and expected progress on commercial-scale fuel production processes and associated infrastructure.

   SAVANNA; GROWTH
AB The impact of pasture management on tree regrowth (from seedlings and/or root suckers) was measured from 1982 to 1992 at `Hillgrove' and `Cardigan', near Charters Towers, north-east Queensland. Oversowing introduced legumes and grasses, applying superphosphate and cultivating the soil before sowing had little impact. In contrast, on plots where the trees were killed, the number of stems, height and leaf area indices of regrowth were much greater than on plots with live trees. Heavy stocking rates (1 steer/ha) also greatly reduced stem number and leaf area index of regrowth but these stocking rates were not sustainable. Clearing and killing trees can give large herbage growth responses but the regrowth problems reported here, and other potential negative impacts, necessitate a cautious approach to clearing and careful post-clearing management.

DT Article
ID THAR DESERT
AB This study conducted in arid rangelands of Jaisalmer district in western Rajasthan, India, assessed the effect of root-zone soil moisture and grazing pressure on regenerative potential and fodder yields of Lasiurus sindicus (Sewan) grass. Uncontrolled grazing significantly reduced stand density of grass tussocks and their regeneration compared with sites subjected to controlled grazing or no grazing. The root-zone moisture at 0-30 and 30-60 cm depths controlled sprouting of new shoots whereas moisture at 60-90 cm depth had the greatest impact on growth of new shoots and biomass production. These findings suggest that grazing of grasslands should be controlled to allow a rest period for regeneration, if the Sewan pasturelands are to be maintained on a sustainable basis.

ID SKYSCRAPER; CITY
AB In recent years, amid the debates of sustainable development and urban compactness, there has been a widening interest to reintroduce high-rise living in cities. Several European cities including London and Manchester are once again building high-rise housing as part of their urban housing strategy. Elsewhere, in Asia, Hong Kong and Singapore are distinguished by their high-rise public housing developments. With nearly half of the world's population living in urban areas, the unfolding trend is towards a more urban-style development with taller buildings included as an inevitable housing solution. Drawing on findings from a study of Singapore public housing residents' living experience, this paper aims to look at the increasingly important question of the liveability of high-rise living by discussing the occupants' appreciation and concerns of high-rise.

DE regulation; water industry; weak sustainability
AB Regulation has been the most important driver in encouraging the water industry to move towards sustainability, but increasingly the appropriateness and effectiveness of regulation are being questioned. It is argued that, in its present form, sustainability as presented and supported through regulation equates to a form of weak sustainability that privileges the economic and subordinates the environment and societal spheres of sustainability. To overcome this, requires more long-term perspectives, participatory mechanisms and moves beyond efficiency to intensity of resource use.

AB The Water Framework Directive (WFD) provides a coherent structure within which the problems of diffuse urban pollution can be effectively tackled and managed. The context of impermeable surface water quality within the terms of the Directive are outlined, and the pollutant sources and loadings associated with various urban land uses are identified. Stormwater flows and quality are sufficient to prejudice any 'good' ecological potential, particularly in terms of chronic receiving water sediment toxicity. A simple volume-concentration method for the prediction of pollutant loadings and impact assessment on a subcatchment scale is described and discussed.

ID PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
AB As with other states in Australia, Western Australia is currently undergoing a process of water reform. The purpose of this reform has been to create environmental sustainability and provide economic improvements through the introduction of markets. To ensure that these reforms also have long term social viability, local Water Resource Management Committees (WRMCs) will be formed to provide ongoing advice to government on water resource and allocation issues. Given that over-allocation is not as much of an issue as in other states in Australia, the WRMCs will have an important contribution on water issues relating to fairness and the public interest. Fortunately, there has been a significant amount of research in WA and elsewhere on how these basic concepts can be operationalized in community-based decision making. This paper describes ways this knowledge can be incorporated in ongoing decision making in the context of water reform and issues associated with procedural and distributive justice.

SO WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY

DT Article
AB The ecology of the White-winged Nightjar (Eleothreptus candicans) is poorly known. Only three breeding populations (one from Brazil kind two from Paraguay) are known, and populations tire decreasing due to continuing destruction of cerrado habitat. On 14 September 2003, we took several photos of an unidentified nightjar in Beni Biosphere Reserve, Departmento Beni, Bolivia. The bird was later determined to be an adult male White-winged Nightjar. Interestingly, the only previous record for Bolivia was a male collected in 1987 at the same locality and time of year. Because the White-winged Nightjar is non-migratory and secretive, we hypothesize that (here may be a Sustainable population of White-winged Nightjars in Bolivia, and the paucity of sightings may be due to the species' low delectability.

AB We consider the problem of finding the most sustainable path (MSP) between two nodes in a wireless mobile ad hoc network (MANET). A MSP between two nodes is a path that maximizes the probability of path existence under some probability model. We show how to exploit geometric properties in computing the reliability of a path in the resulting mobility graph G, prove that simple shortest path algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm cannot be directly applied in this scenario, and propose an algorithm for computing a single pair MSP in a modified representation of G. To improve reliability in routing, we also discuss the computation of k most sustainable paths under the link metric and under the standard shortest path formulation.

AB In the 1970s, it appeared that fuelwood use was growing rapidly, and this could have major adverse impacts on the resource and poor users. By the mid-1980s, revised assessments indicated that there was less of a problem than had been foreseen, and much less of a need for forestry interventions to maintain supplies. As a result many of the latter were sharply scaled back. Additional information and analysis that has become available since the 1980s support the view that there is no need for large scale interventions devoted just to provision of fuelwood. However, declining access to supplies or markets can raise significant problems in some areas, and for particular categories of user. Growing urban demand for charcoal can also cause local problems, in particular in Africa. The potentials for appropriate forms of intervention are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Body trunks were isolated from juvenile zooids of the Japanese colonial tunicate Botryllus primigenus and cultured in vitro to establish tissue-specific cell lines. Epidermal cells from some explants spread and formed a flat sheet consisting of vacuolated cells. They then dissociated into single cells, and their growth stopped within two weeks. Continuously proliferating cells were established from four explants. After the 20(th) implantation, nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs were extracted from these cells. The nucleotide sequences of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and mitochondrial large ribosomal RNA (mtlrRNA) completely matched the PCNA and mtIrRNA taken from living colonies of B. primigenus; this shows that the four independently proliferating cells were indeed of the Botryllus origin. One cell line (Bp0306E10) comprised round-shaped cells with a diameter of 8-10 mu m. These cells have been cultured in vitro with a doubling time of approximately 24 hours since June, 2003. The BrdU labeling index was approximately 2%. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the cultured cells recognized a 28 kDa polypeptide and stained free mesenchymal cells in vivo. G418-resistant subclonal cells could be established by introducing a tunicate retrotransposon loaded with the neomycin resistance gene into the cells by electroporation. This study is the first to succeed in producing a sustainable cell culture of Botryllus.

AB Floodplains in and lands can be agriculturally productive, but they can also be geomorphically unstable environments. Many of the floodplains of higher order basins in southern portion of the Basin and Range Province of the American Southwest have been farmed intermittently for hundreds of years, and continuously for the past century. In order to be productive, however, these floodplains were modified considerably by human agency. This paper reviews the different types of human manipulations to floodplains that may result in land degradation and geomorphic change, including vegetation, topography, soils, hydrology, and channel banks. Emphasis is on the direct and indirect consequences of geomorphic modification, and the long-term viability of such changes in the contexts of landscape sensitivity and sustainability. Evidence documents transformation of natural floodplains to agricultural surfaces, with examples from southern Arizona, USA, and Sonora, Mexico. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recreational opportunities and amenities are important human-use services generated by urban greenspaces. This study explored the use of pattern and behavior of urban greenspaces in Guangzhou city, south China. The monetary value of the non-priced benefits was gauged by the contingent valuation method using willingness-to-pay and open-ended payment card approaches. A questionnaire gleaned data by face-to-face interviews of 340 respondents in the 18-70 age group, dwelling in 34 residential street blocks selected by clustered sampling. Guangzhou residents actively used urban greenspaces, accompanied mainly by family members. Parks were the most popular venues, whereas institutional greenspaces served as surrogate parks. Visitation is mainly induced by accessibility, followed by high green coverage and quality of the ambience. Small and low-quality sites near homes were shunned. Residents of the compact city harbored subdued expectation for privacy and solitude. They are accustomed to paying greenspace entrance fees. Ninety-six point six per cent of respondents were willing to pay to use urban greenspaces, notably more than other cities, and indicating the importance of salubrious outdoor recreation as a leisure pursuit. Conservative estimate of average willingness-to-pay was RMB 17.40/person/month (US$ 1.00 = n4B8.26), higher than actual entrance-fee payment. Willingness-to-pay was significantly associated with income, and its marginal effect verified by an ordered probit model which hinted the treatment of urban greenspaces as superior goods. Aggrepte monetary value of urban greenspaces attained RMB547 million per year which outstripped Guangzhou's annual expenditures on urban greenspaces by six times. This study verified the applicability of contingent valuation to urban greenspaces in China with socioeconomic, cultural and political backgrounds that are different from many countries. The results could assist cost-benefit analysis to justify more resources for development and management of urban greenspaces, with implications on incorporating public opinions in a precision planning process in the quest towards sustainable cities.

AB A recurring pattern of declining mean trophic level of fisheries landings, termed "fishing down the food web," is thought to be indicative of the serial replacement of high-trophic-level fisheries with less valuable, low-trophic-level fisheries as the former become depleted to economic extinction. An alternative to this view, that declining mean trophic levels indicate the serial addition of low-trophic-level fisheries ("fishing through the food web"), may be equally severe because it ultimately leads to conflicting demands for ecosystem services. By analyzing trends in fishery landings in 48 large marine ecosystems worldwide, we find that fishing down the food web was pervasive (present in 30 ecosystems) but that the sequential addition mechanism was by far the most common one underlying declines in the mean trophic level of landings. Specifically, only 9 ecosystems showed declining catches of upper-trophic-level species, compared with 21 ecosystems that exhibited either no significant change (n = 6) or significant increases (n = 15) in upper-trophic-level catches when fishing down the food web was occurring. Only in the North Atlantic were ecosystems regularly subjected to sequential collapse and replacement of fisheries. We suggest that efforts to promote sustainable use of marine resources will benefit from a fuller consideration of all processes giving rise to fishing down the food web.

AB An eco-hydrological model of a subtropical urbanizing watershed in south Florida, USA was developed to simulate solar emergy using H.T. Odum's energy systems language as programmed in an iconographic simulation software (i.e., Extend (R)) to provide dynamic valuation of a wetland stormwater management system (WSMS). The solar emergy (i.e., ultimate amount of solar energy required to produce another form of energy) and emdollar (EMS, value an energy flow contributes to an economy based on its proportion of total emergy flow) values of watershed transpiration (a measure of productivity), surface discharge and change in landscape water storage were quantified for various ratios of wetland to upland areas, valuing wetlands in EM$ ha(-1) y(-1). Simulation results indicated that integrating a WSMS into the watershed increased landscape productivity, decreased surface discharge and increased surface water storage. The eco-hydrological value of watershed productivity was 367 EMS ha(-1) y(-1) when 10% of the watershed was wetland, which was an increase of 65 EM$ ha(-1) y(-1) (based on Florida's emergy-to-dollar ratio in 1985, 2 x 10(12) sej $(-1)). The annual contribution of this extra ecological productivity to public welfare was 12 million EMS, which was estimated from the product of eco-hydrological value and local emergy investment ratio of south Dade County (18: 1). Average emdollar value of water saved per unit of wetland was 343 EM$ ha(-1) y(-1). Dynamic emergy accounting provided distributions of solar transformities of hydrologic variables as opposed to more commonly used point estimates. Our work advances the temporal dynamic principles of emergy accounting by demonstrating how solar emergy may be continuously tracked through an ecosystem to estimate the value of nature's life-support services.

AB Compensatory density-dependent processes in fish stocks are critical for the sustainability of fisheries, yet the implications of different mechanisms of density dependence in populations are seldom considered. We examine a size-structured matrix model of an abalone population subject to compensatory density-dependent processes at various life-stages. Matrix elements governing transitions amongst seven length classes are derived from growth, fecundity and mortality data for abalone populations in Australia, employing a probabilistic Gompertz growth model that accurately represents tag-recapture data for these populations. The resulting transition matrix is then modified to take account of density-dependent fecundity, survival and growth processes at various life stages. Equilibrium states of these models are obtained in the absence of fishing. Hypothetical populations at these equilibria are then subjected to fishing pressure and their responses examined. We find that density-dependent fecundity, survival and growth are each sufficient to stabilize these populations under harvesting. Density-dependent fecundity and survival lead to altered population structures after short time delays, while density-dependent growth stabilizes populations over longer time scales. Some forms of density-dependent growth lead to a false recovery from the initial fishing impact, followed by a decline to a lower stable level. The varied response to fishing under different compensatory mechanisms implies that simple stock-recruitment models may not capture key aspects of the dynamics of fishery stocks, nor predict their response to fishing correctly. Since density-dependent growth has been demonstrated for many species, its implications for fisheries deserve further theoretical investigation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the dry areas, water, not land, is the most limiting resource for improved agricultural production. Maximizing water productivity, and not yield per unit of land, is therefore a better strategy for dry farming systems. Under such conditions, more efficient water management techniques must be adopted. Supplemental irrigation (SI) is a highly efficient practice with great potential for increasing agricultural production and improving livelihoods in the dry rainfed areas. In the drier environments, most of the rainwater is lost by evaporation; therefore the rainwater productivity is extremely low. Water harvesting can improve agriculture by directing and concentrating rainwater through runoff to the plants and other beneficial uses. It was found that over 50% of lost water can be recovered at a very little cost. However, socioeconomic and environmental benefits of this practice are far more important than increasing agricultural water productivity. This paper highlights the major research findings regarding improving water productivity in the dry rainfed region of West Asia and North Africa. It shows that substantial and sustainable improvements in water productivity can only be achieved through integrated farm resources management. On-farm water-productive techniques if coupled with improved irrigation management options, better crop selection and appropriate cultural practices, improved genetic make-up, and timely socioeconomic interventions will help to achieve this objective. Conventional water management guidelines should be revised to ensure maximum water productivity instead of land productivity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE system-water balance; Murrumbidgee irrigation area; Rechna Doab;
   Liuyuankou irrigation system; salinity
AB Globally, about 10 Mha of agricultural land is lost annually due to salinisation, of which about 1.5 Mha is in irrigated areas. While some climate and management aspects are common to semi-arid regions, the detailed mechanisms and options to secure ecological sustainability and economic viability may vary considerably from case to case. This paper applies a whole of system-water balance to compare irrigation in three semi-arid regions suffering from similar sustainability issues: Rechna Doab (RD), Pakistan; the Liuyuankou irrigation system (LIS), China; and Murrumbidgee irrigation area (MIA), Australia. Soil salinity, lack of adequate water resources and groundwater management are major issues in these areas. The MIA and LIS irrigation systems also suffer from soil salinity and low water-use efficiency issues. These similarities occur in spite of very different climatic and underlying hydrogeological conditions. The key data used to compare these different regions are climate and soils, available water resources and their use, as well as components of the water balance. In addition, the history of water resource development in these areas is examined to understand how salinity problems emerge in semi-arid regions and the consequences for production. Based on the efficiency parameters and the definitions of sustainability, approaches are explored to solve common environmental problems while maintaining economic viability and environmental sustainability for irrigation systems.

AB Financial valuation OF GMWBs: We develop a variety of methods for assessing the cost and value of a very popular 'rider' available to North American investors on variable annuity (VA) policies called a Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB). The GMWB promises to return the entire initial investment, albeit spread over an extended period of time, regardless of subsequent market performance. First, we take a static approach that assumes individuals behave passively and holds the product to maturity. We show how the product can be decomposed into a Quanto Asian Put plus a generic term-certain annuity. At the other extreme of consumer behavior, the dynamic approach leads to an optimal stopping problem akin to pricing an American put option, albeit complicated by the non-traditional payment structure. Our main result is that the No Arbitrage hedging cost of a GMWB ranges from 73 to 160 basis points of assets. In contrast, most products in the market only charge 30-45 basis points. Although we suggest a number of behavioral reasons for the apparent under-pricing of this feature in a typically overpriced VA market, we conclude by arguing that current pricing is not sustainable and that GMWB fees will eventually have to increase or product design will have to change in order to avoid blatant arbitrage opportunities.

AB Background: Salinization causes negative effects on plant productivity and poses an increasingly serious threat to the sustainability of agriculture. Wild soybean (Glycine soja) can survive in highly saline conditions, therefore provides an ideal candidate plant system for salt tolerance gene mining.
   Results: As a first step towards the characterization of genes that contribute to combating salinity stress, we constructed a full-length cDNA library of Glycine soja (50109) leaf treated with 150 mM NaCl, using the SMART technology. Random expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing of 2,219 clones produced 2,003 cleaned ESTs for gene expression analysis. The average read length of cleaned ESTs was 454 bp, with an average GC content of 40%. These ESTs were assembled using the PHRAP program to generate 375 contigs and 696 singlets. The resulting unigenes were categorized according to the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. The potential roles of gene products associated with stress related ESTs were discussed. We compared the EST sequences of Glycine soja to that of Glycine max by using the blastn algorithm. Most expressed sequences from wild soybean exhibited similarity with soybean. All our EST data are available on the Internet (GenBank_Accn:DT082443 similar to DT084445).
   Conclusion: The Glycine soja ESTs will be used to mine salt tolerance gene, whose full-length cDNAs will be obtained easily from the full-length cDNA library. Comparison of Glycine soja ESTs with those of Glycine max revealed the potential to investigate the wild soybean's expression profile using the soybean's gene chip. This will provide opportunities to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying stress response of plants.

AB Land cover classification over large geographic areas using remotely sensed data is increasingly common as a result of the requirements of national inventory and monitoring programmes, scientific modelling and international environmental treaties. Although large-area land cover products are more prevalent, standard operational protocols for their validation do not exist. This paper provides a framework for the accuracy assessment of large-area land cover products and synthesizes some of the key decision points in the design and implementation of an accuracy assessment from the literature. The fundamental components of a validation plan are addressed and the framework is then applied to the land cover map of the forested area of Canada that is currently being produced by the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development programme. This example demonstrates the compromise between the theoretical aspects of accuracy assessment and the practical realities of implementation, over a specific jurisdiction. The framework presented in this paper provides an example for others embarking on the assessment of large-area land cover products and can serve as the foundation for planning a statistically robust validation.

In an outdoor situation, one or more cells connected in series might be shaded. The shaded cells then have to transport the current of the module in reverse bias.
   Here, a study of the processes and interfaces involved in the electron transport of a DSC under reverse bias is presented. Furthermore, the effect of these processes on the long-term stability of a DSC is evaluated.
   The I-V characteristic of a DSC under reverse bias differs significantly from a typical diode I-V characteristic. Compared to other solar cell technologies, in particular crystalline silicon solar cells, the largest sustainable reversed biased voltage (breakdown voltage) of a DSC is extremely low (approximately 500 mV). Therefore, in terms of power output, no bypass diodes are required, when connecting DSC in series.
   In order to identify the processes and the interfaces involved in the charge carrier transport in reverse bias, a batch of different electrode set-ups was built that consisted of single components of a standard DSC.
   It was shown that charge transport under reverse bias directly occurs via the electrolyte/TCO (transparent conducting oxide) interface, catalysed by the dye molecules. The charge transfer is highly asymmetrical, with a symmetry parameter of approximately 0.35, using a simple Butler-Vollmer model.
   Electrical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the TiO2-layer is not significantly involved in the electron transport under reverse bias.
   To study the effect of reverse biasing on the long-term stability of DSC. solar cells were subjected to a constant reverse current in the dark 0 for more than 100 h. The voltage drop over the cell was monitored. It increased only slightly, without reaching critical values, which would damage the cell irreversibly. No degradation in overall efficiency was observed for more than 100 h. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Saving of bath chemicals and freshwater Consumed within metal finishing systems and the reduction of wastewater produced can be important steps towards more sustainable processes. Furthermore, the application of regenerators is usually energy intensive. Accordingly, in an "eco-eco" (ECO) trade-off, importance should be given to both economic benefits as well as to several ecological measures. The approach presented here is the synthesis of in ECO-optimal reuse and recovery network (RRN) based on a simultaneous multi-objective system optimization model with dynamically chosen environmental objective. It includes a conventional cost objective and the potential environmental impact of the system. This second objective is represented by the maximal relative increase of indicator results. This, in turn, derives from a sensitivity analysis of life cycle inventory analysis (LCIA) integrated into mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). This means, the LCA-rule, which claims that environmental indicators must not be aggregated, can be adhered strictly. In the case study, the synthesis procedure for eco-optimal design is applied to a large scale phosphating. Depending on the weighting ratio for the representative impact factor and the cost in the objective function, Pareto-optimal solution sets were calculated allowing to assess different eco-optimal RRN alternatives and to find a way out of the main dilemma between the contradicting behavior of energy demand and wastewater production. Up to 74% improvement in tennis of environmental indicators could be realized at low cost increase. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In semi-arid conditions in Northwest India, smallholder agriculture has made increasing use of subsidised mechanisation and energy inputs to reduce short-term risks. However, detrimental environmental consequences have occurred, not least a rapidly falling water table, and energy-intensive production is threatened by the prospect of increasing scarcity and expense of energy supplies, especially as urban demands are forecast to grow rapidly. This paper describes the energy flows through four subsystems of smallholder agricultural villages: the crop system; non-crop land uses; livestock systems; and households. It employs a multi-objective programming model to demonstrate choices available for maximands either of net solar energy capture or financial surpluses. Applied to three villages selected to represent major settlement types in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, the results demonstrate that both energy conservation and financial performance can be improved. Although these results need qualifying because of the reductionist, linear character of the model used, they do provide important insights into the cultural role of mechanisation and the influence of traditional agricultural practices. They also underline the need for local energy conservation strategies as part of an overall approach to improved self-determination in progress towards rural sustainability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Environmental concerns and tightened environmental policy parameters have been associated with the notion of additional costs of compliance rather than with innovation and sustainability. The contrary, has also been suggested, claiming that strict environmental legislation merely serves as a catalyst for firms to retain obvious economic and environmental mutual gains-so called win-wins-laying around waiting to be collected. Such implications can be seen from the Porter and van der Linde writings, heavily criticised by Palmer et al. as being built on faulty examples. This paper supports that conclusion and uses property rights and transactions costs theories to find private incentives to explore the win-wins for those actors who have the largest potentials to diminish the pressure on our environment. By applying the Coase theorem, emphasising transaction costs and property rights, this paper argues that strong public support is needed to create private incentives for exploring economic and environmental win-win innovations. The public support suggested is to (A) extend producer responsibilities-where the same costs which may be neglected by the end consumers will, if transferred to the design owner, be viewed as a production cost-and to (B) enforce environmental public procurement. Both may be combined with a support to (C) actors (such as non-governmental organisations and consumer agencies) positioning themselves as information bridges by informing the consumers. The negative effects of asymmetric information among actors can, thereby, be diminished as well as the low interest to primarily care for the environment among common consumers.

AB The 1987 Montreal Protocol is widely seen as a global environmental accord that has produced tangible results in terms of reductions in ozone-depleting substances. In addition, there have been other benefits, largely unrecognized and undocumented, that can best be characterized in a sustainable development framework based on a review of 50 out of 931 projects implemented over a 13 year period by one of the four implementing agencies of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol. All investment projects have reduced ozone depleting potential and global warming potential. Some projects have reduced atmospheric emissions and contamination of groundwater. Other projects have increased the competitiveness of enterprises in domestic and international markets and have sustained and in a few cases created employment opportunities. Others, fewer in number, have potentially contributed to environmental problems, have initially created difficulties in maintaining productivity and quality standards and have decreased the number of employment opportunities because of the need to rationalize manufacturing processes.
   The potential contributions from Multilateral Fund investment projects to sustainable development could probably have been amplified with project design guidance for the technical staffs of all three implementing agencies executing investment projects. In thinking about other multilateral environmental agreements, one can see the need for similar guidance for Global Environment Facility funded projects supporting the focal areas of climate change, international waters, ozone depletion and persistent organic pollutants. Some of them have the potential to generate multiple beneficial impacts in addition to their stated environmental objective if designed and implemented within a sustainable development framework.

AB This paper evaluates the dynamic effects of adding an endogenous process for human population growth into a renewable resource-based economic growth model. Endogenizing human population growth in a static, constant technology form of the model gives rise to a dynamically complex system, with the possibility of multiple steady states of several types, and unusual comparative static responses to changes in the system's parameters. Adding technological progress to the model gives rise to the possibility of multiple sustainable paths for the variables in the system. These results reinforce concerns raised by ecological economists about systems stability and sustainability, since exogenous shocks to the system could move the economy from higher welfare to lower welfare equilibria or, in the model with technological progress, from higher welfare to lower welfare sustainable growth paths. Moreover, this kind of dynamic complexity adds to the management challenge faced by policy makers, who could confront the necessity of maneuvering the economy among different equilibria or sustainable growth paths.

AB The international community - including Slovenia, which recently became a EU member state - has expressed its commitment to sustainable development. The methods necessary to measure the degrees of success in achieving this final goal must be developed in parallel. Recently, the ecological footprint method has gained more prominence. In this paper, for the first time, the Slovenian ecological footprint is presented. It was found that current ecological footprint of Slovenia (3.85 gha/capita) exceeds the available biological productive areas (2.55 gha/capita) and significantly exceeds the biological productive areas of the planet (1.9 gha/capita). Therefore, Slovenia must be classified as a country with non-sustainable development, both on locally and globally scale. Because of the large influence of the energy supply on the ecological footprint, several national strategies and international directives promoting energy conservation and renewable energy sources were accepted. These documents were taken into consideration when predicting the future ecological footprint of Slovenia for the year 2020. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite great recent progress, hunger and poverty remain widespread and agriculturally driven environmental damage is widely prevalent. The idea of agricultural sustainability centers on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, and that lead to improvements in food productivity. Here we show the extent to which 286 recent interventions in 57 poor countries covering 37 M ha (3% of the cultivated area in developing countries) have increased productivity on 12.6 M farms while improving the supply of critical environmental services. The average crop yield increase was 79% (geometric mean 64%). All crops showed water use efficiency gains, with the highest improvement in rainfed crops. Potential carbon sequestered amounted to an average of 0.35 t C ha(-1) y(-1). If a quarter of the total area under these farming systems adopted sustainability enhancing practices, we estimate global sequestration could be 0.1 Gt C y(-1). Of projects with pesticide data, 77% resulted in a decline in pesticide use by 71% while yields grew by 42%. Although it is uncertain whether these approaches can meet future food needs, there are grounds for cautious optimism, particularly as poor farm households benefit more from their adoption.

AB More attention has been given to tree size diversity in boreal forests over the past few years, mainly because of increased focus on uneven-aged forest management, biodiversity and social values. Objective measures of tree size diversity are needed in order to develop management plans that are sustainable with respect to ecological and economical values. The objective of the present study was to evaluate different indices describing diameter diversity based on criteria related to applications in forest management planning. Eight previously described indices were evaluated based on 16 simulated and 174 empirical diameter distributions. The Gini coefficient was found superior with respect to discriminant ability, capability of providing logical ranking of different distributions and sensitivity to variation in sample size. There is a wide range of possible applications of the Gini coefficient in forest management planning, e.g. to compare tree size diversity in different stands, to assess changes in tree size diversity over time, to quantify the influence of different silvicultural treatments on tree size diversity and to assess areas suitable for certain silvicultural treatments. The coefficient can also be used as an integrated part of growth simulators in order to control the silvicultural treatments in projections. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In NW Patagonia, forestry with rapid growing species is an expanding practice, especially in the semi-arid steppe. To provide data for managing forests for biodiversity, we studied the impact of forestry on the native ant assemblages. We sampled ants using pitfall traps in a wide geographical area, including steppe sites and pine plantations, both dense (forest cover 87% in average) and sparse (forest cover 52% in average) designs. We measured and analyzed ant abundance, species richness and species composition as response variables. Through our results, we show that ants are highly sensitive to pine tree forests. Ant abundance within plantations is lower and species composition significantly impoverished. However, the more open plantations sustained ant assemblages which resemble those of the native steppe samples. This is probably because the open forests allow for native under-story vegetation to grow as in the natural steppe sites. We suggest that tree presence in an otherwise shrub and grass dominated area is responsible for the changes in the ant assemblages. We also note that the presence of native vegetation cover predicts ant assemblage composition in these arid zones. From an applied point of view, our findings suggest that a more open plantation design will be accompanied by higher ant abundances and species richness, which in turn may bring about consequences for sustainable forest management in the area.

AB Fire exclusion and high-grade logging have altered the structure and function of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests across the American West. Restoration treatments are increasingly being used in these forests to move stand density, structure, and species composition toward more historically sustainable conditions. Yet little research has focused on how restoration treatments influence the associated understory plant communities, particularly in the northern Rocky Mountains of the USA. To this end, we implemented a replicated (N = 3), randomized block experiment in a second-growth western Montana ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest that initiated after harvest in the early 1900s and has not burned since. We evaluated the effects of no action (control), silvicultural cutting (thin-only), spring burning (burn-only), and silvicultural cutting followed by spring burning (thin-burn) on the understory community. Treatments were implemented at an operational scale (9 ha). Data were collected before treatment and in three subsequent years, at two spatial scales: plot (1000 m(2)) and quadrat (I m(2)). Richness, Simpson's evenness index, and cover were calculated for the total vascular plant community. Species origin and lifeform were used to further investigate richness and cover responses to treatment. Treatments differentially impacted the understory community, with the most dramatic changes in the thin-burn. The burn-only treatment initially reduced richness and cover of the understory, but by year three all active treatments increased plot-scale understory richness relative to pre-treatment and the control. Simpson's evenness increased the first growing season after burning, but was not influenced by treatment in subsequent years. Forbs, both native and exotic, were the most responsive lifeform and increased in richness and cover after thinning, with the greatest response in the thin-burn. Increased native richness was not detected at the quadrat-scale in any treatment, but was significant at the plot-scale in numerous combinations of treatments and years. A short-term reduction in shrub richness and abundance after burning was detected at the quadrat-scale. Sapling density was reduced in all active treatments. Although active treatments create more open overstories and increase understory diversity at the stand level, a mix of treated and untreated areas will likely maximize heterogeneity and diversity at the landscape scale.

AB Studies of land-use/land cover change are an important means for examining the viability of community-based programs for forest conservation, although an analysis of the social processes influencing land-use decisions is necessary to understand the factors leading to different conservation outcomes.
   In this paper, we demonstrate that an analysis of locally recognized land-use rules and regulations embedded in local institutions can inform remote-sensing approaches by helping: (1) to elucidate some of the local perceptions, criteria and interactions with outside agencies that drive conservation actions and (2) to better interpret the spatial patterns of land-use change and forest conservation revealed by remote-sensing data.
   Based on a case study of a forest ejido from the Maya Zone of Quintana Roo, Mexico, we evaluate changes in forest cover and in local land-use regulations before and after the initiation in the mid-1980s of a community forestry program, the Plan Piloto Forestal (PPF). Methods included development of a time series of land cover maps based on LANDSAT imagery from 1976, 1988, 1991, 1997 and 2000, as well as interviews and participant observation with local farmers and community leaders.
   Results indicate a high degree of forest conservation on community lands with net rates of forest loss of 0.6-0.7%/year. Locally recognized conservation regulations included a number of forest reserves as well as regulations which protect specific forest types, resulting from both local initiatives and interventions of external agencies. These initiatives included but were not limited to the PPF, highlighting the importance of evaluating community-based conservation programs within a broader historical context. Conservation regulations protecting an important commercial non-timber forest product (Manilkara zapota) pre-dated the PPF and may have facilitated its implementation. In the most accessible agricultural areas, the only mature forest patches were customary forest reserves and an area regenerated from secondary forests, protected due to enrichment plantings of commercial timbers. Recognition of local Maya terminology used to distinguish forest types was crucial for proper interpretation of local land-use regulations, which revealed that less-valued forest types may not be adequately protected on community lands.
   We suggest that future research should examine the significance of the less-valued forest types for global biodiversity conservation. In addition careful consideration of the historical antecedents and community institutions which may have facilitated the implementation of the Plan Piloto Forestal will be important for the successful application of this model of community forestry to other socio-economic and cultural contexts.

AB Understanding the effect of agriculture on the availability of non-timber forest products (NTFP) is currently relevant. Many landscapes are dominated by agricultural fields and fallow lands, so we should understand the status of NTFP in these landscapes. We studied the availability of leaves of xa'an palm trees (Sabal yapa Wright ex Beccari) in the shifting cultivation systems among the Yucatec Maya in Mexico. The mature leaves of this species of palm have been widely used for roofing since prehispanic times until present days; in the year 2000, approximately 90,000 people used S. yapa in Quintana Roo, and 360,000 used Sabal spp. in the Yucatin peninsula. This palm is managed by Maya farmers who spare palm trees when clearing a forest patch to turn it into maize fields (milpa). We compared the population structure and leaf production rate in different stages of the shifting cultivation cycle (milpa, fallow lands and forest), and quantified the domestic leaf demand in the village of X-Maben, state of Quintana Roo. In addition, we projected future availability of xa'an leaves, and estimated the period after which this might not be sufficient enough to cover the local demand of some villages and municipalities of Quintana Roo. Our results suggest that one of the consequences of shifting cultivation is the decrease in the availability and quality of this NTFR Decreasing availability is a result of variations in population structure and leaf production rates between agriculture and forest patches. These negative effects may increase as agriculture becomes more intensive. Currently, the complete mosaic landscape created by this practice still offers sufficient resources for the local inhabitants in many communities. Besides, this NTFP has a high commercial potential in the tourist area. Our study suggests that the harvest of S. yapa in natural systems is sustainable for nine more decades and will be compatible with shifting cultivation as long as land tenure remains communal, there are long fallow periods and other factors remain unchanged.

AB For over a century, the negative exponential relationship of tree density to diameter has been observed and considered an indicator of equilibrium forest structure, especially at the stand level. More recent studies have suggested that other forms of diameter distributions should be considered "balanced". Some of these seemingly contradictory findings can be resolved by understanding the impacts of scale and sampling area on the possibility of observing a negative exponential distribution. We calculated the minimum area required to sample the smallest number of trees necessary to produce hypothetical negative exponential distributions. The minimum area is influenced greatly by the maximum diameter and the exponential decrease rate of the distribution. It is also influenced by the width of diameter classes used to summarize the data, and the basal area per hectare of the sample. These differences in minimum required sampling area are important considerations because some recent studies that suggest a rotated sigmoid distribution, rather than negative exponential, is more characteristic of old-growth forests may have used sampling schemes that were insufficient to observe a negative exponential distribution even if one existed. Others have used criteria in selecting sampling locations that ensure a high density of large trees, thereby precluding them from observing a negative exponential distribution even if one existed. Our review suggests that within-stand sampling areas for testing diameter distribution in temperate forests typically need to exceed I ha, especially in mature to old-growth stages, though mortality rate, diameter class width, and total stand basal area all affect the area or number of prism points needed. Diameter distributions have rarely been assessed at the landscape scale. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to expect that landscape distributions may generally be negative exponential and the slope of the line (i.e. the mortality rate) may be an important measure of landscape dynamics. Old-growth landscapes where natural disturbances are typically small patches will have a lower mortality rate than those where disturbances are more frequent and widespread.

AB Floods can destroy fish habitat. During a flood a fish has to seek shelters (refuges) to survive. It is necessary to know the maximum discharge that the fish can sustain against the strong current. Ecological and hydraulic engineers can simulate the flow condition of high flow for designing the refuge when restoring and enhancing the rivers are needed. Based on the average ratio of the mean and maximum velocities invariant with time, discharge and water level, this paper tries to introduce the concept of ecological high flow. The mean-maximum velocity ratio can be used to estimate the mean velocity of the river. If the maximum velocity of the cross section is replaced by the maximum sustained swimming speeds of fish, the mean velocity of ecological high flow can be calculated with the constant ratio. The cross-sectional area can be estimated by the gage height. Then the ecological high flow can be estimated as the product of mean velocity of ecological high flow multiplied by the cross-sectional area. The available data of the upstream of the Dacha River where is the habitat of the Formosan landlocked salmon were used to illustrate the estimation of the ecological high flow. Any restoration project at Sonmou that try to improve the stream habitat can use the ecological high flow to design the hydraulic structure at suitable location to offer refuges for the Formosan landlocked salmon that is an endangered species in Taiwan Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Survival from cutaneous melanoma is mainly dependent on the thickness of the lesion at diagnosis. Skin screening may increase detection of thin lesions and hence improve survival. Within a community-based randomized controlled trial of a population screening program for melanoma in Queensland, Australia, 9 communities were randomly assigned to the 3-year intervention and 9 communities to the control group. Skin screening prevalence was monitored by cross-sectional surveys at baseline, 1, 2 and 3 years into the intervention and 2 years later. At baseline, prevalence of whole-body clinical skin examination was similar in intervention and control communities. In intervention communities, the prevalence of whole-body skin examinations increased to 29.2%, an absolute difference of 18% from baseline, with a peak of 34.8% 2 years after baseline, and began to decline again at the end of the intervention period. The largest increases were seen in men and women >= 50 years. Uptake of screening did not differ according to melanoma risk factors; however, the decline in screening was less in participants who reported a number of melanoma risk factors. The prevalence of skin self-examination remained stable during the intervention program. No changes were observed in the control communities. These results indicate that the intervention program significantly increased the prevalence of whole-body clinical skin examinations in intervention communities. Once the intervention program ceased, and particularly after skin clinics ceased, levels of skin screening began to decline. The provision of specialized skin screening clinics may be needed to achieve sufficient screening rates should population based screening for skin cancer be considered. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Objective-To describe the number and types of veterinary professional degree and certificate programs providing education in the area of public practice to veterinarians and determine the availability of these programs via distance learning.
   Procedures-Web-based internet searches were performed for programs for veterinary public practice or public health, population medicine, or Master's degree in Epidemiology. The information reviewed was derived from individual school and program Web sites and from personal e-mail correspondence with school administrators.
   Results-17 professional degree and 4 certificate programs were available to provide education and training in the areas of public practice and population medicine to veterinarians. Twelve of these programs have begun since 1998. Of the 17 professional degree programs, 7 are located in the United States and 10 are located in other countries. Nine of the professional degree programs provide education through traditional teaching methods, and 8 provide education and training through distance learning.
   Conclusions-During the preceding 5 years, the number of programs available to educate and train veterinarians in the areas of public practice and population medicine has increased. Distance learning is being used to increase capacity and reach a broader audience of veterinarians. With the increase in programs has come an increase in capacity to educate and train veterinarians in the fields of population medicine and public practice. The impact and sustainability of this increased capacity have not been evaluated.

ID YIELD COMPONENTS; SOIL-SALINITY; GROWTH
AB Iran's groundwater resources have been over-exploited, often at the expense of deteriorating water and land quality, and there is limited room for expanding its irrigation agriculture. Thus, the possible use of Caspian Sea water, whose salinity is well below that of open seas, for supplementary irrigation has some appeal. The impact of irrigation with diluted Caspian Sea water on the growth and yield of barley and on the characteristics of soil was investigated in field plots and in pot experiments during the 2001-2002 growing season. Three irrigation regimes of well water alone (I-0); Caspian Sea water diluted with well water and used at stem elongation (I-1); and the same diluted sea water used at ear formation (I-2). A rainfed treatment (I-r) was also added to the field experiments. The results of both pot and field experiments show that a 1:1 mixture of Caspian Sea and well water can be used for irrigation without a significant reduction in the growth and yield of barley, provided that it is not applied earlier than the time of ear formation. This would amount to a significantly reduced demand on the limited ground water resources of the region for agricultural use. However, when this mixture was applied at the earlier time of stem elongation, significant yield reduction occurred. All other growth components of barley plants were also adversely affected by this early application of diluted sea water. Soil analysis after harvest showed that the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract had increased significantly in both diluted sea water treatments. This may suggest that the mixing of sea and ground waters at the rates used in these experiments may not be sustainable over a long period of time and soil salinization may occur unless soils are of light texture and sufficient good quality fresh water or winter rain is available to lower the salinity of soil between successive crops. No significant interaction between irrigation salinity and fertiliser treatments was observed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is one of the most important global environmental challenges, with implications for food production, water supply, health, energy, etc. Addressing climate change requires a good scientific understanding as well as coordinated action at national and global level. This paper addresses these challenges. Historically, the responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions' increase lies largely with the industrialized world, though the developing countries are likely to be the source of an increasing proportion of future emissions. The projected climate change under various scenarios is likely to have implications on food production, water supply, coastal settlements, forest ecosystems, health, energy security, etc. The adaptive capacity of communities likely to be impacted by climate change is low in developing countries. The efforts made by the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol provisions are clearly inadequate to address the climate change challenge. The most effective way to address climate change is to adopt a sustainable development pathway by shifting to environmentally sustainable technologies and promotion of energy efficiency, renewable energy, forest conservation, reforestation, water conservation, etc. The issue of highest importance to developing countries is reducing the vulnerability of their natural and socio-economic systems to the projected climate change. India and other developing countries will face the challenge of promoting mitigation and adaptation strategies, bearing the cost of such an effort, and its implications for economic development.

DT Article
DE emission scenario; GHG; methane; nitrous oxide; energy choices
ID EFFICIENCY; PERMITS; EQUITY; POLICY
AB This paper presents emission scenarios for India, constructed following the IPCC SIZES framework. Analysis spans 21st century and is centered on energy sector CO2 emission. Scenario stories presume no explicit climate intervention; however differences in endogenous profiles of key drivers like technologies have profound indirect impact on GHG emissions. Across scenarios, aggregate emission trajectories vary significantly, thus proving that endogenous development choices are key determinants of emission paths. The paper therefore argues that development policies and actions, which alter profiles of key drivers of development should be essential elements of climate mitigation strategies.
   Scenario results show that India's per capita emission during the century would rank amongst the lowest. Stabilization at a 550 ppmv CO2 concentration would induce significant changes in energy and technology mix and economic losses in India. Stabilization burden would be lower in scenarios where underlying development paths are sustainable. The near-term energy choices, given their path dependence, could deliver sustained development and climate benefits. Aligning development and climate actions, therefore, is advisable and feasible. The regime instruments, the paper concludes, should aim to first support endogenous climate-friendly actions and then to induce climate centric actions in addition.

AB The need to document and conserve biodiversity has become a necessity in the wake of increased threats from deforestation, alteration in land use, soil degradation, pollution and climatic change. Developing technologies with more predictive capabilities could help the society address some of the concerns affecting nature and biodiversity. Current electronic inventories provide limited information on biodiversity, its environmental status, bioclimate, evolutionary history and management units of conservation. This communication explains a system that provides species-specific and site-specific information with improved data semantics to help conservation monitoring, eco-restoration and sustainable use of biological resources.

TI Strategies for sustainable dye harvest of the purple conch Plicopurpura

AB The purple conch, Plicopurpura pansa, occurs on rocky shores of the tropical eastern Pacific of North and Central America, ranging from Magdalena Bay, Baja California to Colombia. When disturbed, it exudes a secretion that photo-oxidizes to an intense purple hue. This product has been used as a dye for ceremonial dresses. Unlike the case in other dye-producing molluscs, it is not necessary to sacrifice individuals to obtain the dye, allowing repetitive "milking" of the same animal without causing mortality. Evaluation of population parameters, rates of dye produced as a function of age at first milking, and milking frequency allowed us to simulate different exploitation scenarios and to evaluate strategies to determine the most profitable exploitation intensity and optimum milking frequencies. Laboratory experiments and field data showed that mortality occurs when the interval between milking is lower than 21 days. The most profitable exploitation strategies suggest that up to 310 L of dye in 50 kin of shoreline length can be harvested during the three-month milking season. This volume of dye is sufficient to stain up to 260 skeins of cotton thread. Simulations showed that the stocks can withstand sustainable exploitation along their distribution range, allowing commercial exploitation of the dye produced by stocks of purple conch in other areas apart from those where it currently takes place, benefiting other groups of fishers elsewhere and ensuring the conservation of this tradition.

TI Barriers and incentives to orphan care in a time of AIDS and economic
   crisis: a cross-sectional survey of caregivers in rural Zimbabwe
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID AFRICA; COMMUNITY; CHILDREN
AB Background: Africa is in an orphan-care crisis. In Zimbabwe, where one-fourth of adults are HIV-positive and one-fifth of children are orphans, AIDS and economic decline are straining society's ability to care for orphans within their extended families. Lack of stable care is putting thousands of children at heightened risk of malnourishment, emotional underdevelopment, illiteracy, poverty, sexual exploitation, and HIV infection, endangering the future health of the society they are expected to sustain.
   Methods: To explore barriers and possible incentives to orphan care, a quantitative cross-sectional survey in rural eastern Zimbabwe asked 371 adults caring for children, including 212 caring for double orphans, about their well-being, needs, resources, and perceptions and experiences of orphan care.
   Results: Survey responses indicate that: 1) foster caregivers are disproportionately female, older, poor, and without a spouse; 2) 98% of non-foster caregivers are willing to foster orphans, many from outside their kinship network; 3) poverty is the primary barrier to fostering; 4) financial, physical, and emotional stress levels are high among current and potential fosterers; 5) financial need may be greatest in single-orphan AIDS-impoverished households; and 6) struggling families lack external support.
   Conclusion: Incentives for sustainable orphan care should focus on financial assistance, starting with free schooling, and development of community mechanisms to identify and support children in need, to evaluate and strengthen families' capacity to provide orphan care, and to initiate and support placement outside the family when necessary.

AB The Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. (KEPCO) and Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (MMC) have been jointly developing intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The operation temperatures between 600 and 800 degrees C were set as the target, which enable SOFC to use less expensive metallic separators for cell-stacking and to carry Out internal reforming of hydrocarbon fuels. The electrolyte-supported planar-type cells were fabricated using highly conductive lanthanum gallate-based electrolyte, La(Sr)Ga(Mg,Co)O3-delta, Ni-(CeO2)(1-x)(SmO1.5), cermet anode, and Sm(Sr)CoO3-delta cathode. The 1 kW-class power generation modules were fabricated using a seal-less stack of the cells and metallic separators. The 1 kW-class prototype power generation system with the module was developed with the high performance cell, which showed the thermally self-sustainability. The system included an SOFC module, a dc-ac inverter, a desulfurizer, and a heat recovery unit. It provided stable ac power output of 1 kW with the electrical efficiency of 45% LHV based on ac output by using city gas as a fuel, which was considered to be excellent for such a small power generation system. And the hot water of 90 degrees C was obtained using high temperature off-as from SOFC. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To achieve effective, sustainable and acceptable water recycling, the need for integrated and multidisciplinary management is now well recognised. The complexity of interacting technical, socio-cultural and environmental factors requires approaches which are responsible, robust and adaptable. This paper describes the toolkit which is being developed for managing the Hawkesbury Water Recycling Scheme. A management plan based upon the logic of environmental management systems provides the basic structure of the toolkit, with supporting systems including those relating to organisational support, decision support, monitoring and research, communication, and an external interface. Lessons learned to date suggest that this form of management approach can assist in operationalising principles of sustainability and adaptive management in relation to water recycling.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Water reuse and recycling is the subject of intense scrutiny in Australia as demand for the resource approaches sustainable supply limits. In many cases this has resulted in substantive work being undertaken to understand the engineering or technical solutions to recycling problems. In addition, much of the focus on wastewater recycling is centred on larger urban communities where the scale of engineering works is most likely to prove financially defensible. However, focusing attention solely on recycling from this relatively narrow perspective overlooks the broader catchment-wide benefits of improved wastewater treatment, particularly in smaller communities. This paper contends that improving wastewater treatment in such communities provides significant recycling opportunities that extend beyond the immediate locale. On this premise, the growing interest in improved wastewater treatment in rural Victoria is explored before offering a methodology for quantifying individual preferences in small towns.

AB Gerringong and Gerroa are coastal towns with 3,500 permanent local residents. They are located 120 km from Sydney on the southeast coast of Australia. The region is a popular holiday destination and very well known for its diversified flora and fauna, as well as its beaches. The main local industries are dairy farming and tourism. The Gerringong Gerroa Sewerage Scheme, commissioned in 2002, and designed to meet the local community's needs up to the year 2022 for an estimated population of 11,000, has brought significant benefits to the area. For example, improved housing and commercial development due to sewer reticulation and a sustainable agricultural-based reuse system designed to use greater than 80% of the treated effluent and 100% reuse of the biosolids. The Gerringong Gerroa Sewerage Scheme is the culmination of an intensive environmental impact assessment process and community input to provide the area with a state-of-the-art wastewater treatment system.

AB BlueScope Steel's Port Kembla Steelworks is situated on a 760 hectare site approximately 80 kin south of Sydney on the NSW south coast. Port Kembla Steelworks is a 5.1 mil t/y integrated steelworks operating in the top quartile of the world's lowest cost producers. Ten years ago BlueScope Steel was using 55 ML/d of water with a key performance indicator (KPI) of 5.5 kL/slab tonne. By the end of 2004, through a series of capital improvements and recycling schemes water consumption was reduced and water efficiency doubled to take 36 ML/d of water with a KPI of 2.6 kL/slab tonne. By comparison, most steel mills in the US use between 3 and 4 kL/t. By June 2005, with involvement in Sydney Water's Illawarra Waste Water Strategy, Australia's biggest sewage recycling scheme, demand was to be reduced by a further 20 ML/d. The BlueScope Steel Site water reduction program is a sign of the company's commitment to sustainable steel production, to the company bond to work within the community, and is a result of the partnership shared with Sydney Water.

AB The Water Reclamation and Management Scheme (WRAMS) at Sydney Olympic Park was built as part of the Olympic Games in 2000. The Scheme was designed to treat raw domestic sewage into recycled water which is then sold back to consumers. The main elements of WRAMS are a water reclamation plant, a water treatment plant, storm water collection, clean water storage and recycled water delivery systems. WRAMS is owned by the Sydney Olympic Park Authority and operated by United KG; it provides continuous recycled water for irrigation, water fountains and domestic/residential uses to Sydney Olympic Park and the surrounding suburb of Newington. The Scheme saves more that 800 ML of drinking water each year and is projected to increase up to more than 1000 ML in coming years.

AB Two case studies are described that explain the role, value, limitations and policy requirements for storing reclaimed water in aquifers for indirect reuse. The first case involves aquifer storage and recovery of water, the product of tertiary treated municipal sewage effluent, via a single injection and recovery well at Bolivar, South Australia. The recovered water, like the source water for injection, is used for unrestricted irrigation of horticulture. A limestone aquifer at a depth of 100 to 160 in confined by clay and containing brackish groundwater provides the storage zone. In the second case, located at Alice Springs, trials are proceeding to assist in the design and establishment of a soil-aquifer treatment system which will allow water derived from secondary treatment of municipal sewage effluent to be stored in an unconfined alluvial aquifer for irrigation of horticulture. Intermittent infiltration from basins provides supplementary water treatment. In each case, the motivations, choice of methods, required investigations, public consultation processes, and economics of subsurface storage are presented. The lessons learned that may assist with development of policies to facilitate environmentally sustainable subsurface storage of water in water reuse projects are discussed.

AB The mounting necessity for recycle and reuse of water presents global challenges to our abilities to meet ongoing needs for water suitable for human consumption. Coupled with this is the reality that current practices of treating the total water demands of communities to levels required for human consumption are not indefinitely sustainable. Viable alternative strategies that integrate more effective water recovery for potable reuse with improved means for production and delivery of higher quality water for human consumption are thus essential. Given the inherent advantages of flexibility and responsiveness associated with decentralization of complex functions and operations, the strategic dispersal of flexible advanced treatment and control technologies throughout water transport and storage networks is one logical alternative to consider. Integration of advanced technology satellite systems with cost-critical components of current water infrastructures would facilitate optimal cost-effective applications of highly sophisticated advanced technologies within the context of existing treatment and distribution/collection systems. Most importantly, it would provide markedly enhanced "personal water" quality and significant potential for energy recovery.

AB The efficient use of water to meet the social, economic and environmental needs of our communities is becoming a consistent theme throughout much of Australia. This is particularly important for the Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water (GWMWater) region, especially given the extremely dry period currently being experienced. One of the options attracting the interest of government, community and industry as an accepted alternative to the finite limited fresh water supplies, is the use of recycled water, or treated wastewater. For over 30 years GWMWater has led the Victorian Water industry in recycled water use, with now over 92% reuse of urban wastewater now used within the region. GWMWater supplies over 30 customers with recycled water and has developed a process that assesses the technical, environmental, economic and social aspects of recycled water initiatives. A recycled water strategy has been development based on sustainability (Triple Bottom Line) principles and seeks to balance the development needs for water with emerging environmental imperatives [1]. To strengthen the process, GWMWater engages the community and stakeholders in the assessment and decision-making process, resulting in improved understanding of recycled water use viability issues and management requirements.

AB Water recycling is one of the important strategies that are currently being considered to reduce mains water consumption and relieve the pressure on Sydney's water supply. However, water recycling is only one element of the total water cycle of the site and its integrated water resource management. BASIX is a web-based sustainability indexing tool that is currently used by the NSW Government to reduce water consumption for residential developments by 40% through assessing their potential performance against the performance of benchmarked dwellings. The introduction of BASIX is an important step to promote the use of recycled water for new residential developments. However, the current approach needs to consider many other issues such as total water cycle performance of the development, reforming regulatory guidelines to encourage reliable decentralised recycled water systems and broadening the criteria for sustainability to account for social and environmental objectives. These issues and elements of a framework to sustainably manage water recycling schemes are discussed in this paper such as the need for comprehensive water cycle decision support tools, establishing links with the water cycle related issues of the catchment and providing new risk-based regulatory guidelines. Special emphasis is given to the use of BASIX as a water cycle decision support tool through a case study and indicating ways to improve its comprehensiveness.

AB Membrane filtration for sustainable wastewater reuse has been encountering particle deposition (i.e., particle cake fouling) with mostly micron-sized particles including bacteria, and nano-sized colloids/particles as well. Particle size may influence membrane fouling and flux decline through cake formation as particles with different sizes exhibit different back diffusivity and packing density of the cake. A theoretical diffusivity equation was proposed by Einstein (1906) [1]; thermodynamic and drag (i.e., resistance or mobility relation) forces were compared in equilibrium. The diffusivity relationship, ratio of thermodynamic and drag forces, was combined with steady-state convection and diffusion equation and finally came up with a relationship between retention times from flow field-flow-fractionation (f1-FFF) and diffusivity of a particle. An asymmetric f1-FFF system (Postnova, Germany) equipped with a regenerated cellulose membrane with molecular weight cutoff of 1,000 molecular mass and a micro-channel employing both laminar channel and cross flows, was used to obtain chromatography using an UV detector. A wide range of colloids and particles were used; both traceable polymer and latex microsphere colloids/particles with nominal diameters of 0.09 (i.e., 90 rim), 0.152, 0.2, 0.5, 0.701, 0.82, 0.993, 1.0 mu m (Duke Scientific, US), and micro silica particles with nominal diameters of 3.0, 6.0, 10.0 mu m (Nanotech, Korea). Each colloid or particle was characterized in terms of either its size or diffusivity with analyses of chromatography obtained from f1-FFF. It was found in this work that ca. 0.5 mu m is a critical size below and above which diffusivity of a particle increases (i.e., particle of 0.5 mu m has a minimum diffusivity). An empirical equation for the shear-induced diffusivity will be suggested in the presentation based on the results obtained from the fl-FFF. There may be many important implications on this observation; for example, bacteria with a 0.5 mu m size may provide significant cake deposition and subsequently flux decline and possibly bio-fouling. These nano-/micro-size and diffusivity information is being investigated in conjunction with membrane filtration with the corresponding particles and various membranes.

AB Short- and long-term changes of total ozone are investigated by means of an ensemble simulation with the coupled chemistry-climate model E39/C for the period 1960 to 2020. Past total ozone changes are well simulated on both, long (decadal) and short ( monthly) timescales. Even the 2002 Antarctic ozone anomaly appears in the ensemble. The model results indicate that the 11-year solar cycle will delay the onset of a sustained ozone recovery. The lowest global mean total ozone values occur between 2005 and 2010, although stratospheric chlorine loading is assumed to decline after 2000. E39/C results exhibit a significant increase of total ozone after the beginning of the next decade, following the upcoming solar minimum. The observed ozone increase in the second half of the 1990s is reproduced by E39/C and is identified as a combined post-Pinatubo and solar cycle effect rather than the beginning of a sustainable ozone recovery.

AB Biogas plants fuelled with renewable sources of energy are a sustainable means for power generation. In areas with high infestation levels with the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hbn.), it is likely that transgenic Bt-maize will be fed into agricultural biogas plants. The fate of the entomotoxic protein Cry1Ab from MON810 maize was therefore investigated in silage and biogas production-related materials in the utilization chains of two farm-scale biogas plants. The Cry1Ab content in silage exhibited no clear-cut pattern of decrease over the experimental time of 4 months. Mean content for silage was 1878 +/- 713 ng Cry1Ab g(-1). After fermentation in the biogas plants, the Cry1Ab content declined to trace amounts of around 3.5 ng g(-1) in the effluents. The limit of detection of the employed ELISA test corresponded to 0.75 ng Cry1Ab g(-1) sample material. Assays with larvae of O. nubilalis showed no bioactivity of the reactor effluents. The utilization of this residual material as fertilizer in agriculture is therefore deemed to be ecotoxicologically harmless.

AB Away from traditional supply option of building dams, we need to adopt new supply options that can be incorporated into urban development and at household-level technology, including rainwater harvesting and wastewater reclamation. While technological advancements have made them possible, economic arguments and to larger extent a lack of political leadership have been keeping these options at pilot stage. The Kogarah Council is amongst a few NSW municipalities who have embarked on a comprehensive review of its water management practices. This journey has resulted in changing the Council's focus from traditional drainage pits and pipes to a much broader approach to water cycle management. In 2003 the Kogarah Council became the first one in Sydney to adopt TWCM principles into its Sustainability Management Plan. '' Reduction in per capita water demand in Kogarah '' was identified as a key sustainability indicator in the plan. At the same time, the Council recognised that while it had a statutory responsibility for managing stormwater, a successful partnership with the Sydney Water Corporation (responsible for water and wastewater) was vital to bringing together data, resources, and knowledge to develop and implement TWCM projects. The project developed a TWCM strategy for the Beverley Park catchment to identify priority projects in the catchment that produce the most cost-effective water savings. The Council has since endorsed the strategy and is committed to three priority projects identified for implementation in 2004/05: participation in Sydney Waters '' Every Drop Counts '' Business Program, the Beverley Park Water Reclamation Project, and the Rainwater Tanks in Schools Project. The first project will enhance the on-going water efficiency roll-outs from the Sydney Water Corporation, and the other two projects focus on creating new water sources. By 2005/06, the implementation of these projects will save up to 150 ML of drinking water every year in Kogarah. This paper presents an insight into this innovative project and provides the current status of the three priority projects.

DE water reuse; water reclamation; desalination; integrated concepts
AB Communities across the world face water supply challenges due to increasing demand, drought, depletion and contamination of groundwater, and dependence on single sources of supply. Water reclamation, recycling, and reuse address these challenges by resolving water resource issues and creating new sources of high-quality water supplies. The future potential for reclaimed treated effluent is enormous. Although water reclamation and reuse is practiced in many countries around the world, current levels of reuse constitute a small fraction of the total volume of municipal and industrial effluent generated. In addition, to meet their growing water supply needs, communities are considering other non-traditional sources of water such as agricultural return flows, concentrate and other wastewater streams, storm water, co-produced water resulting from energy and mining industries, as well as the desalination of seawater and brackish groundwater. Water reuse provides a wide range of benefits for communities, which translates into creating immense value for the public and the environment. The benefits of water reuse, however, can be difficult to quantify and often go unrecognized. One of the most significant benefits of water reuse is the value created by the inclusion of water reuse in integrated water resources planning and other aspects of water policy and the implementation of water projects resulting in the long-term sustainability of our water supplies. These integrated concepts, which involve the convergence of diverse areas such as governance, health risks, regulation, and public perception, also present a significant challenge to water reuse. These complex connections can assert equal influences on both the benefits and challenges associated with water reuse. In addressing these complex integrated issues, a number of significant barriers and impediments to the widespread implementation of water reuse projects arise. Numerous examples exist of barriers experienced by current water reuse projects around the world, including: the need for innovative technologies, technology transfer, and novel applications; the need for public education and increased public acceptance; better documentation of the benefits of water reuse; the lack of available funding for water reuse projects; working with the media; and the need for support by regulators and politicians. Integrated concepts can also be factors in a number of trends affecting water reuse globally. Current trends include addressing emerging pollutants of concern, the use of advanced wastewater treatments including membranes, indirect potable reuse, public perception, understanding the economics of water reuse, groundwater recharge and aquifer storage and recovery, salinity management (including concentrate disposal), increase in the use of '' alternative sources '', environmental or natural system restoration, innovative uses of nonpotable water reuse, and decentralized and satellite systems. Since these trends are emerging developments in the field of water reclamation and reuse, there are a number of research needs associated with these topics. Research is needed to better understand the issues, to develop innovative technologies, and to develop tools and other assistance for communities and water agencies to implement successful water reclamation and reuse projects.

DE cultural; water use; holistic; Mauri; sustainability
AB The Maori people have always valued water as a taonga(*). Waitangi Tribunal(*) reports from the previous twenty years demonstrate this. In these reports it is concluded that the rivers and tributaries within the rohe(*) of the hapu(*) claimant groups were and are taonga of the Tangata Whenua(*). Water and water bodies such as rivers, lakes and wetlands, have their own mauri(*), which it is important for the Tangata Whenua to protect from pollution, degradation and damage. Rivers, lakes and wetlands are also key elements in the identity, whakapapa(*) and mana(*) of the hapu. In order to include indigenous perspectives appropriately in infrastructure evaluation and decision-making the Mauri Model has been created. Mauri is the central concept that this evaluation model uses to identify the Tangata Whenua perceptions of the sustainability of various techniques under consideration for proposed infrastructure development. The Mauri Model has a strong foundation in traditional Tangata Whenua values and also parallels the current policy direction being taken by Central Government in New Zealand. This enables a direct comparison between the results of a conventional analysis of techniques available and the results based on analysis of impacts on mauri within the Mauri Model. Research presented in this paper identified significant differences with regard to the appropriate use of recycled water, in particular wastewater. Recycling is a concept recognised by the Tangata Whenua; however, the integrity of the mauri in recycled water greatly influences how it can be used. Further, recycling some of these waters in a culturally consistent manner could only be achieved by returning the water to the ground or onto land.

AB Introducing reclaimed water as an alternative to the traditional mains water supply involves change in practices as well as technology. Therefore, the social effects of innovative solutions to sustainable water management need to be carefully considered. This paper will present findings from research undertaken in California and Florida, USA, and Australia. What is the community response to recycling reclaimed water? Are there ways of involving the public so that the change involved in introducing reclaimed water achieves sustainable outcomes? Results from a series of case studies where indirect potable reuse has been planned will be considered along with the findings from a range of industry surveys, mainly conducted in the USA. In relation to non potable reuse, this paper will cover acceptance of some of the main uses, and householder's experience of recycling water for residential use. The resulting analysis suggests that the shift from traditional, centrally controlled water supplies to innovative alternatives, requires a corresponding shift in resources to support what is essentially a social transformation in water service delivery and management.

AB Sustainability or '' Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs '' [1] remains a relatively new concept for the water industry. The challenge is to develop sustainable recycled water projects that meet the needs of a water business as the responsible service authority, while at the same time meeting the individual needs of a particular community. The community consultation model that has been adopted by Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water to assist in the implementation of our urban Water Quality Improvement Program is widely considered to be a water industry benchmark. The integration of this tried and tested consultation model with our recently adopted Recycled Water Strategy is now providing us with a framework for informing and educating local communities and other key stakeholders about recycled water. The model also encourages local stakeholders to play a major role in identifying and evaluating opportunities for potential sustainable recycled water projects to meet the needs of their particular community. The successful elements of the model that have been further developed include community newsletters, information packages and public workshops. Initial newsletters and an information workshop seek local community input into identifying potential projects. Subsequent information packages and workshop(s) provide further information for interested individuals and/or organisations in the development of project proposals. Local community input into prioritising the criteria used to assess project proposals are also sought, usually through these workshop(s). Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water has challenged the perceived 'we know what's best for you' culture by providing key stakeholders with the opportunity to have informed input during the decision making process. This is allowing us to develop sustainable recycled water projects that take into consideration the needs of individual communities and key stakeholders. It is also assisting us to build strong relationships with our customers through educated and informed communities.

AB The concept of sustainability has received much attention since the publication of Our Common Future by the World Commission on Environment and Development in 1987. Despite the institutionalisation of sustainability principles through legislation and policy around the world, progress in implementing sustainable development actions has been slow. The very open-ended definition of sustainable development provided in these documents, and the "language" used has made interpretation of what is required for implementation controversial. ''Principles" of sustainable development have been developed to provide further guidance for implementation, but sustainability remains a contested and value-laden concept. Yet there is increasing recognition that the present development paths around the world are clearly not sustainable into the future and that we need urgently to address this unsustainability. Water use has become a prominent issue through broad acceptance that its use in many situations, including southeast Australia and cities such as Sydney, is unsustainable. This paper provides a broad introduction to the development of the concept of sustainability, barriers to implementation of sustainable development, and the application of sustainable development principles to water provision for a city such as Sydney, with emphasis on the use of recycled water.

AB In an engineering context the precautionary principle is often perceived as an excuse to do nothing or a substantial barrier to technical progress. The precautionary principle requires that remedial measures be taken in situations of scientific uncertainty where evidence of harm cannot be proven but potential damage to human or environmental health is significant. In this paper the scope of the precautionary principle in water recycling is discussed. It is clear that uncertainties and risks exist in many areas of water recycling. These risks are closely linked to the risks of sewage discharge. Hence, water recycling has two main areas of concern: (1) the dilemma that minimising potential environmental harm by reducing effluent discharge may increase potential harm through reducing the water flow in receiving waters and (2) the consequences of using recycled water of varying quality for a number of applications. The precautionary principle can be regarded as an opportunity to improve water recycling practice and in fact increase the scope of ecologically sustainable water recycling. The precautionary principle has an important role to play as a guide in decision making and in dealing with the vast number of risks and uncertainties in water recycling.

The European Framework Water Directive established that by the year 2015 "a good ecological state" of all European water resources and a sustainable use of water must be achieved. Wastewater reuse presents a promising solution to the growing pressure on Europe's water resources. However, wastewater reuse implementation in Europe faces obstacles that include insufficient public acceptance; technical, economic and hygienic risks; and lack of regulations. On the other hand, a very important aspect to implement a water reuse project is the feasibility study that was previously developed. Some of the work carried out in a European project called Integrated Concepts for Reuse of Upgraded Wastewater is described herein. One of the most important tasks of this project is to prepare guidelines on feasibility studies for water reuse systems. The defined structure to carry out feasibility studies and some guidelines to obtain an ecological, social and economical assessment is described.

AB Treatment technology for water recycling encompasses a vast number of options. Membrane processes are regarded as key elements of advanced wastewater reclamation and reuse schemes and are included in a number of prominent schemes world-wide, e.g. for artificial groundwater recharge, indirect potable reuse as well as for industrial process water production. Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are a promising process combination of activated sludge treatment and membrane filtration for biomass retention. This paper will provide an overview of the status of membrane bioreactor applications in municipal wastewater reclamation and reuse in Europe and will depict their potential role in promoting more sustainable water use patterns. Particular attention will be paid to the impact of MBR technology on emerging pollutants. A case study will be presented on a full-scale MBR plant for municipal wastewater which is operated by Aquafin in Belgium.

ID WASTE-WATER TREATMENT
AB Field experiments are in progress for secondary wastewater upgrading for unrestricted use for irrigation and sustainable agricultural production. The integrative treatment system for the secondary effluent polishing is based on implementing in series of two main treatment stages: ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane treatment. The pilot system has the capacity of around 8 m(3)/h. The UF effluent is used to feed the RO membrane stage. Different mixtures of UF and RO permeates are subsequently applied for drip irrigation of various agriculture crops. The field results indicate the importance of the UF component in the removal of the organic matter and the pathogens that are still contained in the secondary effluent (the secondary effluent is obtained from a waste stabilization pond treatment system). Under specific conditions, when the dissolved solids content is relatively low, the UF effluent can be applied directly for unrestricted irrigation. In the successive RO stage most nutrients are removed, allowing applying the effluent without jeopardizing the soil fertility and the aquifers. Preliminary economic assessment indicates that the extra cost for effluent polishing via the UF stage only is in the range of 8-12 US cents/m(3). The extra cost for the RO stage is as well assessed at 8-12 US cents/m(3). The additional treatment expenses depend to a large extent on the quality of the incoming raw secondary effluent and local requirements at the command agricultural production sites.

AB Selection of an appropriate agroforestry system will not only extend the life of an effluent irrigated system but it also allows the disposal of wastewater in an environmentally-friendly manner. To test this hypothesis, plantations of seven agroforestry (AF) systems were raised in a two hectare experimental site at Yeppoon (Central Queensland) in June 2002. The AF systems included three species, viz Pangola grass (Digitaria decumbens.- P), Ma bamboo (Dendrocalamus latiflorus; B) and Flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis: E) that have shallow medium and deep root system, respectively. The raised AF systems were either monoculture or in various combinations of the species and resulted in seven cropping systems (P, B, E, PB, PE, BE, PBE). The seven agroforestry systems were irrigated at 180 mm/ha/y as determined by the MEDLI (Model for Effluent Disposal using Land Irrigation). Managing the irrigation rate was found crucial for environmental sustainability of land disposal of effluents. Soil moisture monitored over two years revealed that E grandis plots were driest but at par with Ma Bamboo + E. grandis plots closely followed by Pangola plots and other agroforestry systems. Root densities in the first 30 cm under all agroforestry systems were similar, but in 30-60cm, Pangola systems had the highest root densities. In 60-100 cm depth, eucalypt based systems produced greatest density of roots. Hence in short-rotation, agroforestry systems may perform at par with conventionally favoured monoculture tree plantations. The systems may be preferred for their additional commercial crops.

TI Creating an infrastructure for training in the responsible conduct of
   research: The university of Pittsburgh's experience
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID IAIMS; INTEGRITY
AB In response to public concerns about the consequences of research misconduct, academic institutions have become increasingly cognizant of the need to implement comprehensive, effective training in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) for faculty, staff, students, and external collaborators. The ability to meet this imperative is challenging as universities confront declining financial resources and increasing complexity of the research enterprise.
   The authors describe the University of Pittsburgh's design, implementation, and evaluation of a Web-based, institution-wide RCR training program called Research and Practice Fundamentals (RPF). This project, established in 2000, was embedded in the philosophy, organizational structure, and technology developed through the Integrated Advanced Information Management Systems grant from the National Library of Medicine. Utilizing a centralized, comprehensive approach, the RPF system provides an efficient mechanism for deploying content to a large, diverse cohort of learners and supports the needs of research administrators by providing access to information about who has successfully completed the training. During its first 3 years of operation, the RPF served over 17,000 users and issued more than 38,000 training certificates. The 18 modules that are currently available address issues required by regulatory mandates and other content areas important to the research community. RPF users report high levels of satisfaction with content and ease of using the system. Future efforts must explore methods to integrate non-RCR education and training into a centralized, cohesive structure. The University of Pittsburgh's experience with the RPF demonstrates the importance of developing an infrastructure for training that is comprehensive, scalable, reliable, centralized, affordable, and sustainable.

AB Sheep production is the main agricultural activity in Patagonia. Since the middle of the 20th century, sheep numbers have declined steadly. We used historical records of stock numbers in four ranches to analyze the importance of regional factors so as to explain the decline of the Patagonian sheep flocks. We found that the stocks of all the four ranches declined with a similar trend but fluctuated independently, thus reflecting a complex interaction between regional and local factors. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and vegetation physiognomy explained most of the differences in the flocks declining rates. We estimated demographic parameters for two ranches differing in their average annual growth rates. From these demographic parameters, we constructed deterministic and stochastic matrix models to establish the relative contribution of demographic processes to the observed decline. Matrix models projected a faster decline than that observed in the ranch used to calibrate the model. This suggests that the recorded demographic parameters could drive most stocks to extinction in less than 100 years. We concluded that the observed dynamics would be generated by demographic processes, but extinction is delayed or avoided by a continuous intake of animals. Ewe survival was the most important parameter in controlling the growth rate of the flocks. The environmental stochastic model showed that the growth of the stocks was highly sensitive to increases in the frequency of good years (those that produce a positive growth) and in the transition from normal years to bad years. All these evidences point out the existence of biological constraints to sheep production in Patagonia: ANPP and vegetation structure would control flock population dynamics throughout its effects on key demographic parameters, ewe survival and marking rate (a recruitment measure). Our model results suggest that the decline in sheep numbers, and hence the sustainability of the activity, is driven, to a large extent, by the demographic characteristics of the flocks.

AB Whole-farm design models quantitatively analyze the effects of a variety of potential changes at the farm system level. Science-driven technical information is confronted with value-driven objectives of farmers or other social groupings under explicit assumptions with respect to exogenous variables that are important drivers of agricultural systems (e.g., market conditions). Hence, farm design is an outcome of objective specification and the potential of a system. In recent publications, whole-farm design modelling has been proposed to enhance (farm) innovation processes. A number of operational modelling tools now offers the opportunity to assess the true potential of whole-farm design modelling to enhance innovation. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is not trivial to find niches for the application of goal-based farm models. Model outcomes appeared not to match questions of farm managers monitoring and learning from their own and other farmers' practices. However, our research indicates that whole-farm design modelling possesses the capabilities to make a valuable contribution to reframing. Reframing is the phenomenon that people feel an urge to discuss and reconsider current objectives and perspectives on a problem. Refraining might take place in a situation (i) of mutually felt dependency between stakeholders, (ii) in which there is sufficient pressure and urgency for stakeholders to explore new problem definitions and make progress. Furthermore, our research suggests that the way the researcher enters a likely niche to introduce a model and/or his or her position in this niche may have significant implications for the potential of models to enhance an innovation process. Therefore, we hypothesize that the chances of capitalizing on modelling expertise are likely to be higher when researchers with such expertise are a logical and more or less permanent component of ongoing trajectories than when these researchers come from outside to purposefully search for a niche.

AB In the wave of the Kyoto Protocol, a large effort is undertaken to find sustainable strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. The present paper summarises the results of a research project, which was designed to analyse the potential of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) as a diet component for ruminants to inhibit rumen methanogenesis. In a series of eight in vitro and four in vivo experiments, a research strategy was pursued including: (i) a comparison of feeding coconut oil (rich in MCFA) and feeds containing long-chain unsaturated fatty acids (LCFA) with respect to their effects on rumen and total digestive tract metabolism; (ii) a search for effective MCFA feeds other than coconut oil; (iii) identification of specific MCFA effective against rumen methanogenesis; (iv) clarification of the mode of action of MCFA; and (v) revealing of dietary pre-conditions for a significant methane-suppressing effect of MCFA. The project clearly demonstrated the potential of MCFA, used either in esterified form (such as coconut oil, palm kernel oil and genetically modified canola oil) or in non-esterified form (C12:0 and C14:0), to substantially reduce methanogenesis in domestic ruminants. Detailed insight into the numerous interactions within the rumen, which will determine the extent of methanogenesis inhibition when feeding MCFA, was gained. From an assessment of the combined data, it was concluded that even with dietary proportions below 3% MCFA of C12:0 and C14:0, a 50% reduction of in vivo methane emission is possible.

ID TROPICAL HOMEGARDENS; GARDENS; CONTINUUM
AB Homegardens in Kerala have long been important multi-purpose agroforestry systems that combine ecological and socioeconomical sustainability. However, traditional homegardens are subject to different conversion processes linked to socioeconomic changes. These dynamics were studied in a survey of 30 homegardens. On the basis of a cluster analysis of tree/shrub species density and subsequent further grouping using homegarden size as additional characteristic, six homegarden types were differentiated. These were assessed regarding structural, functional, management and dynamics characteristics. Four development stages of homegardens were found along a gradient from traditional to modern homegardens. Fifty percent of the homegardens still displayed traditional features, whereas 33% incorporated modern practices. The process of modernisation includes a decrease of the tree/shrub diversity, a gradual concentration on a limited number of cash-crop species, an increase of ornamental plants, a gradual homogenization of homegarden structure and an increased use of external inputs. One homegarden was characterised as an adapted traditional homegarden combining multispecies composition and intensive management practices using internal inputs with commercial production. In comparison to modern homegardens, this homegarden type offers an example of an alternative development path in adapting homegardens to changing socioeconomic conditions. The study of structural and functional dynamics of homegardens offers the opportunity to understand the trends in socio-economic sustainability and how these relate to ecological sustainability.

AB Biomass and municipal solid wastes are two of the sustainable energy resources. Countercurrent, substoichiometric conversion of these fuels into energy in packed beds has the benefits of lower tar and dust carryover in flue gases, and therefore gas-treatment procedures can be simplified and the running cost is reduced. In this paper, mathematical simulation is performed on a large-scale plant furnace for both municipal solid wastes and biomass fuels in a range of operating conditions. The temperature profile inside the moving packed bed of the same system was measured by an in situ electronic device for the baseline case to partially validate the simulation results. Mathematical simulation indicates that by using variable grate speed to obtain constant bed height, a typical moving-bed furnace can achieve over 99% of conversion efficiency with only 40-50% of the normal primary air supply, without loss in throughput; the char conversion rate is significantly lower than the devolatilization rate in the bed and the char conversion process occupies over half of the total bed length, whereas fuel devolatilization occupies only one-third or more of the bed length.

ID INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; FUTURE; DIALOGUE; SCIENCE
AB Manifold linkages exist between climate change and sustainable development. Although these are starting to receive attention in the climate exchange literature, the focus has typically been on examining sustainable development through a climate change lens, rather than vice versa. And there has been little systematic examination of how these linkages may be fostered in practice. This paper examines climate change through a sustainable development lens. To illustrate how this might change the approach to climate change issues, it reports on the findings of a panel of business, local government, and academic representatives in British Columbia, Canada, who were appointed to advise the provincial government on climate change policy. The panel found that sustainable development may offer a significantly more fruitful way to pursue climate policy goals than climate policy itself. The paper discusses subsequent climate change developments in the province and makes suggestions as how best to pursue such a sustainability approach in British Columbia and other jurisdictions.

ID RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT
AB There exists a negative externality of livestock breeding due to the difference between private and social breeding cost in Xilingol Biosphere Reserve (XBR), Inner Mongolia, that has caused extensive ecological degradation of the grassland. The property rights regime, the household production responsibility system (HPRS), was adopted in the 1980s to increase livestock production in XBR. Although HPRS has successfully increased production by promoting private economic interests, it has led to grassland degradation due to inefficient enforcement of stock rate. Through interviews conducted with government representatives and herding families in all management units of XBR, we elucidate the shortfalls of the current management regime and the Fencing Grassland and Moving Users policy initiated in 2002 to restore grassland. We propose an alternative property rights regime, small-scale co-management, to concurrently promote both individual economic interests and grassland conservation by improving the enforcement of stock rate.

AB To improve coral reef management, a deeper understanding of biodiversity across scales in the context of functional groups is required. The focus of this paper is on the role of diversity within functional groups in securing important ecosystem processes that contribute to the resilience of coral-dominated reef states. Two important components of species biodiversity that confer ecosystem resilience are analyzed: redundancy and the diversity of responses within functional groups to change. Three critical functional groups are used to illustrate the interaction between these two components and their role in coral reef resilience: zooxanthellae (symbiotic micro algae in reef-building corals), reef-building corals, and herbivores. The paper further examines the consequences of undermining functional redundancy and response diversity and addresses strategies to secure ecological processes that are critical for coral reef resilience.

AB The authors present a program of research that focuses on reducing health disparities among African American populations through innovative health communication and health promotion interventions. Research on tailored communications ranges from investigating efficacy, manipulating communication variables, and comparing tailored print versus other state-of-the-art intervention modalities to integrating tailored materials into public health interventions based on a socioecological model. Examples from other research, as well as advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, are discussed. The purpose of the overall research program is to develop effective and cost-effective health communications for promoting health behavior change that also are culturally relevant and potentially sustainable in communities.

AB Developing countries with an increasing hepatitis A disease burden may target vaccination to specific groups, such as young children, as an initial control strategy. To better understand transmission of hepatitis A virus in such countries, the authors prospectively studied household and day-care/school contacts of cases in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Overall, by the time of identification of symptomatic index cases, half of transmission had already occurred, having been detected retrospectively. The odds of household contacts' becoming infected were 35.4 times those for day-care/school contacts (95% confidence interval (CI): 17.5, 71.7). Within households, younger age of either index cases or susceptible contacts elevated the odds of secondary infection among susceptible contacts: The presence of a case under 6 years of age raised the odds 4.7 times (95% CI: 1.2, 18.7); and compared with contacts aged 14 years or older, the odds of infection were increased to 7.7 (95% CI: 1.5, 40.3) and 7.0 (95% CI: 1.4, 34.3) among contacts aged 0-6 years and 7-13 years, respectively. Young children are appropriate targets for sustainable hepatitis A vaccination programs in areas undergoing hepatitis A epidemiologic transition. If vaccine is determined to be highly effective postexposure and if it is feasible, vaccinating household contacts could be a useful additional control strategy.

ID ROSEWOOD
AB In consideration of the world's present environmental situation and the threat of species extinction, investigations concerning alternative sustainable sources of natural substances represent an extremely important issue. In this respect, the present research is focused on the analytical evaluation of Brazilian rosewood (Aniba rosaeodora Ducke) leaves, as an alternative source (with respect to wood) of rosewood essential oil and, as such, of natural linalool, which is extensively used in perfumery. Enantioselective-gas chromatography-olfactometry (EsGC-O) was used as a tool for the simultaneous stereodifferentiation and olfactive evaluation of the volatile optically active components present in the analyzed samples. In addition to Es-GC-O analyses, direct olfactive analyses were also performed, enabling the evaluation of the global aroma exerted by each sample and the influence of each linalool antipode, as also other minor compounds. The samples were also submitted to gas chromatographymass spectrometric analysis, thus establishing their chemical profiles. The assessment of enantiopure chiral compounds through Es-GC-O, along with direct olfactive analyses, confirmed that the leaves are a potential substituent for wood in the extraction of Brazilian rosewood essential oil, representing a sustainable nonwood source of natural linalool.

AB This paper is concerned with gradual land conversion problems, placing the main focus on the interaction between time and uncertainty. This aspect is extremely relevant since most decisions made in the field of natural resources and sustainable development are irreversible decisions. In particular, we discuss and develop a scenario-based multi-stage stochastic programming model in order to determine the optimal land portfolio in time, given uncertainty affecting the market. The approach is then integrated in a decision tree framework in order to account for domain specific (environmental) uncertainty that, diversely from market uncertainty, may depend on the decision taken. Although, the designed methodology has many general applications, in the present work we focus on a particular case study, concerning a semi-degraded natural park located in northern Italy.

AB Economical, nutritious diets for hybrid striped bass (HSTB) are required for the continued expansion and sustainability of this industry. Turkey meal (TM) is a by-product of the US turkey industry and is a potentially-valuable local, alternative protein source for use in aquaculture diets because of its excellent nutritional composition and quality. TM may substitute for more expensive fish meal (FM)-based diets; however, there are no published data with regard to using this ingredient in sunshine bass diets. Therefore, a 16-week feeding trial was conducted with juvenile (36 g) sunshine bass (Morone chrysops x Morone saxatilis) to evaluate growth, feed conversion and body composition when fed diets with decreasing levels of FM (300, 200, 100 and 0 g kg(-1)) and increasing levels of turkey meal (0, 97, 175 and 264 g kg(-1)). Four practical diets were formulated to contain 400 g kg(-1) protein and similar energy levels. Twenty fish were stocked into each of the 12, 1200-L circular tanks and were fed twice daily ad libitum. At the conclusion of the feeding trial, there were no significant (P > 0.05) differences in final mean weight, percentage weight gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio among treatments, which averaged 363.7 g, 904.3%, 2.02% day(-1) and 1.73, respectively. Percentage survival of fish fed diet 4 (0 g kg(-1) FM and 264 g kg(-1) TM) was significantly (P > 0.05) lower (survival = 88.3%) than fish fed diet 3 (100 g kg(-1) FM and 175 g kg(-1) TM; survival = 95%), but not different from fish fed diet 1 (survival = 92.5%) and fish fed diet 2 (survival = 93.3%). Fillet weight and amount of abdominal fat were not significantly different among all treatments and averaged 258 and 58 g kg(-1), respectively. Fish fed diet 1 (300 g kg(-1) FM, 0 g kg(-1) TM) and diet 2 (200 g kg(-1) FM and 970 g kg(-1) TM) had a significantly (P < 0.05) lower hepatosomatic index (2.83 and 3.01, respectively) than fish fed diet 4 (3.33), but not different (P > 0.05) compared to fish fed diet 3 (3.14). Lipid in the fillet of fish fed diet 2 (197 g kg(-1)) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than fish fed all other diets; and the percentage lipid in the fillet of fish fed diet 1 (126 g kg(-1)) was significantly lower than fish fed diets 2 and 4, but not different (P > 0.05) compared to fish fed diet 3. Fillet moisture, protein and ash were similar among fish fed all diets and averaged 748, 798 g kg(-1) and 51.0 g kg(-1) (dry-matter basis), respectively. The amino acid composition of fillets was similar among all treatments with a few slight significant differences. Results from the present study indicate that tank-grown sunshine bass can be fed a diet containing 264 g kg(-1) TM with 0 g kg(-1) FM, compared to diets containing up to 300 g kg(-1) FM, without adverse effects on weight gain, growth rate, feed conversion and body composition. Further research should be conducted using lower-protein diets to determine minimum protein level for tank-grown sunshine bass.

AB The genetic variations of rohu (Labeo rohita, Hamilton) sampled from five hatchery populations (Arabpur, Brahmaputra, Comilla, Kishorganj and Natore) and three major river populations (the Halda, the Jamuna and the Padma) were analysed by allozyme electrophoresis. Ten enzymes encoded by 11 loci were screened, and six were polymorphic. Alleles at three loci (Est-1(*), Gpi-1(*) and Gpi-2(*)) proved variable for hatchery and river populations, and the Mdh-2(*) locus exhibited heterozygous genotypes for river populations only. Polymorphic loci per population (27.3 +/- 5.3%), heterozygous loci per individual (15.5 +/- 1.2%) and relative gene diversity (0.27 +/- 0.08) in river populations were higher than those for hatchery populations (25.5 +/- 1.8%, 10.7 +/- 1.6% and 0.25 +/- 0.01 respectively). Also, the observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He) (0.09 +/- 0.03 and 0.14 +/- 0.04 respectively) in river populations were higher than those in hatchery populations (0.08 +/- 0.01 and 0.11 +/- 0.01 respectively). The lower levels of genetic variability in hatchery populations suggested the occurrence of inbreeding and/or genetic drift. The pairwise population differentiation (F-ST) values showed a lower level of genetic differentiation between hatchery and river population pairs. The unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean dendrogram of Nei's genetic distances showed a relationship between the genetic distance and geographic distance. The populations were clustered into three groups: the Padma in one group, the Halda in second group and the Jamuna, including five hatcheries, in the third group. Highly diversified rohu individuals were observed in the Padma and Halda Rivers, whereas less genetically variable individuals were found in the Jamuna River and five hatcheries.

AB Luronium natans (L.) Rafin. is a very rare macrophyte even though it has the ability to grow in a wide variety of habitat types. Previous studies leave two possibilities for this pattern: the species has a poor ability to disperse and establish or it is unable to grow and develop a sustainable population after colonization. Experiments on establishment of shoots, seed bank dynamics, seed germination and genetic analysis (AFLP) were conducted to establish whether L. natans disperse to new habitats within hydrologically linked water systems by means of vegetative shoots or by seeds. Shoots had high ability to establish by roots (52% in autumn shoots), but only when subjected to water depths < 4 cm. Seeds of L natans has a high germinate rate (mean of 51-60%), and the density of seeds in the seed bank ranged from 635 to 3354 m(-2) during a year. Analysis of the genetic diversity showed that samples could be differentiated to individuals with higher diversity between populations than within population. Low ability of shoots to establish if not subjected to low water depth, high germination rate of seeds, substantial seed bank and a high genetic diversity all indicate that most colonization events depend on sexual reproduction. Genetic diversity in L. natans seems to depend on habitat type and management. Habitats subjected to high water velocities or management with weed cutting generally have a lower genetic diversity (5-6%) than habitats subjected to dredging (11 %), indicating that the latter habitats favor sexual reproduction.

TI Solar disinfection of water for diarrhoeal prevention in southern India
SO ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
LA English
DT Article
ID DRINKING-WATER; CONTAMINATION; DISEASE
AB Aims: To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of solar irradiation in the prevention of diarrhoeal morbidity in children under 5 years of age, in an urban slum in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.
   Methods: A total of 100 children were assigned to receive drinking water that had been subjected to solar disinfection in polyethylene terephthalate bottles. One hundred age and sex matched controls were also selected. Both groups were followed by weekly home visits for a period of six months for any diarrhoeal morbidity. At the end of the follow up period, the acceptability of the intervention was assessed by interviews, questionnaires, and focus group discussions.
   Results: There was significant reduction in the incidence, duration, and severity of diarrhoea in children receiving solar disinfected water, despite 86% of the children drinking water other than that treated by the intervention. The incidence of diarrhoea in the intervention group was 1.7 per child-year, and among controls 2.7 per child-year, with an incidence rate ratio of 0.64 (95% CI -0.48 to 0.86). The risk of diarrhoea was reduced by 40% by using solar disinfection. In qualitative evaluation of acceptability, most women felt that solar disinfection was a feasible and sustainable method of disinfecting water.
   Conclusions: Solar disinfection of water is an inexpensive, effective, and acceptable method of increasing water safety in a resource limited environment, and can significantly decrease diarrhoeal morbidity in children.

AB Organochlorine (OC) insecticides were measured in different environmental compartments (including seawater, sediment, and biota) at six sites within the Mai Po Marshes Nature Reserve (MPMNR) and at one site in A Chau (AC) in Hong Kong in June 2002 (wet season) and January 2003 (dry season). MPMNR is a Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar site) situated in the western part of Hong Kong, whereas AC is a relatively remote island in Starling Inlet on the eastern side of the New Territories of Hong Kong. Generally, concentrations of OC insecticides in water, sediment, and biota were greater at MPMNR than at AC. Hexachlorobenzene, dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, and hexachlorocyclohexanes were detected in all samples collected from MPMNR. Preliminary risk assessments were performed by comparing the measured concentrations of OCs in different environmental compartments with the corresponding guidelines promulgated by various environmental protection authorities. Concentrations of some OCs in sediments from certain locations in MPMNR were consistently greater than their corresponding sediment guideline values. These results suggest that the sediment OC concentrations in the sediments of MPMNR might pose a risk to aquatic organisms. Despite this, concentrations of OCs in biota samples were much lower than the relevant guideline values promulgated by government agencies to protect the health of human consumers. It is postulated that the management practices adopted at MPMNR have been effective in limiting the bioaccumulation window (duration) for OCs. This situation may have been aided by a frequent exchange of water between the tidal shrimp ponds at MPMNR and the open sea, again attributable to management practices. The low-cost maintenance practices adopted at MPMNR may potentially be applicable to wetlands in other southeastern Asian countries, thus allowing sustainable fishery production and wildlife conservation.

AB The recent G8 Gleneagles climate statement signed on 8 July 2005 specifically mentions a determination to lessen the impact of aviation on climate [Gleneagles, 2005. The Gleneagles communique: climate change, energy and sustainable development. http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/PostG8_Gleneagles_Communique.pdf]. In January 2005 the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) commenced operation as the largest multi-country, multi-sector ETS in the world, albeit currently limited only to CO2 emissions. At present the scheme makes no provision for aircraft emissions. However, the UK Government would like to see aircraft included in the ETS and plans to use its Presidencies of both the EU and G8 in 2005 to implement these schemes within the EU and perhaps internationally. Non-CO2 effects have been included in some policy-orientated studies of the impact of aviation but we argue that the inclusion of such effects in any such ETS scheme is premature; we specifically argue that use of the Radiative Forcing Index for comparing emissions from different sources is inappropriate and that there is currently no metric for such a purpose that is likely to enable their inclusion in the near future.

AB We need more rather than less money for research, energy research in particular, research being an important contributor to progress, in order to achieve peak performance, comply with the quest for knowledge about the structure of the world, or to be able to further improve our quality of life at far less expense of materials and energy.
   This latter concept is in line with European identity. If we succeed in demonstrating to the world that people can live a better life if they manage their affairs sustainably, we Europeans will have won a new trademark: a sustainable Europe which can be left to future generations. For this purpose Europeans, more than before, must perceive Europe as a space of knowledge. Science policy must be geared to Europe, not just to a national territory.
   Also, Europe should devote more attention to fundamental research. Some outstanding projects are needed, particularly in energy research, with the participation of industry in order to reduce materials consumption and avoid emissions.
   Education, too, must be given much attention. In the absence of enthusiastic young scientists, engineers, and skilled workers who know their neighboring countries and their technologies and languages from an early age, European energy policy is bound to remain fragmented.

AB The United Nations passed and adopted "Principles Of Sustainable Development" in 1992, as a resolution on the sustainable development of mankind. It advocates maintaining the ecological system to support the earth, while presenting the ethical issue of "impartiality within a generation," the reduction of absolute poverty and also "impartiality between generations," in particular "not leaving a negative legacy to the next generation." The issue of the appropriate handling of waste is by nature an issue of safety and resources, but is also an ethical issue.
   Nuclear power generation is more likely to conserve the environment, if the comparison between radioactive waste and carbon dioxide is considered. The creation of hydrogen by nuclear energy resembles the ecological relationship between the sun and the earth in that it consists of the conversion of nuclear energy into chemical energy.
   Nuclear Fission, nuclear fusion, particle acceleration and lasers can all be found in the universe. It will be possible to find a future For nuclear energy by learning from and imitating nature.
   If the future of nuclear energy is seen from the viewpoint of sutainability, it can be expected that energy resources will be Secured and the environment will be conserved by a system of nuclear energy, which will hopefully grow into a comprehensive nuclear science and technology that Supports the civilization at its roots.

AB In the sub-humid part of Burkina Faso, population growth, migrations and new marketing opportunities have induced rapid land-use changes and social reorganization, leading to new approaches to natural resource management. The objective of this study was to evaluate tree biodiversity parameters in agroforestry parklands (scattered trees in crop land) as population increases and fallows become shorter. Out of about 100 tree species existing in the area, and 50 commonly found in traditional parklands, only 3 indigenous and 2 non-native species hold a significant importance for farmers, all for their fruits. No indigenous tree species are planted, but a few are protected when clearing the land. Planted cashew nut orchards develop rapidly and are seen as a land tenure guarantee and an important source of income. Given these facts, the perspectives for tree biodiversity management in farmers' land may appear bleak. Yet, the importance given by farmers to specific tree products demonstrates that trees do play a part in land development and farmers' strategies. Existing practices of farmers show potential for improved land-use and spatial patterning of the land, as revealed by emerging parklands and orchards. Our data do not confirm common statements that migrant farmers do not manage the land as sustainably as native farmers do. Rather than trying to conserve tree biodiversity as it is, researchers and developers should identify with farmers the complementarities between trees and farms and promote tree biodiversity through existing practices.

AB The Kingdom of Nepal extends 800 km east to west along the southern slopes of the Himalayas. Because of its biogeographical position, Nepal contains biological elements of both the Indo-Malayan and Palaearctic realms. Beside the trees in forest ecosystems, a large number of tree species are maintained on farms as part of subsistence farming systems. The role of these trees in ensuring the sustainability of agricultural production and the importance of traditional farming systems for the conservation of crop diversity have been well documented. However, the status of farm trees and their role in biodiversity conservation are poorly documented. This paper presents a case study of two villages in the western middle hills of Nepal. It highlights the role of traditional agroforestry practices for the conservation of tree diversity and argues that farms can be considered biodiversity reservoirs. Farm trees help to reduce pressure on community and government forests and create a favorable environment for many plant and animal species. Farm trees also provide social functions in that households with many farm trees no longer exercise their communal rights to extract grass products from community forests, which in turn benefits poor and disadvantaged households. The paper discusses possibilities to improve the role of farm trees in biodiversity conservation. It argues for the development of mechanisms such as tax exemptions and conservation credits that provide benefits to rural communities as compensation for their local and global environmental services including biodiversity conservation.

AB Southern Chile experienced serious deforestation during the past century and it is projected that by the year 2025 Chile will be devoid of native forests. One of the most important endemic tree species of the country and at the same time one of the most endangered ones is Araucaria araucana (Mol.) C. Koch, the monkey-puzzle tree. It grows in the Andes Mountains, homeland of the indigenous Mapuche Pewenche people who depend on this tree. This paper is based on participatory field research with a Mapuche Pewenche community in the southern Chilean Andes on their ecological knowledge, values, use and management of the Araucaria araucana forest. It attempts to reveal how indigenous people and their knowledge contribute to the sustainable management of these forests. The paper (1) illustrates the complexity of indigenous ecological knowledge of Araucaria araucana and its efficacy in native forest management, (2) explores the link between the conservation and use of biodiversity by the indigenous people, and (3) provides answers relevant to native forest management and conservation strategies ex-situ and in-situ incorporating indigenous and scientific knowledge, thus providing a contribution towards integrated natural resource management.

AB Systematic conservation planning has become an important tool for increasing the efficiency of conservation decisions, but many planning efforts result in static plans that may lose relevance over time. We developed a process whereby planning is integrated into the decision-making process and updated every six months in response to conservation actions. The Florida Forever program is a 10-year, $3 billion land acquisition program expected to acquire approximately 1.25 million acres (607,000 ha) for conservation in Florida through the year 2010. With limited funding and duration, the program needs to be able to efficiently protect the most natural resources for a fixed cost, a situation well suited to a systematic reserve design approach. To inform this program, we conducted an assessment of natural resource conservation needs and developed the Florida Forever Tool for Efficient Resource Acquisition and Conservation (F-TRAC), a systematic reserve design analysis based on a simulated annealing site selection algorithm using Marxan software. The analysis considered conservation needs for a variety of natural resources including species, natural communities, high quality watersheds, wetlands, and sustainable forestry. Each 6-month analysis identifies an efficient portfolio of sites for resource protection, given the amount of land area likely remaining to be acquired by the Florida Forever program. The Spring 2004 model portfolio had a cost threshold of 206,308 ha, met conservation targets for 18 of 32 resource conservation features, and identified approximately 116,000 ha outside of current land acquisition projects. This study also demonstrates the use of reserve design results to evaluate existing and proposed land acquisition projects and inform decision makers; and the evaluation of acquisition trends and program success based on potential achievements as indicated by reserve design analyses.

AB Soil microbial biomass data derived from fumigation-extraction (FE), substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and ATP estimations differed significantly and were significantly correlated, which agrees to previous studies. In a second step, the SIR/FE, ATP/FE and SIR/ATP ratios were calculated to evaluate the glucose-responsive and active component of the microbial (active and resting) biomass and the glucose-responsive component of the active microbiota. Soils were sampled along gradients within and between associated ecosystems in Northern Germany, Denmark and along a gradient of heavy metal pollution in Finland. The ratios indicated that the active portion and glucose-responsive component decreased with proceeding litter decomposition, higher degree of sustainable land management practices and higher degree of heavy metal contamination.

TI Re-emerging schistosomiasis in hilly and mountainous areas of Sichuan,
   China
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
DE schistosomiasis/epidemiology/prevention and control; China
AB Despite great strides in schistosomiasis control over the past several decades in Sichuan Province, China the disease has re-emerged in areas where it was previously controlled. We reviewed historical records and found that schistosomiasis had re-emerged in eight counties by the end of 2004 - seven of 21 counties with transmission control and one of 25 with transmission interruption as reported in 2001 were confirmed to have local disease transmission. The average "return time" (from control to re-emergence) was about eight years. The onset of re-emergence was commonly signalled by the occurrence of acute infections. Our survey results suggest that environmental and sociopolitical factors play an important role in re-emergence. The main challenge would be to consolidate and maintain effective control in the longer term until "real" eradication is achieved. This would be possible only by the formulation of a sustainable surveillance and control system.

AB From a prospective study on burn patients admitted at the Burn Center in Kuwait during 1993-2001, 826 paediatric burn cases, in 0-14 years age group, were retrieved to study incidence, causes, and mortality among children. The demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcome constituted our data file in Statistical Software, SPSS. Overall incidence rate was 17.5/100,000 children aged 0-14 years, being almost twice (34/100,000) among those between 0 and 4 years, constituting 70.8% of all paediatric burns. Scald was the main cause of burn (67%), followed by flame (23%). Mean age (6.4 years) of children with flame burns, was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than those with scalds, or other causes. A positive significant correlation existed between duration of hospital stay and TBSA% (r = 0.56, p < 0.001). Overall mortality rate was 0.23/100,000 children, maximum (0.52/100,000) being in children below 5 years. Among 11 (1.3%) non-survivors, flame burns caused nine fatalities. Multiple logistic regression mooring predicted children aged < 5 years, flame burns and TBSA >= 70%, (OR = 29.2, p < 0.001), as main contributing factors to fatal outcome among children. Gender and nationality had no influence on incidence or mortality. These findings will hopefully stimulate development of targeted and sustainable interventions for reducing burns occurrence among identified paediatric high-risk groups.

TI Altered states of consciousness and Palaeoart: an alternative

AB There has been much controversy recently regarding Lewis-Williams's assertion that altered states of consciousness and shamanism can explain Palaeolithic art. Evidence now seems to be accumulating that this account is unable to provide a sustainable explanation for Upper Palaeolithic depictions. This proposition will be explored and substantiated by examining further weaknesses contained therein. Additionally, in response to claims by those defending altered states that no alternative explanation for palaeoart has been proposed as a viable alternative, it will be shown that such a description does exist but has not been given the attention it deserves because of a misplaced concern for shamanism.

AB Agroforestry is a new practice of sustainable soil use in the mountainous Sierra Sur de Oaxaca area of Mexico. Coffee is also a common cash crop grown in the region. The objective of this study was to investigate the pedodiversity in the area. Soil development is very complex. and is influenced by slope parameters and parent materials. Several soil groups are found in the area investigated: Alisols. Umbrisols. and Cambisols. Morphology. chemical properties. and mineralogical composition of the clay fraction of these soils were studied. The soils vary in the extent of weathering. morphology. and chemical properties. which are important to farming in the area. Most of the soils have heterogeneous parent material. The distribution of major soil types of the area is related to mass movement along the slopes. both past and present. The studied soils represent a chronosequence from unleached and unweathered Cambisols to Alisols, characterized by strong clay illuviation and dominance of kaolinite and gibbsite in clay fraction. A mosaic of landslides and gullies of various ages. formed by catastrophic events such as earthquakes and hurricanes. form the pedodiversity of the area studied.

AB In areas within Alberta where suitable cultivated land is not available, or for convenience, the use of forage land is an alternative for manure application. However, there is limited research on the effects of manure on forage land in the province. The objective of this 5-yr study was to determine the effects of manure on soil chemical properties of forage land. Cattle (Bos taurus L.) and hog (Sus scrofa L.) manures were applied at five rates on irrigated alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and on rainfed timothy (Phleum pratense L.) sites. Treatments were replicated four times and arranged in a randomized complete block design. Soil samples (0 to 15, 15 to 30, 0 to 60, 60 to 90, 90 to 120, and 120 to 150 cm) were collected each spring prior to manure application. Manure application on forage land significantly affected soil chemical properties such as increases in NO3-N, PO4-P, K, Na, and electrical conductivity. There was also evidence of accumulation and some downward movement of NO3-N, Na, and K below 15 cm. The higher manure application rates used in this study (> 31 Mg ha(-1) cattle manure and > 42 Mg ha(-1) hog manure: wet weight) are not sustainable in terms of potential environmental risk, such as leaching of NO3-N to groundwater, loss of P in runoff water, and increased soil salinity. Appropriate application rates should be based on crop nutrient requirements and management practices that include regular manure and soil testing.

AB Agricultural management affects soil organic matter, which is important for sustainable crop production and as a greenhouse gas sink. Our objective was to determine how tillage, residue management and N fertilization affect organic C in unprotected, and physically, chemically and biochemically protected soil C pools. Samples from Breton, Alberta were fractionated and analysed for organic C content. As in previous report, N fertilization had a positive effect, tillage had a minimal effect, and straw management had no effect on whole-soil organic C. Tillage and straw management did not alter organic C concentrations in the isolated C pools, while N fertilization increased C concentrations in all pools. Compared with a woodlot soil, the cultivated plots had lower total organic C, and the C was redistributed among isolated pools. The free light fraction and coarse particulate organic matter responded positively to C inputs, suggesting that much of the accumulated organic C occurred in an unprotected pool. The easily dispersed silt-sized fraction was the mineral-associated pool most responsive to changes in C inputs, whereas the microaggregate-derived silt-sized fraction best preserved C upon cultivation. These findings suggest that the silt-sized fraction is important for the long-term stabilization of organic matter through both physical occlusion in microaggregates and chemical protection by mineral association.

DT Article
ID FAMILY FARM; TIME; DECADE
AB The collection of census information about pluriactivity or "part-time farming," as it was initially termed, began as early as the 1930s in the United States and the 1940s in Canada. Researchers have since moved beyond reporting basic descriptive statistics to detailed investigations of the various non-farm sources of total family income, types of off-farm employment, and underlying motivations. Although interest in the topic has waned somewhat, further analysis of pluriactive households is warranted, particularly in light of rural restructuring, farm depopulation, and the "farm crisis." Social scientists have pursued divergent lines of inquiry into the nature of pluriactivity; however, much of this work is related to Sustainable Rural Livelihoods (SRL) concepts such as adaptive strategies, diversification and resilience. This paper explores the utility of SRL analysis for interpreting the presence, persistence, and varied forms and functions of pluriactivity among Canadian farm households.

AB The control of diseases in human and livestock populations can be hampered by the existence of a reservoir of infection in wildlife. However, simplistic approaches to controlling such sources of infection by culling wildlife populations may not adequately address ecological complexities. In the UK and Ireland the badger is implicated in the spread of bovine TB to cattle and has been the subject of several culling strategies. Field studies demonstrate that culling leads to substantial social perturbation of badger populations, and can be associated with increases in the incidence of infection in cattle. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the social perturbation associated with badger culling may have epidemiological consequences that hinder the effective control of infection in cattle. The development of sustainable strategies for the effective management of disease in wildlife populations requires careful consideration of the demographic and behavioural responses to intervention.

AB Objectives: Iatrogenic, including corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis is preventable with administration of osteoprotective biphosphonates. The best medical practice is published in the National Guidelines: UK Osteoporosis Consensus Group (1998. update 2002). We conducted an audit in prednisolone-treated general neurology patients, to assess compliance to national guidelines. raise awareness of osteoporosis prevention, and improve clinical practice in a tertiary neurology referral centre.
   Methods and results: Preintervention: Of the 48 cases (21 male) identified twenty-nine (61%) received osteoporosis prophylaxis. Nineteen (40%) were given biphosphonates, while 10 (21%) hormone replacement therapy or calcium and Vitamin D. Intervention: Results were presented to the consultant body. Postintervention: Data were collected prospectively on 48 patients (30 male) in year 2001. Thirty-eight (79%) received prophylaxis: 35 (73%) were started on biphosphonates, while 3 (6%) on calcium and Vitamin D. This process was repeated 2 years later to assess sustainability. Of the 48 patients, 44 (92%) received prophylaxis: 41 (86%) were taking biphosphonates, while 3 (6%) calcium and Vitamin D.
   Conclusion: We present an original and complete audit on osteoporosis prophylaxis in a typical population of neurology patients. Though initial results were similar to previous reports, our audit led to significant improvement in clinical practice. National guidelines could not be followed meticulously, as our centre has no regular access to bone densitometry. Our patient population had other risk factors for osteoporosis apart from steroid use. Therefore, we recommend that neurologists in this setting use osteoporosis prophylaxis for all their patients on long-term corticosteroids. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper traces the development of coastal engineering, drawing parallels with history of civilization and development of society in general. It recognizes three distinct ages-those of providence, progress and nihilism. It recalls the impact of the enlightenment and describes the rise of the modem era, in which coastal engineering has its roots; the time with the underlying motto "yes we can!" Next, we follow the move to postmodernism where we find that our models have practical limits, that there are no single, correct answers and that good coastal engineering is not necessarily good. We explore the concepts of uncertainty, pluralism and sustainability. Finally, we attempt to find some direction to proceed with coastal education, research and management within the postmodern environment. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Natural fiber reinforced plastics are challenging materials for sustainable product development. Plastics reinforced with non-woven natural fiber mats can be applied in automotive structures due to good mechanical properties and low price. Hence, these materials have large properties variations (heterogeneity). The definition of properties of the heterogeneity was proposed. A method for quantitative estimation of heterogeneity of natural fiber mats has been developed. The method is based on spectral analysis of digital image of the mat. Estimated heterogeneity parameters of mats can be used further in simulation of properties of heterogeneous materials. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The origin of the International Photochemical and Storage of Solar Energy (IPS) conferences can be traced to the oil crisis during the 1970s that emerged out of politically-driven shortage of supply. The next crisis will most likely emerge out of excess of supply. The solutions that were contemplated in the 1970s are still very relevant. We will focus here on human contributions to changes in the atmospheric chemical composition that will most likely have a major impact on the global climate. The key issue addressed is the prediction of the possibility that the system will self-adjust to achieve sustainable development and thus immunize us from the consequences of wrong decisions. We conclude with a presentation of a computer model that greatly accelerates the cause-effect choices that we make and incorporates renewable energy supply as an important part of the solution.

CT Conference on Gully Erosion in Mountain Areas

AB Sequential aerial photographs of a small headwater catchment in the Waiapu basin, East Coast Region, North Island, New Zealand, were interpreted to measure and analyse temporal changes in active area of gullies and gully complexes for a longer time span (1939-2003) and with higher temporal resolution compared to previous studies. We focus on the conditions leading to the development of gullies and gully complexes under pasture and forest by using topographic thresholds (slope-area relationships) of catchments for the initiation of gullies and gully complexes. In addition, the influence of two different lithologies as well as the occurrence of major rainfall events was related to gully activity.
   Twenty gullies and four gully complexes (occupying 62.5 ha or 12.5 per cent of the catchment area) occurred in the study catchment between 1939 and 2003. However, the majority of these were not active at all of the dates studied. Gullies developed in the sandstone-dominated Tapuwaeroa Formation tended to attain their maximum size by 1957 with a mean catchment area of 2.1 ha. Gullies developed in mudstone of the Whangai Formation attained their maximum size in 1939 with a mean catchment area of 4.31 ha. Exceptions are gullies which developed into mass movement deposits or into an earth flow deposit as well as gullies developed under indigenous forest. Topographic threshold values for gullies under pasture and indigenous forest show that values for gullies under forest plot far above the threshold line of gullies under pasture, indicating that the topographical threshold for gully development under forest is higher compared to under pasture. A threshold value of 9.4 ha in catchment area is needed for the development of gully complexes under pasture, all located in the Whangai Formation and with the same orientation as the strike of the mudstones. Gully-complex area and dominance of mass-movement erosion increased with larger catchment area. A decreasing distance to the threshold line for gullies under pasture indicates a later development for gully complexes. No gully complexes developed under indigenous forest, indicating that the threshold value for gully-complex development is higher than for gully complexes under pasture and was not reached in the study area.
   A model of shifting topographical threshold for gully development for a given catchment is developed which depends on land use. When a catchment has an indigenous forest cover the topographical threshold is very high. After conversion to pasture, threshold values decrease drastically. With the invasion of scrub, the threshold slowly increases and returns to a similar level to that under indigenous forest after reforestation.
   Development of gullies and gully complexes is a highly dynamic phenomenon, and phases of expansion and inactivity indicate that models describing only unidirectional advancing stages without periods of inactivity are not suitable. Therefore, this study adds more phases to models of gully and gully-complex development in the East Coast Region. The threshold line for gully initiation under pasture and a value of 9.4 ha in catchment area for gully-complex initiation permits one to predict which catchments, under similar environmental settings, develop gullies and gully complexes on a physical basis. This enables land managers to implement sustainable land-use strategies to reduce erosion rates of gullies and gully complexes. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Prospective elasticity analyses have been used to aid in the management of fished species and the conservation of endangered species. Elasticities were examined for deterministic size-based matrix models of red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, and white abalone, H. sorenseni, to evaluate which size classes influenced population growth (lambda) the most. In the red abalone matrix, growth transitions were determined from a tag recapture study and grouped into nine size classes. In the white abalone matrix, abalone growth was determined from a laboratory study and grouped into five size classes. Survivorship was estimated from tag recapture data for red abalone using a Jolly-Seber model with size as a covariate and used for both red and white abalone. Reproduction estimates for both models used averages of the number of mature eggs produced by female red and white abalone in each size class from four-year reproduction studies. Population growth rate (lambda) was set to 1.0, and the fiist-year survival (larval survival through to the first size class) was estimated by iteration. Survival elasticities were higher than fecundity elasticities in both the red and white matrix models. The sizes classes with the greatest survival elasticities, and therefore the most influence on population growth in the model, were the sublegal red abalone (150-178 mm) and the largest white abalone size class (140-175 mm). For red abalone, the existing minimum legal size (178 mm) protects the size class the model suggests is critical to population growth. Implementation of education programs for novice divers coupled with renewed enforcement may serve to minimize incidental mortality of the critical size class. For white abalone, conservation efforts directed at restoring adults may have more of an impact on population growth than efforts focusing on juveniles. Our work is an example of how prospective elasticity analyses of size-structured matrix models can be used to quantitatively evaluate research priorities, fishery management strategies, and conservation options.

AB Increasing centralization of the control of fisheries combined with increased knowledge of food-web relationships is likely to lead to attempts to maximize economic yield from entire food webs. With the exception of predator-prey systems, we lack any analysis of the nature of such yield-maximizing strategies. We use simple food-web models to investigate the nature of yield- or profit-maximizing exploitation of communities including two types of three-species food-webs and a variety of six-species systems with as many as five trophic levels. These models show that, for most webs, relatively few species are harvested at equilibrium and that a significant fraction of the species is lost from the web. These extinctions occur for two reasons: (1) indirect effects due to harvesting of species that had positive effects on the extinct species, and (2) intentional eradication of species that are hot themselves valuable, but have negative effects on more valuable species. In most cases, the yield-maximizing harvest involves taking only species from one trophic level. In no case was an unharvested top predator part of the yield-maximizing strategy. Analyses reveal that the existence of direct density dependence in consumers has a large effect on the nature of the optimal harvest policy, typically resulting in harvest of a larger number of species. A constraint that all species must be retained in the system (a "constraint of biodiversity conservation") usually increases the number of species and trophic levels harvested at the yield-maximizing policy. The reduction in total yield caused by such a constraint is modest for most food webs but can be over 90% in some cases. Independent harvesting of species within the web can also cause extinctions but is less likely to do so.

AB We assess fiscal performances in G7 and selected Latin American and Asian countries. We consider two questions: (i) Have public finances been sustainable? (ii) Do countries follow more restrictive fiscal policies when debt starts to rise? We find that: (i) the traditional unit root tests often overlook the corrective actions taken by many governments; controlling for structural breaks changes the non-stationarity results dramatically among the three groups; (ii) estimation of a reaction function for governments, expanded by incorporating structural breaks, provides further evidence for significant active anti-debt policies among G7 countries, and to a lesser extent in the other regions.

AB Purpose: This article focuses on the sustainability of reform through the lens of teachers' nostalgia-the major form of memory among a demographically dominant cohort of experienced older teachers. Unwanted change evokes senses of nostalgia for these lost missions that take two forms: social and political. As teachers age, their responses to change are influenced not only by processes of degeneration (loss of commitment, energy, enthusiasm, etc.) but also by the agendas of the generation-historically situated missions formed decades ago that teachers have carried with them throughout their careers.
   Findings: Findings indicate that the effects of cumulative demographic and educational change and the resulting nostalgias have left teachers feeling resistant to mandated reform, insecure about their own professional capacity, disenchanted with their students, and pessimistic about their schools' future. The results of this research have practical implications for policy makers, administrators, and classroom teachers.

ID POLITICAL-ECONOMY
AB Background: This article is an historical sociospatial analysis of change during the past three decades within and between three high schools in a deindustrialized city in the northeastern United States. Sociospatial relations are the everyday spatial practices, perceptions, and representations that constitute social worlds. Interrelated with the continued economic decline and spatial segregation in many U.S. cities, state standards-based reform policies are reinforcing and furthering a more hierarchical, homogeneous, and fragmented educational space, increasing the marginalization of some urban schools, teachers, and students.
   Purpose: This historical sociospatial analysis of urban secondary schools will describe the conjunction of demographic and policy changes contributing to patterns of uneven development that raise questions about the consequences and sustainability of the current state and federal standards-based reform initiatives.

TI The sustainability of innovative schools as learning organizations and
   professional learning communities during standardized reform
SO EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
DE innovative schools; sustainability; teaming organizations; professional
   learning communities; standardized reform
AB Background: Implicitly, innovative schools have historically contained some (but not usually all) of the properties of learning organizations andprofessional learning communities but have a weak record of sustaining success over time. Can innovative schools that self-consciously establish themselves as learning organizations and professional learning communities sustain their early promise of success in the face of the predictable cycle ofthe "attrition of change"; of pressure and envy in the surrounding district, profession, and community; and of the historically specific and recent pressure of standardized reform?
   Purpose: This article explores the impact of these influences on three innovative schools and their sustainability over time. It concentrates in particular on the promise and viability of one of these schools, which has been consciously modeled as a learning organization andprofessional learning community.
   Conclusions: Although further research is required, the article concludes that the learning organization and professional learning community model may provide a more robust resistance to conventional processes ofthe attrition of change and of surrounding change forces, but much like other innovative schools, it also shows signs of defaulting to conventional patterns of schooling in the face of standardized reform.

AB Central biogenic amine systems have long been studied for their effects on feeding behavior, energy balance, and maintenance of body weight. Those monoaminergic systems that use dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) as neurotransmitters have been the main targets of study. A number of antiobesity medications that affect monoaminergic activity have appeared on the market and/or in clinical trials. Early examples of such agents are the so-called CNS stimulants, e.g., the amphetamines, phentermine, ephedrine, etc. These agents release monoamines from neuronal stores, and their antiobesity activity seems to be tied most closely to their ability to release NE. Inhibitors of neuronal reuptake of NE or 5-HT have been shown to reduce feeding and weight gain both preclinically and clinically. However, the magnitude and sustainability of such effects in clinical trials has generally not been great enough to register or label these agents for the treatment of obesity. Sibutramine, however, is an exception. This compound is metabolized in vivo to produce metabolites that have varying degrees of inhibition of NE, 5-HT, and/or DA uptake. Sibutramine is the only drug affecting monoaminergic systems currently approved for the long-term control of obesity. Research continues on serotonergic and histaminergic systems to determine if targets such as the 5-HT2C and H-3 receptors may be suitable for developing antiobesity agents. Because the clinical antiobesity effects of monoaminergic drugs have been modest, future directions include looking at combinations of different monoaminergic mechanisms and/or combinations of monoaminergic drugs with non-monoaminergic mechanisms.

AB Three wastes are examined: agricultural slurry, municipal solid waste (MSW) and sludge (wastewater bio-solids). The recommended utilisation of biogas generated from the digestion of agricultural slurry and of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is as a transport fuel. Due to parasitic demands only 50% of biogas is available for export. The lack of a market for thermal product in incinerating the residue of MSW entails wastage of 42% of the energy value of the waste. The treatment of sewage sludge requires input of energy. An integrated system is proposed which overcomes the shortfalls of the separate systems. The sludge is incinerated with the residue of MSW. Electric and thermal products of the incineration process are used in the integrated system. Surplus electricity (67% of the total) is exported. The surplus heat (82% of the total) may be exported if a market is found. The effect of the integrated system is to pull the balance of energy production towards transport fuel production and to ensure sustainability. A system treating the waste from 1,000,000 person equivalents (PE) could power 12,400 cars, provide electricity for 30,900 houses and heat 15,100 houses. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Food-for-work (FFW) programs are commonly used both for short-term relief and long-term development purposes. This paper assesses the potential of FFW programs to reduce poverty and promote sustainable land use in the longer run. There is a danger that such programs distort labor allocation or crowd out private investments and therefore have unintended negative effects. We explore this issue using survey evidence from northern Ethiopia that we use to motivate a simple theoretical model, a more detailed version of which we then implement through an applied bio-economic model calibrated to northern Ethiopia. The analysis explores how FFW project outcomes may depend on FFW project design, market conditions, and technology characteristics. We show that FFW programs may either crowd out or crowd in private investments and highlight factors that condition whether FFW promotes or undercuts sustainable land use.

AB This paper adapts the safe minimum standard (SMS) approach so as to explore its use as a potential policy decision support tool that can be applied to issues related to the conservation and sustainable use of farm animal genetic resource (AnGR) diversity. Empirical SMS cost estimates are obtained using data from three AnGR economics case studies in Mexico and Italy. The findings support our hypothesis that the costs of implementing an SMS are low, both when compared with the size of subsidies currently being provided to the livestock sector (< 1 per cent of the total subsidy) and with regard to the benefits of conservation (benefit-cost ratio of > 2.9).
   Nevertheless, despite providing a potentially useful AnGR conservation decision support tool, a critical assessment of the application reveals that a much more extensive quantification of the components required to determine SMS costs needs to be undertaken before this tool can be applied in practice.

TI Collective action in community management of grazing lands: the case of
   the highlands of northern Ethiopia
SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Collective action can play a significant role in sustainable management of common grazing lands through restricting access and regulating use. However, it is not clear why there are often violations of grazing restrictions in equilibrium. This paper first presents a theoretical framework of collective action in community management of grazing lands that explicitly models individual violations behaviour. Then data from the highlands of Amhara region of Ethiopia are used to test the model predictions to examine the impact of policy-relevant factors on collective establishment of grazing restrictions and violations of grazing restrictions. Econometric results show that collective action in community grazing land management is likely to be more beneficial and effective in communities with better market access or higher populations. Collective action, on the other hand, is less likely to be successful in communities with greater social, economic, or cultural heterogeneity or more affluent members. Factors related to greater livestock profitability, such as rainfall, or fixed costs of negotiating agreements, such as total land area of the community, have ambiguous effects, as they are associated with establishment of grazing restrictions as well as violating the restrictions.

ID MOBILITY
AB In this paper, the hypothesis is that there is a connection between international aeromobility, knowledge organisations, and environmental impacts. The object is therefore to examine the driving forces, mechanisms, and patterns of meaning behind the increase in international long-distance work mobility. The author will draw on a case study which involves two Danish examples of 'knowledge organisations'. He argues that it is necessary to rethink central concepts of travel, tourism, and working life, in order to understand and describe this kind of international mobility in these organisations. The boundary between work and tourism is not distinct and there is a very complex connection between travel, work, tourism, and play. He shows that actually, there is a strong 'material' impact from supposedly 'immaterial' organisations and this 'materiality' is particularly linked to the extension of forms of mobility. This has implications for understanding the possibilities of replacing physical work mobility with virtual mobility as a tool in order to ensure a more 'sustainable transport system' in the future.

AB Since the Second World War, Australian governments have adopted various approaches to governing nonmetropolitan Australia. The authors profile three distinct approaches to governance characterised as (1) state-centred regionalism; (2) new localism; and (3) new forms of multifaceted regionalism. Although recent policy initiatives have been justified by the argument that the region is the most suitable scale for planning and development in nonmetropolitan Australia, in practice the institutional landscape is a hybrid of overlapping local, regional, and national scales of action. The authors compare this new, multifaceted, regionalism with the so-called 'new regionalism currently being promoted in Western Europe and North America. It is argued that new regionalism differs in quite important ways from the regionalism currently being fostered in Australia. In Australia, the centrality of sustainability principles, and the attempt to foster interdependence amongst stakeholders from the state, market, and civil society, have produced a layer of networked governance that is different from that overseas. It is argued that there is a triple bottom-line 'promise' in the Australian approach which differs from the Western Europe/North American model, and which has the potential to deliver enhanced economic, social, and environmental outcomes.

AB Permit, Trachinotus falcatus are economically and ecologically important throughout their range of the Caribbean, subtropical and tropical western Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico. Despite their economic importance, little is known about the biology and ecology of permit, and most existing information is from Florida. While sufficient information is available to paint a general picture of permit life history, details are lacking for most life stages. For the juvenile life stage, nursery habitats and size and age at settlement have not yet been defined. Although six distinct habitat types (medium energy and low energy windward beaches, leeward beaches, and windward, leeward, and lagoon interior mangrove shorelines) were sampled to determine spatial patterns of habitat use by early juvenile permit at Turneffe Atoll, Belize, Central America, and the Florida Keys, USA, 99% of juvenile permit were found along medium energy windward beaches, indicating their role as nursery habitat for this species. A sub-sample of juvenile permit from Florida was examined to estimate spawning date and age at settlement from otoliths. Size-frequency distributions and otolith age analysis indicate that larval duration is approximately 15 - 20 days, and settlement occurs year-round. Since permit in Florida spawn March through July, from March through September in Cuba, and from February through October in Belize, year-round settlement indicates population connectivity via larval transport. These results lay the foundation for future research on larval supply, population connectivity, and juvenile ecology, and will aid in the ongoing formulation of a conservation plan toward a sustainable fishery for permit.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT
AB Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) in Canada is in dire straits. Despite a huge amount of talk and a flurry of developmental activity associated with CEA concepts, it has not lived up to its glowing promise of helping to achieve sustainability of diverse valued ecosystem components. This article aims to articulate that failure, to examine it in terms of six major problems with CEA, and to propose solutions. The six problem areas include (1) application of CEA in project-level environmental impact assessments (EIAs), (2) an EIA focus on project approval instead of environmental sustainability, (3) a general lack of understanding of ecologic impact thresholds, (4) separation of cumulative effects from project-specific impacts, (5) weak interpretations of cumulative effects by practitioners and analysts, and (6) inappropriate handling of potential future developments. We advocate improvements not only within the purview of project-specific EIAs, but also mainly in the domain of region-scale CEAs and regional environmental effects frameworks (or perhaps land use planning). Only then will the CEA begin to approach the promise of securing sustainability of valued ecosystem components.

AB Participatory environmental management can empower communities and enhance the sustainability of environmental interventions. However, existing power structures and inequalities along class, gender, or ethnic lines could prevent part of the community from accessing the full benefits of the intervention. An analysis of determinants of the willingness-to-participate in an environmental intervention in a Beirut neighborhood is conducted. Socioeconomic, health-risk distribution, and perception of community efficacy are used as predictors. A randomly selected sample of residents was surveyed. Respondents were asked to specify the frequency with which they were willing to be involved in an intervention to address priority environmental problems in the neighborhood. Bivariate and multivariate ordinal regression analyses were conducted. Tests of significance were based on the 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the odds ratio (OR). Males versus females (OR = 4.89, P < 0.001), respiratory patients versus nonsufferers (OR = 5.65, P < 0.001), tenants versus house owners (OR = 2.98, P < 0.01), and the less educated versus the more educated (OR = 2.42, P < 0.05) were significantly more likely to be willing to participate. The reluctance of female community members to participate might be a major hindrance to community-based environmental protection and special strategies must be devised to overcome it. On the other hand, respondents suffering from an illness perceived to be related to environmental toxins are likely to be strong participants in environmental conservation efforts. Finally, the study yielded no evidence that belief or lack of it in the efficacy of community action is a good predictor of the willingness-to-participate in such action.

AB Climatic change will result in great changes in vegetation. In this paper, a biogeographical model, the BIOME1, was used to predict potential vegetation distribution in China under climate change. Firstly, the BIOME1 was validated according to the climate-vegetation relationships in China. Kappa statistics showed that the validated BIOME1 was able to capture the geographical patterns of vegetation more accurately. Then, the validated BIOME1 was used to predict the distribution of vegetation of China under two climatic scenarios produced by a Regional Circulation Model, RegCM2/CN. The simulation results showed obvious northward shifts of the boreal, temperate deciduous and evergreen and tropical forests, a large expansion of tropical dry forest/savanna and reduction of tundra on the Tibetan Plateau. Three vulnerable regions sensitive to climate changes are pointed out, i.e., Northern China, the Tibetan Plateau and Southwestern China (mainly Hengduan Mountains in Yunnan Province and west of Sichuan Province). In recent decades, China has experienced dramatic industrialization and population growth, which exert strong pressure on the environment of China. The consequences of climate changes warrant more attention for maintaining a sustainable environment for China.

AB The pressure on marine renewable resources has rapidly increased over past decades. The resulting scarcity has led to a variety of different control and surveillance instruments. Often they have not improved the current situation, mainly due to institutional failure and intrinsic uncertainties about the state of stocks. This contribution presents an assessment of different management schemes with respect to predefined constraints by utilizing viability theory. Our analysis is based on a bio-economic model which is examined as a dynamic control system in continuous time. Feasible development paths are discussed in detail. It is shown that participatory management may lead to serious problems if a purely resource-based management strategy is employed. The analysis suggests that a less risky management strategy can be implemented if limited data are available.

AB This paper provides a comparison of ecosystem management (EM) to the traditional regulatory management approach and outlines the characteristics of EM from a policy perspective, defining the conditions under which this management tool can be successfully implemented. Ecosystem management is a collaborative and integrative tool focused on balancing societal needs, economic growth, and environmental protection to ensure the long-term ecological integrity of a particular ecosystem. The characteristics of this particular tool include: (1) its holistic approach to environmental problems; (2) its integration of values (economic, social, and environmental) through a collaborative, multi-partner, decision making structure; (3) its reliance on science to guide decisions and set boundaries; and (4) its ability to learn from the implementation of decisions (adaptive management). Examples are draw from Environment Canada's various regional ecosystem initiatives.

AB The transboundary Georgia Basin Puget Sound ecosystem is situated in the southwest corner of British Columbia and northwest comer of Washington State. While bountiful and beautiful, this international region is facing significant threats to its marine and freshwater resources, air quality, habitats and species. These environmental challenges are compounded by rapid population growth and attendant uiban sprawl. As ecosystem stresses amplified and partnerships formed around possible solutions, it became increasingly clear that the shared sustainability challenges in the Georgia Basin and Puget Sound required shared solutions. Federal, state and provincial institutional arrangements were made between jurisdictions, which formalized small scale interest in transboundary management of this ecosystem. Formal agreements, however, can only do so much to further management of an ecosystem that spans international boarders. A transboundary regional research meeting, the 2003 GB/PS Research Conference, opened the doors for large-scale informal cross-boarder cooperation and management. In addition to cooperation, continued efforts to stem toxic pollution, contain urban growth, and protect and restore ecosystems, require a commitment from scientists, educators and policy makers to better integrate research and science with decision-making.

AB The Northern River Ecosystem Initiative (NREI), 1997-2004, has provided new scientific knowledge in response to specific recommendations from its predecessor, the Northern River Basins Study (NRBS), 1990-1996. The two initiatives together provide a remarkable body of science which is, and will continue to be, used by resource managers responsible for economic and environmental sustainability in the northern watersheds of Alberta. The NREI focused its investigative efforts on improving our understanding related to ecological considerations of changes in river flow, effect of climate change on flow, ecological responses to pollution and cumulative effects, vulnerability of drinking water quality, and to a lesser degree, wildlife (birds) response to large scale changes within the watersheds. Key findings are briefly presented in this paper and discussed in greater detail in the other NREI papers included in this. Commensurate with the undertakings of NREI, provincial and territorial governments, First Nation and Metis communities, and other administrative organizations such as the Mackenzie River Basin Board, undertook policy, regulatory, and watershed initiatives towards achieving sustainability and providing reliable drinking water quality.

AB If sustainable development of Canadian waters is to be achieved, a realistic and manageable framework is required for assessing cumulative effects. The objective of this paper is to describe an approach for aquatic cumulative effects assessment that was developed under the Northern Rivers Ecosystem Initiative. The approach is based on a review of existing monitoring practices in Canada and the presence of existing thresholds for aquatic ecosystem health assessments. It suggests that a sustainable framework is possible for cumulative effects assessment of Canadian waters that would result in integration of national indicators of aquatic health, integration of national initiatives (e.g., water quality index, environmental effects monitoring), and provide an avenue where long-term monitoring programs could be integrated with baseline and follow-up monitoring conducted under the environmental assessment process.

AB The International Joint Commission has recently completed a five-year study (2000-2005) to review the operation of structures controlling the flows and levels of the Lake Ontario - St. Lawrence River system. In addition to addressing the multitude of stakeholder interests, the regulation plan review also considers environmental sustainability and integrity of wetlands and various ecosystem components. The present paper outlines the general approach, scientific methodology and applied management considerations of studies quantifying the relationships between hydrology and wetland plant assemblages (% occurrence, surface area) in Lake Ontario and the Upper and Lower St. Lawrence River. Although similar study designs were used across the study region, different methodologies were required that were specifically adapted to suit the important regional differences between the lake and river systems, range in water-level variations, and confounding factors (geomorphic types, exposure, sediment characteristics, downstream gradient of water quality, origin of water masses in the Lower River). Performance indicators (metrics), such as total area of wetland in meadow marsh vegetation type, that link wetland response to water levels will be used to assess the effects of different regulation plans under current and future (climate change) water-supply scenarios.

AB Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River (LOSL) wetland bird abundance and diversity are greatly influenced by lake and river hydrology. Our study used an interdisciplinary ecosystem approach, blending avian and plant ecology, ecohydraulic, statistical ecology and modelling to evaluate potential impacts of water level fluctuations on indicator species representative of the wetland breeding bird assemblages in the entire LOSL freshwater system. Multi-year (2000-2003) bird surveys captured bird distribution and density in wetland habitats under varying degrees of water inandation, depth and fluctuation. Analyses revealed strong associations between estimated breeding pair densities and plant communities, water depth, and degree of water level fluctuation during the breeding season for a suite of wetland bird species using marsh, wet meadow, shrub swamp and treed swamp habitats. These quantitative associations were used to develop wetland bird performance indicators for use in a LOSL water regulation review study. Several bird species also nest at or near the water surface and are thus vulnerable to nest flooding or stranding. Changes to the seasonal hydrology of Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River that result in an increased frequency or magnitude of these nest failure events may have a significant impact on regional population sustainability. Long term nest record databases were analyzed to create nesting flooding and stranding probability equations based on water level increases and decreases during the breeding season. These species-specific nesting relationships were incorporated into a reproduction index.
   Many breeding bird species were strongly associated with specific wetland plant communities. Predicted habitat suitability, as measured by estimated breeding pair density, can also change significantly within a specific wetland plant community based solely on changes in water depth during the breeding season. Three indicator species, Black Tern, Least Bittern and Virginia Rail were selected as key environmental performance indicators for alternate regulation plan comparisons.
   Water regulation criteria should be such that the long term diversity and abundance of wetland plant communities and frequency of spring flooding in marsh habitats during breeding are not reduced. Magnitude and frequency of water level change during the nesting season (May-July) can also adversely impact reproductive success of many wetland bird species. As such, regulation criteria that increase the seasonal magnitude and frequency of water level change may be detrimental to the long term viability of certain regional breeding bird populations.

AB The Atlantic Coastal Action Program (ACAP) is a unique, community-based program initiated by Environment Canada in 1991 to help Atlantic Canadians restore and sustain watersheds and adjacent coastal areas. ACAP is the eastem-most Environment Canada Ecosystem Initiative. The ACAP family is currently made up of 14 ecosystem-based organizations in the four Atlantic provinces. Each one of these non-profit organizations operates independently, but is formally linked under the umbrella of ACAP to represent a force stronger than the individual parts. In Environment Canada's experience, the program consistently demonstrates the value of a community-based approach and produces results on an ecosystem basis. This paper will examine some of the impacts of ACAP in terms of economics, credible community science, and environmental results which most often align with Environment Canada's objectives. It will explore the influences of the community-based approach to environmental management on multiple scales (local, regional, etc.). Through examples, the paper will demonstrate the effectiveness of ACAP in influencing some of the policies, programs and attitudes of various levels of government and industry in the region, as well as describe how the community-based model has been exported internationally. The paper will conclude with a discussion on a planned path forward for ACAP.

AB In the United Kingdom, the bicycle has played a role in the oppositional cultures of various social movements; feminism and socialism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, post-1960s anarchism and, most recently, environmentalism. This article discusses the significance of the bicycle to the discourse and practice of the contemporary environmental movement. At the level of discourse, the bicycle is mobilised routinely in constructing the green visions to which environmentalism aspires; and in practice, use of the bicycle organises and helps to sustain the distinctive 'green lifestyles' of environmental activists. Thus, as an object both utilised discursively in green talk and texts, and actually ridden by green practitioners, the bicycle powerfully enables the articulation of an alternative society, a green vision of sustainability. The case of the bicycle demonstrates how 'ordinary' materialities can contribute to the development and performance of antagonistic cultural and political identities.

AB We study the dynamic impact of recycling through its effect on the production set of the economy and its relationship with natural resources. The contribution of renewable and recyclable resources for sustainability is studied. Although in the short run recycling may alleviate resource scarcity, in the long run it is not enough to compensate for the exhaustibility of non-renewable resources and the possibility of obtaining non-decreasing output paths crucially depends on the extent to which production rests on renewable resources. Furthermore, recycling interacts with natural resource growth, surprisingly not always favoring sustainability. The Production and Recycling Function is a generalization of the traditional production function, providing an integrated view of regular production and recycling and representing the production set of the economy when a recycling technology is available.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID SEWAGE-SLUDGE; INCINERATION
AB An integrated appraisal of five technology scenarios for the co-combustion of biosolids in the UK energy and waste management policy context is presented. Co-combustion scenarios with coal, municipal solid waste, wood, and for cement manufacture were subject to thermodynamic and materials flow modeling and evaluated by 19 stakeholder representatives. All scenarios provided a net energy gain (0.58-5.0 kWh/kg dry solids), having accounted for the energy required for transportation and sludge drying. Co-combustion within the power generation and industrial (e.g., cement) sectors is most readily implemented but provides poor water utility control, and it suffers from poor public perception. Co-combustion with wastes or biomass appears more sustainable but requires greater investment and presents significant risks to water utilities. Incongruities within current energy and waste management policy are discussed and conclusions for improved understanding are drawn.

TI Procedure for determining maximum sustainable power generated by

AB Power generated by microbial fuel cells is computed as a product of current passing through an external resistor and voltage drop across this resistor. If the applied resistance is very low, then high instantaneous power generated by the cell is measured, which is not sustainable; the cell cannot deliver that much power for long periods of time. Since using small electrical resistors leads to erroneous assessment of the capabilities of microbial fuel cells, a question arises: what resistor should be used in such measurements? To address this question, we have defined the sustainable power as the steady state of power delivery by a microbial fuel cell under a given set of conditions and the maximum sustainable power as the highest sustainable power that a microbial fuel cell can deliver under a given set of conditions. Selecting the external resistance that is associated with the maximum sustainable power in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) is difficult because the operator has limited influence on the main factors that control power generation: the rate of charge transfer at the current-limiting electrode and the potential established across the fuel cell. The internal electrical resistance of microbial fuel cells varies, and it depends on the operational conditions of the fuel cell. We have designed an empirical procedure to predict the maximum sustainable power that can be generated by a microbial fuel cell operated under a given set of conditions. Following the procedure, we change the external resistors incrementally, in steps of 500 Omega every 10, 60, or 180 s and measure the anode potential, the cathode potential, and the cell current. Power generated in the microbial fuel cell that we were using was limited by the anodic current. The anodic potential was used to determine the condition where the maximum sustainable power is obtained. The procedure is simple, microbial fuel cells can be characterized within an hour, and the results of the measurements can serve many purposes, such as: (1) estimating power generation in various MFCs, (2) comparing power generation in MFCs using different electroactive reactants, (3) quantifying the effects of the operational regime on the power generation in MFCs, and finally, (4) the purpose for which the procedure was designed, optimizing the performance of existing MFCs.

DE Giessen Declaration; new nutrition science project; nutrition science
AB In the Giessen Declaration' a new broad definition of nutrition science is presented. This extended definition is necessary now, to put nutrition science in a position to contribute to the solution of the problems in the 21(st) century. The key elements of the new definition confirm the traditional role of nutrition science as a biological discipline, that deals with food systems, foods and drinks, and their nutrients and other constituents. New is the incorporation of the interactions within and between all relevant biological, social and environmental systems. The overall principle is ethical in nature, that should also be guided by the philosophies of co-responsibility, sustainability, human rights approaches, and by understanding evolution, history and ecology. Thus nutrition science should be the basis of food and nutrition policies, which should be designed to identify, create, conserve and protect rational, sustainable and equitable communal, national and global food systems, in order to sustain the health, well-being and integrity of humankind and also the living and physical worlds.

AB Lake Victoria is one of the African Great Lakes, and an important source of affordable protein food in the form of fish. It provides employment, income, and export earnings to the riparian communities. Despite this importance there are major concerns about the status and exploitation of the fisheries. This study assesses if current extraction rates/yield of Nile perch, Lates niloticus (L.), from Lake Victoria are sustainable for the foreseeable future. The paper reviews trends in catch and effort in the Nile perch fishery and models the expected scenarios using ECOPATH. The fishery exhibits, classic indicators of intensive fishing, erring towards overexploitation, including: (i) decline in total estimated catch of Nile perch in recent years from the peaks in the 1990s. This is coupled with a shift in contribution of catches from higher trophic level species (Nile perch) to lower trophic level (dagaa) species. (ii) Three major trends in the fishing effort are evident: (a) almost doubling of the number of fishers and fishing boats between 1990 and 2000, and the even greater expansion between 2000 and 2002; (b) a large scale increase in the number of gears operational in the lake; and (c) the propensity for use of 'illegal' gears. (iii) Catch-per-unit-effort has declined from about 80 to 45 kg per boat day. (iv) Predictive modelling (ECOSIM) of the future of the Nile perch fisheries under a scenario of increased fishing effort suggests that the fisheries are unsustainable and will decline in the long term. It appears that the Nile perch stocks in the three riparian countries are under intense fishing pressure, and unless concerted action is taken, the potential for degradation of the resources is prevalent. In view of the importance of these fisheries, it is recommended that a precautionary approach to further intens-ification of the fisheries is adopted until such time empirical evidence shows that the fisheries are capable of further expansion and intensification. The main options for management are devolvement of responsibilities for the fisheries to the communities, enforcement of existing regulations, improved monitoring and data collection processes, reducing post-harvest losses and increasing the value of the products to the export market.

AB The whelk Buccinanops globulosum, a very common prosobranch mollusk in northern Patagonian, is the target of a new fishery in San Matias Gulf. Given certain biological characteristics making this species susceptible to overfishing, a study started in 2000 in order to collect data or demography and growth at age of this species, with the aim to design and to implement a provisional management plan.
   Mean density was estimated at 111 individuals m(-2) (S.D. = 16.77). Females outnumbered males in most of the months (P < 0.05) and appeared laying egg capsules from November to January. The smallest female carrying egg capsules was 45.2 mm total conch length (n = 36). Recruitment peak was identified in January 2002 and January-February 2003. Early crawling juveniles had a mean size of 4.2 mm conch length (S.D. = 0.51 n = 60).
   A total of 450 individuals (263 females and 187 males) were examined for growth at age. Significant differences were found in the growth parameters between sexes (maximum likelihood method; chi = 92.34; gl = 3; P < 0.001). Growth of males was lower than growth of females.
   Commercial capture of whelks is done by diving using a bait of fish discarded or open living purple clams. Only adults up 4 cm are retained during the fishing operations in a net bag. During 2000-2004 the annual catch varied from 20 to 9200 kg. Fluctuations in landings have more often reflected market prices rather than changes in the abundance of the resource. If effort for this whelk increases it should be necessary to consider a period of no fishery at all in the reproductive/recruitment period in order to ensure the sustainability of the stock.

AB In the Archipelago Sea, one of the most valuable species in the professional and recreational fisheries is the pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), mainly caught with gillnets. Currently, the minimum mesh size (bar length) for pikeperch gillnet fishing in the Archipelago Sea is 43-45 mm. Enlarging the mesh size has been suggested to ensure the biological sustainability of pikeperch fishing. The impacts of enlarging the minimum allowable mesh size to 50 mm were analysed using a bio-economic simulation model and data based on pikeperch samples from professional catches from 1978 to 1997, and catch statistics. The effect of uncertainty in the variable values was examined by specifying probability distribution functions for the main variables and using Monte Carlo simulation. According to the results, the yield would be reduced by 50% in the first year, but after some years it would stabilise at about 20% higher level than before the shift. The biomass of the spawning stock would be doubled as a result of the larger mesh size, which would reduce the risk of low recruitment and benefit the fisheries in the long term. However, the short-term impacts on the profitability of commercial fishing would be negative, because it would take 3 years before the expected present value of the catch exceeded the value prior to the change in mesh size, and 8 years before the expected net present value of the catch would be positive. The challenge for fisheries management is to find a solution that would be both biologically and economically reasonable. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Since the 1990s, the international market for importing aquarium fish is suspicious of stock coming from South-East Asia. Fish catches are still executed with cyanide-based toxic products. In the present paper, the potential of the French Polynesian Islands to develop a marine aquarium fish business with a new approach is explored. Coral reef fish are captured at the larval stage with crest nets, then larvae are reared in aquaria before being put on the world ornamental fish market. This approach offers several advantages: (i) larvae are captured with a passive system placed on the reef crest (crest net) that does not destroy the environment and limits the stress on collected larvae; (ii) larvae are then put into farmed basins that allow them to be controlled sanitarily; and (iii) larvae are weaned at the farm and fed rapidly with artificial food. This method increases survival rates as it eliminates the food acclimatization problem of fish captured at adult stage (main cause of fish mortality in aquaria). Overall, reared larvae will constitute a new product in terms of species, sizes and quality of ornamental fish on the aquarium market.

AB The fusion-driven subcritical system (named FDS-I) was previously proposed as an intermediate step toward the final application of fusion energy. A conceptual design of the FDS-I is presented, which consists of the fusion neutron driver with relatively easy-achieved plasma parameters, and the He-gas/liquid lithium-lead Dual-cooled subcritical Waste Transmutation (DWT) blanket used to transmute long-lived radioactive wastes and to generate energy on the basis of self-sustainable fission and fusion fuel cycle. An overview of the FDS-I is given and the specifications of the design analysis are summarized. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional fragmented and mechanistic science is unable to cope with issues about sustainability, as these are often related to complex, self-organizing systems. In the paper, sustainable development is seen as an unending process defined neither by fixed goals nor by specific means of achieving them. It is argued that, in order to understand the sources of and the solutions to modem problems, linear and mechanistic thinking must give way to non-linear and organic thinking, more commonly referred to as systems thinking. System Dynamics, which operates in a whole-system fashion, is put forward as a powerful methodology to deal with issues of sustainability. Examples of successful applications are given.
   Any system in which humans are involved is characterized by the following essential system properties: Bounded rationality, limited certainty, limited predictability, indeterminate causality, and evolutionary change. We need to resort to an adaptive approach, where we go through a learning process and modify our decision rules and our mental models of the real world as we go along. This will enable us to improve system performance by setting dynamic improvement goals (moving targets) for it.
   Finally, it is demonstrated how causal loop diagrams can be used to find the leverage points of a system. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable agriculture meets human needs for food, enhances the quality of life of people, protects the integrity of natural systems, and is economically profitable. Making a transition to agricultural sustainability involves difficult choices and an understanding of the complex trade-offs associated with different agricultural pathways. In this paper, we describe the development and application of a decision support tool-AgFutures-for exploring alternative futures for agricultural sustainability in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia. The main core of the model is simulation of future land-use changes in different scenarios and assessment of social, economic and environmental consequences under these scenarios. Evolution of land-use is simulated as a result of not only biophysical conditions but also as a result of human behaviour and choices, specifically related to lifestyle, agricultural management practices and institutional policies. Eight different scenarios are generated and compared for their impacts on sustainability in the Lower Mainland.
   AgFutures helps users to identify desirable future scenarios and the set of choices and trade-offs that they are willing to accept. Identification of these allows decision-makers-to-formulate policies that would lead to achieving the goals of sustainable agriculture. The novel aspect of this model lies in its design and methods, which represent a balance between the need for rigour and the need for a tool that can be used by a wide array of users.

AB To reduce soil destruction by urban sprawl, land use planning has to promote the use of soils within cities. As soil functions are now protected by law in Germany, urban soil quality has to be evaluated before soil management. We studied contributions from elemental carbon (EC) and soil organic matter (SOM) quality in topsoil horizons at seven sites in Stuttgart, Germany, differing in impurities by technogenic substrates. The most disturbed site was found at a disused railway area while high-density areas, public parks and garden areas showed varying degrees of disturbance by anthropogenic activities. For most soils, compounds derived from plant litter dominated organic matter (OM) quality characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Although high contents of EC (up to 70% of soil organic carbon) were indicated by thermal oxidation, this was not confirmed by aromatic C intensities in NMR spectra. Only for the highly aromatic railway soil were results for elemental carbon by thermal oxidation and NMR similar. As other technogenic substrates beside EC like plastics may also contribute in the long-term to OM in urban soils, new analytical techniques are therefore required. This knowledge will promote the evaluation of urban soil properties and their sustainable use. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Conversion of forests to agricultural land in the American tropics, through traditional agricultural practices such as shifting cultivation, has not been able to maintain stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC), and increasing population pressure has led to shortened fallow periods, causing further losses of soil fertility. However, land management practices such as agroforestry can provide a sustainable alternative to single cropping because of its ability to maintain or increase the SOC pool. This study quantified SOC and nitrogen (N) pools, gross SOC turnover, residue stabilization efficiency (RSEAC) in the alley crop, Soil delta C-13 partitioning, C-3-C abundance and delta N-15 dynamics in 19- and 10-year Gliricidia sepium and Elythrina poeppigiana alley cropping system. Each system was studied at two fertilizer levels (tree prunings only [-N or -A], and tree prunings plus chicken manure [+N], or Arachis pintoi as a groundcover [+A]), and was compared to a sole crop system. The SOC and N pools were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the 19-year-old alley crop compared to the sole crop, but not significantly different (p<0.05) in the 10-year-old system. Soil C and N (%) showed a similar trend as that of the SOC and N pools in both 19- and 10-year-old systems. Gross SOC turnover, to a 20 cm depth, ranged from 12 to 21 years in the 19-year-old alley crop compared to 50 years in the sole crop, and from 20 to 32 years in the 10-year-old alley crop compared to 106 years in the sole crop. The RSEAC ranged from 10% to 58% in the 19-year-old system, and from 3% to 43% in the 10-year-old system. The delta C-13 signature of the soil shifted significantly (p<0.05) towards that of C-3 vegetation in the alley crop due to the greater input of organic residues from tree prunings compared to the sole crop. The proportion of input from tree prunings only in the 19-year-old alley crop ranged from 14% to 20%, and from 9% to 11% in the 10-year-old system to a soil depth of 20 cm. The delta N-15 signature of the soil showed two patterns: that of the 19-year-old system being enriched in delta N-15, and that of the 10-year-old system being depleted in delta N-15 compared to the sole crop. The addition of manure in the 19-year-old system has enriched the Soil delta N-15 and in the 10-year-old system the soil was depleted due to the N-2-fixing groundcover A. pintoi.

AB Environmental skepticism denies the reality and importance of mainstream global environmental problems. However, its most important challenges are in its civic claims which receive much less attention. These civic claims defend the basis of ethical authority of the dominant social paradigm. The article explains how political values determine what skeptics count as a problem. One such value described is "deep anthropocentrism, " or the attempt to split human society from non-human nature and reject ecology as a legitimate field of ethical concern. This bias frames what skeptics consider legitimate knowledge. The paper then argues that the contemporary conservative countermovement has marshaled environmental skepticism to function as a rearguard for a maladaptive set of core values that resist public efforts to address global environmental sustainability. As such, the paper normatively argues that environmental skepticism is a significant threat to efforts to achieve sustainability faced by human societies in a globalizing world.

AB This article presents two new models that give a perspective on green chemistry (GC). The first model is a classification model of different green chemistry activities, while the second model concerns green chemistry policy and knowledge areas (green chemistry principles, industrial biotechnology and "the green sector"). A broad view of green chemistry is used, where all activities with the aim of greening of chemistry and chemical practice are included. The classification model consists of three main parts: (1) research activities ((a) basic chemical research; (b) chemical engineering), (2) management activities ((a) laboratory practice; (b) production; (c) consumption) and (3) policy activities. This article refers to over seventy publications, covering a broad area of research and type.

AB Many countries are using the strategy of international recruitment to make up for shortages of health professionals to the detriment of health systems in the poorest parts of the world. This study reviewed the potential impact of eight national level and international codes of practice or similar instruments that are being introduced to encourage ethical recruitment in order to protect these countries. Whilst effective dissemination of the instruments is generally in place, support systems, incentives and sanctions and monitoring systems necessary for effective implementation and sustainability are currently weak or have not been planned. If such codes or instruments are to be used to protect developing country health systems, lessons should be learnt from the early adopters; the focus of protecting developing country health systems needs to be emphasised in instruments with multiple objectives; the process of implementing the instruments strengthened; and internal and external pressure needs to be increased to ensure the codes and instruments lead to ethical recruitment and help to protect developing country health systems.

AB The detection and conservation of spawning units is of crucial importance in highly migratory species. The sutchi catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (Pangasiidae; Teleostei) is a common large-sized tropical fish, which migrates annually to several upstream spawning sites on the Lower Mekong River and feeds on the huge floodplain of the Lower Mekong and Tonle Sap for the other half of the year. We hypothesised that because of the relative size of the feeding and spawning habitat, genetic variability would be high and homogeneous in foraging populations, but that spawning stocks would be distinct in space and time. To test these predictions, 567 individuals from 10 geographic locations separated by up to 1230 km along the Lower Mekong River were genotyped at seven microsatellite loci. The level of genetic diversity was much higher than other freshwater fish and reached values comparable to marine species ( mean H-e = 0.757). All samples collected at the potential spawning sites deviated from Hardy - Weinberg expectations, suggesting admixture. Individual-based clustering methods revealed genetic heterogeneity and enabled the detection of three genetically distinct sympatric populations. There was no evidence of recent reduction in effective population size in any population. Contrasting with the vast extent of the feeding grounds, the shortage of spawning grounds seems to have moved sutchi catfish towards diachronous spawning. Hence the sustainable exploitation of this natural resource hinges on the conservation of the limited spawning grounds and open migration routes between the spawning and feeding grounds.

AB Intergenerational justice is implicit in international commitments to sustainability. If ecological, economic, and social components of sustainability are to be achieved there is a necessity for intergenerational justice considerations to be included in decision-making. The present generation's risk judgments should include consideration of the possible outcomes for their children. But intergenerational issues cannot be considered in isolation from other current risk and fairness concerns. This article reports a community-based integrative model that describes justice and other attitudes and motivations that determine community and individual pro-environmental behavior in two nations: Germany and Australia. This model can account for a considerable amount of the variance in political compliance as well as various proenvironmental behaviors. Group or individual self-interests have nearly no effects on global protective behavior. It is shown that universal as well as contextual principles including distributive (within or between generations), procedural and interactive justice, play a crucial role in fairness judgments. Other principles are also taken into account, such as efficiency, environmental rights, and rights to economic welfare. The results are discussed in relation to the importance of complex community fairness judgments in predicting and evaluating acceptance of political decisions, and for promoting proenvironmental behavior.

AB In arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and other parts of the world, flows of historically ephemeral streams are now perennially dominated by municipal and/or industrial effluent discharges, particularly in urbanized watersheds. Because effluent-dominated and dependent water bodies have previously received limited scientific study, we reviewed select contemporary topics associated with water quality of ephemeral streams receiving effluent flows. Our findings indicate that these ecosystems present numerous challenges to aquatic scientists and water resources managers, including: 1) appropriate ecosystems or upstream conditions used reference sites in biomonitoring are difficult to locate or do not exist; 2) water quality criteria, particularly for metals, are dramatically influenced by unique site-specific stream and land use conditions; 3) effluent-dominated streams represent worse-case scenarios for evaluating and predicting aquatic responses to emerging contaminants (e.g., pharmaceuticals and personal care products); 4) low-flow and drought conditions often preclude effective biomonitoring and water quality interpretation, or skew ambient assessment results; 5) chemical-physical water quality parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature) are dramatically altered by effluent and stormwater characteristics; and 6) beneficial reuse of reclaimed effluent waters potentially conflict with sustainability of ecological integrity. Subsequently, we recommend several water quality research priorities for effluentdominated water bodies.

AB A successful new product development strategy involves the identification, development, and exploitation of key resources. Such exploitation of a firm's unique knowledge base ultimately leads to successful new products and, in turn, a sustainable competitive advantage. In this paper, we look at a firm's knowledge strategy along three dimensions, and examine the impact of firm size and age on the type of knowledge strategies used to build technological strength and competitive success. The three dimensions of knowledge strategy examined are: extent of emphasis on speed of learning, emphasis on internal versus external sourcing of knowledge, and the development of a broad versus a narrow knowledge base.
   Using a population of 27 firms from the drug delivery sector of the pharmaceutical industry, we found that firm size and age influenced the success of firm knowledge strategies. Interestingly, we found that the differences in the knowledge strategy dimensions between large and small firms and between old and young firms were not as great as expected. However, we found that firm size and age moderate the relationship between knowledge strategies and technological strength. In other words, firms that used appropriate knowledge strategies for their size and age optimized their technological strength. Concerning size, smaller firms that focused on faster learning and developing a narrow knowledge base were able to optimize technological strength. On the other hand, large firms that developed a broader knowledge base and focused on internal learning achieved similar success. Concerning age, younger firms that maintained connections to external sources of learning and developed a narrower, niche-based knowledge optimized their technological strength.

SO INTERCIENCIA

ID MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH; RAPID APPRAISAL; AGRICULTURE
AB Agroecology has long been considered as a science or discipline, having the agroecosystem as the unit of study. Theoretical or methodological components of agroecology are derived from available scientific tools or they are complemented by other disciplines. This discipline mixture or interaction makes agroecology something more than a pure discipline. Agroecology strengthens itself by systems thinking and systems approach, becoming more vigorous by using the advances and methods derived from the discipline, the multidiscipline and the interdiscipline, and takes into account local knowledge where ecological, social and economic concepts and principles are applied in a reasonable manner; consequently agroecology becomes a transdiscipline. Depending on the social production relationships, farmer production. systems of food and other agricultural products enhance or deteriorate the natural resources base; furthermore, they are conditioned by market prices and public demands. Agroecology considers the ecological, social or economic principles making them available to modern agriculture. Agriculture requires harmonic functioning with the environment and natural resources offering innocuous food and healthy agricultural products to society. Agroecology as a transdiscipline has the opportunity or may have the responsibility of focusing on the analysis, design, development and evaluation of high and low external input agricultural systems, considering them as "systems" that work at different hierarchical levels. For this reason, there is no doubt that considering agroecology as a transdiscipline can contribute to the long term sustainability of agroecosystems and its natural resources base.

TI Implementation of a Basic Package of Oral Care: towards a reorientation

ID HEALTH
AB Dental NGOs and volunteers working in disadvantaged communities around the world do so with the best of intentions and with high motivation. Regrettably, the impact of this engagement on oral health at the population level remains rather low. This is mainly due to the choice of inappropriate approaches, the failure to integrate their projects within existing health care systems and the lack of sustainability. This paper proposes the concept of the Basic Package of Oral Care (BPOC) as a guiding framework for dental NGO and volunteer activities. The main components of the BPOC (Oral Urgent Treatment, Affordable Fluoride Toothpaste, Atraumatic Restorative Treatment) offer many opportunities for effective, affordable and sustainable activities that aim to improve oral health on the community and population level. Only through a reorientation of dental volunteer services and NGOs towards new roles and activities can a sustained impact on global oral health be possible. Recommendations are given that could help dental NGOs and volunteers in this process of change.

AB Hydrogen civilization (HyCi) conception is generalized. Some biospheric, noospheric and synergetic aspects of the HyCi-conception are analyzed. For the first time it is noted that the HyCi-conception includes two constituent, mutually conditioned parts: humanitarian-cultural part and environmental-industrial one. The most important possible stages of the transition to the HyCi have been indicated, including the important role of the world hydrogen movement, general public, international and regional organizations, parliaments and governments of the world countries. It has been emphasized that these global changes in humankind's life need a long period of time, humanitarian-cultural and legislative-economical self-regulation of the life of people and countries. Some modern times challenges of the IAHE and the World Hydrogen Movement are discussed. (c) 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Civilization is defined as an aggregate achievement of inventions for realizing lofty human ideas, and culture is defined as the intellectual side. The realization of human ideas is the sustainable development (SD), and one of these pillars is the energy system. The main current of the human energy carriers has made the transition from coal to petroleum, and from petroleum to natural gas. This trend means the transition from the fuels with a larger ratio of carbon to those with a larger ratio of hydrogen. Ultimately, the main energy current will be converged to hydrogen. The hydrogen civilization is about to emerge today. The centripetal force acting upon every fuel toward hydrogen has an intellectual analogy to Brownian motion, which is one of the main topics of the concerned complexity science. Moreover, Ashby's requisite variety law indicates that the civilization must wear the cloth of the culture in order to build up the endlessly sustainable civilization.

AB Contemporary approaches in urban ecology should take into account interactions and feedbacks between socio-ecological dimensions. Sustainability indicators are key tools to assess such integration, but initiatives are diverse and there is no agreed framework for the assessment of such interactions and feedbacks. Despite this formidable challenge, several attempts have been made to reach out beyond the traditional subject areas of environment, economy and society in frameworks for indicators of sustainable development. While efforts to develop such a methodology have been made from different scales and levels of analyses, as we descend to the local scale, initiatives are multiplied. There is a need to channel the diversity of these various initiatives and standardize some concepts and methods. In this paper I deal with the pros and cons of the most commonly applied conceptual frameworks, looking for a method able to optimize the main purposes of sustainable development indicators. Starting from this foundation, I build a new proposal combining different methods previously applied in some research fields. A single Hierarchical Framework, developed to assess sustainable forest management is represented graphically through a visual model presented in the Johannesburg Summit of 2002, the Dashboard of Sustainability. An appraisal of the local contribution to global sustainability is obtained by introducing the Ecological Footprint into the methodological procedure.

AB Forest policies that devolve forest-use rights to local people have undergone development over the past few years in Laos. As collaboration between local people and forestry officials is seen as indispensable to effective and sustainable local forest management, the objective of this study is to clarify the issues pertinent to the resolution of latent conflict between these two stakeholders. The issues are examined by presenting two case studies in terms of forest management as perceived by local people and forestry officials; the first in a rich forest area and the second in a degraded forest. Issues relating to land and borders and social capital are identified as the most important in the degraded forest area, while social capital is a very important issue in the rich forest area. Our studies show that the problems of land and border issues in the degraded forest area were caused by an inappropriate resettlement policy. This can be interpreted as the mismanagement of social capital, and for effective local forest management it is very important to overcome problems of this nature. The effective use of social capital has so far been overlooked, however, in the establishment of collaborative forest governance at the local level.

AB Evaluation of sustainability is the core of research on sustainable land use. To a certain extent, traditional social, economic and ecological evaluation for sustainable land use can be regarded as an appraisal on the temporal scale without evaluation of spatial patterns. Landscape ecology can help to realize spatial evaluation for sustainable land use. In this paper, we construct landscape ecological indicators for evaluating sustainable coastal land use from the aspects of landscape productivity, threats and stability, to realize a synthetic temporal-spatial evaluation. These cover the five pillars of sustainable land use, i.e. productivity, security, protection, viability and acceptability. The results of applying landscape ecological evaluation to a case study in Wudi County in China show that land use sustainability is somewhat low and there are great regional differences between its 11 villages. We classified the 11 villages into 5 grades: strong sustainable land use, sustainable land use, weak sustainable land use, weak unsustainable land use, and strong unsustainable land use. Each grade has different land use characteristics and differs in the countermeasures required. But the core countermeasures in all the grades are to improve landscape productivity, to reduce human threats and to optimize landscape patterns.

TI Financial viability and profitability of irrigation in Crimea, Ukraine

LA English
DT Article

   economy; Ukraine
AB Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 199 1, the financial sustainability of irrigated agriculture in Crimea (Ukraine) has been endangered due to transitional problems. The undefined state of ownership, absence of secure agricultural markets and lack of farmers' funds for operations and maintenance resulted in irrigation equipment breaking down. Consequently, irrigation water demand has fallen dramatically. This paper looks at whether irrigated agriculture is financially viable and profitable in a market economy. By comparing the price paid for water delivery services with the actual irrigation water expenditure, it becomes clear that there is currently only partial cost recovery. By comparing returns to irrigation water with the potential costs of water delivery, it is clear that irrigation could be profitable in the future even in the most distant areas. It is interesting to note that on-farm costs account for a substantial share of the total potential irrigation costs and the challenge is therefore to reduce and fund on-farm costs.

AB A Basin-wide Holistic Integrated Water Assessment (BHIWA) model was developed by the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) under the Country Policy Support Programme (CPSP) to study and integrate impacts of water for "food", "people" and "nature" sectors on water availability and derive policies supporting sustainable development. The model was applied to two typical river basins in India. The model provides for past, present and future conditions a sound and much broader "knowledge base" to understand the state of water availability under alternative scenarios by different use sectors at the basin/sub-basin level. The scenario-based approach has allowed the testing of various plausible policy options for managing water and related land resources and to suggest suitable modifications in India's National Water Policy.

ID RESOURCES; RICE
AB The Office du Niger is a centrally managed collective irrigation scheme of 80000 ha, mainly cultivated with flooded rice. In the context of recent reforms, water distribution and maintenance at the tertiary canal level were left to farmers. In this paper, their ability to resolve collective action problems through devising, monitoring and enforcing rules is diagnosed through a questionnaire survey of 89 farmers on 59 tertiary canals from five villages. Results show that rules are devised only on 30 and 24% of the canals for water distribution and maintenance respectively. Moreover, there is often no consensus on rules among farmers, and monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms are absent. This results in individualistic behavior causing problems concerning water distribution and maintenance for respectively 20 and 43% of the interviewed farmers. Ineffectiveness of peer pressure and farmers' incomplete mentality shift towards assuming collective responsibility are impediments to successful organization of water management. With water supply being abundant and the infrastructure recently rehabilitated, organization of water management at tertiary level is, however, not always required in order to avoid problems. On the other hand, the current state of affairs is not considered sustainable, as the irrigated area will strongly expand and the irrigation infrastructure ages with time. Measures of sensitization and group empowerment accompanying the process of management transfer will therefore be desirable. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Animal welfare and the ethical issues it raises have been discussed intensively for a couple of decades. The emphasis has been on the direct effects of housing and husbandry, but more attention is now being given to problems originating in selective breeding. European attempts to adjust animal welfare legislation to deal with these problems have been largely unsuccessful, but the fact that selective breeding can introduce welfare problems continues to place an ethical responsibility on the animal breeding industry. Since breeding decisions are made centrally and, increasingly, internationally, strategic change is only likely to occur if it is embedded in an international agreement of some kind. The aim of this paper is to describe the key ethical issues facing animal breeding and assess the suggestion that the breeding industry itself can deal with ethical issues by means of an ethical code. Results from recent projects involving commercial breeding enterprises are presented.

AB Several writers on animal ethics defend the abolition of most or all animal agriculture, which they consider an unethical exploitation of sentient non-human animals. However, animal agriculture can also be seen as a co-evolution over thousands of years, that has affected biology and behavior on the one hand, and quality of life of humans and domestic animals on the other. Furthermore, animals are important in sustainable agriculture. They can increase efficiency by their ability to transform materials unsuitable for human consumption and by grazing areas that would be difficult to harvest otherwise. Grazing of natural pastures is essential for the pastoral landscape, an important habitat for wild flora and fauna and much valued by humans for its aesthetic value. Thus it seems that the environment gains substantially when animals are included in sustainable agricultural systems. But what about the animals themselves? Objections against animal agriculture often refer to the disrespect for animals' lives, integrity, and welfare in present intensive animal production systems. Of the three issues at stake, neither integrity nor animal welfare need in principle be violated in carefully designed animal husbandry systems. The main ethical conflict seems to lie in the killing of animals, which is inevitable if the system is to deliver animal products. In this paper, we present the benefits and costs to humans and animals of including animals in sustainable agriculture, and discuss how to address some of the ethical issues involved.

AB Background: Children with IgE-mediated allergy to foods frequently react to seeds of oilseed rape (Brassica napus ssp. oleifera) and turnip rape (Brassica rapa ssp. oleifera) in skin prick tests (SPTs). Sensitization pathways are not known.
   Objective: We identified possible major allergens in oilseed rape and turnip rape using sera from 72 atopic children (mean age, 3.3 years) with positive SPT responses to oilseed rape and turnip rape.
   Methods: Allergens from oilseed rape and turnip rape seed extracts were purified by using gel filtration and cation exchange chromatography and characterized by means of reversed-phase chromatography, N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. IgE binding of sera from 72 children with positive SPT reactions to oilseed rape and turnip rape and 72 age- and sex-matched atopic control subjects with negative SPT responses were analyzed by means of IgE ELISA and immunoblotting. In vivo reactivity of the purified allergens was tested with SPTs in 6 children.
   Results: In IgE immunoblotting and IgE ELISA major reactivity was to a group of homologous, approximately 9.5- to 14.5-kd proteins. These allergens were identified as 2S albumins, also known as napins, by means of N-terminal amino acid sequencing. In ELISA approximately 80% of the patients had IgE to purified napins from both plants. In SPTs purified napins caused positive reactions in all 6 children tested.
   Conclusions: This study shows that 2S albumins in oilseed rape and turnip rape are new potential food allergens. Further studies are needed to clarify the routes of exposure and mechanisms of sensitization.

AB The process of desertification in the Otindag sandy land has increased dramatically over the past several decades. While there has been an increase in research on recent changes. little is known about the historical vegetation cover, the soils and the past biogeographical patterns, which are important for understanding the desertification causes and for effective desertification control. This research explores two relevant issues: (1) what are the major causes for ecosystem change and desertification; and (2) what are the implications for developing management policies, including those related to engineering projects. For these purposes, a meta-process model is developed to simulate several key parameters of plant community, including foliage projective cover (FPC) and net primary production (NPP). Their dynamics over the past 40 years are analysed. It is found that if only climate is considered, the simulated NPP and FPC of vegetation community show an increasing trend, although the increase is not statistically significant. This indicates that climate may not be the key cause for desertification in this area. Instead, socio-economic factors should be mainly responsible for such changes, as is confirmed by our further analysis. Two measurements are proposed for sustainable environment management: development and maintenance of suitable vegetation coverage of at least 46.7% and implementing a reasonable sheep stocking of 1.5 per hectare, respectively.

AB In different parts of the world, there is an urgent need for redesigning and innovating farming systems. Such a process may be supported by model-based explorations that enable ex-ante evaluation of a broad range of alternatives. Since a variety of viable patterns of farm development exists related to farm resource endowment and farmer's strategy, model-based explorations should be able to capture the existing variation in resource endowment and strategies in order to have impact oil strategic farm management. In this paper, we present an overview of the model-based explorative method based on the MILP model Farm Images, applied to explore options for sustainable development of vegetable farms in Canelon Grande, Uruguay. The method is used to gain insight into the impact of current farm resource endowment on the possibilities for sustainable development and on the resource use efficiency at farm scale. We maximized farm income for 128 different farm types in an environment-oriented scenario and in an incorne-oriented scenario. Farm types were defined by combining 4 farm sizes. 2 labor endowments, 4 irrigation endowments, 2 soil quality combinations and 2 mechanization levels. The results demonstrate a Strong impact of farm resource endowment on possibilities for sustainable development, as well as synergy between labor, land and irrigated area on resource-use efficiency at farm scale. Farms with 10 ha of land or less, representing 47% of the farms in the Canelon Grande region, could only achieve a family income higher than the average income of Uruguayan families when the irrigated area was ca. 40% of the farm area. The achievement of environmental targets was less costly in terms of income on farms with a low rather than high labor availability per unit area and on farms with irrigation facilities.

TI Effect of pH on the rate of myosin head detachment in molluscan catch

AB Moderate alkalisation is known to terminate the catch state of bivalve mollusc smooth muscles such as the anterior byssus retractor muscle (ABRM) of Mytilus edulis L. In the present study, we investigated the effect of moderate alkalisation (pH 7.2-7.7 vs control pH 6.7) on the myosin head detachment rate in saponin-skinned fibre bundles of ABRM in order to investigate the possible role of myosin heads in the force maintenance during catch. The detachment rate of myosin heads was deduced from two types of experiments. (1) In stretch experiments on maximally Ca2+-activated fibre bundles (pCa 4.5), the rate of force decay after stepwise stretch was assessed. (2) In ATP step experiments, the rate of force decay from high force rigor (pCa > 8) was evaluated. The ATP step was induced by photolysis of caged ATP. We found that moderate alkalisation induces relaxation of skinned fibres in catch, thereby reducing both force and stiffness, whereas it does not accelerate the rate of myosin head detachment. This acceleration, however, would be expected if catch would be simply due to myosin heads remaining sustainably attached to actin filaments. Thus, the myosin heads may be less involved in catch than generally assumed. Catch may possibly depend on a different kind of myofilament interconnections, which are abolished by moderate alkalisation.

AB Community health workers (CHWs) are effective in improving access to health care, promoting client knowledge and behavior change, and contributing to improved health status of individuals. However, few outreach programs have evaluated the financial impact of CHWs on health care systems and policies. A longitudinal repeated measures design was used to assess the return on investment (ROI) of outreach by CHWs employed by Denver Health Community Voices. Service utilization, charges and reimbursements for 590 underserved men were analyzed 9 months before and after interaction with a CHW. Primary and specialty care visits increased and urgent care, inpatient, and outpatient behavioral health care utilization decreased, resulting in a reduction of monthly uncompensated costs by $14,244. Program costs were $6,229 per month and the ROI was 2.28:1.00, a savings of $95,941 annually. These data provide evidence of economic contributions that CHWs make to a public safety net system and inform policy making regarding program sustainability.

AB Using a socio-ecological framework to guide the initiative, New Mexico Community Voices developed, with state and local stakeholders, responsive oral health policies to address oral health disparities. Several policy objectives were achieved: increasing awareness of the public health importance of oral health; improving access to dental services for uninsured or underserved populations; enhancing dental services specialty care; and increasing sustainable oral health infrastructure through pipeline development of oral health providers to relieve service shortages and diversify the oral health workforce. Improving access to oral health and augmenting numbers of dental providers in rural areas were also successful. The governor has appointed the New Mexico Oral Health Advisory Council to address state oral health issues. The New Mexico partnerships have demonstrated how effective policy change can generate important incremental shifts in oral health care delivery and provide best practice models that diminish the oral health crisis faced by underserved populations.

AB Scandals at Enron and WorldCom have thrust debates concerning corporate governance and corporate social performance (CSP) to the forefront of the minds of shareholders, managers, and public policy makers. Relying on the theory of stakeholder salience, the authors suggest that institutional owners'investment horizons, as well as the frequency and coordination of institutional owners'activism, moderate the institutional ownership -CSP relationship. Data collected in 1995 and 2000 front the Fortune 500 firms show that long-term institutional ownership is positively associated with CSP and that the frequency and coordination of activism interact with long-term institutional holdings to positively affect CSP 3 years later.

SO JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE

DE heat stress; MVTR; permeability; protective clothing
ID HEAT-STRESS
AB The fabrics associated with protective clothing affect heat stress, which influences productivity and risks of heat-related disorders. This study compared the work limiting effects of five protective coveralls and a semiclothed condition (t-shirt and shorts). Two fabric characteristics determined from bench tests, moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR), and air permeability were also examined as possible predictors of ensemble performance. A progressive metabolic rate protocol was used where environmentalconditions (T-db = 32 degrees C; T-pwb = 26 degrees C) were held constant while treadmill speed was slowly increased. The limiting metabolic rate to just maintain thermal equilibrium was the critical point. At this point, critical speed and critical metabolic rate were noted and total evaporative resistance was calculated for each ensemble. Five acclimatized subjects wore each of the six clothing conditions in a random order. Statistically significant differences were found among the five protective garments and a semiclothed ensemble for critical treadmill speed (S-crit), critical metabolic rate (M-crit), and total evaporative resistance (Re-t). The semiclothed condition (S-crit = 1.77 m/sec; M-crit = 580 W; Re-t = 0.0099 kPa m(2)/W) and ensembles made from spunbonded, melt blown, spunbonded polypropylene (SMS) (1.72 m/sec; 560 W; 0.0135 kPa m(2)/W) and spunbonded polypropylene (1.67 m/sec; 550 W; 0.0126 kPa m(2)/W) were able to support higher work rates than fabrics made from Tyvek 1422-A (a nonwoven spunbonded olefin) (1.48 m/sec; 470 W; 0.0183 kPa m(2)/W) and a microporous film supported by spunbonded polypropylene (1.34 m/sec; 420 W 0.0231 kPa m(2)/W). A tightly woven polyester ensemble (1.59 m/sec; 510 W; 0.0130 kPa m(2)/W) had intermediate values and was not significantly different from either group. Air permeability was a better predictor of fabric work limiting performance than MVTR. An air permeability on the order of 10,000 L/min cm(2) bar would have little effect on maximum sustainable work.

AB The Romanian North Western coastal and shelf zones of the Black Sea and Danube delta are a mosaic of complex, interacting ecosystems, rich natural resources and socio-economic activity. Dramatic changes in the Black Sea's ecosystem and resources are due to natural and anthropogenic causes (increase in the nutrient and pollutant load of rivers input, industrial and municipal wastewater pollution along the coast, and dumping on the open sea). A scientific management system for protection, conservation and restoration must be based on reliable information on bio-geophysical and geomorphologic processes, coastal erosion, sedimentation dynamics, mapping of macrophyte fields, water quality, climatic change effects. Synergetic use of quasi-simultaneously acquired multi-sensor data may therefore allow for a better approach of change detection of coastal area. This paper is an application of multi-temporal and multi-spectral satellite remotely sensed data (Landsat MSS, TM, ETM, SAR ERS, ASTER, MODIS) over a period of time between 1975 and 2003 for North-Western Black Sea coastal zone change detection assessment. Spectral mixture analysis, supervised and unsupervised classification are used to study chosen test areas. The results can be utilized as a temporal land-use change model for a region to quantify the extent and nature of change, and aid in future prediction studies, which helps in planning environmental agencies to develop sustainable land-use practices.

SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION

DT Article
DE municipal solid waste (MSW); macronutrients; organic components; Nigeria
AB This research was conducted within Uyo metropolis, Nigeria. Three designated dumpsites of municipal solid waste (MSW) were randomly selected for the collection of samples for analysis of the physical and macronutrient contents of their organic fraction. After the waste was sorted, its physical components were determined to be: organic materials (73.7%), plastics/polythene (12.9%), cans/metals (4.3%), bottles/glasses (4.2%), clothes/shoes (4.3%), and ceramics (0.6%). Laboratory analysis of the organic components of the waste indicated that the mean nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) contents were 11.0, 3.2, and 10.7 g kg(-1) , respectively. The mean contents of other elements were calcium (Ca) (87.7 g kg(-1)), sodium (Na) (18.4 g kg(-1)), and sulfur (S) (2.3 g kg(-1)). The mean organic-matter content of the organic components of the waste was 223.7 g kg(-1) . Both the physical and macronutrient contents of the waste differed from one location to another within the municipality. The high content of organic matter and some essential macronutrients in the waste suggest its high value for use in the production of organic and organo-mineral fertilizers for sustainable agricultural development.

AB Ecological security is an important basis of the entire human security system, the cornerstone for human survival. Knowing the status of ecological security is crucial for making decisions to avoid ecological disaster. Existing research, both the basic research on ecological security mechanism and information service systems, is still primitive in their abilities to resolve eco-security problems. This paper investigates the eco-security impact factors and identifies eco-security types. Taking urban eco-security as an example, we develop an assessment method including the indicator system and assessment model, and construct an integrated assessment framework based on data integrity, security assessment and security management with the support of the Knowledge Grid e-science environment. The proposed assessment framework enables decision makers to better know the status of eco-security in making policies for achieving sustainability. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Rechargeable Li2O2 electrode for lithium batteries
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE
AB Rechargeable lithium batteries represent one of the most important developments in energy storage for 100 years, with the potential to address the key problem of global warming. However, their ability to store energy is limited by the quantity of lithium that may be removed from and reinserted into the positive intercalation electrode, LixCoO2, 0.5 < x < 1 (corresponding to 140 mA(.)h g(-1) of charge storage). Abandoning the intercalation electrode and allowing Li to react directly with O-2 from the air at a porous electrode increases the theoretical charge storage by a remarkable 5-10 times! Here we demonstrate two essential prerequisites for the successful operation of a rechargeable Li/O-2 battery; that the Li2O2 formed on discharging such an O-2 electrode is decomposed to Li and O-2 on charging (shown here by in situ mass spectrometry), with or without a catalyst, and that charge/discharge cycling is sustainable for many cycles.

TI Physical and chemical properties of major upland soils in Shandong
   Province of China
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
AB In the present study, physical and chemical properties of major upland soils in Shandong Province, China, were examined for the purpose of sustainable and continuous use of agricultural land. The particle density ranged from 2.58 to 2.67 Mg/m(3) and the bulk density ranged from 1.30 to 1.39 Mg/m(3). The organic matter content was in a generally low level of 10.1 to 20.8 g/kg and was found to be a controlling factor of soil productivity in Shandong Province. The contents of plant-available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were strongly affected by the plant-nutrient management practice of soils. The cation exchange capacity ranged from 18.2 to 25.8 cmol(c)/kg, indicating the high potentiality of soils for fertilizer retention.

TI Soil water permeability measurement for irrigation scheduling on
   Tenggeli Desert in China
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
AB In the and and semi-arid areas where soil water holding capacity is small, research in the soil water characteristics such as the hydraulic conductivity, diffusivity and water retention is important for the proper irrigation scheduling to provide the sustainable and steady crop production. In this research, the permeability of the soil in Tenggeli desert was measured, and a numerical study of the infiltration process was conducted. The available moisture was 10.3% for the original desert sand. But it was proved that available moisture increased up to 27.5% in an irrigated field because of cultivation with the water supply from the Yellow river. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in drying process ranged from I V to 10(-6) cm/s for the sand soil and 10(-5) to 10(-8)cm/s for the top layer soil. On the other hand, that in welling process ranged from 10(-5) to 10(-7) cm/s for the sand soil and 10(-6) to 10(-7) cm/s for the top layer soil. These data will contribute to sustainable development of agriculture at the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin.

AB The structure and typology of beef cattle farms from three autochthonous Spanish breeds (Avilena-Negra Iberica, Morucha and Retinta) located in "dehesa" areas have been characterised from a survey including 130 farms. The questionnaire provided information on the structure of the farms, feeding practices, reproductive and sanitary management, production and commercialisation of the product. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis (multiple correspondences analysis and cluster analysis) were used to understand the relationships between variables and to establish farm typologies. We have found that the farms are large (an average of 125 cows and 548 ha), with an average stocking rate of 0.4 livestock unit/ha of agricultural area. Most of the farms are family managed, but with an important presence of external employees. Feeding depends largely on grazing, with seasonal supplementation. The presence of other livestock species, such horses, sheep and swine is frequent. The typology of the farms has been established on the basis of (1) farm size, (2) productivity of labour, (3) degree of specialisation, and (4) degree of extensification. Three groups of farms have been differentiated. The first group has followed a strategy of intensification of the system and includes the smallest farms. The second group is constituted by farms of intermediate size, very specialised in beef production. The third group includes large farms that have followed a strategy of extensification, complementing farm incomes by the exploitation of other livestock species. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI Will international pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals alleviate
   poverty in mountains?
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Since September 2000, when world leaders agreed on time-bound, measurable goals to reduce extreme poverty, hunger, illiteracy, and disease while fostering gender equality and ensuring environmental sustainability, the Milennium Development goals (MDGs) have increasingly come to dominate the policy objectives of many states and development agencies. The concern has been raised that the tight time frame and financial restrictions might force governments to invest in the more productive sectors, thus comprimising the quality and sustainability of development efforts. In the long term, this may lead to even greater inequality, especially between geographical regions and social strata. Hence people living marginal areas, for example in remote mountain regions and minority peoples risk being disadvantaged by this internationally agreed agenda.
   Strategies to over come hunger and poverty in their different dimensions in mountain areas need to focus on strengthening the economy of small-scale farmers, while also fostering the sustainable use of natural resources, taking into consideration their multifunctionality.

TI Pursuing the Millennium Development Goals in the Andean Altiplano -
   Building on CIP project experience with poverty alleviation and
   sustainable development
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The International Potato Center (CIP) has had an evolving research-for-development agenda that includes potatoes, sweet potatoes, Andean roots and tubers, and sustainable use of natural resources in mountains. In 2003, CIP completed a participatory Vision Exercise that led to prioritization of 7 development challenges that reflect 8 of the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In summary, these challenges include: reducing poverty and hunger; improving human health; developing sustainable rural and urban systems; and improving the availability of new technologies. A strategy was developed to help accomplish the selected MDGs. The first step towards implementation of this vision was a realignment of CIP's research program. Then, using different tools such as GIS and available national, regional, and world statistics, poverty targeting was carried out in order to prioritize the countries and regions where CIP will focus its resources and its research and development efforts. Targets were identified by overlaying poverty, hunger, and vulnerability with the areas where CIP's commodities are produced. Within this framework, the Center is implementing a new project in the Central Andes Altiplano, which is supported by the Government of Canada as well as other donors. The project is called ALTAGRO (Andean Agriculture in the Altiplano).

We assume that the way people relate to places, and particularly the sense of place they have, is a basis for their needs and aims regarding future landscape development. Conflicts among aims can be better understood if the underlying place relations are known. Therefore, we inductively examined differences between locals' and tourists' sense of place by means of a qualitative interview study in Alvaneu, a Swiss Alpine village. In social science theory, "sense of place" is used as an umbrella concept for manifold people-place relations. The findings reveal that the place characteristics relevant to sense of place are approximately the same for both groups. However, locals and tourists attribute different meanings and significance to these characteristics, and thus have distinct needs regarding landscape development. Consequently, a balance between appropriate economic development desired by locals and the preservation of the cultural characteristics and authenticity sought by tourists must be found when pursuing sustainable landscape development.

DT Article
DE access; energy; poverty; public policy; alternative strategy
AB Poor and inadequate access to clean, reliable and affordable energy is now considered a major concern for sustainable development. India houses about a third of the world's population without access to electricity and about 40% of those without access to modern energy. This article considers India's challenge in this area, examines the energy access situation, and analyses measures pursued to improve it. The article argues that the current focus on rural electrification is unlikely to resolve the energy access problem, due to the low penetration of electricity in the energy mix of the poor. The article also argues that strategies based on energy market reform, promotion of renewable technologies and correct price signals are unlikely to succeed in changing the situation, as acceptance of this policy prescription is rather low. Instead, a bottom-up, holistic, long-term approach is suggested that integrates energy access with economic development, and relies on selective market intervention, local resources and local governance.

DE China coal industry; sustainability
AB China is the largest coal producer and the largest coal consuming country in the world. Approximately half of China's coal comes from small-scale mines. The sustainability of China's coal industry would be improved if a greater share of the coal come from larger-scale mines. This article presents a case history of the Shuangliu Mine in Shanxi Province and discusses the issues and benefits of the transformation of this mine. Significant gains were observed in worker safety and benefits, and in more efficient exploitation of the coal resource. Problems included loss of employment opportunities for local labourers, and reduced revenue for local townships. The wider implications of a shift of China's coal supply from small-scale to large-scale mining operations are discussed in relation to economic, social and environmental aspects.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; CHALLENGE
AB Environmental or 'ecological' footprints have been widely used in recent years as indicators of resource consumption and waste absorption on the basis of biologically productive land area required per capita with prevailing technology. Such footprints represent a partial measure of the extent to which the planet, its regions, or nations are moving along a sustainable development pathway. They vary between countries at different stages of economic development and varying geographic characteristics. The determinants of environmental footprints in some 113 countries from around the world have been evaluated. Dimensional analysis techniques from engineering and the physical sciences are employed to determine the relative significance of population density, economic wealth, and intensity of pollutant emission. Variations about the resulting 'power-law' correlation suggest the extent to which individual nations are currently frugal or profligate in terms of their resource use and environmental impacts. The scatter associated with footprints, or closely related parameters, also indicates the uncertainty inherent within the international datasets needed to compute them, as well as differences in local climate and terrain. Nevertheless, national footprints alert humanity to the necessity of living within the regenerative capacity of the biosphere in order to ensure 'environmental sustainability'.

AB Environmental flows are of crucial importance for questions of sustainability. But analysing only the material side of environmental flows brings us halfway understanding questions of sustainability. This article reports on the development of a more integrative approach in studying environmental impacts of agro-industrial systems in Asia, taking tapioca (cassava starch) processing in Vietnam as an example. The analysis of material flows and technological options to close material cycles is combined with an actor-network analysis from three angles: a policy, an economic and a social perspective, respectively. The paper finally assesses the additional value of the developed methodology and points out ways for further investigation and development of a more integrative approach to industrial transformations.

AB Rural households in less-favoured areas (LFAs) face multiple constraints for overcoming chronic poverty and resource degradation. Strategic development options can be assessed through interdisciplinary research based on coupling of human and natural systems approaches. Simulation modelling enables the identification of more precise research questions and the definition of appropriate fieldwork methods. We present an overview of the stylized micro-macro modelling framework used for the exploration of production and resource management options and livelihood strategies at household and village level. The simulation outcomes are subsequently used for the identification of feasible pathways for agricultural and rural development in LFAs and for critical incentives that enable households to invest in profitable and sustainable resource management. The interaction between model simulations and topical field research generates useful insights for the design of comprehensive research programmes regarding strategies for sustainable development in LFAs. Stylized models of coupled human-natural systems based on the behaviour of representative stakeholders provide a practical and flexible framework for exploring critical research issues.

TI Recycle of transuranium elements in light water reactors for reduction

DE transuranium element recycle; sustainable LWR cycle; thorium fuels
AB This paper presents results of a feasibility study aimed at developing a zero-transuranic-discharge fuel cycle based on the U-Th-TRU ternary cycle. The design objective is to find a fuel composition (mixture of thorium, enriched uranium, and recycled transuranic components) and fuel management strategy resulting in an equilibrium charge-discharge mass flow In such a fuel cycle scheme, the quantity and isotopic vector of the transuranium (TRU) component is identical at the charge and discharge time points, thus allowing the whole amount of the TRU at the end of the fuel irradiation period to be separated and reloaded into the following cycle. The TRU reprocessing activity losses are the only waste stream that will require permanent geological storage, virtually eliminating the long-term radiological waste of the commercial nuclear fuel cycle. A detailed three-dimensional full pressurized water reactor (PWR) core model was used to analyze the proposed fuel composition and management strategy. The results demonstrate the neutronic feasibility of the fuel cycle with zero-TRU discharge. The amount of TRU and enriched uranium loaded reach equilibrium after about four TRU recycles. The reactivity coefficients were found to be within a range typical for a reference PWR core. The soluble boron worth is reduced by a factor of similar to 2 from a typical PWR value. Nevertheless, the results indicate the feasibility of an 18-month fuel cycle design with an acceptable beginning-of-cycle soluble boron concentration even without application of burnable poisons.

DE unstructured peer-to-peer networks; distributed randomized algorithms;
   distributed cycle sharing; load balancing
AB Motivated by the needs and success of projects such as SETI@home and genome@home, we propose an architecture for a sustainable large-scale peer-to-peer environment for distributed cycle sharing among Internet hosts. Such networks are characterized by highly dynamic state due to high arrival and departure rates. This makes it difficult to build and maintain structured networks and to use state-based resource allocation techniques. We build our system to work in an environment similar to Current file-sharing networks such as Gnutella and Freenet. In doing so, we are able to leverage vast network resources while providing resilience to random failures, low network overhead, and an open architecture for resource brokering. This paper describes the underlying analytical and algorithmic substrates based on randomization for job distribution, replication, monitoring, aggregation and oblivious resource sharing and communication between participating hosts. We support our claims of robustness and scalability analytically with high probabilistic guarantees. Our algorithms do not introduce any state dependencies, and hence Lire resilient to dynamic node arrivals, departures, and failures. We Support all analytical claims with a detailed simulation-based evaluation of our distributed framework. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Geometric origin of dynamically induced freezing of quantum evolution
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW A
LA English
DT Article
ID PHASE; SYSTEMS; VECTOR; OPTICS
AB The phenomenon of dynamical, field-induced freezing of quantum evolution is discussed. It occurs when a time-dependent state is dynamically driven in such a way that the evolution of the corresponding wave function is effectively localized within a small region in the projective Hilbert space. As a consequence, the dynamics of the system is frozen and the expectation values of all physical observables hardly change with time. Necessary and sufficient conditions for inducing dynamical freezing are inferred from a general analysis of the geometry of quantum evolution. The relevance of the dynamical freezing for a sustainable in time, dynamical control is discussed and exemplified by a study of the coherent control of the kicked rotor motion.

AB During a survey of nitrogen-fixing Burkholderia associated with sugarcane in Tamil Nadu, some endophytes were isolated on PCAT medium. Isolation was based on the use of the selective PCAT medium. Four isolates were studied, all belonging to the genus Burkholderia. One of them, MG43 was consistently more active in reducing acetylene and was identified as Burkholderia vietnamiensis. This isolate was used to inoculate micro-propagated sugarcane plantlets in a comparison with two other diazoptrophs, viz. Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus(T) and Herbaspirillum seropedicae(T). Inoculated plants and uninoculated controls were used in a pot experiment followed by two field experiments under different rates of nitrogen fertilisers. MG43 and G. diazotrophicus performed best in sugarcane, their natural host. Biomass increase due to MG43 inoculation reached 20% in the field. Inoculated plants were heavily colonised by the inoculated bacterium (up to 115,000 CFU g(-1) root fresh weight). Inoculation by a combinaison of the three strains performed less well than inoculation by a single MG43 suspension. Ecological implications are discussed, as well as the potential of these bacteria to provide a feasible alternative to higher N fertilisers rates in a low input and long term sustainable rural economy.

AB Information from field studies investigating the responses of roots to increasing atmospheric CO2 is limited and somewhat inconsistent, due partly to the difficulty in studying root systems in situ. In this report, we present standing root biomass of species and root length and diameter after five years of CO2 enrichment (similar to 720 mu mol mol(-1)) in large (16 m(2) ground area) open-top chambers placed over a native shortgrass steppe in Colorado, USA. Total root biomass in 100 cm longx20 cm widex75 cm depth soil monoliths and root biomass of the three dominant grass species of the site were not significantly affected by elevated CO2. Root biomass of Stipa comata in the 0-20 cm soil depth was nearly 100% greater in elevated vs. ambient CO2 chambers, but this was not statistically significant (P=0.14). However, there was a significant 37% increase in fine root length under elevated CO2 in the 0-10 cm soil depth layer. Other reports from this study suggest that the increase in fine roots is primarily from improved seedling recruitment of S. comata under elevated CO2. Few treatment differences in root length or diameter were detected in lower 10 cm depth increments, to 80 cm. These results reflect the root status integrated over two wet, two dry and one normal precipitation years and approximately one complete cycle of root turn-over on the shortgrass steppe. We conclude that increasing atmospheric CO2 will have only small effects on standing root biomass and root length and diameter of most shortgrasss steppe species. However, the potential increased competitive ability of Stipa comata, a low forage quality species, could alter the ecosystem from the current dominant, high forage quality species, Bouteloua gracilis. B. gracilis is very well adapted to the frequent droughts of the shortgrass steppe. Increased competitive ability of less desirable plant species under increasing atmospheric CO2 will have large implications for long-term sustainability of grassland ecosystems.

AB The paper examines the reasons for and consequences of lost domestic animal biodiversity. The origin of domestic poultry and livestock diversity is reviewed from the first center of domestication in the Middle East during the Neolithic Revolution. Accompanied by domestic animals and birds, mankind spread worldwide over the last 12,000 yr, thereby increasing domestic animal biodiversity via adaptation to many environmental challenges, resulting in about 6,000 breeds within only a small number of species used for food. During the last 50 yr of the 20th century, about 20% of these livestock and poultry breeds have become extinct, and the remainder is at risk. This erosion of unique biodiversity is due to changes in farm practices developed in the West that involve mono-breed, intensive farming systems that are unsustainable. The close symbiotic relationship of Homo sapiens and domestic animals and birds over millennia is changing, resulting in a lost understanding of sustainability among urban communities. The single-minded focus on profit is resulting in the loss of the historic European and Western culture based on Judeo-Christian values. Respect for biological boundaries, community, and quality of life are disappearing in Western society. Concurrently, farming is now only a business. The principal decision makers are no longer farmers but business executives, who are remote from the farm. The emphasis on cheap food is the principal driver that leads to increased competition and unsustainable practices. Farmers as well as their breeds are disappearing. The advent of gene technology and transgenic livestock is reviewed with the prospect of extensive manipulation of animal form and function and abuse of genotypes as animals are redesigned, suffer, and lose all dignity. By handling its animals in this manner, high Western civilization is losing its culture and values and becoming simply the top animal species by using its power selfishly. The case is presented that the extinction of animals indicates an urgent need to conserve historic Western culture before it, too, is lost.

AB The effects of key nutrients iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), and their combinations were investigated on the total methanogenic activity (TMA) and total sulfidogenic activity (TSA) of biomass metabolizing synthetic sulfate laden organics (COD/SO42- ratio 3.5) in batch assays. In Phase I of the study, TMA and TSA were assessed twice for four feed changes in Cycle-I and Cycle-II. Nutrient combinations Fe-Co, Fe-Ni-Zn, Ni-Zn-Co and Zn have shown maximum TMA and/or TSA. Antagonistic effects of Ni on Co uptake by methane producing bacteria (MPB) and Zn uptake by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) were observed. In Phase II study, sustainability of effects of nutrients for best combinations was assessed in long duration study involving 10 feed changes. Assays with Fe and Co supplementation have shown maximum stimulation of MPB and SRB. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We have developed expedient and reliable methods to isolate cyclosporin synthetase for in vitro biosynthesis of cyclosporins. We have examined enzyme purification strategies suited to large-scale processing and present a chromatographic sequence that serves as a pilot model for industrial scale preparation of cyclosporin synthetase from cyclosporin producing fungi. A chromatographic sequence consisting of ammonium sulfate precipitation -> gel filtration -> hydrophobic interaction chromatography -> anion exchange chromatography, yielded an electrophoretically homogeneous cyclosporin synthetase preparation (Coomassie G-250 brilliant blue staining). Furthermore, a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system was developed for the isolation of active cyclosporin synthetase enzyme from crude extracts of cyclosporin producing fungi. The environmental factors affecting enzyme stability and the continuity of the in vitro cyclosporin biosynthetic reaction-temperature, pH, and substrate depletion were assessed and manageable conditions have been defined for sustainable cyclosporin biosynthesis with enzyme isolates. Cyclosporin synthetase exhibited an optimal temperature range of 24-29 degrees C and a pH optimum of 7.6. The native enzyme displayed a pI of 5.7, as determined by isoelectric focusing. The industrial implementation of an in vitro biosynthetic approach could potentially prove useful for the production of important therapeutic cyclosporins which occur as only minor fermentation by-products.

TI Putting livelihoods thinking into practice: Implications for development

SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE participation; sustainable livelihoods approaches; process approaches;
   development management; aid
AB The failure of 'blueprint' development interventions to deliver substantive improvements in poverty reduction has been well recognised over the last twenty years. Process approaches seek to overcome the rigidity and top-down operation of much aid-funded intervention. Sustainable livelihoods approaches (SLA) are one of the latest additions to this family of approaches. As a theoretical framework and as a set of principles for guiding intervention, sustainable livelihoods thinking has implications for development management. Drawing on research exploring the application of sustainable livelihoods principles in 10 development interventions. this article considers how these principles have evolved from continuing debates surrounding process and people-centred (bottom-up) approaches to development management. This research suggests that whilst these principles can improve the impact made by interventions, the effective application of sustainable livelihoods and other process approaches are fundamentally restricted by unbalanced power relationships between development partners.

AB Objectives: To investigate the impact of local living circumstances on the level of childhood burn injuries.
   Study design/method: This study was an ecological investigation encompassing the 634 residential areas of the city of Cape Town (about 668,900 children aged 12 years and younger). Fifteen socio-physical features of these areas that describe the population, household, dwelling types and services were considered using data from the 2001 census. Data of childhood burn injuries were gathered from the Red Cross Children's Hospital's register over 1999-2000 (n=923). Area features were synthesized into three main dimensions using factor analysis (principal axis method). Each dimension was split into three (exposure) levels, and the effect of each dimension on childhood burn injury was measured, compiling odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and using the most favourable exposure level as the reference category within each dimension.
   Results: The main dimensions of contextual exposure were defined as housing conditions (five variables), child dependency (three variables) and socio-economic barriers (three variables). Each aspect had a significant impact on the risk of burn injury, with increased Levels of exposure leading to increased risk of burns. For housing conditions (Factor 1) and socio-economic barriers (Factor 3), a graded relationship was observed with noteably increased odds for increased levels of exposure.
   Conclusions: The occurrence of child burn injury is highly influenced by various features of the local environment. These features may be essential targets for sustainable childhood burn injury control and prevention programmes. (c) 2005 The Royal Institute of Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: The aim of the present paper is to describe the development of the National Plan of Action for Food and Nutrition (NPAFN) for Turkey.
   Design: Access to a safe and healthy variety of food, a fundamental human right, was stressed by the International Conference on Nutrition and by the World Food Summit. In the International Conference on Nutrition in December 1992, one major commitment was the preparation of NPAFN. The NPAFN for Turkey was designed according to this commitment.
   Setting: Turkey.
   Results: To this end, under the coordination of the State Planning Organization, a Working Committee Report for National Food and Nutrition Strategy of Turkey was prepared and published, with the participation of different sectors. The goal of the prepared National Food and Nutrition Strategy for Turkey is to protect and promote health through and healthy nutrition and reduce the burden of diseases, while contributing to socio-economic development and a sustainable food security.
   Conclusion: In Turkey the NPAFN was developed and implementation has initiated. Nearly for all the actions, related projects are being developed.

TI Methodology for delineating groundwater protection areas against

DE groundwater contamination; pesticides; protection; remediation; water

AB This study proposes a general methodology, applied in Switzerland, for the delineation of protection areas for abstracted groundwater against persistent chemical contaminants in order to establish: (1) remediation programmes in the event of contamination and (2) prevention programmes, in a general way.
   This new approach is based on the complete groundwater flow cycle, from the surface of the catchment zone to the groundwater source itself; areas with the highest contribution rate to the groundwater source will be preferentially protected. The method under consideration thus provides a tool for sustainable development and land management.
   To date, four actual cases have been treated in order to test the method's applicability. The results are convincing in various porous or fractured aquifers. One case is presented to illustrate an application of the methodology.

AB There have been many programs aimed at providing low cost titanium since the advent of the titanium industry in the 1950's. Whilst there have been few headline successes, the industry has been successful in implementing cost reduction technologies and continuous improvements that have enabled the growth of titanium usage in existing applications and expansion into new market sectors. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of TIMET's approach to developing sustainable growth in titanium usage and providing effective and affordable solutions to a range of industries. The overall approach will be illustrated with examples of developments in process and alloy technology and through applications in sectors ranging from aerospace to automotive.

AB Use of chemical substances and genetically modified organisms cause complex problems characterised by scientific uncertainty and controversies. Aiming at sustainable development, policies for assessment, and management of risks in the two areas are under development in the European Union. The article points out that both science and norms play a central role in risk assessment as well as risk management and Suggests that the precautionary principle, the principle of public participation, and the polluter pays principle, all adopted in the European Union, offer a way to operationalise the concept of sustainable development. It is shown, however, that a number of steps ought to be taken to better implement the principles through different policy measures. In doing so, and by recognising the role of both science and norms, the decision-making on risks related to the use of chemicals or genetically modified organisms can be improved to better promote Sustainable development.

DE resource productivity; energy efficiency; regional computable general
   equilibrium; environmental indicators
AB Sustainable development is a key objective of UK national and regional policies. Improvements in resource productivity have been suggested as both a measure of progress towards sustainable development and as a means of achieving sustainability. Making 'more with less' intuitively seems to be good for the environment, and this is the presumption of current UK policy. However, in a system-wide context, improvements in energy efficiency lower the cost of energy in efficiency units and may even stimulate the consumption and production of energy measured in physical units, and increase pollution. Simulations of a computable general equilibrium model of Scotland suggest that an across the board stimulus to energy efficiency there would actually stimulate energy production and consumption and lead to a deterioration in environmental indicators. The implication is that policies directed at stimulating energy efficiency are not, in themselves, sufficient to secure environmental improvements: this may require the use of complementary energy policies designed to moderate incentives to increased energy consumption.
