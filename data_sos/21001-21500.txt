DE sustainability; mobile pastoralism; access to pasture; carrying
   capacity; remote sensing; western Himalayas; Kashmir
AB Using ground truth and remote sensing data this paper tries to demonstrate once again that commons as well as privately owned pastures ale managed by their appropriators in such a manner that sustainability as a goal can be approached, while areas not recognized as controlled by one or more legitimate persons and hence open to all may well be overexploited. The analysis of pastures which are recognized as commons in the western Liddar valley in Kashmir (India) shows that these lands are not overexploited by the nomadic and transhumant pastoralists using them. On the whole, individually owned pastures were also not found to be overstocked. Those plots, however, through which all herders transit on their bi-annual migration and which are not recognized as being owned by any authority are highly degraded.

AB Although managers cite human resources as a firm's most important asset, many organizational decisions do not reflect this belief. This article uses the value, rareness, imitability, and organization (VRIO) framework to examine the role that the human resource (HR) function plays in developing a sustainable competitive advantage. Why some popularly cited sources of sustainable competitive advantage are not, and what aspects of a firm's human resources can provide a source of sustainable competitive advantage are discussed. The role of the HR executive as a strategic partner in developing and maintaining competitive advantage within the firm is also examined. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI A sustainable framework for joint implementation
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIMATE-CHANGE
AB The Kyoto Protocol has recently opened new opportunities for joint implementation (JI) activities between parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Before JI markets can develop, however stakeholder acceptability of the instrument must be enhanced. Remaining barriers to acceptability include the lack of an agreed approach to assess additionality-the emission reductions achieved by a JI project relative to a baseline-and the lack: of an operational framework to ensure that sustainable development and international equity objectives are met by JI activity. Difficulties besetting current approaches to assessing additionality are rooted in the uncertainties characterizing assumed baselines. This paper outlines an observable baseline framework for JI projects in the energy sector, which could remove these uncertainties. In contrast to current approaches to define baselines, observable baselines are calculated from om a country's existing energy and emissions data, and not from the particularities of a hypothetical baseline project. The framework provides for unique baseline definitions, permitting unambiguous assessments of additionality. Furthermore, observable baselines dynamically adjust over time to ensure that many sustainability development objectives are met by JI activity. I will demonstrate a number of sustainability benefits that naturally result from application of the framework, and explore additional conditions that can be added to the framework to promote international equity objectives.

AB Sustaining gains that result from international aid projects is a matter of contemporary concern. This paper outlines a model for sustainable professional development, drawn from the authors' experiences in managing a six-year professional development project for teachers' college lecturers in Papua New Guinea. The model involves five stages which have implications for individuals, their institutional contexts, and the interactions between them. Research designed to authenticate the model is reported. The data support the general features of the model and suggest that, with some elaboration, the model has potential application in the design, implementation and evaluation of similar projects in many fields.

TI Sustainable land development model for rapid growth areas using GIS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB There has been worldwide concern for sustainable development especially after the 1992's Rio's UN Conference on Environment and Development. Rapid encroachment of urban development on valuable agricultural land will have great influence on whether sustainable development can be achieved. A sustainable land development model is developed using GIS in an attempt to control urban sprawl under rapid rural urbanization. The objective of the model is to ensure that equity between generations and efficiency in land use can be achieved in land development so that development can be sustained in the future. The model is used to study the impacts of agricultural land loss in Dongguan in 1988-93, a rapidly growing area in the Pearl River Delta of China. The impact of unplanned urban growth is evaluated by comparing the actual development with optimal development derived from the sustainable land development model. Land use problems are identified in both spatial and time dimensions as some land conversions are found to occur at the 'wrong' time and locations. Future land development which can meet the objective of sustainable development is proposed using the model. By testing different development scenarios and land consumption parameters, planners and government officials can use the model as a decision support system for sustainable land development in areas in the world that are under great pressure of rapid urban growth.

ID MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION; ENTRY
AB This paper proposes a dynamic approach to potential competition in a spatial framework where productive investments are location-specific and have finite duration. We define a notion of strategic sustainability against multiple entries, in which spatial preemption comes from anticipated renewal policies of plants. We show that, in an infinite horizon model with no discounting, potential competition leads to average-cost renewal but a positive value can be attached to incumbency. The conditions for the existence of such strategically sustainable structures are determined in the model of the circular city, under mill or discriminatory pricing rules. Our results are finally related to the usual two-stage notion of free entry equilibrium in spatial models. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Sustainability and coastal zone management in Hong Kong - the case of
   Mirs Bay
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE coastal pollution; Hong Kong; Mirs Bay; marine park; environmental
   protection
AB Hong Kong's coastal zone is under considerable stress as a result of continuing population growth, large-scale infrastructure developments, extensive land reclamation projects, the ineffective control of various types of pollution, and a growing problem of cross-border pollution associated with rapid development in neighbouring parts of Mainland China. Policy-related and institutional weaknesses have resulted in a failure to tackle environmental problems in a comprehensive and integrated manner, little attention has been given to sustainability issues, and Hong Kong lacks a clear framework for coastal zone planning and management.
   Mirs Bay, on the eastern margins of Hong Kong, remains one of the few relatively unpolluted parts of the territory's marine environment. It contains a rich and diverse marine flora and fauna, and is the location of two of Hong Kong's designated marine parks. However, even this area of high ecological value may now be under threat from future development, and increased levels of pollution from both Hong Kong and Mainland sources. The paper examines environmental conditions in Mirs Bay, reviews existing evidence regarding pollution levels and changes in marine biodiversity, evaluates threats to the Bay's environment, and discusses whether, in the context of Hong Kong's existing approaches to environmental protection, it is possible to protect this area of high quality marine environment from irreversible degradation.

AB Natural capital should be preserved because it exhibits features that distinguish it from all other kinds of capital. The notorious prevalence of risk, uncertainty and ignorance makes it difficult, however, to state which parts of it should be presented. Some forms of natural capital are more likely to be substitutable than others. Another difficult question is how, to what extent and for how large costs certain kinds of natural capital should be preserved. Both the 'precautionary principle' and the concept of 'safe minimum standards' are rather elusive, especially on the question of costs. Policy measures are discussed that allegedly preserve natural capital at low, or even negative, costs. It is argued, however, that while there is some scope for policies that are good for the environment and for economic development at the same time, the relationship between the environment and the economy is likely to remain one of a fundamental trade-off. Resolving this trade-off is beyond scientific reach and should be left to democratic decision making. What science can do, is to help basing democratic decisions on rational grounds.

DE sustainable development; transhumant; Himalaya; resource use
AB The intricate and complex relationships between transhumant pastoralists, livestock and environment at the high altitudes of Indian Central Himalaya has started to break down at an alarming rate. Some of the important factors attributed to this are depletion of grazing resources, commercialization of the rural economy, and integration of these communities with the mainstream of development through education and employment. Traditionally these livestock were assigned different roles in society depending upon their economic benefit and utility. The roles which once depended upon attitude to various risks, such as environmental, social and economic, have lost their significance due to changing of the production process. This paper gives an overview of the various types of roles the livestock played in the transhumant society, and how they are being replaced by the developmental process in the region, and whether the changes are sustainable for such remote regions in a developing country.

DT Article
DE women; sustainable development; fishery resources; time use; poverty
AB This paper presents a case study of time use and contribution to the household income of men, women, and children in 12 households in a fishing village in Panay Island, central Philippines. The study highlights the differential impact of poverty on men and women and provides a glimpse of the intrahousehold dynamics within poor fishing households. Findings in previous studies in both industrialized and developing countries that women work longer hours than men were corroborated. Women contribute at least 22% to the household cash income and 40% of the value of unpaid labour. Their contribution to the household cash income becomes larger than that of men's when the value of livestock is computed. Women's daily participation in productive activities, such as fish vending and shucking oyster and mussel, unwittingly puts them in a position of being environmental recorders and verifiers of the state of fishery resources. Because they are burdened with the responsibility of making ends meet, they are also confronted with the challenge of realizing the dream of sending their children to university to enable them to escape poverty. This alone makes women one of the strongest stakeholders in the sustainable development of fishery resources.

AB The number of Sustainable Development Indicator (SDI) programmes has proliferated since the 1992 United Nations Rio Earth Summit, with indicators selected according to the particular purpose of evaluation. However, there has not yet been a comprehensive and simple SDI set that can be readily and quickly applied to land-use operations by the operators themselves to determine the extent of their progress towards sustainable development. Such a method is proposed in the following paper, based on the general principles of sustainable development endorsed at the Rio Summit and recommendations from the literature. Preliminary testing has been undertaken on several case studies and further refinement of the method is ongoing.

ID CHILDREN
AB Prader-Willi syndrome is a genetic illness associated with a defect on chromosome 15. It presents with hypotonicity in infancy followed by voracious appetite and gross obesity from early childhood and with a range of other clinical and behavioural sequelae. This case report is of an adolescent boy who was admitted to a psychiatric unit for an intensive behavioural programme to control his weight gain and deal with associated behavioural problems, and demonstrates that an inpatient programme can lead to sustainable improvements in weight control and other indicators of well-being in PWS patients.

   ROTATION
AB The occurrence of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) root colonization and spore number in soil was assessed for 18 fields under intensive lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) production in California during July and August of 1995. Data on management practices and soil characteristics were compiled for each field, and included a wide range of conditions. The relationship between these factors and the occurrence of VAM in these fields was explored with multivariate statistical analysis. VAM colonization of lettuce tended to decrease with the use of chemical inputs, such as pesticides and high amounts of P and N fertilizers. Addition of soil organic matter amendments, the occurrence of other host crops in the rotation, and soil carbon:phosphorus and carbon:nitrogen ratios, were positively associated with VAM colonization of lettuce roots. The number of VAM spores in soil was strongly correlated with the number of other host crops in the rotation, the occurrence of weed hosts and sampling date, but was more affected by general soil conditions than by management inputs. Higher total soil N, C and P, as well as CEC, were inversely related to soil spore number. A glasshouse study of the two primary lettuce types sampled in the field showed no significant differences in the extent of root colonization under similar growing conditions. The results of this study are compared with other studies on the effects of management and soil conditions on mycorrhizal occurrence in agriculture.

TI Seasonal Inlet Closure: Governing Processes
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Tidal inlets; coastal sediments; control processes; wave climate;
   siltation; tidal channels
AB Seasonal closure of tidal inlets is a common occurrence in microtidal, wave-dominated environments where strong seasonality of streamflow is experienced, causing navigational difficulties and water quality problems. Hence, there is increased interest in keeping these inlets perennially open. However, a sustainable engineering solution will only result from a clear understanding of the processes governing seasonal inlet closure. Previous studies have shown that inlet closure could be caused by two mechanisms: One governed by longshore processes and the other by cross-shore processes. This study aims to gain insight into the processes governing seasonal inlet closure via field and modelling studies undertaken at Wilson Inlet, Australia, which is a typical seasonally open inlet.
   A field campaign was undertaken during the summer of 1995 to investigate the hydrodynamic and morphological variability the inlet experiences when progressing from 'open' to 'closed' state. Field measurements included inlet current measurements, offshore wave climate measurements, nearshore current measurements, and periodic bed level measurements. For the numerical modelling component of the study, a quasi-3D morphodynamic model developed specifically to study the seasonal closure of inlets, was applied to Wilson Inlet under various forcing conditions.
   While the field data imply that onshore sediment transport might be responsible for inlet closure, the model results conclusively prove this hypothesis. The effect of summer streamflow and storm events on inlet closure is also examined. Results indicate that, depending on the intensity and timing of the events, summer streamflow/storm events generally extend the 'open-period' of the inlet. However, a storm event when the inlet is nearly closed is shown to result in rapid closure of the inlet.

TI Profitability of moderate intensive grazing of dairy cows in the

SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article

ID PASTURE PROGRAM; FERTILITY; NITROGEN
AB Empirical analyses of the profitability of moderate grazing are presented based on sample dairy farms in Pennsylvania and New York. Net income per cow was higher for dairy farms that employed moderate intensive grazing than for dairy farms that employed extensive grazing. Income appeared to be adequate for family living expenses, but moderate intensive grazing could not be considered a high profit system. Detailed analyses of dairy farms that employed moderate and extensive grazing in northern Pennsylvania indicated that returns to management and owner equity were higher for pasture enterprises than for corn silage or hay enterprises. Positive dairy profits were related to lower feed costs. Milk production was lower on farms that employed moderate grazing than on farms that employed extensive grazing. Legit regression analysis characterized farms that employed moderate intensive grazing as oriented toward dairy rather than toward crop production; these farms had lower culling rates and a greater dependence on milk sales as a share of total sales. The reduced use of fertilizers and chemicals suggests that moderate grazing had environmentally sustainable features.

AB We model exploration for and production from a multiple-deposit, nonrenewable resource. Exploration is viewed as a Bayesian process involving learning about undiscovered reserves, and is undertaken both to improve the quality of and to replenish known reserves. Known reserves are not physically defined, but depend on the realizations of discrete episodes of exploration elsewhere and on decisions at each instant about the margin bem een ore to be mined and low-grade material to be rejected. The appropriate measure of resource scarcity, the sustainable level of the contribution of the resource, and the treatment of depletion in the ational accounts are considered.

AB Sustainability has emerged as an important new qualification for environmental infrastructure projects, particularly on the fast-growing and environmentally undeserved U.S.-Mexico border. The Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) and the North American Development Bank (NADBank), respectively charged with approving and financing environment projects on the border, have determined six principle areas in which sustainability plays a role: natural resource management, technical efficiency, natural resource preservation, environmental protection, benefits to low-income residents, and community participation. The Naco Constructed-Wetlands/Microenterprise Proposal (NACWEMP), which would build a demonstration-scale constructed wetland for wastewater treatment and train community members in three associated microenterprise projects, creatively demonstrates how principles of sustainable development are expressed in actual project implementation.

AB Phosphorus (P) export from agriculture is a major cause of eutrophication in many lake ecosystems. Human activity, hydrology, and physicochemical and biological processes that store, transform, and transport P, define P export patterns over time and space. We suggest that an ecosystem paradigm is useful to holistically view P dynamics within complex watersheds. An ecosystem model of a dairy agricultural system was created within a hierarchical compartment-flux structure of a conceptual watershed ecosystem. Mass balance calculations with our Agriculture Ecosystem model (AEP model) describe P dynamics for the farm system, which are driven by the amount of P stored in agricultural soils and system management practices. Longterm P dynamics respond predominately to human interventions in watersheds and define conditions for future generations, Model simulations suggest that long-term environmental protection programs should incorporate the notions of P sustainability into management decisions. Dynamic simulation modeling is a valuable paradigm for understanding how complex watersheds process P and for developing management perspectives and public policy to achieve goals of environmental quality as well as economic and resource sustainability.

Good forest management is an essential part of the sustainable development process.

TI Development or dependency? Sustaining Alabama's forest communities
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY

DT Article
AB Comparison of two forest-dependent communities: tips in Alabama illustrates how prospects for sustainable development are shaped by history, social structure, prevailing pattern of resource ownership, and forest industrial sector structure. Opportunities appear stronger if a community's forest products industry is diversified and entrepreneurial spirit is strong. Conversely, simply recruiting forest industry will not lead to sustainable development and might, in the absence of round policy, actually impede it. Truly sustainable development requires expanding people's opportunities and protecting and enhancing the natural resource base on which those opportunities are built.

AB A two-year field study was conducted in eastern Ontario to evaluate the effects of water table management on the quality of subsurface drain flows. Drainage discharge volumes and NO3--N concentrations in drainage effluent were monitored during the growing seasons. The 3.5 ha experimental field was strip-cropped with corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max Merr.). Controlled-drainage subirrigation was used to manage water from precipitation and subirrigation. Time two controlled water table treatments were 50 cm and 75 cm from the surface. There was also a conventional free-drainage treatment (FD). In 1995, mean NO3--N concentrations in drainage water were reduced by 84% and 75% by the 50 and 75 cm controlled water table depths, respectively. In 1996, drain flow volumes and NO3--N concentrations were significantly reduced relative to free drainage. Total drain flow was reduced by 42% by the 50 cm controlled water table, while NO3--N concentrations were reduced by 61% and 52% by the 50 cm and 75 cm controlled water tables, respectively. Consequently, NO3--N loadings were also reduced by 94%, and 30% by the 50 cm and 75 cm controlled water tables, respectively. Improvements in drainage water quality were attributed to both reduced drainage outflow and enhanced denitrification in the controlled water table plots, In addition to significantly reducing NO3--N pollution, economic benefits were achieved through fertilizer equivalent savings, and enhanced crop yields were achieved through subirrigation. Therefore, the practice of water table management in the region was demonstrated to be both environmentally and economically sustainable.

AB We examine the implications of replacing the Cournot market clearing assumption with Bertrand-Edgeworth behavior when production is time-consuming. The benchmark is Saloner's result that when two firms simultaneously choose quantities in each of two periods before the market clears, every point on the outer envelope of the reaction functions between the Stackelberg outcomes is sustainable in equilibrium (Saloner, 1987). We demonstrate that in a symmetric Bertrand-Edgeworth duopoly, for small capacity costs, except for the leader-follower points, none of the points on the outer envelope of the best responses lying in the mixed strategy region are sustainable in equilibrium.

AB Many pinon-juniper ecosystems in the western U.S. are subject to accelerated erosion while others are undergoing little or no erosion. Controversy has developed over whether invading or encroaching pinon and juniper species are inherently harmful to rangeland ecosystems. We developed a conceptual model of soil erosion in pinon-juniper ecosystems that is consistent with both sides of the controversy and suggests that the diverse perspectives on this issue arise from threshold effects operating under very different site conditions. Soil erosion rate can be viewed as a function of (1) site erosion potential (SEP), determined by climate, geomorphology and soil erodibility; and (2) ground cover. Site erosion potential and cover act synergistically to determine soil erosion rates, as evident even from simple USLE predictions of erosion. In pinion-juniper ecosystems with high SEP, the erosion rate is highly sensitive to ground cover and can cross a threshold so that erosion increases dramatically in response to a small decrease in cover. The sensitivity of erosion rate to SEP and cover can be visualized as a cusp catastrophe surface on which changes may occur rapidly and irreversibly. The mechanisms associated with a rapid shift from low to high erosion rate can be illustrated using percolation theory to incorporate spatial, temporal, and scale-dependent patterns of water storage capacity on a hillslope. Percolation theory demonstrates how hillslope runoff can undergo a threshold response to a minor change in storage capacity. Our conceptual model suggests that pinon and juniper contribute to accelerated erosion only under a limited range of site conditions which, however, may exist over large areas.

AB I reviewed the distribution, abundance, habitat selection, and population trends of 69 diurnal raptors found in 13 subregions from India to Indochina, Sumatra, and Java. At least four species are Endangered or Vulnerable and 19 are at lower risk or have insufficient data to determine their status. Among 49 bleeding species, 33 have a world range mostly within South Asia, half with high conservation value scores. Others have small (six species) or substantial (IO species) populations but a much wider distribution. Of all 69 taxa, eight are mature forest-interior species, six are associated with gaps or disturbance, 14 are woodland, edge, or upper canopy dwellers, 14 are associated dth grasslands or cultivation, and seven are river or wetland species. Most wintering migrants (20) are nonforest species, There is evidence of largescale population declines on the continent of Asia, as well as insular syndrome involving increased density and wider habitat breadth on islands. The most important threats to diurnal raptors are (II habitat loss, especially of lowland rainforest to cultivation, (2) habitat degradation, mainly from logging, and (3) forest fragmentation. Few species are successfully adapting to new man-made habitats and none are from the forest-interior guild. Main conservation priorities include surveys and ecological studies, extension and enforcement of protected areas, and sustainable logging practices.

TI Improving the quality of child care in the rural south
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL WELFARE
LA English
DT Article
AB A collaborative of six social service agencies and a state university determined that the single most pressing need of families in a 14-county, rural area was child care. The Training Resource Center, developed through a W. K. Kellogg Foundation grant, worked with day cave licensing and early childhood professional groups to develop a plan to address the systemic nature of the problem of how to improve the quality of child care. Programs developed included training, mentoring, NAEYC accreditation, and a resource library. After 15 months, some programs show the possibility of sustainability.

TI Gap-phase regeneration in selectively logged lowland swamp forest,
   northeastern Costa Rica
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
LA English

DE Carapa nicaraguensis; forest management; gaps; tropical forestry
ID RAIN-FOREST; NEOTROPICAL FOREST; CARAPA-GUIANENSIS; DYNAMICS; CANOPY;
   DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; AMAZON
AB For sustainable logging to be achieved in tropical forests, there must be successful gap-phase regeneration to restock: the logged-over area. This study examined three aspects of gap-phase regeneration in selectively logged lowland swamp forest of northeast Costa Rica. First, logging gaps were censused immediately after extraction to determine the density of advanced regeneration. Stem density and basal area of residual trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh in logging gaps was >85% lower than undisturbed forest, and all trees in gaps had sustained structural damage. The common canopy species Pentaclethra macroloba (Fabaceae) was the most abundant species in gaps whereas the timber tree Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae) was absent from all censused gaps. This suggests that canopy replacement, particularly by Carapa, will depend on trees <10 cm dbh or by seed input into logging gaps. Second, the diversity of the understorey was compared with. 6-y old single-tree and multiple-tree logging gaps. Multiple-tree logging gaps were the most diverse, but dominated by two ruderal species; however many shade-tolerant species were present in those gaps. This indicates that controlled selective logging can result in a localized shift in species composition, but that logging gaps should return to pre-logging composition with time under a carefully implemented, controlled harvesting regime. Finally, this study found a significant effect of a fringing Carapa tree on logging gap seedling density. Thus, seed arrival into gaps is a barrier to logging gap regeneration, particularly for a large-seeded tree species. Gap-phase regeneration by a large-seeded tree species in managed forest would benefit from seed broadcasting into gaps.

AB This article reports the results of a study aimed to develop an approach for the rehabilitation of sylvopastoral lands that would be applicable and sustainable under local village-management conditions. Stabilization measures involved protection against exploitation activities during a period of five years, with accompanying low-cost restoration measures (all locally known) including (i) alignments of dead wood along the contour, (ii) spreading (mulching) of dead wood, and (iii) alignments of small stones along the contour. Monitoring demonstrated remarkable and continuing regeneration of the vegetation, with restoration measures clearly accelerating such regeneration. Low-intensity grazing did not appear to be harmful. The study also demonstrated the synergy between the herbaceous and woody plant layers. However, village management of the area was increasingly neglected, and after the five-year period exploitation levels reverted back to normal, so that the results will not be sustained. This was due to neglect of socio-economic issues, including insufficient insight into the norms and values attributed by the villagers to such low potential sylvopastoral lands. Future research should focus on the socio-economic aspects of land rehabilitation, as technical means are widely known, including appropriate low-cost measures based on local practices. Recommendations focus on principles and steps to be undertaken for successful and sustainable land rehabilitation. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Socio-economic and cultural adaptations in the sustainable use and
   management of resources in a high altitude village in Central Himalaya
SO MAN IN INDIA
LA English
DT Article
AB The article is based on the findings of a study on the functioning of the village Khatuwa, located in the Jaunsar-Bawar region of Central Himalayan region of India. The village is inhabited by the Jaunsaries, a scheduled tribe and have been so since 1967, when the area Jaunsar-Bawar, where they reside, was declared scheduled area. They are polyandrous, though the system is fast disappearing. The difficult and harsh eco-climate has directed the people to develop socioeconomic and cultural adaptations in consonance with the demands of the ecology for their very survival. The present article discusses some of these socio-economic and cultural adaptations, which, otherwise, are markers of sustainability for the continued functioning of the village, through an indepth and empirical study. As found, economic practices, i.e., landholding, agriculture, cropping pattern, etc. and social behaviours, i.e., social hierarchy and intercaste interactions, forms of family, marriage types, etc, are tuned and adopted to ecological demands.

AB India is one of the few countries in the world having the largest tribal concentration. The tribals of our country are having fascinating rich cultural heritage and played a significant role in enrichment of composite culture. The objective and comparative studies of pre-literate societies and their contribution to great indigenous culture of India is essential before they are totally eclipsed in the fast changing cultural canvass of India. Such indepth, comparative and analytical studies may throw light and provide missing cultural links in understanding complex Indian heritage. Santal culture may provide certain clues for decoding the scripts on the seals of Indus Valley Civilization. The study of the process of indigenization of alien culture is essential in order to bring about harmonious integration of tribal societies. A national cultural policy of tribal communities is also necessary to promote sustainable development, on the lines of their "own genius".

AB The conventional notion of science and technology on the nanometer scale is the progress of observation and precision down to the atomic level and the continued miniaturization from today's microelectronics to tomorrow's nanoelectronics. A more adventurous approach to the nanoworld is the assembly scenario, in which nanomachines are assembled from nanometer-scale building blocks, including molecules anl macromolecules. Together, miniaturization and assembly will provide new opportunities and novel ways of solving problems, inspired by the most elegant and efficient ways of nature. Nanotechnology is crucial to ensuring a sustainable development.

DE hierarchies; scale
AB Issues of environmental sustainability, limits to growth and opportunity, introduction of new technology, and the economic and social costs of resource degradation have forced more proactive integration of biophysical and socio-economic data. Natural resources management, including soil, water and land quality, involve balancing the often conflicting objectives of food and fibre production under scenarios of increasing demand, while increasing economic efficiency and maintaining the quality of the environment. It involves integration of data from several disparate disciplines, scaling the data to make them compatible on input, identifying strategic indicators, criteria and thresholds with which to assess the state and performance of the system, and the application of biophysical and economic optimisation models to examine the impacts and trade-offs of alternate management options. However, some basic questions of scales and hierarchies still have to be resolved, e.g. how to "scale-up" the biophysical data to the level at which public policy is formulated without losing the integrity of the data. This paper examines these and related issues by discussing the theories and principles of spatial and temporal hierarchies and scales, and providing some examples of application.

AB Soil nutrient depletion is increasingly regarded as a major constraint to sustainable food production in tropical environments. Research in the recent past focused on different scales, but few attempts were made to link them. In this paper, two cases are elaborated in Central America (CA) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in which the integration of different scales has been studied. Soil nutrient depletion has been calculated for fields, and has then been aggregated to farms, regions, and subcontinents. Key problems on aggregation of field nutrient balances to farms include nutrient flows between fields. Aggregation of farms to regions requires a generalization of individual farms into a farm typology. Aggregation of regions into subcontinents implies that the farm typology concept can mostly not be maintained, resulting in a generalized calculation based on national soil, climate and land use data bases. The field-farm step proved complicated for SSA due to the occurrence of a wide variety of nutrient flows between fields, whereas in CA these flows were much less pronounced; the farm-region step turned out to be manageable for both CA and SSA as farm typology adequately covered observed variation; the region-subcontinent step proved difficult for CA due to the considerable variation in management and input levels in farming systems, whereas this was less the case in SSA. The study shows that integration of spatial scales is constrained by both data availability (the tropical parameter crisis) and by scale-specific variability.

DE nitrate flow; ground water pollution; GIS; large scale model; reduction
   strategies; spatial/temporal impact assessment
AB A GIS-based area-differentiating model has been used to analyze the nitrate pollution of soil and groundwater throughout Germany. The results of the calculations based on the model for the current situation show that a high potential for high nitrate pollution of the soil and groundwater (> 50 mg NO3/l) is to be expected in all regions of Germany subject to intensive agricultural use. In order to achieve a sustainable use of water resources, effective strategies to reduce the nitrogen surpluses from agriculture must be developed and analyzed with respect to their spatial and temporal impact on the nitrate pollution of soil and groundwater, taking into consideration the various agricultural land usages as well as the different hydrological, hydrogeological and agricultural conditions.
   The effects of three different nitrate reduction strategies on the resulting N-surpluses and the nitrate concentration in the leachate were investigated; firstly a stocking rate limitation, secondly a limitation of both organic and mineral fertilizers and thirdly, a combination of three reduction measures consisting of a stocking rate limitation, an improvement of the nitrogen utilization factor by livestock and a higher utilization factor of nitrogen bound in organic fertilizers by crops. The analysis showed that separate application of each of these nitrogen reduction measures would only lower the nitrogen surpluses in a few regions. In order to achieve a considerable reduction of nitrate concentrations both in leachate from land under agricultural use and in the groundwater a combination of area-covering and regionally effective measures (scenario III) turned out to be most promising.

DE soil remediation; mass flux balancing; metal accumulating plants;
   sustainable land use; uncertainty analysis
AB Extraction of heavy metals by accumulating plants is a method which is currently in development for the "gentle" remediation of contaminated agricultural soils (phytoremediation, see [2]). Areal contaminant mass flux balances are basic criteria for the design of such remediations and their control. A framework for the integration of contaminant balances relating the field scale of remediation with the regional scale of soil monitoring networks is provided by the recently developed method PROTERRA [3]. The objective of the study presented in this paper was to test the suitability of PROTERRA for planning and monitoring gentle soil remediations. For this purpose we applied the PROTERRA method to the contaminated agricultural land in and around Dornach, Switzerland, to assess copper flux balances.
   The calculations showed that atmospheric deposition and the application of pesticides and manure are important pathways for the inputs of copper. The copper export with a special maize cultivar accumulating heavy metals would be about three times higher than the average metal export with crops. A moderate increase of sewage sludge application would lead to a substantial increase of the copper input. Decisions to remediate the soil should take the uncertainty of mass flux balances both on field scale as well as on regional scale into account. Therefore, an important need of further development of the PROTERRA method is the integration of uncertainty analysis on both scales.

AB While Africa, the birthplace of the oil palm, has exploited this wealth since immemorial time on a gathering economy basis, it is only since the beginning of the 20th century that this high yield per hectare oil crop has really been cultivated, on an ever-increasing scale. Conditions for the sustainable nature of the crop are discussed: the choice of site is very important, combining a gentle topography, deep soils, rainfall well distributed throughout the year, environment-friendly land preparation techniques, crop management sequences, input use (intensive fertilization), integrated disease and pest control, oil mill quality and pollution risks. However, the sustainability of such a crop is not measured in physical and technical terms only; economic aspects, price fluctuations on the world market, currency parity or instability are all factors that boost or drag down the system: the examples of Africa in the franc zone in the 1980s and Indonesia today illustrate the point.

AB Diseases and pests ore among the adverse factors that most affect the sustainability of a crop or farming system. In many cases, the biological diversity of plant species enables the identification and selection of high-yielding, tolerant cultivars.
   Through methodical and ongoing research, oil palm Fusarium wilt has been overcome. The research programmes launched against bud rot,though not so far advanced, are based on the resistance of Elaeis oleifera. likewise, Ganoderma resistance indexes are known, but their utilization remains limited. For oil palm marchitez and coconut hartrot, in the absence of a resistance index, control methods involve management of the environment to control the vector insect, lastly, resistance sources have been identified in two coconut ecotypes; they provide hope of a promising outcome to lethal yellowing control.
   Few insect species threaten the life of a palm. They are merely responsible for a drop in yields. An oil palm plantation contains an entomological complex comprising pests and their natural enemies, which play a considerable role in regulating populations. Given the fragility of this environment, control methods have to respect the ecosystem as much as possible. Whether it be for diseases or pests, man now has a panoply of methods at his disposal for the rational control of pests and diseases whilst respecting biological balances.

AB The effects of chitin and chitosan on disease, incidence and severity of Fusarium yellows of celery and on populations of Fusarium oxysporum were investigated between 1994 and 1996. Field experiments were conducted at two locations with a history of severe Fusarium yellows. Disease incidence and severity were significantly reduced by pre-plant chitin amendments to soil. Chitosan applied as a root dip alone did not reduce disease incidence but significantly (P < 0.05) reduced disease severity when used with a tolerant celery cultivar. Standard soil dilution methods were used to enumerate populations of soil microflora, Chitin increased bacterial and actinomycete populations in soil in 2 of the 3 years of study. The effects of potential biocontrol agents recovered from chitin-treated plots in 1995 were studied in 1996; enriching the transplant medium with isolates of bacteria and actinomycetes 4 weeks and I week prior to transplanting did not alter the established equilibrium in the field, and no biocontrol effect was observed. Chitin amendments to soil or chitosan treatment of transplants did not reduce soil populations of F. oxysporum. Whether these treatments affected the F. oxysporum f. sp. apii subpopulation within the, F. oxysporum population could not be determined.

AB This paper describes how Swedish women argue and act in order to improve their quality of life. It is based on a citizen survey and on interviews with leaders of a broadly defined women's movement, The thesis is that women are in the process of developing their own democratic practice. They thereby challenge the assumption that general suffrage and numerical equality of representation are sufficient conditions for transforming the contemporary gender power order into one characterized by equality of power between women and,lien. The empirical data show that there is a great deal of variation in perceptions of problems and ways of accomplishing change. The existence of somewhat different priorities and plural feminist strategies for change-state feminist, interest group-based, civil, and segregated-are interpreted as speaking in favor of the sustainability of such pressure for "women-friendliness" in Sweden.

ID THIRD-WORLD CITIES; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; URBAN; GROWTH
AB Since the 1970s, big cities of the developing world have experienced three unprecedented demographic changes: Most "mega-cities" (cities with 5 million residents or more) have absorbed huge population increments; other large cities have experienced, on average, a doubling of population size; and national populations have become increasingly concentrated in dries with one million or more residents. As a result of these and related changes, the long-standing presumption that living conditions are better for big-city residents has come into question. This study uses indicators of children's status and level of infant mortality to compare wellbeing across cities of one million or more residents and smaller settlements within developing regions. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the pronounced early survival advantage of big-city residents has declined steadily since the late 1970s and was no longer apparent by the early 1990s. In sub-Saharan Africa "mega-villages" of several hundred thousand people have emerged-places in which such basic human needs as adequate nutrition, schooling, and child health care are less fulfilled than they are even in small towns. In sum findings suggest that sustainable development of large cities is dependent not only on efficient management, good governance, and sufficient resources, but is also related to cities' size and their rate of population growth.

LA English
DT Article
DE local government; pollution; weather
AB Most staff involved with coastal management issues and working for a local authority have experienced problems from time to time with oil pollution affecting the coastline and beaches. On most occasions incidents are slight and cleanup of the coast is well within the capacity of the local authority; on occasions, however, incidents are much more serious and strategies must be in place to cope with such events. It is essential that those involved with coastal issues are aware of the implications of oil spill, particularly from an environmental and economic viewpoint. This paper is one of a series of topic reports that is being prepared by the Technical Advisory Group Coastal Management Committee for the assistance of those involved with coastal work, The coastal zone is currently the subject of intensive study at local, regional, national and European levels in recognition of the need for the development of sustainable policies to preserve this fragile environment for future generations, The paper is intended to provide an aide-memoire for those involved with the coastline and to encourage training of staff and the updating of contingency plans, particularly at a time when some local authorities are facing restructuring and reorganization.

AB Photovoltaic (PV) power systems call lead to significant reduction of emissions to the environment, Contrary to conventional fossil fuel-based electricity production, the environmental aspects of PV power systems ara mostly related to indirect processes such as cell and module manufacturing and 'end of life' waste management, Careful assessment of such environmental aspects throughout all life-cycle stages is required to reveal the contribution that PV power systems can make to environmental sustainability within fire energy sector. An expert workshop was held in Utrecht, The Netherlands, oil 25-27 June 1997 that addressed issues and approaches regarding the environmental aspects of PV power systems, including energy payback times, CO2 mitigation potential, environmental life-cycle assessment and health and safety assessment and control.
   Various issues of environmental importance were identified during the workshop and recommendations were made for further work to ensure that PV power systems will indeed fulfil the promise of environmental sustainability. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper addresses the air emissions of grid supply versus grid-connected and off-grid photovoltaic power generation, using the framework of life-cycle assessment, in the concert of rural household energy supply in Australia. Emissions of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides are calculated for the three life-cycle stages of manufacture, use and disposal. Sensitivities to materials and data inputs, as well as to component efficiencies, lifetimes and sizing are discussed.
   For each supply option, demand management options, including insulation and appliance choice, and the substitution of solar heating or bottled gas for electricity, are considered.
   The best option in all cases, in terms of life-cycle air emissions, is a grid-connected photovoltaic system used to supply an energy-efficient household with a mix of solar, gas and electric appliances. However, in financial terms, with current Australian energy prices, this option represents a high capital and life-cycle cost. Additionally, for the grid options, electricity costs do not significantly disadvantage the high demand scenarios. Both results provide a clear illustration of current Australian energy-pricing policies being ill conflict with long-term environmental sustainability. (C) 1998 John Wiley C Sons, Ltd.

TI Why is evaluation of the cost effectiveness of audit so difficult? The
   example of thrombolysis for suspected acute myocardial infarction
SO QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
LA English
DT Article
DE audit; acute myocardial infarction; thrombolysis; cost effectiveness
ID CARE
AB Background-Cost effectiveness analysis is an established technique for evaluation of delivery of health care, but its use to evaluate clinical audit is rarely reported. Thrombolysis for suspected acute myocardial infarction is a commonly used therapy of established effectiveness and an appropriate subject for audit in many healthcare settings.
   Objective-To measure the cost effectiveness of audit of thrombolysis in some district general hospitals.
   Main outcome measure-Cost of audit per extra patient treated with thrombolysis (incremental cost effectiveness ratio).
   Design-Prospective agreement with physicians to undertake repeated audits of a specific aspect of the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Baseline measurement of the proportion of these patients given thrombolysis in each hospital were made, as were three subsequent retrospective audits, giving time series of measurements. Costs were estimated from records of staff time and other resources used in each hospital; effectiveness was estimated by fitting the results to a model which assumed a uniform rate of increase over time in the proportion of eligible patients given thrombolysis which might be accelerated by regular audit. Upper and lower limits for main outcome measure were derived from sensitivity analysis of costs and logistic regression of time series data.
   Setting-Five district general hospitals in North West Thames Regional Health Authority including one control hospital were used, starting in April 1991 when widespread medical audit was first introduced.
   Results-Between the first and last audits, the proportion of patients with suspected acute myocardial infarctions receiving thrombolysis rose in three of the hospitals undertaking audit by 20% to 37% and fell by 6% in the fourth (although this hospital started with a rate in excess of 90%). The corresponding change in the control hospital was an increase of 15%. The differences between each of the auditing hospitals and control hospital were not significant, except in one case, where 51 extra treatments per year were attributable to audit (95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) 0.5 to 61 cases per year). Estimated overall costs in each hospital ranged from pound 3700 to pound 5200 for data collection, a series of four audit meetings, and subsequent actions. The central estimate of cost effectiveness in the three responsive hospitals ranged from pound 101 to pound 392 per extra case given thrombolysis, with very wide 95% CIs. In the fourth hospital audit had zero effectiveness as defined in this study.
   Conclusions-Methodological difficulties were encountered which need to be considered in future economic evaluations of clinical audit and related activities. These were: (a) adequate control for other factors influencing clinical behaviour; (b) uncertainties about the sustainability of changes in behaviour associated with audit; and (c) the relative infrequency in a single hospital of specific clinical events leading to small numbers for analysis. These difficulties constitute major challenges for the economic evaluation of clinical audit. They are most likely to be overcome in a large study which compares clinical audit with other interventions aiming for the same quality improvement, such as patient specific reminders or educational programmes.

AB The quantification of the depreciation of natural capital is fundamental to the evaluation of the sustainability of economic development. Several methods for calculating the depletion cost of natural resource stocks have been proposed and used, including net price, El-Serafy's depletion cost, sustainability price, transaction value and replacement cost. Miller and Upton have also shown how resource rent can be estimated using the market value of a firm's liabilities. The relation of resource rent to depletion cost is discussed. These alternative approaches and techniques are described and critiqued, The alternative methods are used to obtain estimates for the resource rent and depletion cost of Argentina's petroleum reserves with data derived from the privatization of Argentina's state-owned oil enterprise, YPF, The results are used to argue that two methods, net price and transactions, overvalue the resource rent of petroleum reserves and to support the derivation of rent from the value of a firm's stock.

AB Based on N. Georgescu-Roegen's bioeconomic paradigm, this paper reconsiders the neoclassical economic paradigm which endorses continuous global economic growth through stimulated trade. We suggest that, in view of sustainability, it is fundamental to acknowledge: (1) the importance of preserving the identity and integrity of economic systems in different regions of the world through enlarging as much as possible self-sufficiency and equity assessed at national and regional levels; and (2) the importance of including respect for biospheric equilibria as one criterion to be used to regulate world economic activity and trade. We examine differences and similarities of the past and present patterns of ecological degradation. We also present two types of efficiency to assess technological changes and the drive toward unsustainability. Then we discuss an entropy-based theory of North-South trade issues and three points for promotion of sustainability. Finally, we show that the true origin of current ecological crisis lies in a deep change in the perception of the relation between humans and nature that affects the mode of technological development of modern society.

AB In recent years, women's contribution to farming has been increasingly recognized by academics, decision makers, and some sectors of the farming community. In contrast, women's activism in agricultural politics is less well accepted or understood. This paper investigates data from a number of farm activist groups operating on a variety of scales in Australia. The paper examines the ways in which farm women develop political agency and then mobilize across a number of "fields of action" to effect both personal and industry-wide change.

AB The spatial variation of the soil seed bank in the steppe of Larrea divaricata and Stipa spp. was evaluated in relation to the spatial pattern of the established vegetation, over two years. Plant distribution was expected to affect the spatial pattern of the soil seed bank. It was hypothesized that patches of bare soil are seed-limited, while soil beneath the external crown of vegetation patches contains greater numbers of seeds. The soil seed bank of the steppe of Larrea divaricata and Stipa spp. displayed a patchy distribution associated with the spatial pattern of above-ground vegetation. Seed banks in areas of bare soil showed lower numbers of seeds than those beneath vegetation. The soil seed bank was dominated by annuals, both in open areas of soil and under vegetation canopies. The relative composition of the soil seed bank varied spatially. Annuals (dicots and grasses) were more abundant in grass-shrub patches (GSP) and grass patches (GP) than in incipient grass-shrub patches (IGSP) and bare soil (BS). Seeds of perennial grasses were more abundant under GP, less abundant under grass-shrub mixed canopies (IGSP and GSP) and practically absent in BS. In addition, seeds of perennial dicots were more frequent in grass-shrub mixed canopies, scarcely represented in GP and absent in BS. The concentration of seeds of perennial grasses in GP and GSP indicates that these are essential for the maintenance of the size of grass populations. Sustainable management should be focused to maintain the structure and function of these types of vegetation patches.

ID IMPACT
AB The continuing trend of donor attention and resources away from Latin America threatens the sustainability of nongovernmental family planning organizations in that region. Managers can improve sustainability through cost control, cost recovery, and income generation. The Population Council's INOPAL II and INOPAL III projects and Family Health International assisted CEMOPLAF, an Ecuadoran private voluntary organization, in carrying out operations research in each of these areas. Studies included cost-savings analysis from altering IUD revisit norms (cost control), an ability-to-pay study that showed potential gains from increased prices for reproductive health services (cost recovery), and a feasibility study to estimate income from ultrasound services (income generation). Results indicate that any one intervention will probably have a limited impact, and that managers likely will need to undertake several initiatives simultaneously to make significant progress toward sustainability.

AB The question remains of under what conditions can pig breeding be regarded as ecologically appropriate. Therefore an approach to develop holistic criteria is presented using the four paradigms of environmental protection and the three action-principles of "caring economy". Pragmatic systems for pig breeding are developed for two aspects: breeding for sustainable agriculture, what are the alternative goals of breeding, and sustainable breeding. The latter requires a considerable biodiversity in pigs used for everyday breeding. Whether or when such an ecologically bases pig breeding system will become a reality is discussed.

DE economic rationality; economy of time; sustainability
AB Time in modem economics is treated either as money or as a resource. Time is scarce and as such it is economically rational to save it. The economic approach to time ensures the acceleration of economic processes. This in turn damages the reproductive cycles of social life and the natural environment This paper argues that a future sustainable economy must be based on a new understanding of time. It must care for and protect socio-environmental needs for more time, for time cycles and for rhythms. The development of such a 'new economy of time' requires a broader concept of economic rationality. With this goal in mind, the traditional economic approaches to time are criticized and five aspects of a 'new' economy of time discussed. Finally, the question of the constructors of the 'new economy of time' is raised.

TI Zero-excess manure management in dairy through optimum rations
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE

DT Article
DE phosphorus; ration management; optimization; manure management; dairy
   operation
AB Manure phosphorus (P) is a major pollutant in many ecologically sensitive areas today. Reduction of manure P in the daily industry is critical for environmental sustainability. Optimum ration management is one way of minimizing excess manure. The objective of the article is to present nutritionally satisfying rations that result in the elimination of unwanted P in a dairy farm by using an optimization-based nutrient balance (NBD) model. The NBD model shows that nutritionally satisfying rations that lead to zero-excess manure are characterized by high P contribution from crops, low in excess dietary N and P, high com-to-alfalfa silage ratio, and high plans biomass content. Rations low in excess dietary N and P lead to low fecal excretion of P and high utilization of P and vice versa for rations high in excess dietary P. Rations formulated for high milk-yielding cows (25 kg d(-1) or more) result in the most efficient utilization of P and zero-excess manure P. On the other hand, dairy systems with low milk yields (20 kg d(-1) or less) have low utilization efficiency for P and consequently, high unwanted manure P.

AB The world's oceans harbour a large diversity of living organisms. As tropical rainforests have been searched for natural drugs, these marine organisms are being screened for useful products, and a number have been found in marine sponges. These are often produced only in trace amounts, and so a large quantity of sponges must be collected to obtain sufficient amounts of the target compounds. Hence, sustainable production of these compounds requires alternatives to harvesting sponge biomass directly from the sea, including the biotechnological production of sponge metabolites.

ID ESTABLISHMENT
AB A band-seeding method was utilised to oversow a suite of legumes into an established pam grass (Brachiaria mutica) pasture. Twining legumes Pueraria phaseoloides and Centrosema pubescens persisted productively in the dense para grass sward but Neonotonia wightii cvv. Malawi and Cooper persisted weakly and Aeschynomene americana cv. Glenn, Stylo-santhes guianensis cv. Cook and Vigna parkeri cv. Shaw failed to persist.
   The legume-oversewn pam grass pasture was compared with a legume-deficient para grass pasture (control) for botanical stability and animal production under continuous grazing. The oversewn treatment was significantly more robust than the control pasture, resisting weed invasion and tolerating adverse seasonal conditions. Animal production from the oversewn legume treatment was, on average, 22% higher than the control over a 3-year grazing period.

SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB A definition of the meaning of "paradigm" is given, followed by a specification of "change of paradigm" in the sense of modern theory of science. It is shown that the presently valid paradigm for planning of environmental and water resources systems is no longer sufficient. The requirements of today's society lead to the postulation of a new paradigm. A trial is made to define such a new planning paradigm with the aid of the formulation of four criteria. These new criteria are: (1) sustainable development; (2) ecological quality; (3) consideration of macroscale systems and effects; and (4) planning in view of changes in natural and socioeconomic systems. The meaning of these new criteria is specified and research activities in those fields are briefly discussed, which may lead - partially - to the formulation of new planning techniques and tools, which are still missing at present.

TI Self-employment and home ownership after the enterprise culture
SO WORK EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the relationship between patterns of self-employment and patterns of home ownership in England in the 1990s. It does this via a secondary analysis of the Survey of English Housing. It argues that for many of the self-employed both the housing boom and the economic boom of the 1980s and the housing and economic recessions of the 1990s have been mutually constitutive. The growth and sustainability of self-employment and of home ownership are two sides of the same socio-political coin. In the 1980s they both boomed and in the early 1990s they both bust. For the future, after the enterprise culture, the two forces are likely to pull in opposite directions, with increasing reliance on self-employment but with housing constituting both a constraint and a risk. Owner occupation is unlikely to offer the means for small business growth that it did in the 1980s, but equally, will make financial demands that the self-employed may find hard to meet. The extremes of boom and bust may be avoided towards 2000, but the livelihoods and homes of self-employed mortgagors are still likely to be precarious.

DE global modelling; biosphere; sustainability; thermodynamics approach
AB If we observe the evolution of different globalistic concepts from T. Malthus up to recent concepts such as the models of the Club of Rome and the sustainability suggested by the Brundtland commission, we can see that all the concepts are principally anthropocentric. For instance, the models of the Club of Rome, though differing by the levels of spatial and functional complexity, are first of all macro-economic models, including the biosphere processes as disturbances of global processes. On the other hand, we can consider the human society as a natural component of the biosphere. We can consider also the Biosphere (in accordance to Vernadsky V.I. (1926) (The Biosphere. Leningrad, Nauchtekhizdat (in Russian)) as an entity and study its reactions to human impact. Thus, we suggest the concept of coevolution of mankind and the biosphere as a further development and an alternative to sustainability. We try to show in this work how terms such as 'limits to growth', 'sustainable development' can be understood. We try to analyse a few technocratic illusions and reveal some physical contradictions contained in the basis of some globalistic concepts. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper outlines resource conflicts, especially around land and water, in the Cauvery basin, and demonstrates a dialectical relationship between conflict and development, rooted in the political economy of the region.
   Development, in the form of introduction of new farming methods, generates increased use of natural resources, and competing claims on these resources leads to their over-exploitation and conflicts. The conflicts indicate an unsustainable situation, which gets resolved by returning to a more sustainable form of development.

AB The year 1998 marks the bicentenary of Thomas Malthus' essay on the impact of population growth on world food supply. His fears relating to an exponential growth in population have come true, while his apprehensions relating to the rate of growth in food production lagging behind that of population growth rate have not materialized. In check-mating Malthusian fears, scientific advances in crop improvement based on Mendelian genetics have played an important role. As we approach a new millennium, the question arises whether Malthusian fears will still come true in the years ahead. Can recent advances in molecular genetics, information, space, renewable energy and management technologies help promote sustainable food security? These questions will be discussed at an infer-disciplinary dialogue to be held in Chennai in the last week of January 1998.

SP Assoc Amer Med Coll
AB The author states that one definition of "paradigm shift" is "the process whereby a governing conceptual framework becomes destabilized and is eventually replaced, more or less wholesale, by a new conceptual consensus." He asks whether recent fundamental changes in academic medicine amount to a paradigm shift, and then briefly describes and comments on 25 changes under way in academic medicine (e.g., the growing importance of cost considerations; focus on episodic care of the acutely ill individual moving instead toward clinical and fiscal responsibility for the health of a population; relative autonomy of the physician evolving to increasing interdependence, both clinical and financial).
   The author maintains that the basic conceptual framework of academic medicine's core mission-patient care, teaching, and research-remains the same, and that this mission's capacity for, good has greatly, grown in recent decades. Over the same interval the core business of academic medicine (i.e., its financing) and how: that relates to the core mission:have indeed;become destabilized. These also comprise a "conceptual framework" by which academic medicine has functioned, and that framework is being replaced, compellingly, by what amounts to a new conceptual consensus-in short, a paradigm shift. He urges his colleagues in academic medicine to be clear-eyed, responsive, and innovative, and never to give up as they work to forge a new and sustainable system that maintains and strengthens scholarship and service.

AB More fundamental knowledge on critical trade-offs is potentially important to improve the performance of low-input agroecosystems. Productivity, stability and sustainability are expressions of performance, and their tradeoffs are a cause of scientific debate. Our results show that articulation and storage within the system play an important role in the trade-offs between productivity and stability, and between productivity and sustainability. Both articulation and storage involve complex structures that have a high maintenance cost, and consequently depress the overall ecosystem productivity. However, they are important to smooth the effect of external perturbations. The inverse relationship between productivity and stability and productivity and sustainability cannot be easily reverted unless external inputs are added. But some structural arrangements in the agroecosystem that produce anomalies and deviations from those inverse trends look promising as a means to reconcile opposite effects in a low-input scheme.

AB Major changes in land use may be anticipated in Europe in the decades to come as a result of technological, socio-economic and political developments as well as global environmental change. The type and effects of these changes will strongly depend on policy decisions which are governed, amongst others, by: (i) an increasing agricultural productivity; (ii) an increasing realization of the need to conserve bio-diversity and environmental quality for current and future generations; (iii) pressure from an increasingly urban population to emphasize non-agricultural forms of land use in terms of nature and landscape conservation; (iv) increasing market-driven demand for high quality produce made with environmentally friendly forms of management: and (v) increasing food demand on the world market as the world population doubles and purchasing powers increases, particularly in Asia. These developments occur now both in Eastern and Western Europe, even though historical developments during the last 50 years have been strikingly different in these two regions Collectivization in Eastern Europe after World War II was associated with higher yields but also with unfavourable changes in land use and cropping patterns causing acidification, soil erosion, salinization and chemical pollution. The change to democracy in the late 1980s implied a change from an essentially quantity-to a more quality-oriented type of agriculture, like in Western Europe where an industrialized agriculture had also caused environmental problems. Emphasis is now being placed on rational land use, which includes optimization of farm size and the development and implementation of economically viable crop production techniques which result in high quality produce as well as limited adverse environmental side effects. However, these ideals an far from being realized, According to some studies, the technical possibilities of modern agriculture can theoretically in future provide an adequate volume of produce from only 30 to 50% of the current agricultural area in western Europe. This implies potential for other forms of land use in the remaining land area. However, other studies emphasizing low external input agriculture or extrapolation of historical trends, indicate that the current land area may be needed to produce adequate food, certainly when considering the future world market demand, This conclusion is also supported by the fact that theoretical production levels are often much higher than real levels, because of various agronomic and socio-economic factors. A major challenge for the decades ahead is to avoid uncontrolled developments of land use with possibly adverse socio-economic and environmental effects; the latter include the time-delayed release of harmful chemicals, currently held in some soils, into the environment and the enhanced emission of radiatively active trace gases from soils to atmosphere. Controlled developments yielding sustainable forms of agricultural land use in some areas and nature development in others, is to be preferred and should ideally be based on eco-regional approaches. The authors advocate initiation of comprehensive, exploratory studies for Europe in which sustainable production of major land units is defined as a function of different types of land management and in which Europe is seen as part of the world economy. Six exploratory studies are reviewed in this paper; however, none of these scenario studies has the necessary comprehensive character and none is based on adequate land data.

AB Anthropogenic changes in atmospheric deposition have led to accelerated soil acidification in many sites, especially on soils and/or bedrocks low in acid neutralizing capacity. This paper presents data from field studies in forest sites in temperate and tropical regions, which are suitable to discuss cause-effect relationships and give evidence of toxic effects caused by aluminum and heavy metal ions in soil solution. The discussion includes metals of anthropogenic origin, brought to the site by atmospheric transport or by direct deposition, and also metals originating from weathering of bedrocks and soil minerals. Possible restrictions of forestry practice to counteract negative effects of soil chemical changes and destabilization of forest ecosystems are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID HEMODIALYSIS; STENOSES; DILUTION
AB The hemodynamic monitor (HDM) is a device that uses magnetic principles to accurately measure access recirculation during hemodialysis. The measurement is based on differential conductivity between arterial and venous blood flow rates in the dialysis blood tubing sets. One milliliter of hypertonic saline is injected into the venous line of the blood tubing set as a conductivity "tracer." As the tracer enters the patient, the presence of access recirculation causes a percentage of the hypertonic saline to recirculate into the arterial line and is detected and quantified by the HDM; the percentage of access recirculation is calculated in under 1 minute, Clinical studies were performed in two centers on 106 patients with various forms of blood access leg, arteriovenous fistulae, Gore-tex grafts [WL Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, AZ], Permcaths [Quinton Instrument Co, Bothell, WA], subclavian catheters). Access recirculation was detected under routine dialysis conditions in only 13 patients. In the remaining cases, attempts at inducing access recirculation were made by reversing the arterial and venous lines and/or increasing the blood pump to its maximum sustainable rate for a given patient. A 18-minute protocol was then instituted. Three blood samples (arterial, venous, and "peripheral" [stop-flow technique]) were first obtained to determine urea measurements and for subsequent calculation of access recirculation; Immediately afterward, an HDM recirculation measurement was recorded to allow correlation of urea and HDM access recirculation results (accuracy). Two further HDM access recirculation measurements were made to analyze the precision or repeatability of the HDM test. This protocol was attempted up to three times in each patient on different dialysis days. Two hundred fifty-nine studies were made, and a strong linear correlation was obtained between urea and HDM results (r = 0.94, slope 0.95) over a range of access recirculation (5% to 60%) demonstrating accuracy. Repeated HDM access recirculation results showed a characteristic SD of 1.8% over the whole range of values, demonstrating a precision superior to the 6% expected using the urea method. When zero access recirculation was indicated by the HDM, "ground truth" tests were performed by injecting 1 mt of hypertonic saline (HS) into one injection port of the blood tubing set then 0.1 mL of HS into the other to simulate 10% access recirculation; the mean results were 9.96% +/- 1.59% (+/-SD; n = 93), confirming the accuracy of the method, (C) 1998 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB In a dynamic manufacturing environment, manufacturing cell configurations based on current part mix and production process may need to be revised once the part mix or the production process has changed. However, machine and equipment moving costs make frequent reconfiguration uneconomical and sometimes impossible. Designing a sustainable cellular manufacturing system in a dynamic environment is studied in this paper. An integer programming model is developed to minimize material handling and machine costs as well as cell reconfiguration cost for a planning horizon of multiple time periods. Solving this integer programming problem is NP-complete. A decomposition approach is developed so that the decomposed subproblems can be solved with less computational effort. Dynamic programming is then employed to find a solution of the original problem. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the model and the solution technique developed in this paper.

AB Until recently, the interaction between environmental quality, economic activity and growth is predominantly considered in an a-spatial context. Traditional neoclassical growth theory following Solow/Swan has mainly addressed questions about environmental and resource limits to growth. Recently, much attention is also devoted to the environment-growth interface from an endogenous growth perspective. However, an important element that is missing in both the neoclassical and endogenous growth approaches is a multiregional perspective. The present theoretical study tries to present one of the first attempts to fill this gap. The analysis is based on a model of two interactive regions, with possible interaction between the regional environments via the global environment. The implications of this type of analysis are manifold. One is that endogeneity of growth is not only due to technology and knowledge formation but also to the effects of trade, resource scarcity and environmental degradation. Another implication is that a coordinated environmental policy of regions should address long-term sustainability, and take account of the positive technological and negative environmental dynamic externalities.

AB Estimates of production and predation rates from bioenergetic models of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) suggest a long-term decline in their gross conversion efficiency (gross production/prey consumption) and the gross production to biomass ratio in Lake Ontario during 1978-1994. The former pattern was caused primarily by a declining trend in adult alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) energy density during 1978-1985; the latter pattern resulted from reductions in growth rates (coho salmon) and a buildup of the older age-classes in the population (lake trout) over time. Model results suggest that over 100 and 25% of the annual production of adult alewife and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), respectively, was consumed by salmonines during 1990 in Lake Ontario; hence, we claim that recent observations of reduced salmonine growth in Lake Ontario may be a result of prey limitation. Energy transfer from primary production to salmonines appeared to be more efficient in Lake Ontario than in Lake Michigan, probably due to higher stocking levels per unit area and higher densities of preferred prey fish in Lake Ontario. Through separate analyses, we arrived at conflicting conclusions concerning the sustainability of the food web configuration in Lake Ontario during 1990.

   MODEL; GENERAL-THEORY; MANAGEMENT; CATCH; STRATEGIES; POPULATION; GROWTH
AB Fishery reference points are widely applied in formulating harvest management policies. We supply precise mathematical definitions for several reference points in common use. We then derive analytical expressions for these quantities from age-structured population models. In particular, we explain how the maximum sustainable harvest rate and catch (h*, C*), two quantities of management importance, can replace the classical recruitment parameters (alpha, beta) in the Beverton-Holt and Ricker recruitment curves. We also demonstrate dependencies of various reference points on subsets of model parameters. Although our analysis is restricted to special cases, our models still have general utility. For example, simple calculations from analytical formulas enable checks on the output from more complex models and guide the choice of reference points for fishery management.

AB Alternate silviculture systems, such as small patch clearcuts, may become important in the development of sustainable forest management strategies in aspen forests. A study was initiated in a 64-yr-old trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stand in Meadow Lake Provincial Park, Saskatchewan to determine changes in nutrient dynamics and secondary succession following patch clear-cutting. One hectare replicated patch cuts were logged in the winter of 1993-1994. There was no site preparation following harvest. Annual vegetation, regeneration and soil and plant nutrient data were collected annually, 1 yr prior to, and 3 yr following harvest. Aspen regeneration was 48 375 stems ha(-1) 2 yr after treatment. Stand (alpha) diversity of the understory was not affected by harvesting, although annual species turnover (beta diversity) increased slightly after harvest. There was an increase in aspen foliar nitrogen (N) for 2 yr following harvest. Soil nutrient concentrations did not differ between patch cut and unharvested plots except total potassium (18% lower in the LFH of the harvested treatments 3 yr after harvesting). Small patch cuts with the litter horizon kept intact may be appropriate for aspen-dominated stands in the boreal mixed wood to minimize ecological disturbance while maintaining aesthetics within a park setting.

AB A steady-state mass balance model (ForSust), developed to simulate potentially sustainable levels of tree biomass growth and related nutrient uptake dynamics, was applied to 17 jack pine sites across Canada. The model simulates potential tree biomass growth based on nutrient inputs from estimated atmospheric deposition (N, Ca, Mg, K) and soil weathering (Ca, Mg, K), and matches the resulting nutrient supply rates with calculated nutrient demand. Nutrient demand calculations are based on nutrient concentrations in wood, bark, branches, and foliage. Specifically, the model simulates sustainable annual increment (SAI) of biomass growth for stem-only and whole-tree (aboveground biomass) harvesting, and for recurring forest fire conditions. Calculated SAI levels were compared with field-estimated mean annual increments for aboveground forest biomass (MAI). For recurring forest fires, it was found that SAI values, as simulated, corresponded with the MAI field estimates in general. For whole-tree harvesting, SAI was lower than MAI for most but not all sites. For stem-only harvesting, SAI corresponded with MAI, but there was a greater scatter between SAI and MAI values than what appeared to be the case for the recurring forest fire scenario.

AB The effects of conventional stem-only and whole-tree harvesting on nutrient losses in biomass removal and in leachate fluxes over a 3-yr period after cutting three white birch stands in central Newfoundland were determined. Losses of nutrients in biomass were proportionately greater with more intensive harvesting as tree components with higher nutrient concentrations (branches, foliage) were removed. Stem-only harvesting removed 126, 9, 51, 126 and 23 kg ha(-1) of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in biomass, respectively. Whole-tree harvesting led to a 19% increase in biomass removal as compared to stem-only harvesting, but nutrient removals with whole-tree harvesting increased by 127% for N, 138% for P, 151% for K, 72% for Ca and 90% for Mg. Nutrient losses in deep percolation of soil solution during the first 3 yr after harvesting were generally greater following stem-only than whole-tree harvesting. This may be the result of increased leaching from slash, increased mineralization beneath slash, and retardation by slash of the successional vegetation that could act as a nutrient sink. In the first 3 yr following harvesting, leaching losses after whole-tree harvesting were 4, 0.2, 8, 23 and 7 kg ha(-1) of N, P, K, Ca and Mg, respectively, as compared with 9, 0.1, 7, 28 and 9 kg ha(-1) of N, P, K, Ca and Mg after stem-only harvesting. Nutrient losses in leachate were generally small compared to losses in biomass removal.

   Finland
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE

DT Article
ID WILD REINDEER; LIMITATION; WINTER; SIZE
AB The increase in the Finnish semidomesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) stock and the high level of meat production during the 198Os and the beginning of the 1990s were mainly due to reindeer-management practices. However, the continuing deterioration of winter-range quality has now forced reindeer managers to invest increasingly in supplementary feeding. At the same rime, carrying-capacity models for semidomesticated-reindeer ranges have proved difficult to develop. This study deals with reproduction and productivity of the reindeer stock in northern Finland during the period 1987-1995. The results reveal that reproduction and productivity of reindeer in the study area are largely regulated by density-dependent factors related to the quantity and quality of winter ranges. Reindeer densities on total rangeland had the strongest effect on the slaughter body masses of reindeer, which indicates the special importance of summer and autumn pastures for growth and autumn condition of reindeer. Through intensive calf slaughtering, the natural mortality rate was minimised and reproduction rates and reindeer meat production were increased, although winter ranges were heavy grazed. Developing semidomesticated-reindeer husbandry to be more economical in the future by keeping sustainable meat production at a sufficiently high level while maintaining reindeer rangeland in adequate condition and supplementary feeding quite marginal in Finland involves consideration of both ecological and management factors. One way of looking at the economic carrying capacity of Finnish semidomesticated-reindeer ranges is to develop a model based on dependence among the factors presented in this study. Sustainable net incomes from reindeer husbandry could then be optimised by studying and modelling the economy of reindeer management itself with respect to stock density.

AB The capital city Beijing, known for its cultural heritage and aesthetic urban design, has been transformed into a seriously polluted heavy industrial city in the past five decades, Beijing's industrial structure is dominated by fuel and material processing that can be located in other parts of China. Suggestions are made in this paper to make the city more sustainable by restoring and conserving selected landscapes in the city, modifying its urban function and economic structure, developing satellite cities and underground spaces, recycling industrial wastes, transferring water from South China, and improving irrigation efficiency in the municipality. However, improving revenue sharing with the central government is most essential to make this cultural capital sustainable, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Following reports of dramatic declines in managed and feral honey bees from nearly every region of North America, scientists and resource managers from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada come together to review the quality of the evidence that honey bees as well as other pollinators are in long-term decline and to consider the potential consequences of these losses on the conservation of biodiversity and the stability of the yield of food crops. These experts in pollination ecology confirmed that the last 5 years of losses of honeybee colonies in North America leaves us with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the last 50 years and that the management and protection of wild pollinators is an issue of paramount importance to our food supply system. Although there are conclusive data that indicate 1200 wild vertebrate pollination may be at risk, data on the status of most invertebrate species that act as pollination agents is lacking. The recommendations from a working group of over 20 field scientists, presented here, have been endorsed by 14 conservation and sustainable agriculture organizations, research institutes, and professional societies including the Society for Conservation Biology. Among the most critical priorities for future research and conservation of pollinator species are (1) increased attention to invertebrate systematics, monitoring, and reintroduction as part of critical habitat management and restoration plans. (2) multi-year assessments of the lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides, herbicides, and habitat fragmentation on the wild pollinator populations in and near croplands; (3) inclusion of the monitoring of seed and fruit set and floral visitation rates in endangered plant management and recovery plans; (4) inclusion of habitat needs for critically-important pollinators in the critical habitat designations for endangered plants; (5) identification and protection of floral reserves near roost sites along the "nectar corridors" of threatened migratory pollinators; and (6) investment in the restoration and management of a diversity of pollinators and their habitats adjacent to croplands in order to stabilize or improve crop yields The work group encourages increased education and training to ensure that both the lay, public and resource managers understand that pollination is one of the most important ecological services provided to agriculture through the responsible management and protection of wildland habitats and their populations of pollen-vectoring animals and nectar-producing plants.

AB Both harvest rates and food web interactions may be altered through use of different gill net mesh sizes in the fisheries of Lake Victoria, East Africa. Thus, conservation of the native ichthyofauna is intimately linked to patterns of exploitation in the fisheries. we used bioenergetics modeling to estimate the harvest rates of introduced Nile perch (Lates cf. niloticus) and changes in their predation rates on other important fishes that would result from the implementation of various restrictions on gill net mesh size. Total mass of harvested Nile perch was predicted to vary more than three-fold over the range of minimum gill net mesh size from 3 to 16 inches. Maximum harvest is expected to result from minimum mesh size restrictions between 6 and 10 inches. Predation rates on all prey fishes would increase with all increases in minimum mesh size. Universal enforcement of a 5-inch minimum mesh size would reduce both Nile perch cannibalism and predation on other important fishes, such as tilapiines, haplochromine cichlids, and Rastrineobola argentea by as much as 44%, with little decrease (10%) in Nile perch yield. But, if fishers respond to a 5-inch minimum mesh size by concentrating all fishing effort on the smallest gill nets (5- and 6-inch mesh), a substantially larger reduction in predation on native haplochromines will result, but at the expense of large (similar to 35%) decreases in Nile perch harvest. Our analyses demonstrate that fisheries in Lake Victoria will play an active role in the restoration of a diverse fish community and fishery resource, thus benefiting both many native fish species and the sustainability of the fishery.

AB We used empirical data to simulate the impacts, over the next 40 years, of subsistence-level agricultural clearing and bushmeat consumption on forest resources within the recently established Okapi Wildlife Reserve in northeastern Zaire. Satellite imagery, human population census data, and field measurements were used to calculate Present and projected impacts of agricultural clearing on forest cove: Data on per capita meat consumption and the species captured by hunters were combined with relevant ecological data to estimate ratios of consumption to production and to assess the sustainability of hunting. Even with projected population growth of nearly 300% among local communities over 40 years, sufficient secondary forest is available that agricultural clearing will have minimal effect on mature forest throughout most of the reserve. Impacts on the reserve's fauna will be more dramatic particularly within 15 km of villages where most hunting currently occurs Subsistence exploitation of forest antelopes may be sustainable in much of the reserve (especially if high estimates of game production are used), but as the human Population continues to increase duikers will likely be over-hunted. Primate populations do not appear to be threatened In the near future in those areas where bow hunters exploit monkeys, but an increase in this specialized activity in other legions of the reserve and growing human populations could change this. Although additional surveys of commonly hunted species throughout the Okapi wildlife Reserve are essential to enhancing the precision of the simulation, our results suggest that mitigation efforts should he designed and implemented note if the long-term effects of domestic bushmeat consumption are to be addressed.

AB Conservation biologists often must make decisions about the sustainability of harvest rates based on minimal demographic information. To assist them Robinson anti Redford (1991) formulated a method to estimate maximum rates of production which could be used to detect overharvesting based on only age at first reproduction, fecundity, and maximum longevity. By assuming constant adult survival we reduced the Euler equation to a simple form that allows calculation of population growth from the same minimal demographic data, brit that can incorporate empirical prereproductive and adult survival rates if available. With this formula, we computed growth rates rising various explicit survival schedules, and we compared these rates and those from Robinson and Redford's (1991) method to rates calculated from 19 relatively complete mammalian life tables gleaned from the literature. When we applied our method (assuming 1% survival to maximum longevity) and that of Robinson and Redford (1991) to the same minimal demographic data, we found that our growth rates were closer to those from complete life tables. We therefore reexamined the data of Fa et al (1995) and Fitzgibbon et al. (1995), who analyzed overharvesting of several populations of commercially exploited African mammals based on Robinson and Redford's (1991) methods Our reanalysis indicates that several additional populations may be overharvested. Our analysis also suggests that data on survival to age at first reproduction improves estimates of population growth rates more than data on age-specific adult survival. Regardless of the method, approximate growth rates based on incomplete life tables can be used to detect when populations are overharvested, brit one should not conclude that harvest rates are sustainable when they are less than approximate production rates because simplifying assumptions often lend to overestimates.

TI Strategies for land-bird conservation on Mauritius
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION; EXTINCTION; ISLAND
AB The native wildlife of Mauritius is highly threatened by a variety of influences other than habitat destruction. Protection from habitat destruction atone cannot guarantee its conservation and the damage already sustained is not fully reversible Therefore, the ideal for conservation-maintenance or restoration of self-sustaining populations of all species in native ecosystems-is presently unattainable. We assessed three long-term strategies for maintaining and increasing populations of threatened native birds on the mainland and offshore islets of Mauritius, with respect to efficacy, sustainability, and side-effects. Rehabilitation of native vegetation on the mainland is likely to improve food availability over limited areas, but it can only form the basis of a long-term bird conservation strategy when population density of introduced animals, especially predators, can he reduced sustainably, at low financial cost, and without adversely affecting native wildlife. Marooning bird populations on ecologically rehabilitated islets can eliminate the predator problem, but they would be vulnerable to catastrophes (especially cyclones) and possibly disease and much habitat manage ment work is still needed. A third novel strategy-enhancement of mainland habitat using exotic plants-allows creation of source habitats, greatly reducing the predator threat. It also permits larger areas to be managed and at lower cost, than is the case with intensive rehabilitation. Habitat management regimes for conservation of threatened species or communities must be designed specifically to alleviate population-limiting factors. Ln altered environments certain exotic plants can be essential to the survival of native animal species. The most effective conservation measure must not be assumed always to be the rehabilitation of native vegetation.

AB Worldwide increases in the frequency and spatial extent of blooms of harmful marine microalgae and heterotrophic dinoflagellates suggest that these species are becoming an increasingly important influence on year class strength of marine fishes through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Impacts on fish populations from harmful marine microalgae and heterotrophic dinoflagellates have been considered primarily from the limited view of acute or lethal influences. Accumulating evidence indicates that insidious sublethal and chronic impacts to both fish and human health from these organisms, such as long-term behavior alteration, increased susceptibility to cancers and other diseases, depressed feeding, and impaired reproduction, may be substantial and pervasive. For some harmful species, significant indirect impacts that promote critical habitat loss or disrupt the microbial food web balance also have been documented. Because successful models to predict the behavior and growth of most of these species have not yet been developed, and because toxins for many are poorly characterized, a clear anthropocentric focus has guided management strategies for confronting their outbreaks. The extent to which management takes the fundamental step of acknowledging scientifically demonstrated linkages among harmful microalgae, shellfish contamination, fish kills, and human health impacts has also been seriously constrained by political dictates stemming from economic considerations. Without federal involvement, and without catastrophe of human death or widescale serious human illness, little progress historically has been realized in the development of effective management strategies to mitigate lethal impacts to fish or other organisms. Many long-known taxa such as certain "red tide" dinoflagellates apparently can increase independently of human influences other than physical transport. However, some newly discovered toxic or otherwise harmful taxa have been correlated with cultural eutrophication in poorly flushed fish nursery grounds such as estuaries and coastal waters. Outbreaks of certain warm-optimal species have coincided with El Ni (n) over tilde o events, suggesting that warming trends in global climate change may stimulate their growth and extend or shift their range. The available information points to a critical need for a more proactive, concerted effort to determine the full range of chronic/sublethal effects, as well as acute impacts, on marine fish populations by harmful marine microalgae and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, so that their increasingly important influence can be factored into reliable plans for sustainable fisheries management.

AB We discuss the issues of sustainable use and management in the Chilean inshore benthic small-scale (artisanal) fisheries. The fishery benefits from two features that make it possible to overcome some of the problems of conventional management. These are: (1) major advances have been made in understanding relevant ecological processes, and (2) this knowledge has been institutionalized in the 1991 Chilean Fishing and Aquaculture Law (FAL). FAL legalizes the use of community-owned shellfish grounds, so-called "Management and Exploitation Areas" (MEA); this practice is considered to confer quasi-property rights to fishers' unions. Management plans for these areas have to be approved by the government. This co-management approach solves one of the major problem in many fisheries: overexploitation,]in addition, the study of the MEAs could provide useful information, if they are considered as "replicates," in evaluating the effect of human perturbation and different management regimes. We think that by using the different tools provided by the FAL on the spatial arrangement of the small-scale fishery and answering certain key ecological questions, the sustainable use of inshore benthic resources in Chile (e.g., gastropods, sea urchins, and algae) via an ecosystem approach can be achieved in the near future.

ID ECOPATH
AB Using a top-down modeling approach, published mass-balance models of trophic interactions and state variables in the western central Pacific Ocean and the northern Gulf of Mexico shelf were used to explore how large increases in top predator biomasses can be accommodated with given primary productions. It appears that the biomasses of top predators in these models can be increased an order of magnitude, which leads to a six- to sevenfold increase in overall consumer biomasses. This results in changes in food web structures that are in agreement with major aspects of E.P. Odum's theory of ecosystem development, particularly with regard to features associated with the retention and recycling of detritus. Based on the simulations and Odum's theory, we propose a functional definition of carrying capacity: the upper limit of biomass that can be supported by a set primary production and within a variable food web structure is reached when total system respiration equals the sum of primary production and detritus import. The theory supported by the simulations has a number of corollaries relevant to sustainable management of ecosystems.

ID TRANSFERABLE QUOTAS
AB With the growing importance of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) in fisheries management, it is critical to document and understand what happens when individual quotas are implemented. In-person interviews with fishing business owners and others were conducted in 1987 and 1995 in New Zealand, where ITQs were implemented in 1986. Similar interviews and mail surveys were completed in 1993-1994 with participants in British Columbia's (Canada) halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) fishery, where individual vessel quotas were implemented in 1991. Results indicate (1) an end of the "race for fish," (2) industry participants' maximization of returns from quota holdings, and (3) strong influence of individual quota system design details on outcomes. Implications of ITQs for sustainable fisheries management are discussed.

AB Georges Bank, a shallow submarine plateau located off the New England coast, has supported valuable commercial fisheries for several centuries. The region is characterized by high levels of primary productivity and, historically, high levels of fish production, Within the last four decades Georges Bank has been subjected to major perturbations that have profoundly altered levels of catch, abundance, and species composition. The arrival of distant water Beets during the early 1960s resulted in dramatic increases in effective fishing effort and the subsequent commercial collapse of several fish populations. Total fish biomass is estimated to have declined by >50% on Georges Bank during the period of operation of the distant water Beets, The implementation of extended jurisdiction (the 200-mile [370.4-km] limit) in 1977 was followed by modernization and increased capacity of the domestic Beet, resulting in a second perturbation to the system that resulted in further declines in groundfish populations to historically low levels, A subsequent increase in the abundance of species of low commercial value was documented, with an apparent replacement of gadid and Bounder species by small elasmobranchs (including dogfish sharks and skates), Examination of feeding guild structure suggests that this switch in species dominance may have been Linked to a competitive release, The small elasmobranchs, notably dogfish sharks, also prey on species of commercial importance (primarily small pelagics, including herring and mackerel), The cumulative impacts on the groundfish populations as a result of intense exploitation and predation pressure may have been further exacerbated by effects of fishing gear on the physical structure of the habitat. Implications for the development of an ecosystem-based management approach are described.

AB The capacity of marine and coastal ecosystems to sustain seafood production and consumption is seldom accounted for. In this article, we review estimates of marine and coastal areas appropriated by aquaculture and fisheries for seafood production, and also by cities and whole regions for seafood consumption. The appropriated ecosystem area - the ecological footprint - ranges from negligible to as much as 50000 ha/ha activity, largely depending on the methods of farming and fishing. The area for waste assimilation ranges from 2 to 275 ha/ha seafood production. The human population of the Baltic Sea region (85 x 10(6) people) appropriate for their seafood consumption an area of marine ecosystems that corresponds to two additional Baltic Sea areas. Twenty percent of the global human population (1.1 x 10(9) people), living in large cities worldwide, appropriate 25% of the globally available area of productive coastal and marine ecosystems. The capacity of marine and coastal ecosystems to produce seafood is not included in the signals that guide economic development. Practices that make use of this capacity without degrading it have to be developed and protected from economic and social driving forces that create incentives for misuse of coastal and marine ecosystems.

AB Many modern fisheries management systems create incentives to overfish, leading to negative economic and environmental consequences for human welfare and marine ecosystem health. In this paper, we review problems faced by many fisheries managers, including overcapitalization, by-catch of nontarget species, and alteration of marine food webs. We recommend the formulation of alternative fisheries management goals based on risk-averse, multispecies management. We discuss alternative fisheries management systems, including transferable fishing privileges, community development quotas, and individual transferable quotas (ITQs). We argue that fostering fisheries conservation will require combining stringent performance criteria with alternative fisheries management designed to create incentives for sustainability.

AB Upwelling ecosystems are productive fishing grounds, contributing >30% to the world's catch of marine fish. A set of seven trophic mass balance models of productive subsystems of the four largest upwelling areas is used to demonstrate key features of the modeling process and the analysis of the models using some flow network techniques. The models describe trophic interactions in the northern Humboldt Current (4 degrees-14 degrees S), the northern Benguela Current (15 degrees-35 degrees S), the southern Canary Current (12 degrees-25 degrees N), and the California Current (28 degrees-43 degrees N), focusing on different biological regimes in the 1970s and 1980s. The straightforwardness of the method is emphasized as a coherent basis for more sophisticated modeling approaches. One major advantage over more traditional assessment methods is that the fishery is explicitly tied into the full set of species interactions, and its impact can thus be readily compared to that of other piscivores in the ecosystem. This approach consequently allows us to assess the ecological sustainability of a fishery. It therefore addresses the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries recently published by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.

AB Overexploitation of marine fisheries remains a serious problem worldwide, even for many fisheries that have been intensively managed by coastal nations. Many factors have contributed to these system failures, Here we discuss the implications of persistent, irreducible scientific uncertainty pertaining to marine ecosystems. When combined with typical levels of uncontrollability of catches and incidental mortality, this uncertainty probably implies that traditional approaches to fisheries management will be persistently unsuccessful. We propose the use of large-scale protected areas (marine reserves) as major components of future management programs, Protected areas can serve as a hedge against inevitable management limitations, thus greatly enhancing the long-term sustainable exploitation of fishery resources. Marine reserves would also provide an escape from the need of ever more detailed and expensive stock assessments and would be invaluable in the rehabilitation of depleted stocks.

AB Time scales, and the trophic relations between these scales, are very different in the sea from those on land. In particular, marine systems are much more responsive to decadal scale alterations in their physical environment but are also much more adaptable. Thus it is difficult, and probably counterproductive, to try to define a baseline state for marine ecosystems. Further, regime shifts in fish communities can have major economic consequences without being ecological disasters. Climatic changes at decadal scales, from natural or anthropogenic causes, are likely to produce or enhance regime shifts.
   There are different management issues in different sectors. The coastal zone demands our intervention to assure integrated management of the land and sea components. At the other extreme, our understanding of open ocean systems is an essential element of climate prediction and so of eventual management. Between these two environments, our use of resources in continental shelf seas requires an ability to distinguish between human and natural causes of long-term change.

I begin by convassing various conceptions of sustainability and sketching some difficulties with the notions that have been introduced. Next some possible uses of the idea of sustainability are identified. I go on to discuss these in the context of disputes over public lands in the United States. Finally I say why we must go beyond sustainability if we are successfully to address the present disorder regarding the human relationship to nature. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID ECONOMISTS
AB The conventional economic paradigm assumes that tastes and preferences are exogenous to the economic system, and that the economic problem consists of optimally satisfying those preferences. Tastes and preferences usually do not change rapidly and, in the short term, this assumption makes sense. Sustainability is an inherently long-term problem and in the long run it does not make sense to assume tastes and preferences are fixed and given. If preferences are expected to change over time and under the influence of education, advertising, changing cultural assumptions, etc., the old assumption of 'consumer sovereignty' is not adequate. Different criteria of optimality are needed. How preferences change, how they relate to the goal of sustainability, and how they can or should be actively influenced to satisfy the new criteria needs to be determined. Ecological economics has emphasized the three rank ordered goals of ecological sustainability, fair distribution; and allocative efficiency. This paper examines how preferences evolve and change over time and the implications of this for developing policies that meet these three goals in democratic societies.

AB Traditional approaches to sustainability rely on models that depend upon judgments of welfare across future generations, 'right prices' and some sense as to what future persons will find giving of utility. These models both accept the spontaneous order of market processes and rely on that order to derive optimal consumption paths into the future. Sustainability is, however, not a problem of divining optimal paths predicated upon right prices. Rather, sustainability, to be operational, requires a prior constructed order predicated upon rights for future persons and duties for those now living who sit in a position as dictator over the settings and circumstances that will be passed on to future persons. Rights-based approaches to sustainability do not rely upon unknowable 'preferences' of future persons, but rather upon an 'environmental regency' in which those now living agree to preserve 'settings and circumstances' for the future. This reminds us that the issue of sustainability concerns not 'how much to preserve) but 'what to preserve.' (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Soil degradation was found in first generation of Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii (Rupr) Rupr.) plantations in northern China and also in plantations of other larch species such as Larix olgensis and Larix leptolepis in the same area. Soil degradation in pure larch plantations may be exacerbated in the second rotation under continuous cropping and was accompanied by obvious concomitant decrease in tree growth. A study on nutrient cycling revealed that poor quality of larch litter, which decomposed very slowly, was a key factor leading to soil degradation and decline in tree growth in pure larch plantations. The accumulation of forest floor litter in similar to 20-year-old pure larch stands was 23-28 ton ha(-1) and this was higher than 9-16 ton ha(-1) in virgin mixed Korean pine/broad-leaf forests. Larch litter took 4.4 years to mineralise, whereas angiosperm litter lash, birch and poplar) in a pure larch stand took only 0.9-2.4 years. The progressive accumulation of litter on the forest floor acted as a heat-isolating layer which inhibited thermal conduction and decreased soil temperature and limited soil microbial activities. Consequently, degradation of soil fertility occurred and this was exacerbated after two or more rotations under continuous cropping. The role of the understorey vegetation was significant in nutrient recycling and maintaining sustainable soil fertility in larch plantations. A low-cost, effective way to prevent soil degradation in pure larch plantations is to develop mixed stands formed either by creating a mixture with broad-leaved trees or by introducing understorey vegetation (herbs and shrubs). Large areas of man-made, pure larch stands should be replaced by many small patches of different. uneven-age stands and crop rotation with different tree species should be adopted instead of continuous larch cropping.

AB The term 'degraded land' is subjective and depends on the perspective of the observer. Foresters may view land as degraded when, in the view of the people who 'degraded' it, it has, for the first time, a value. While, for most people the term `degraded land' unarguably includes land, possibly previously covered in trees, that has been mined and left devoid of all topsoil, all vegetation and any hope of regeneration in the medium term. The term is also held to include land that historically carried trees but which was cleared in the past and having no current alternative use, and has become apparently stable under some form of heath vegetation. In that state it may be valued for other reasons. Degraded land is sometimes held to include previously forested land that is in the process of being changed to other uses but may, currently, still contain remnants of forest. The purpose of this paper is to pose the question as to whether putting trees back on all types of degraded land is always the best decision when factors such as the economics of the operation; the social desirability of the operation and the ecological sustainability of it are considered and to highlight some of the issues a forester needs to consider before embarking on reafforestation of such land. Two examples are used-one from the North Auckland region of New Zealand, the other from the Western chats region of India. The New Zealand example shows that both the direct and maintenance costs of afforesting degraded land can be greater than those for afforesting better land and when the private sector is the major player in afforestation, degraded land will not be taken up for planting, however desirable that might be for other reasons. The Indian example demonstrates that land which appears to be degraded might, in fact, be important to someone's livelihood and the political support for afforestation can be lost unless that implicit right is recognised.

AB The study of forest work allows connections to be drawn between good work, productivity and environmental sustainability. The development of good forest work has generally followed the classic path, entailing higher wages, shorter working hours and less strenuous work; but it has also resulted in growing unemployment, labour market segmentation, flexibilization and environmental degradation. Full cost accounting, all-age forest management, value-added production, community tenures and eco-certification provide a basis for alternative good work and productivity measures. We suggest that forest workers, both in their capacity as workers and residents of forest-industry based communities, constitute potential agents who can embrace and support such alternatives.

AB Electrification of villages from the main grid leads to large investments and losses, and this forms the basis:of decentralized electricity generation. The objective of-the present paper is to evolve different strategies in which the electrical energy demand of various villages of Madhya Pradesh (India) is met at minimum cost by utilizing renewable energy resources, thereby making them self-sustainable in their electrical energy needs.
   The renewable energy technologies considered are biomass based power generation, biogas based power generation and solar photovoltaics. The villages are categorized into five categories on the basis of the resource technology combination capable of meeting their demand at the lowest cost. The demand of villages of category (1) is met by biogas based technology only. The per unit electricity cost (PUEC) of these villages lies between Rs. 4.1 and Rs. 5.7/kW h. For villages of category (2), where demand is met by a combination of biogas and biomass technologies, the PUEC lies in the range Rs. 4.1 to Rs. 5.8/kW h. The PUEC of villages of category (3), where demand is met by biomass based technology only, lies in the range Rs. 4.7 to Rs. 8.2/kW h. The PUEC of villages where demand is met by a combination of biogas, biomass based power generation and PV technology, varies between Rs. 4.7 and Rs. 18.0/kW h (category 4). Category (5) includes those villages that do not have an appreciable amount of biomass or dung, and hence their demand is solely met by PV systems. The PUEC of these villages varies between Rs. 16.1 and Rs. 21.3/kW h. It is found that villages that have good biogas potential correspond to the lowest PUEC. This is sufficient indication for having energy policies in countries, like India, based on bioenergy (biogas and biomass). (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The embodied energy of the four main materials used in the construction of an inert gas filled, double-glazed window, of a given size, was quantified. The four main materials considered were infill gas (argon, krypton and xenon), timber, aluminium and glass. The energy requirements of the underlying manufacturing processes are also estimated for the processing of the finished product. The total embodied energy for argon, krypton and xenon cavity filled windows (1.2 m by 1.2 m standard tilt and turn window), was found to be 1031 MJ, 1539 MJ and 5531 MJ per window, respectively. For argon filled cavities, this leads to the production of 94.7 kg of CO2, 1.2 kg of SO2 and 0.4 kg of NOx per window. The results presented in this paper are initial findings in the first stages of a complete Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) of double-glazed windows for sustainable buildings. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper analyzes the inter-relationship of energy development and environmental constraints in China, It examines the effects of economic development, investment, energy trade and environmental Limitations in shaping energy development, It highlights the tensions between institutions involved in energy development, energy conservation and environmental protection, and concludes that total fuel mix in China will be diversified in the future, The share of coal in primary energy production and consumption will increase in the short time span till 2020, and diminish gradually thereafter, being largely replaced by gas, nuclear and renewables, China will become a big oil importer, due to increase in demand and resource limitations, Meanwhile, coal export will increase in the long run, SO2 and CO2 emissions will become potentially larger in the future, because of the speed of economic growth and lack of effective control measures. Institutional bottlenecks, and political preference to solving local environmental problems, will affect actions to eliminate global environmental risks, There exist huge investment potentials for energy development from both international and domestic private investment funds, Energy efficiency will continue to improve, associated with gradual decline of non-commercial energy use and increasing share of commercial energy in final consumption. Energy conservation holds the key for sustainable energy development, which should be promoted at the national and local levels with demand management as a focus in policy implementation.

AB This paper has been written on the base of Romerio, 1994, which includes 80 pages of references (here we only quote some of them which are particularly significant). A previous version has been published in Energy and economic growth: is sustainable growth possible? Proceedings of the 20th Annual International Conference of the International Association for Energy Economics: New Delhi: Tata Energy Research Institute, 1997, v. III, p. 845-856, We would like to thank the Swiss National Science Foundation who has partially supported this study, as well as Ms. Cheryl Dotti, Ms. Masha Egorova and Ms. Catherine Varfis for their remarks.
   We carry out an evaluation of the risks of nuclear policies from the point of view of security of energy supplies and of the environment, We define a model which helps to explain and evaluate the choice of the nuclear sector, electric utilities and governments. This model takes into consideration the main elements which may restrain nuclear energy development, in particular, electric consumption evolution, production costs, fuel resources, major accidents, disposal of highly radioactive wastes, and development of new technologies allowing to reduce emissions from the coal fired power station. We also examine the problem of the gap existing between "the reality" and "the objectives of the actors", because it allows to understand some energy policy decisions, We examine the risks provoked by energy strategies which try to realise their objectives through an unilateral technological choice. We point out the economic and political advantages of diversification and flexibility. We evoke the importance of objectivity and transparency, This paper intends to be a contribution to discussions on sustainable development and on the future of nuclear energy.

ID PLANNING SYSTEM; FOCUS GROUPS
AB Although a rhetoric of sustainability is now widely used by government, nongovernmental organisations, and business in addressing the public, there is no evidence of a broad shift of behaviour in response to it. Yet most sustainability programmes at international, national, and local levels require broad public participation if they are to reach their goals. We argue that organisational communication with the public is central to defining the form of participation that is expected, and that rhetorical analysis can show relationships that are implicit in these attempts to persuade. We analyse leaflets from a range of organisations to identify some of the elements that are common between them, both in their explicit content and their implied models of participation. Then we analyse the responses in focus groups to these common appeals. Our findings show that the generalised appeals and the rhetoric of crisis tend to distance policy organisations from the immediacy and dailiness of the public's own experiences of and talk about the environment. Because of this distance, the rhetoric does little to encourage participation and practical action.

ID GROWTH
AB Based upon the development of export-oriented industrialization (EOI), Taiwan has undergone a well-known economic miracle, especially since the 1960s when the capitalist world entered a deep Fordist crisis. Nevertheless, the EOI development was imbued with development contradictions, and caused crisis and dysfunction in Taiwan's spatial development and management. The author aims to analyze this crisis and dysfunction from political-economic perspectives, by discerning how the state intervened in spatial development and management along with the development of EOI. As the author demonstrates, the state manipulates the crisis and dysfunction of the planning mechanism to satisfy the political-economic requirements of Taiwan's EOI development. EOI development provided good environments for capital accumulation, but led to poor living conditions, The environmental results have brought Taiwan much wider political, social, and economic tensions, and have made increasingly unlikely the possibility of constructing a social coalition of sustainable development. The author contends that it is time for Taiwan to reorganise the development of EOI before the current crisis becomes destructive.

AB The human population moves to 10-12 billion next century; there is an urgent need for the exact description of the behaviour of all chemical elements in all parts of the Earth system and changes in geochemical cycles induced by human technologies. For many or most earth materials used on massive scales, such as energy systems, mining, agriculture, water treatment, waste systems, such data do not exist. There is an urgent need for geochemists to become involved in the crisis problems of sustainable development and in the development of new clean technologies for the twenty-first century. To solve these complex problems, there is need for teams integrating all the expertise, from the sciences, engineering, social science and economics.

DE selective-sequential extraction; cryoboralfs; soil genesis
AB Recently, there has been considerable interest in categorizing the availability of plant essential nutrients and selected transition metals in the soil environment so as to predict their effects on ecosystem health and the efficacy of potential management practices. Researchers desire to isolate important soil properties, determinant biotic activities and fundamental pedogenic processes that control biogeochemical cycling and are potentially modifiable for the goal of ecosystem sustainability. In a relative sense, a significant portion of this scientific effort has been directed towards temperate and tropical forest ecosystems, with relatively less attention given towards understanding the boreal forest ecosystem. Consequently, an investigation was undertaken near Thompson, Manitoba, to: (1) determine the extent of weathering of the principal soils, (2) employ a selective-sequential chemical extraction method to categorize the soil-chemical fractions responsible for nutrient availability, and (3) infer the importance of selected soil forming processes responsible for soil genesis and nutrient availability. Preliminary findings suggest that nutrient availability is related to the nutrient concentration in the cation exchange fraction and/or to nutrients sequestered by the organic fraction. The metals in the manganese, noncrystalline and crystalline iron oxide fractions may be bound so tightly to these oxides that they are largely unavailable to plants; however, they are largely responsible for buffering the more labile pools against gradually changing vegetational and climatic conditions.

ID PARTICIPATION
AB There are over 2,500 Landcare groups with 65,000 members operating across Australia. With considerable evidence of program impact, Landcare is an important example of state sponsored community participation in natural resource management. However, the authors suggest excessive emphasis has been placed upon attitudinal change-the development of landholder stewardship, as the lever for effecting major changes in land management. Analysis of data from a landholder survey failed to establish predicted stewardship differences between Landcare and nonLandcare respondents or between those who joined early/late, or pairticipated more/less in group activities. And there was no relationship between stewardship and adoption for most of the sustainable agriculture practices surveyed. Further analysis clearly linked Landcare participation and concern about the environmental and economic impacts of land degradation. Whilst respondents were significantly more concerned about economic impacts, research findings were consistent with earlier work indicating that most land managers have a strong stewardship ethic. The authors also suggest that concerns that Landcare is not addressing biodiversity conservation are largely unjustified and reflect urealistic expectations of these voluntary groups.

AB Critical loads (CL) for nitrogen as a nutrient (CLnut,,(N)) and total acidity (CL(S +; N)) for the terrestrial ecosystem have been calculated and evaluated for all NITREX sites. NITREX constitutes a series of N addition or removal experiments in coniferous forest stands and one alpine site across a European deposition gradient (2-60 kgN, ha(-1) yr(-1)). Experimental manipulation of S and N inputs at these sites provides a valuable opportunity to test the validity of the mass balance approach to computing CLs at the ecosystem scale. CLnut,,,(N) values calculated using the sustainability (nutrient limitation) approach were 3-8 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1) for sites on acidic geology, and 19 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1) for sites on basic geology. Where N uptake was estimated using N removed in bolewood, CL values increased to 11-15 kgN ha(-1) yr(-1) at acidic sites. These values will increase further if whole-tree rather than stem-only harvesting is employed and will be greater in areas where stand rotation lengths are relatively short (e.g., UK). Mean annual uptake rates of N into bolewood could not be sustained by available P at any of the sites indicating the probable need for fertiliser applications in the long-term. Problems associated with estimating values for other parameters in the CL equation (N-i(crit), N-de(crit), N-le(crit)) are discussed and preferred approaches identified. CL(S + N) values were computed as 1.7-6.9 keg ha(-1) yr(-1) reflecting differences in weathering rates, deposition and uptake of base cations, and the (Ca + Mg + K)/Al-crit,,, ratio in soil solution for the dominant vegetation. Comparison of ambient deposition loadings and calculated CL values indicated that the sites were in three categories: (1) sites with deposition below both CLnut,,,(N) and CL(S + N) (Sogndal and Alptal), (2) sites where deposition was equal to or exceeded CLnut (N) but not CL(S + N) (Gardsjon, Aber and Klosterhede), and (3) sites in which both CLnut,,,(N) and CL(S + N) were exceeded (Speuld, Selling and Ysselsteyn). Response of soil solution (Ca + Mg + K)/Al ratio following changes in deposition at the sites is discussed with respect to observed ecological changes. Nitrate leaching was positively related to exceedance of CLnut,,,(N) if the larger CLnut,,,(N) values were used, highlighting the importance of this removal pathway for excess N in coniferous forest ecosystems. The study has demonstrated the value of long-term, ecosystem scale experiments if current approaches to calculating CLs are to be rigorously tested. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Sustainable tropical rain forest management is currently the subject of strong interest. There are only a few experimental stations available to research the impact of forest management (especially logging practices) on stand growth, This study develops a quantitative model to describe and simulate the dynamics of an undisturbed stand, as well as a logged uneven-aged, multispecies stand in French Guiana, This is a management-oriented matrix model, It takes into account three main characteristics of the forest dynamics in this type of ecosystem, First, we estimated density-dependence by nonlinear regression of the dynamics parameters (growth, mortality, and ingrowth), Second, a site effect is introduced on the assumption that the stand density in a natural stand is an approximate site characteristic and may help define the steady state corresponding to undisturbed conditions, Third, the very high species diversity is reduced by combining species into five groups based on growth behavior with reference to shade tolerance and maximum potential size. The model has been validated with short-term as well as medium-term projections. It was used to assess the stability of such a stand, We also evaluated the biological sustainability of logging practices, that is, the ability to return to the steady state in terms of total density as well as species composition.

AB It has been suggested that regulatory analysis and regulation theory provide appropriate foundations for the analysis of the sustainability problematic. We accept these claims and in this paper provide an interrogation, founded in the literature on 'real' regulation, of a judicial decision concerning the allocation of water resources to farm irrigation in Northland, Aoteroa/New Zealand. The fact that 'sustainable management' has been inscribed in that country's resource management legislation has given focus to social contests over the meaning and interpretation of sustainability. We outline the legislative fram-work and then provide a description of the contests over the allocation of water to dairy pasture irrigation. Competing interpretations of 'sustainable management' were at the centre of these contests. We then attempt to characterise 'regulatory space'. In the discussion we emphasise the social construction of sustainability and the legitimation of competing interpretations through the courts and other fora. We also refer to the geography of regulation, noting that regulatory processes and their outcomes are defined spatially. Lefebvre's concept of representational space and the Lefebvrian and Foucaultian notion of sites of resistance help us to interrogate competing perspectives on sustainability.

AB The decade of the 1990s has seen an awakening understanding by the global community of the importance of freshwater for societal and environmental vitality. In 1994, the Scientific Committee on Water Research (SCOWAR) was established by the International Council for Scientific Unions (ICSU) to address frontier freshwater-related science issues. This paper is SCOWAR's review of current trends and burning needs in selected areas of water resources research. The key future concerns to be served by the results of the research brought under review by SCOWAR are identified as equitable sharing of water resources and demand management, soil moisture for agriculture, water and health, ecological consequences of hydrological change, and improving data collection and assessment. SCOWAR also perceives immediate intellectual challenges in a number of other areas, such as, inter alia, multiple-scale problems, sustainability of reservoirs, dynamics of freshwater ecosystems. There is a general recognition that unavailability of water in sufficient quality and quantity has been and will continue to be an increasingly important constraint on socio-economic development. But the situation is not the same all over the world. SCOWAR is concerned that much of the increased pressure occurs and will occur in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa where high population growth and the desire to improve living standards expand water requirements.

AB The scope and scale of industrialization apparently have progressed to a stage where the base of the engineering sciences must now be expanded beyond the realm of distinct industrial and agricultural technologies to the realm of industrial ecosystems, in which discrete technologies are characterized as design and innovation parameters in organized networks of economic production and consumption processes. The presumed objective of industrial ecosystem design and innovation is to efficiently and economically deploy natural and industrial resources with minimal risks to the integrity of significant natural processes of the biosphere. Mathematical tools for such an expansion derive from the premise that, for given intervals of time, industrial and natural ecosystems and their interactions can be characterized by hierarchies of bounded networks of biotic and abiotic resource acquisition, conversion, and transfer processes. The hierarchies illustrated in this paper range from modular networks of production technologies in manufacturing and refining to food chains and sequential products to biological communities and industrial production networks to product life cycles and beyond.
   The ecology of each resource conversion process within a bounded network of processes is characterized mathematically in terms of the principles of material and energy balance, with energy as one of many biotic and abiotic enabling factors of resource acquisition, conversion, and transfer that are ecologically quantified and monetarily priced. Design equations are developed that map the ecologies of bounded networks of ecological processes into the ecology of the network at its boundary, thereby providing operational procedures for mathematically defining hierarchial network structures. At the lowest level of ecological organization, all constituent network processes are observable first-order natural processes or engineered technologies.
   The economics of a given industrial enterprise are evaluated as an explicit mathematical function of its network of production technologies, its ecological organization, and its ecological boundary prices; thereby providing procedures for the coordinated design, management, and accounting of its technological, ecological. and economic dimensions at hierarchial levels of organization from factory floors and farms to corporate levels and beyond. Sustainable industrialization is shown to be achievable through on-line, risk-control pricing mechanisms.

AB The linear relationship between work accomplished (W-lim) and time to exhaustion (t(lim)) can be described by the equation: W-lim = a + CP.t(lim). Critical power (CP) is the slope of this line and is thought to represent a maximum rate of ATP synthesis without exhaustion, presumably an inherent characteristic of the aerobic energy system. The present investigation determined whether the choice of predictive tests would elicit significant differences in the estimated CP. Ten female physical education students completed, in random order and on consecutive days, five art-out predictive tests at preselected constant-power outputs. Predictive tests were performed on an electrically-braked cycle ergometer and power loadings were individually chosen so as to induce fatigue within approximately 1-10 mins. CP was derived by fitting the linear W-lim-t(lim) regression and calculated three ways: 1) using the first, third and fifth W-lim-t(lim) coordinates (I-135), 2) using coordinates from the three highest power outputs (I-123; mean t(lim) = 68-193 s) and 3) using coordinates from the lowest power outputs (I-345; mean t(lim) = 193-485 s). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that CPI123 (201.0 +/- 37.9W) > CPI135 (176.1 +/- 27.6W) > CPI345 (164.0 +/- 22.8W) (P < 0.05). When the three sets of data were used to fit the hyperbolic Power-t(lim) regression, statistically significant differences between each CP were also found (P < 0.05). The shorter the predictive trials, the greater the slope of the W-lim-t(lim) regression; possibly because of the greater influence of 'aerobic inertia' on these trials. This may explain why CP has failed to represent a maximal, sustainable work rate. The present findings suggest that if CP is to represent the highest power output that an individual can maintain "for a very long time without fatigue" then CP should be calculated over a range of predictive tests in which the influence of aerobic inertia is minimised.

AB 1. We evaluated the potential of small, isolated cornfields embedded in a large forest matrix as an appropriate compromise between conservation and sustainable development.
   2. We examined the relationship between habitat structure and diversity with overall mammal species richness and abundance of six common small mammals in four 6-year-old abandoned cornfields (oldfields) and four continuous rainforest sites in the most speciose region in Mexico, the Selva Lacandona, Chiapas.
   3. Species richness did not differ between forests and oldfields, indicating that forest-dependent mammals penetrate oldfields of size 0.9-2.9 ha, presumably because forest cover and resources are nearby. Even species which strongly selected forest habitat, such as H. desmarestianus and D. marsupialis, were present in oldfields, and only the latter showed a significant decline in the number of captures as a function of distance from forest edge.
   4. The Lacandon Indian use of the land for agriculture in the form of small (> 3 ha) agricultural plots embedded in a large forest matrix increases spatial heterogeneity and promotes mammal diversity.
   5. Those small plots tin agricultural production terms) are intermediate in size when the whole continuum of the local natural and anthropogenic disturbance sizes are considered; more common are the extensive clearings for agriculture or cattle ranching, whereas the most common forest disturbance is treefall gaps, at least 20 times smaller than oldfields.
   6. This form of land use should be considered as an important, appropriate productive element when decisions are made about managing reserves and pursuing sustainable development.

AB 1. The demography of the vegetable ivory palm Phytelephas seemannii was studied on the Pacific coast of Colombia and a female-based matrix model was used to determine the proportion of seed that can be sustainably harvested from the population.
   2. The density of the palm stands ranged from 240 to 420 adult palms ha(-1). The sex ratio was 1:1 and palms of both sexes produced leaves at the same rate. Seedlings produced 1.2 leaves per year on average, juveniles 1.8, and adults 6.1--7.4.
   3. Adult females had fewer leaves than males (18.5 vs. 21.3 on average). Leaves of females lasted about 2.7 years in the crown, those of males about 3.2 years.
   4. Stems creep on the ground, growing at the apex and often dying behind, the extant portion not always reflecting the palm's total age. The longest stem of a female palm in the study plots was 2.5 m, corresponding to an 'extant' age of 85 years; the longest stem recorded was that of a male (outside the plots) 10.5 m In long, corresponding to an 'extant' age of 184 years. These figures reflect differences in growth habit, not in longevity.
   5. Reproduction began at about 24 years, when the palm still lacked an above-ground stem.
   6. The population growth rate lambda was 1.059, and was most sensitive to changes in survival of juveniles and adults, and relatively insensitive to changes in fecundity and growth.
   7. River channel migration is the most important cause of adult mortality. Phytelephas seemannii is apparently an efficient colonizer of the understorey in the late phases of riverine forest succession.
   8. The population call tolerate a harvest intensity of 86% of all seeds before lambda decreases to the equilibrium level of 1.00. Monitoring of the populations under intensive harvesting is required.

ID REAL EXCHANGE-RATE; WHEELS; SAND
AB This paper studies capital controls policy from an intertemporal perspective. Using a small, open economy model with optimizing agents, it derives a policy rule which conforms real-world stylized facts and is sustainable in the long run. In particular, it explicitly models the constraints on the policy rule implied by the dynamics of the economy.
   Studying several prevalent policy experiments, it is demonstrated that significant real effects are generated by the interaction between controls policy and traditional policy tools. This happens as controls affect agents' intratemporal asset allocation and intertemporal consumption patterns. The use of controls enlarges the set of possible outcomes, generating some 'non-traditional' results. The analysis points to new tradeoffs and hence new dilemmas faced by a government that uses controls.

AB As in many other countries, indigenous forests on private land in New Zealand have long been vulnerable to commercial logging and clearance for agriculture and exotic forestry. The 1990s are a potential watershed in achieving sustainable management of this resource. The Government has recently adopted an indigenous forest policy (IFP) with this objective in mind and enacted appropriate legislation [the Forests Amendment Act 1993 (FAA)] as the principal means to implement the IFP.
   The objective of this paper is to analyse the potential of this significant recent environment policy initiative as a means for sustainable management of privately owned indigenous forests from two complementary perspectives:
   an analysis of the new regime for sustainable management of indigenous forests as prescribed in the legislation.
   based on this, a case study of the views of Western Southland forest owners on the ability of the new regime to achieve its objectives. Although the Western Southland landscape has been substantially modified by agriculture and logging, it still retains a significant proportion of indigenous forest cover with silver beech (Nothofagus menziesii) as the predominant species. Beeches are considered the most suited of New Zealand's indigenous forest species to manage for timber production using the methods of sustainable yield management (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

   STRATEGIES; BRAND; PRICE
AB Although pioneers outsell late movers in many markets, in some cases innovative late entry has produced some remarkably successful brands that outsell pioneers, The mechanisms through which innovative late movers outsell pioneers are unclear, To identify these mechanisms, the authors develop a brand-level model in which brand sales are decomposed into trials and repeat purchases. The model captures diffusion and marketing mix effects on brand trials and includes the differential impacts of innovative and noninnovative competitors' diffusion on these effects. The authors develop hypotheses on how the diffusion and marketing mix parameters of the brands differ by market entry strategy (pioneering, innovative late entry, and noninnovative late entry), The authors test these hypotheses using data from 13 brands in two pharmaceutical product categories. The results show that an innovative late mover can create a sustainable advantage by enjoying a higher market potential and a higher repeat purchase rate than either the pioneer or noninnovative late movers, growing faster than the pioneer, slowing the pioneer's diffusion, and reducing the pioneer's marketing spending effectiveness. Innovative late movers are advantaged asymmetrically in that their diffusion can hurt the sales of other brands, but their sales are not affected by competitors' diffusion. In contrast, noninnovative late movers face smaller potential markets, lower repeat rates, and less marketing effectiveness compared with the pioneer.

AB Environmental systems are inherently unstable over time-scales appropriate to planning and management. As knowledge relating to rivers and their floodplains increases, uncertainty is increased rather than decreased. As the limits of what is known become defined, a better appreciation of what is not known is gained.
   The creation of wildlife habitats in rivers and on floodplains has been referred to as an art rather than a science. This paper highlights some of the many questions which remain unanswered as environmental managers strive for more sustainable and cost-effective projects.

AB The researches on Environmentally Conscious Materials (abbr. as Ecomaterials) and Environmentally Conscious Products (abbr. as Eco-products) received great attention worldwide in recent years, because the researches are directly related to the sustainable development of world's society and economy. Ferroelectrics and related materials are very important materials, which have wide applications in various fields. From Ecomaterials points of view, it seems that there are a lot of work in ferroelectrics researches to be done in the near future. In this paper, the concept of environmentally conscious ferroelectrics (abbr. as Eco-ferroelectrics), and the evaluation of the preparation, processing, and application of ferroelectrics on environmental load are proposed, the present status of Eco-ferroelectrics is outlined, and some future research work for promoting Eco-ferroelectrics studies is suggested.

ID SEA TURTLE; SUCCESS
AB Mortality factors and hatching success of 422 terecay turtle (Podocnemis unifilis) nests on seven beaches in the Nichare and Tawadu Rivers, Venezuela, were studied following the oviposition phase. Beaches (3.4-28.4 km(2)), predominantly sandy, and bordered by riparian vegetation, were searched to record nest numbers and their distribution. Elevation and surrounding plant cover were measured for each nest. Most nests were found close to the vegetation's edge (0-11 m), at a significant distance from the water's edge (21-80 m), in more open ground, and along the highest points of the beach (1-3.i m above the water's edge). Nest density was positively correlated with beach elevation but not with beach dimensions. Most nests were concentrated in less than 10% of beach area, along the upper 20% of the beach. Average clutch size was 20.1+/-1.7 eggs, but larger clutches were found significantly further away from vegetation. No significant correlation between hatching success and clutch size was found.
   A large proportion of nests were subject to animal and human predation but environmental factors (especially flooding) affected some. The major cause of egg loss was human predation. Most clutches collected by humans were found away from vegetation, on the upper 10-20% of beaches, in exposed unvegetated sites. Animals preyed upon those nests along the vegetation's margin (1-2 m) in the upper 0-9% of beaches, in sites of high plant cover (75-100%). Nests reaching the incubation phase were mainly located in the open areas, which are more prone to human predation. About three-quarters of nests showed high hatching rates (91-100%). However, hatchability was highest furthest away from the vegetation. Our results indicate that humans are collecting eggs mostly from sites in which nests have the larger clutches and the higher potential hatching success. Because of this relationship between nest viability and location, sustainable yield programmes must consider where harvesting can take place and must avoid the application of standard harvests per nest.

AB A simple game formulation is used to examine the possibility of linking generations when a future generation will confront a risk that can be alleviated by an earlier generation's investment. An insurance market will function provided that the overlapping generations are sufficiently near in time and share risks. Without propinquity or shared risks, there is a need for intervention to overcome the problems of missing markets and missing voters. This intervention should rake the form of minimum environmental standards, based on a notion of sustainability that is constitutionally enforced.

AB The controversy between "petro-polymers" and "green polymers" is a false one. Polymers synthesized by organisms, manipulated or not, are seen as green. Polymers based on cracker products, so called petro-polymers, are considered to be environmentally unfriendly. Arguments used in favour of "natural" polymers are: biodegradability, renewable resources, recyclability, non waste producing etc. We think that several of these arguments are incorrect or irrelevant. Furthermore, we are convinced that petro-polymers might move substantially towards a sustainable situation. It might seem strange, but the most important steps towards such a situation have to be made not in the field of petro-polymers themselves but in the domain of energy supply.

AB Starch-gel electrophoresis of allozymes was used to differentiate the two red mullet species (Mullus barbatus L. and ill. surmuletus L.) in the Mediterranean Sea and, further, to investigate the genetic stock structure of M. barbatus in the eastern Mediterranean area. Twenty putative enzyme-coding loci were examined in eight M. barbatus samples caught in the Aegean and Ionian Seas (Greece) and in the Gulf of Lion (France), and two M. surmuletus samples caught in the Aegean and Gulf of Lion. A high degree of genetic polymorphism was found in both species. Species-specific electrophoretic patterns were found in PGI* and PGM*. Estimates of variance of allele frequencies among samples (F-ST) and chi(2) analyses both revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) among the hi. barbatus samples. Mast of the genetic variation was among samples regardless of region. The mean value of Nei's genetic distance between the two species was 0.329. Genetic distance among M. barbatus samples was low (maximum Nei's D = 0.012), with the sample from Platania differing most from other M. barbatus samples. This is probably be due to founder effects existing at this area. These results suggest that allozyme analysis may provide important information on the genetic structure of the red mullet to ensure sustainable management of this species.

AB The knowledge of local resource users and managers about the biophysical, socioeconomic, and cultural-historical elements of their immediate environment plays a significant role in determining the long-term sustainability of those resources. This paper reports on the results of two case studies from high mountain areas, one in the Upper Beas River watershed of the Indian Himalaya, and the other in the Arrow Lakes area of the Canadian Cordillera. Specifically, this paper describes sustainability indicators which were enumerated by local people in two differing cultural-historical, but environmentally similar, contexts. These indicators may be reflective of local, indigenous knowledge about the environment and therefore may be of significance in impact assessment and monitoring environmental change.
   Results from the Upper Beas watershed reveal a highly discriminated set of indicators which may be grouped as: forest cover indicators; forest-linked indicators; forest management indicators; agricultural livelihood indicators; and socioeconomic indicators. Local people demonstrated a very precise knowledge of the state of the biophysical resources of their village use areas. Specific indicators identified include: forest cover area (decreasing), forest species diversity (some species such as deodar decreasing), forest tree density (decreasing), consistency of water flow (decreasing) and frequency of avalanches and slides (increasing). These are all indicators which can be measured and verified independently of local knowledge. All suggest declining sustainability. Residents in the Arrow Lakes area demonstrated much less precise knowledge of biophysical indicators of sustainability. They enumerated a set of indicators which emphasized institutional arrangements for forest and resource management. For example, few respondents identified the extent of forest cover as important whereas the majority identified forest/land use rules in place as being important indicators of sustainability. in both case studies, people mentioned a number of socioeconomic factors as being important indicators of sustainability.

AB One of the most important aspects of a complex common property resource is the collective-action right to decide how the resource will be defined and used. Throughout the history of the Black Kills National Forest, there has been a community of people interested in exercising the right to define and redefine it as a resource. By using a common property resource framework, this paper focuses on the role of the forest community-those people who were able to exercise the right to define the resource-in sustaining the forest as a multiple-use resource. The composition of the forest community had a direct impact on the sustainability of the Black Kills National Forest as a multiple-use resource. In periods when a forest community was actively engaged in preserving its multiple-use character, the forest has flourished. Without a forest community to focus on the multiple-use definition, single users competed with each other without regard for the impact of their uses on the forest as a whole, leading to the degradation of the forest.

AB Since the Age of Enlightenment, modernization has taken the form of a parallel growth of the significance of both the state and the individual, at the expense of the intermediary or secondary groups or collectives of various kinds. With a modern notion of over-burdening and high transaction costs of the mature state and a disrupting alienation of the individual, the search for institutional solutions that are "neither market, nor state," has intensified in both academia and bureaucracies. However, such : efforts often clash with many of the values of modern Western society. In Northern Norway, the political struggle over the reintroduction of Commons Law for Mountain Areas revealed some of these contradictions. This example also shows why many sub-optimal solutions in modern resource management are favored because of the value attached to individual freedom and equal treatment by the state; even when these contradict the sustainable governing of a resource. In contrast, institutional designs based on smaller collectives are perceived as less attractive because they involve less individual freedom, more duties and more inequality. The lessons are used for a discussion of the role of common property institutions in the process of modernisation.

TI Power generation for the twenty-first century: what role for nuclear?
SO NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE energy; sustainability; nuclear
AB A key element of the sustainable development challenge is meeting the world's future energy needs. With increasing industrialization in the developing world, the demand for electricity is growing. This has important implications for the security of supply of resources and environmental impacts. These issues bear especially on the continued use of fossil fuels for power generation. While there is uncertainty about ultimate fossil fuel reserves, they are finite and there must be concerns over the long-term security of supply. Perhaps of greater significance is the impact of increasing fossil use on the emission of greenhouse gases and the associated threat of global warming. While the need to give higher priority to increased efficiency, particularly in energy use is clear, it is necessary also to look to the increased use of non-fossil sources for power generation. This points to the future role for nuclear, which is the main focus for the present paper. The paper examines critically the barriers to the further development and wider use of nuclear power and their resolution. This is of vital importance if nuclear is to fulfil its potential in meeting the objectives of sustainable development.

AB The changes in Late Quaternary vegetation at two sites in the Tari Basin, central highlands of New Guinea, are presented. Haeapugua basin (1650 m altitude) and Tugupugua basin (2300 m altitude) lie within the lower montane forest belt, where the climate is characterised by high relative humidity and low seasonality. Pollen analysis, mineral magnetics, carbonised particle analysis, and dating by radiocarbon and thermoluminescence techniques are employed to reconstruct the vegetation and sediment history. The sequences include fragmentary interglacial/interstadial records from before 50,000 yr B.P. and a continuous record from al least 28,000 yr B.P. to the present. The study shows that, prior to 21,000 yr B.P., vegetation in the basin was dominated by fluctuating proportions of tree taxa indicative of a forested environment. The montane forest taxon, Nothofagus, is important throughout the record, although other tree taxa, including Castanopsis, Myrtaceae, Dacrydium and Pandanus, attain dominance at different times under the influence of a range of environmental factors. The creation of an open environment around 21,000 yr B.P, is considered to be a consequence of the arrival of humans in the region. The late glacial transition, between 14,500 and 8500 yr B.P., is a period of climatic instability with landscape and vegetation adjustments proceeding at different rates across the highlands. Vegetational adjustments match modern ranges by about 8500 yr B.P., when swamp forest developed across the sites, At the lower altitude site there are indications of anthropogenic forest disturbance, associated with swamp forest clearance: commencing around 1700 yr B.P. and intensifying through to the present. Forest clearance is recorded only after 700 yr B.P, at the higher site, where agriculture was probably only sustainable after the introduction of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas).

ID ACID FOREST SOIL; NITRIFICATION; POPULATION
AB A Most Probable Number (MPN) method was developed allowing for the first time estimation of populations of bacteria capable of heterotrophic nitrification. The method was applied to an acidic soil of a coniferous forest exhibiting nitrate production. In this soil nitrate production was unlikely to be catalyzed by autotrophic nitrifiers, since autotrophic ammonia oxidizers never could be detected, and autotrophic nitrite oxidizers were usually not found in appreciable cell numbers. The developed MPN method is based on the demonstration of the presence/absence of nitrite/nitrate produced by heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria during growth in a complex medium (peptone-meat-extract softagar medium) containing low concentrations of agar (0.1%). Bath the supply of the growing cultures in MPN test tubes with sufficient oxygen and the presence of low agar concentrations in the medium were found to be favourable for sustainable nitrite/nitrate production. The results demonstrate that in the acidic forest soil the microbial population capable of heterotrophic nitrification represents a significant part of the total aerobic heterotrophic population. By applying the developed MPN method, several bacterial strains of different genera not previously described to perform heterotrophic nitrification have been isolated from the soil and have been identified by bacterio-diagnostic tests.

AB A comparative analysis is given of the history of the three main forms of surface transport in the UK: the canal, railway, and car/road systems. There are common features in each of these systems, in terms of growth, technology utilization, and eventual decline. The analysis suggests that the era of dominance of surface transport by the automobile is now drawing to an end, and that it is reasonable to expect a new form of transport to come into being, involving new vehicles matched to a new infrastructure, and designed to meet new requirements, notably the issues of sustainability.

AB With the historical change of the socio-economic system in ex-communist European countries quality of life of the population changed dramaticaly, improving in some components and within certain social strata and deteriorationg in others. These changes are analysed within the framework of authentic development and quality of life components: economic, social, political, environmental, cultural and human. The major aspect of the changes is the enlargement of human choices in all of the components, and to different extents in different countries in transition. The future of the whole transition process lies in its sustainablity and ability to draw on its past experience as well as on the experience of the Western world.

AB Basing his comments around a report on the Space Power Systems 1997 conference,'Energy and Space for Humanity', held in Montreal, 24-28 August 1997, Richard Boudreault describes the progress made in getting the concept of power from space accepted by the terrestrial utilities. Increasing worries about the sustainability of current power sources together with deregulation of power distribution make space power more attractive. However, the high cost of access to space is a barrier, though this is starting to fall. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SYSTEMS
AB The World Watch Institute believes that environmental destruction, decrease of biodiversity, high energy and water consumption, in addition to the enormous demand for fodder cereals resulting in negative effects of modern animal production, are indicative symptoms of an ecological decline. In the future, therefore, animal breeding will have to be an integral part of a mole sustainable agricultural development. The sustainability of agricultural systems can be assessed using criteria such as diversity, quality of nutrient cycles, stability and capacity. The ecological reasons for a turn of events in livestock breeding carl be derived from these. Specialised livestock breeding, concentrating a small number-of highly productive breeds, endangers livestock diversity. A system comprising maximum performance at ally price leads to high external input systems. It is becoming increasingly important how milk, meat and eggs have been produced and therefore new criteria of food quality, including their ecological and ethical value, are required. Longevity and fitness also have to be recognised as important breeding objectives. In this context, animal health has to be considered as much more than just the absence of disease. A reference to the necessary change of livestock breeding is included in the draft of the EU directives concerning organic animal husbandry.

AB European legislation imposes tough restrictions on the quality of landfill leachate discharges, of which a major component is ammonia. Thus, there is a pressing need, particularly for operators who will have to meet these discharge standards, for a greater understanding of the origin and transformations of ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds from landfills. Moreover, with the concept of 'sustainability' being applied to landfilling, the industry will need to meet the challenge of accelerating the rate of refuse decomposition. Ammonia is both a potentially toxic product of refuse degradation and an essential nutrient for the bacteria responsible for this. The quantities present in municipal solid waste (MSW) are known but prediction of the amounts released during decomposition is hampered by the lack of long term data on ammonia concentrations in leachate either from landfills or experimental systems with a measured initial nitrogen content.
   For the treatment of ammonia from landfill regimes designed to accelerate refuse degradation, it is vital to understand the nitrogen requirements of the degradation processes, in order to minimise potential ammonia toxicity while ensuring sufficient concentrations to support the rate of decomposition. The authors found little experimental evidence to support current views on the nitrogen transformations that occur in MSW, although new experimental data support the hypothesis that denitrification occurs in landfill sites. It is generally considered that the high ammonia concentrations in leachate provide evidence that ammonia is released from the decomposition of protein in refuse, even though the concentrations of the various nitrogenous components in refuse during decomposition are not known. Although the concentrations of nitrogenous components in leachate have been characterised, these do not necessarily reflect the degradation of MSW.

AB As the magnitude of human impacts on the ecological systems of the planet becomes apparent, there is increased realization of the intimate connections between these systems and human health, the economy, social justice, and national security. The concept of what constitutes "the environment" is changing rapidly. Urgent and unprecedented environmental and social changes challenge scientists to define a new social contract. This contract represents a commitment on the part of all scientists to devote their energies and talents to the most pressing problems of the day, in proportion to their importance, in exchange for public funding. The new and unmet needs of society include more comprehensive information, understanding, and technologies for society to move toward a more sustainable biosphere-one which is ecologically sound, economically feasible, and socially just. New fundamental research, faster and more effective transmission of new and existing knowledge to policy-and decision-makers, and better communication of this knowledge to the public will all be required to meet this challenge.

AB The existing methods for CCS No7 link availability calculation do not take the observed signalling traffic model (i.e. offered load and MSU's length distribution) into consideration. This introduces a problem in their use in accurately prescribing the sustainable BER value. The authors present an improved method, which takes the offered load influence into consideration.

AB Genetic resources of the species of animals of interest to farmers underpin both immediate and longer term food and agricultural production and the critical sustainable intensification of this throughout the world's broad range of available production environments. The current state of these now essentially irreplaceable genetic resources is the result of up to 12 millennia of domestication processes, together with the more abrupt activity during the twentieth century. Key influences are summarized, as are the present and future developments by humans that are likely to impact on the characterization, use and development, conservation and access to those remaining resources. The imperatives for their management by wise use, together with a mechanism being developed to assist countries and all stakeholders to realize these imperatives, are outlined. The need for this sustainable intensification for at least the next century will focus the genetic resource management effort on understanding the nature of the Earth's primary production environments and on the use and development of resources that are already adapted to particular environments. The interests of all peoples will be best served by particular immediate action in the lower input, higher stress agro-ecosystems, which currently account for the majority of the world's farm animal genetic resources and the majority now at risk, together with providing the majority of food and agriculture now and continuing to do so throughout the twenty-first century. It is these lower input, higher stress production environments and their associated adapted animal genetic resources that now pose the major issues for research, training and development associated with utilizing the farm animal gene pool.

AB Livestock breeding goals have to be orientated towards the future, firstly because breeding schemes can lead to substantial genetic changes and reduction in biodiversity over time, and secondly because there is a time lag between selection decisions and when the genetic changes from these decisions are utilized. Consequently, it is impossible to define appropriate breeding goals without an idea about future market and production circumstances. Since human needs and demands for animal products are expected to double during the next 30 years, production traits should be given first priority, but greater emphasis should be given to the utilization of resources, and environmental and welfare aspects of animal production. In dairy cattle breeding secondary traits such as health, longevity, persistency and calving performance are expected to be important in the future. The use of target breeding goals for a few secondary traits in combination with an aggregate economic goal for the primary traits seems a worthwhile consideration. It is suggested that the use of new reproduction technologies e.g. (transfer of sexed embryos) and strategies may change the primary goal from 305-day to 1000-day lactation records.

With a view to facilitating better global use of dairy cattle genetics, the international committee INTERBULL was developed in 1983. In 1991, the INTERBULL Centre was established in Uppsala as an operational unit with a primary mandate to research, develop and conduct international genetic evaluations of dairy bulls. Such evaluations started in 1994 in the Nordic countries. By 1997, there were 22 countries subscribing to this service. Nearly 90000 bulls of six breeds are evaluated for production traits across countries twice a year. INTERBULL evaluations have had a large impact on the accuracy of selecting bulls across countries, but also on development of national evaluation methods. Application of the Multiple Across-Country Evaluation (MACE) method contributes to more sustainable breeding programmes, as bulls are ranked for each country's needs using this method. More emphasis needs to be placed on development of international genetic evaluations for health and reproduction traits. INTERBULL is expected to play an increasingly important role in future dairy cattle breeding through its status as an independent body networking globally with scientists and industry workers.

AB For many years, health and other functional traits have been included as part of the Nordic breeding goal, mainly due to their cost-effectiveness but also for their ethical worth, although this has never been expressed in terms of economics. The main problem in improving animal welfare is the progressively rising costs of higher desirable levels of additional animal welfare. The Nordic breeding goal is examined in the light of sustainability and welfare criteria, and milk production is evaluated in terms of these criteria. The genetic response in Finnish dairy cattle is reviewed and compared to other breeding populations. Increased cooperation between countries would minimize the risk and maximize the genetic response in the Nordic breeding programmes. By improving the economic efficiency of Scandinavian red cattle populations, the possibility of economic production in the northern areas of Europe is improved.

ID GENETIC-IMPROVEMENT; EMBRYO TRANSFER
AB The genetic implications of reproduction technologies in farm animals and poultry, excluding cattle, are reviewed. The benefits to be expected from the current technologies, artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer (ET), can be simply modelled on the basis of the reproductive parameters of each species, e.g. age at first offspring, dam fecundity and mating ratio. The benefits for genetic improvement from AI and ET are in inverse proportion to the reproductive potential of the species. In practice, AI is the only reproductive technology currently used in the species considered here, and it is being used in more and more species. However, the contribution of Al to genetic improvement is generally small and consequently its potentially negative impact on within-breed genetic variability is also limited. Gamete and embryo technologies have an important role to play in the maintenance of genetic diversity, though the potential of cryopreservation is not yet fully exploited in most species. Prospective applications of new techniques-such as in vitro production of embryos, nuclear transfer and semen sexing-are discussed briefly.

This study proves the antimicrobial activities of the stem bark on Microsporum gypseum, Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophylon rubrum and Candida albicans. The leaves of this plant show the same activities. These facts confirm P, suberosa stem bark traditional uses and establish that the leaves of this plant can be used for sustainable utilisation of this species in order to preserve it from disappearance.

AB The aim of this study is to compare biodiversity in contrasted landscape units within a st-nail region. In western France agricultural intensification leads to changes in landscape structure: permanent grasslands are ploughed, fields enlarged and surrounding hedgerows removed or deteriorated, brooks are straightened and cleaned. South of Mount Saint Michel Bay, four landscape units have been identified along an intensification gradient. Several taxonomic groups (small mammals, birds, insects and plants) have been used to evaluate the characteristics of biodiversity along this gradient. The hypothesis that intensification of agricultural practices lead to changes in biodiversity has been rested. Biodiversity is measured by the species richness. Shannon's diversity index. equitability and similarity indexes. Our results show that intensification of agriculture does not always lead to a decrease in species richness, but to several functional responses according to taxonomic groups. either no modification, or stability by replacement of species, or loss of species. For most of the studied taxonomic groups species richness does not vary greatly alone the gradient. Depending on the landscape structure and farming systems this gradient is probably truncated and does not allow to show major changes in species richness. An alternative hypothesis is that used indexes are not sensitive enough to reveal changes in biodiversity. Nevertheless, similarity indexes reveal that sensitivity to changes varies, invertebrates being more likely to perceive the dynamics of the landscapes studied than vertebrates or plants. These points have to be taken into consideration when elaborating policies for sustainable agriculture or nature conservation (C) Elsevier, Paris.

AB The worldwide increasing energy consumption depends largely on fossil resources and is not sustainable. Section 1 starts with a reflection on this precarious situation as an introduction to a recently proposed possibility of a thorium-fueled sub-critical reactor driven by a proton accelerator. In contrast with reactors fueled with uranium, breeding with thorium can offer clean and inexhaustible commercial energy. The following sections are devoted to feasibility, to non-proliferation aspects, incineration and transmutation, and to further FEA-stimulated studies.

AB Modern deer farming systems have become increasingly intensive allowing strategic feeding for production and genetic improvement programmes. Meeting feeding standards that account for changing nutritional demands related to seasonality and reproductive state is critical. As the industry matures there is a growing awareness of the balance between retaining natural behaviour in producing breeding stock on larger extensive holdings and intensification systems for performance in young stock. Stocking rates are critical determinants of success as land use and capability needs are matched with an increasing stratification of stock type and purpose. Food product safety and welfare considerations of farmed deer are being driven by consumer demands. Farm quality assurance and codes of practice are developing to ensure that deer farming meets and exceeds international expectations of land use and deer welfare in modern deer farming systems.

AB "Isolating mechanisms" and "sustainable advantage" are two constructs that have traditionally formed the cornerstones of business strategy. These constructs evoke images of firms isolating themselves and their technologies from others in order to sustain a monopoly position. In today's networked environments, we propose that a polar set of constructs-"linkages" and "transience"-be considered as a part of the strategy lexicon. We explicate these notions by examining strategic interactions between Netscape and Microsoft in the Internet browser field.

AB A research assignment to reduce nitrogen outputs from land use systems was worked out within a research team from 1992 to 1995. Twenty-two representative fields and two reference farms were chosen as an experimental basis. These tools served to analysis and concept of sustainable land use in the water shed of the Warnow river in a range of 187500 hectare.
   N-balances refered to fields and crop rotations, set aside areas and the location were deduced from the analysis of the reference fields as important figure of influence on the nutrient outputs.
   As a result of analytical investigations the water shed of the Warnow river was subdivided into thirteen land use zones. Therefore data of location like soil type, ground water conditions and inclination were combined with a GIS. Exhaustive sustainable, specific models, land use systems, arable crops, reference numbers of soil fertility and balances of nutrients were proposed as elements and criteria of assessment of farming.

   livestock
AB On a global basis, livestock products - meat, milk, eggs and fibre - account for 40% of the value of total marketed agricultural product. Animal products provide essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals to help ensure nutritionally balanced diets. In developing countries, livestock traction and manure also contribute to food production through improved cultivation and soil fertility which increase crop yields. On average, the proportional contribution of livestock product to dietary calories and protein in developed countries is double that for developing countries. Demand for livestock products is fuelled by the population increase, income growth and urbanisation in developing countries. Therefore, over the past decade, consumption of livestock product has sharply increased in developing countries, while slightly decreasing in developed countries where consumption is already relatively high on average. Increased demand in developing countries increases income for producers, but also stresses the environment through pollution, soil erosion, overgrazing and deforestation. Research involving global partnerships of scientists and institutes can help ensure that the increased demands for livestock product in developing countries will be met in economically feasible and environmentally sustainable ways.

AB This article uses material from many extensive research projects starting from the construction of the electric power supply network and its water supply systems in northern Finland in 1973-1986, to the Agropolis agricultural strategy and networking for the Loimijoki project. A list of the material and references of the publications is available in Agronet on the Internet. All these projects applied integrated environmental research covering biology, the natural sciences, social sciences, and planning methodology. To be able to promote sustainable agriculture and rural development there is a pressing need to improve research methodology and applications for integrated environmental research. This article reviews the philosophy and development of the theory behind integrated environmental research and the theory of network economy.

AB The relationships among winter cover cropping. inoculum potential of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi, and the growth and yield of a subsequent maize crop were investigated. In the first experiment, an autumn-sown winter wheat cover crop increased VAM fungal inoculum potential of a field soil as measured by an in situ maize bioassay during the following growing season. Infective extra-radical hyphal densities were significantly increased by cover cropping as interpreted from the effect of soil disturbance on infection of the maize bioassay plants. In a second experiment the following year, the winter wheat cover crop again increased VAM fungal inoculum potential as assessed by an in situ maize bioassay during the following growing season. Moreover, the degree of mycorrhizal infection of maize was correlated with maize growth and yield. This study suggests that the management of mycorrhizal fungi by cover cropping may be a useful practice in sustainable agriculture. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Agroforestry systems usually are examined for their biological components and somewhat for economic feasibility but rarely for their sociocultural merits. A relatively young agroforestry system was examined in view of sociocultural, biological, and economic factors through the use of decision matrices. Decision criteria were used to evaluate an agroforestry system against two alternative landuse options, a corn-soybean rotation and renting the land to an agricultural producer. Economic, sociocultural, environmental, and risk criteria were considered simultaneously with a scaled Z-statistic and then compared by using four weighting schemes. When all criteria were weighted equally, the agroforestry system had the greatest Z-score (3.4), indicating the better alternative. Placing weights on economic criteria resulted with renting the land being the best alternative (Z-score 6.6). When sociocultural factors were weighted alone, or when greater weights were placed on sociocultural factors along with moderate weights on economic and risk factors, or when community weighted objectives were used, the introduced agroforestry system had the greatest Z- scores (11.5, 6.3, and 1.1, respectively). Use of weighted decision criteria allowed for sensitivity analysis between alternatives to be explored. This is especially important when using techniques that have a greater emphasis on economic parameters that are not equally important or appropriate cross-culturally. Use of decision matrices provides a more comprehensive method for comparing the multiple, interactive, and long-term benefits of the agroforestry system and competing land uses.

ID POROSITY
AB Soil erosion by wind is a persistent problem in central Wisconsin. The extent and effectiveness of windbreaks in erosion- prone areas are unknown. We investigated the potential effectiveness of windbreaks established for soil erosion control in Portage County, Wisconsin. Our objectives included quantification of their extent and condition, development of a routine method for field assessment, and compilation of a reference database of windbreak information. We used aerial photographs to identify the windbreak population, and a two-stage, stratified random sampling technique to obtain samples for field evaluation. Variables and attributes examined included species, number of gaps, height, width, porosity, spacing, live crown ratio, crown condition, and a condition rating. Methods included simple photo-interpretation techniques, field measurements, optical scanning techniques, and data manipulation in geographic information systems. We identified over 2600 windbreaks comprising a total extent of 834 km; only a small proportion of this may offer effective protection at critical periods. Collectively, field windbreaks protect a very small proportion only of the county's agricultural land area from wind erosion. These results imply a need for increased planting rates, explicit maintenance or renovation of existing barriers, and windbreak designs that are both sustainable and compatible with current agricultural production efforts.

ID ARID SAVANNA; TREES; GRASS; RESOURCE; WOODY
AB The tree-shrub savanna 'Foret Classee de Nazinon' (Burkina Faso) is submitted to a management of grazing and rotational cutting of Detarium microcarpum. This species resprouts after cutting. In order to investigate whether this silvopastoral land use system is sustainable, aboveground herbaceous biomass was measured on subplots under uncut trees ('uncut'), next to the stubs of cut trees ('cut') and on subplots not influenced by the (former;, crowns of trees ('open grassland') in four lots. These lots were cut one, three, six and seven years before the study. Vegetation composition of the lots and the composition of the diet of cattle were also determined. Comparisons were made between treatments and lots, Herbaceous biomass was lower in the open grassland subplots than in uncut or cut subplots. We speculate that soil enrichment and more efficient precipitation input in (former) tree crown zones could have resulted in this pattern. Cutting and subsequent resprouting of trees did not lead to significant differences in herbaceous biomass between cut and uncut subplots. The most simple explanation for this is that the trees could extend their roots beyond the location of their neighbouring trees. Biomass and coverage of perennial grasses, mainly Andropogon, ascinodis and Andropogon gayanus, did not change in lots cut one, three or six years before the study, but decreased dramatically in lots that were cut seven years before the study. When foraging, cattle spent more than 90% of their time feeding on these species. This indicates that, as a consequence of tree cutting, forage availability may be reduced to the point where local herdsmen are forced to take their cattle to another region.

AB Means have to be found for rural people to supply both their own needs and those of the urban dwellers, without further loss of natural resources. Some examples from around the humid tropics suggest that complex agroforests may be able to achieve this goal. In West Africa, the concepts of the cocoa (Theobrorna cacao) farm and compound garden, coupled with the domestication of indigenous trees for the production of improved non-timber forest products, need to be developed. There are numerous candidate species both for domestication and for inclusion in multi-strata systems. Research is needed on the development of various forms of multi-strata agroforests, coupled with short-term tree fallows especially to rehabilitate degraded land. More ecologically-oriented studies are required to build sustainable and productive multi-strata agro-ecosystems, while domestication requires greater understanding of the needs of the food and pharmaceutical industries and the development of marketing infrastructures. Incentives are required to promote entreprenurism in rural communities, especially near urban centres.

AB Different aspects of preservation, management and restoration of watercourses are described with their concepts, methods, materials and results. Special emphasis is given to bioengineering which may yield very good hydroecological results.
   Bioengineering is in keeping with a sustainable development of hydrosystems used by man. It is based on the conservation or, on the contrary, on the re-creation of dynamic riparian systems which are missing. Like other engineering sciences, it may solve erosion problems with great technical efficacy, but with great ecological efficiency. Living plants-are used as construction materials which are arranged in specific patterns and are not employed to decorate civil engineering works.
   Intervention in a river is not always necessary. A zero option is considered. The philosophy which governs interventions in watercourses must be based on a natural logic (natural development) where the vegetable is privileged before the mineral : 1) Assess the need for interventions according to impacts and values to protect (zero option) - 2) Assess if bioengineering can solve the problems. - 3) If not, assess if mixed interventions are efficient. - 4) Only at this stage should a conventional civil work technique be applied if it proves reasonable and coherent.
   Regulating and landscaping a watercourse is not only a matter of hydraulic calculations. A knowledge of biological functions is needed to develop appropriate interventions. A fine analysis of the whole stream according to hydroecological criteria has become essential. For successful conservation, natural intervention and restauration of watercourses, guidelines are proposed.

ID STRATEGIES; EVOLUTION
AB The postwar restructuring of small tropical islands toward mass tourism development has threatened their sustainability. A major cause has been inadequate understanding of tourism dynamics and the absence of comprehensive integrated measures of tourism's pervasive economic, social, and environmental impacts. This paper constructs a composite Tourism Penetration Index from per capita visitor spending, daily visitor densities per 1,000 population, and hotel rooms per square kilometer. It is tested on 20 small Caribbean islands and yields three levels of increasing penetration. Four case studies are presented to illustrate the behavior of islands at different levels of penetration and to highlight the policy implications for Dominica, St. Lucia, Antigua/Barbuda, and St. Maarten/St. Martin.

   resistance
AB Insecticide research led to the first "complete" victories in combatting pests almost 50 years ago with the chlorinated hydrocarbons followed quickly by the organophosphates, methylcarbamates, and pyrethroids-all neuroactive chemicals. This Golden Age of Discovery was the source of most of our current insecticides. The challenge then became health and the environment, a Golden Age met with selective and degradable compounds. Next the focus shifted to resistance, novel biochemical targets, and new chemical approaches for pest control. The current Golden Age of Genetic Engineering has curtailed, but is unlikely to eliminate, chemical use on major crops. Insecticide research, having passed through several Golden Ages, is now in a renaissance of integrating chemicals and biologicals for sustainable pest control with human safety.

AB This article records the trade practice and culture cycle of Ophiocephalus maculatus (snakeheads) as adopted by a fish farm at Ngau Tam Mei, the New Territories, Hong Kong. This farm is one of the few remaining local enterprises that have the skills to spawn this labyrinth fish. Documentation is timely not only because there has been great demand for the transfer of culture technology (spawning) to China, but also because the species may become extinct with the demise of the culture business through urbanization. The discussion throws light on the effectiveness and limitations of the institutions of private rights as a means of conserving common resources.

TI Modelling growth rate of Penaeus monodon Fabricius in intensively
   managed ponds: effects of temperature, pond age and stocking density
SO AQUACULTURE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MERGUIENSIS; PLOT
AB Records of shrimp growth and water quality made during 12 crops from each of 48 ponds, over a period of 6.5 years, were provided by a Queensland, Australia, commercial shrimp farm, These data were analysed with a new growth model derived from the Gompertz model. The results indicate that water temperature, mortality and pond age significantly affect growth rates. After 180 days, shrimp reach 34 g at constant 30 degrees C, but only 15 g after the same amount of time at 20 degrees C. Mortality, through thinning the density of shrimp in the ponds, increased the growth rate, but the effect is small. With continual production, growth rates at first remained steady, then appeared to decrease for the sixth and seventh crop, after which they have increased steadily with each crop. It appears that conservative pond management, together with a gradual improvement in husbandry techniques, particularly feed management, brought about this change. This has encouraging implications for the long-term sustainability of the farming methods used. The growth model can be used to predict productivity, and hence, profitability, of new aquaculture locations or new production strategies.

DT Article
ID NORTHEAST THAILAND; FIELDS
AB The results of a socio-economical survey of farming systems practising rice culture with introduced fish, rice culture with indigenous fish and rice monoculture in the semi-deep waters of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, are presented. Rice and fish yields, inputs, and cost-benefits were computed to evaluate the agricultural effects of rice with fish culture. Household size, labour availability and educational level were not significantly different among the three farming systems, Rice-fish farming systems differed mainly from rice monoculture by a higher fertilizer/water requirement and less pesticide use. The total farm cash and net return did not differ among the farming systems, The main beneficial effects of rice-fish culture are thought to be related to environmental sustainability, system biodiversity, farm diversification and household nutrition.

ID PERCEPTION
AB 1. The River Idle is a low gradient river flowing through north Nottinghamshire. The river was comprehensively channelized (early 1980s) for flood defence and land drainage. The scheme has produced a trapezoidal channel with a lack of ecological diversity, a poor fishery and low aesthetic value. A rehabilitation design was required to tackle these deficiencies through improvements which did not compromise the other obligations of the managing authority.
   2. Rehabilitation proposals were based on a semi-quantitative assessment of the sources and pathways of sediment transport through the system. Geomorphological reconnaissance was used to define conservation value, to prioritize the most suitable reaches for restoration and to identify a reference reach. On this basis, structures were designed to achieve short-term objectives without compromising long-term geomorphological sustainability.
   3. After design, the siting and impacts on flow conveyance were tested using appropriate hydraulic models. BENDFLOW was used to refine the positioning of deflectors while the estimated reduction in flow conveyance (HMODEL2 and FCFA) did not exceed 10% of capacity or 0.05 m in water surface elevation (HECRAS) under high flow conditions.
   4. As river restoration and rehabilitation schemes become more widely employed in rivers with multi-functional management requirements, so detailed design principles set into their catchment context and hydraulic testing will become increasingly critical to protect designs from the criticism that flood defence and land drainage interests are adversely affected.

AB in Malawi cattle breeding is based on a population of about 800 000 animals predominantly Malawi Zebu. Records from four governmental breeding stations for Malawi Zebu were analysed for the years 1977 to 1993. Missing records were a major problem. The mean birth and weaning weights were 15.4 kg to 22.5 kg and 75.8 kg to 118.1 kg, respectively. Mean weaning age was 223 days. The mean live weight for three years old animals ranged from 229 kg for males to 162 kg for females. Age at first calving was about 50 months. In Northern Malawi, a sample of 38 milk producing small holder farms keeping Malawi Zebu Friesian crosses delivered on average 1163 kg milk per cow per year. The mean percentage of Holstein-Friesian of genes increased from 50% to 75% from 1981 to 1995. The near collapse of the artificial insemination programme is a major constraint. A commercial Holstein-Friesian dairy herd produced on average 5589 kg milk per cow per year. The heritability for milk yield was 0.21. It is strongly recommended to set-up a sustainable breeding programme for local populations.

AB Aim of this study was the development of an animal welfare index for cattle kept outdoors. The index can reach a maximum score of 200 points by taking into consideration the influence of seven main factors as follows: suitability of race (40 pts), social contact (20 pts), soil and surface consistency (30 pts), behaviour of comfort (20 pts), wind exposure (20 pts), adaptation and condition (30 pts), intensity of animal care (40 pts). Cattle kept outdoors from 501 farms, which follow ecologically sustainable production goals, were chosen for an evaluation study of the newly developped animal welfare index. In 1996 an average score per farm of 159 pts and in 1997 of 162 pts. was obtained. The results demonstrate a high degree of animal welfare in these farms.

AB A series of simulations was made with a fallow-wheat crop simulation model to examine the effects of stubble retention and tillage on yield for 2 semi-arid environments in north-western Victoria over a 100-200-year period. The fallow treatments comprised 4 combinations of stubble management and tillage in 18-month-long fallows of a fallow-wheat rotation. The 2 sites are representative of the major soil types of the region: a chromic vertisol at Dooen and a calcic xerosol at Walpeup.
   Stubble retention had the greatest effect on yield, providing a median increase of 0.8 and 0.6 t/ha at Dooen and Walpeup, respectively. Zero tillage had an important but small advantage in the presence of stubble at Dooen (0.2 t/ha) and no significant advantage under any system at Walpeup. Yield response was primarily caused through increased fallow-stored water of approximately 89 and 25 mm at Dooen and Walpeup, respectively. The accumulation of soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) at sowing in fallows did not show the same treatment differences as with water or yield. There was a significant interaction between soil type and fallow method. At Dooen, stubble depressed SMN by about 24 kg N/ha (163-185 kg N/ha) below those without stubble (188-207 kg N/ha). Tillage reduced SMN with or without stubble by about 20 kg N/ha. At Walpeup, on the other hand, the highest SMN was associated with tillage and was enhanced by stubble, but the differences were small (<10 kg N/ha). Nitrogen fertiliser produced a small increase in yield (median 0.2 t/ha) at Dooen, increasing to about 0.4 t/ha in wetter years when stubble was retained and fallows were maintained with zero tillage. Over a 100-year period, nitrogen fertiliser reduced the rate of yield decline. The use of nitrogen fertiliser with stubble retention and zero tillage offers an opportunity for arresting declining yield and quality in intensive cropping systems in the Wimmera region of Victoria.

AB A major issue for the sustainability of cropping systems is the maintenance of soil fertility and especially the supply of nitrogen to cereal crops. Choice of appropriate management strategies, including the role of legumes, is problematic, especially where climatic variation is large. Simulation models provide the means of extrapolation from the site- and season-specific bounds of experimental data to permit scenario analyses that can explore alternative management options.
   This paper is a status report on the capabilities of the APSIM modelling framework to simulate legume-cereal systems. APSIM deals with water and nitrogen constraints to crop growth and is well suited to the task of modelling whole systems involving crop rotations. The components that are not yet fully developed are modules for growing the legume crops and coupling these with the module describing the dynamics of soil organic matter to obtain sensible predictions of nitrogen supply to subsequent crops. Evidence is provided that those parts of the system that can be represented by current APSIM modules are predicted satisfactorily. The closest approach to a whole system that has been simulated to date is grass or legume (Stylosanthes hamata cv. Verano) leys followed by crops of maize or sorghum grown in experiments at Katherine, NT. Predictions of the yields of the leys and the cereal crops, especially the benefit from the legume leys to a second crop, were sufficiently close to measured yields to suggest that there are good prospects for developing useful models of other systems involving legumes and cereals. A simulation scenario exploring a chickpea-wheat system demonstrates how models can be used to analyse both productivity and sustainability aspects of the system.

AB Productivity of 3 different 2-year crop rotations: namely continuous wheat, wheat-chickpea, and wheat-fallow, was measured over 4 consecutive seasons beginning in 1991-92 at the ICARDA station, Tel Kadya, Syria. Nitrogen (N) fertiliser (30 kg N/ha at sowing) was broadcast every other year in the continuous wheat only. N-15-labelled fertiliser was used to quantify the amount of nitrogen supplied to the crops through current and past applications of fertiliser and by N-2 fixation. The remaining N in the crop was assumed to come from the soil.
   In any single season, wheat yields were unaffected by rotation or N level. However: 2-year biomass production was significantly greater (32%, on average) in the continuously cropped plots than in the wheat-fallow rotation. On average, <10% of the N in the wheat crop came from fertiliser in the season of application, and <1.2 kg N/ha of the residual fertiliser was recovered by a subsequent wheat crop. Chickpea fixed 16-48 kg N/ha, depending on the season, but a negative soil N budget was still likely because the amount of N removed in the grain was usually greater than the amount of atmospheric NP fixed. Uptake of soil N was similar in the cereal phase of all 3 rotations (38 kg N/ha, on average), but over the whole rotation at least 33% more soil N was removed from continuously cropped plots than from the wheat-fallow rotation, suggesting that the latter is a more sustainable system.
   A laboratory study showed that although wheat and chickpea residues enhanced the gross rate of N mineralisation by c. 50%, net rates of N mineralisation were usually negative. Given the high C/N ratio of the residue, immobilisation, rather than loss processes, is the likely cause of the decline in the mineral N content of the soil. Consequently, decomposition of crop residues in the field may in the short term reduce rather than increase the availability of N for crop growth.

TI Characters contributing to high yield in Currawong, an Australian winter
   wheat

ID NEW-SOUTH-WALES; SPRING WHEAT; ENVIRONMENTS; GENOTYPES; WATER
AB This study investigated characters that contribute to high grain yield in the recently released Australian winter wheat, cv. Currawong. Currawong was released as a feed grade wheat for south-central New South Wales, with a 10% yield advantage over the highest yielding milling wheat with winter habit, Rosella. When expressed as a percentage of the grain yield of Rosella, Currawong was found to perform best at sites with low soil pH and high grain yield. These sites corresponded to the wetter eastern margin of the wheatbelt in south-central New South Wales.
   While part of the yield advantage of Currawong is due to its tolerance of soil acidity, there remains an ability to yield particularly well in environments conducive to high yield. In yield component studies that were conducted over 2 seasons at Temora, the yield advantage of Currawong appeared to be associated with its grainfilling characters. Currawong had a more rapid rate of grainfill, and/or a longer duration of grainfilling than other high-yielding winter wheats, leading to significantly heavier grain.
   From a plant breeding perspective, the high yield of Currawong is significant for demonstrating rapid genetic gain for yield in Australian winter wheats. The yield of Currawong also demonstrates the possibility of combining high grain yield with the Sr26 stem rust resistance. Characters that confer high yield in Currawong may be of limited benefit in environments where drought stress limits the duration of grainfilling in wheat.

TI Assessing irrigation requirements in the Ord Sugar Industry using a
   simulation modelling approach
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable irrigation guidelines that maximise profitability and minimise water losses and accession to the watertable are required for the new Ord Sugar Industry. In addition, knowledge on crop water requirements is needed to guide water allocation and costing policies for the expanding Ord Irrigation Area where sugarcane is likely to be a dominant crop. Field data indicating water requirements for sugar in the Ord Irrigation Area are few and this paper deploys a modelling approach to extrapolate from knowledge of water requirements in other parts of the world. The approach links long-term climatic data with soil water characteristics of the main soil type, with a cropping systems model, to develop indicative estimates of irrigation water requirement and yield consequences for different management options for sugarcane production in the Ord.
   Analyses of the growth of 12-month old ratoon crops were conducted using the APSIM-Sugarcane model with historical climatic data from 1960 to 1985 and either a deep (188 mm available water to 160 cm depth) or shallow (144 mm of water to 120 cm depth) Cununurra clay soil. Under maximum attainable growth conditions where crops were irrigated after half the soil water supply was depleted, average sucrose yield ranged from 26.7 to 29.0 t/ha, and the irrigation requirement (assuming 100% application efficiency) ranged from 22.7 to 23.8 ML/ha depending on ratooning date. Soil water holding capacity had a major effect on the number of irrigations and the interval between irrigation for a given irrigation schedule but little effect on yield or irrigation requirement. Varying the irrigation schedule by changing the level of soil water depletion before irrigation and thus the irrigation frequency, showed the tradeoff between yield and irrigation requirement with the most profitable irrigation schedule depending on the price of sucrose and the cost of irrigation relative to other costs. Most of the year-to-year variation in irrigation water requirement could be explained by the highly variable effectiveness in soil storage of rainfall which ranged from 44 to 93%. This study has provided insight and indicative estimates of the yield and irrigation requirements for different irrigation management options for use in the establishment of an Ord River sugar industry. These estimates will be further refined as field data become available.

TI Bush-harvesting of the sedge Caustis blakei reduces vegetative growth
   and seed set
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE

DT Article
DE sustainable harvesting; cut foliage; koala fern; wildflower harvesting;
   fire responses
ID DEFOLIATION; GRASSES; FLOWER
AB Substantial quantities of the native sedge, Caustis blakei Kukenthal (commonly called koala or foxtail fern) are harvested from naturally occurring populations in south-east Queensland as cut foliage and exported to Europe, USA and Japan. Light harvesting (30%) of stems of C. blakei reduced the number or size of marketable stems but did not alter the number and length of new stems. Moreover, mean dry weight of harvested stems significantly reduced over time, suggesting that even light harvesting was probably not sustainable under the dry conditions experienced. Plants that were harvested 3 times per year had more marketable stems than plants that were harvested once or twice per year at the same annual intensity.
   Despite the infertility of the soil in the experimental site, the amount of nutrients removed by harvesting stems was low and may not be the major factor reducing growth. We suggest that limited carbohydrate supplies due to low water supply and harvesting (particularly moderate and heavy harvesting) might be the major causes of reduced growth. Regeneration of fire-sensitive species such as C. blakei is likely to be prejudiced by harvesting. Harvesting removed spikelets and reduced the number of spikelets on new stems. Although only a small number of fruit were removed in this experiment, the commercially harvested stems represent the current season's stems and are the most fecund. This loss could be significant as C. blakei sets few fruit in any one year.
   It is recommended that harvesting should be limited to only 30% of the current season's stems with a limit of 15% during dry seasons, instead of the present harvesting limits of '30% of green stems' or '30% of the plant'. In the longer term, propagation and commercial production will be necessary to supply the demand for cut stems on both export and domestic markets.

AB This paper emphasises the critical importance of achieving environmentally healthy and productive catchments in Australia. This widely held societal goal requires an understanding of landscape processes and predictions of how they might impact spatially on regional land, water and vegetation resources. Such knowledge would assist the development of more sustainable property and catchment plans.
   Current developments in the application of indicators for assessing and monitoring catchment health are briefly described, together with the emerging challenges facing their wider adoption by land managers, the resource stewards of rural Australia. These imposing challenges include: developing a core set of nationally accepted catchment health indicators; meeting the requirement for spatially dense data at reasonable cost; developing and testing new environmental indicators related to on-farm nutrient management and the potential for nutrients to leak off-site; and quantitative estimates of soil biological health.

AB Sustainable agricultural practices and land application of wastes require that the accession of nitrate to groundwater be within acceptable limits. Simulation modelling is a valuable aid to the development and testing of management practices that achieve this goal, but requires unbiased and precise parameter estimates. Here we consider the role of simple lysimeter-based techniques, which may yield only a single integral observation in the form of total solute leached or total drainage, in supplementing infrequent concentration data for the purposes of parameter optimisation.
   The utility of such techniques was evaluated using a simulation model to create a 'no-error data set' of nitrate concentration values and summary observations of the total mass of nitrate leached and total drainage over a 182-day period. From that no-error data set a more realistic data set incorporating random error was created. By using those concentrations, the value of the mass of nitrate leached or total drainage was evaluated by their effect on the unbias and precision of optimised mineralisation or evaporation parameters. The effects of observation weight, error in the observations, and 2 other experimental strategies involving a higher intensity of solute sampling were also tested.
   It was found that the summary observations, such as those obtainable from simple lysimeter-based techniques, had the potential to reduce bias and improve the precision of the optimised parameters. The consequence of this effectiveness was that error in the summary observations led to considerable error in the optimised parameters.

AB The effects of subterranean clover, medic, and lucerne, grown simultaneously from 1988 to 1990, followed by wheat from 1991 to 1993, and of chickpea and long fallow in alternate years with wheat, on soil total nitrogen (N), nitrate-N (NO3--N), organic carbon (C), and moisture were measured over 6 years in 2 long-term experiments on a black earth (pellic vertisol) and red clay (chromic vertisol) in northern New South Wales.
   The accretion of soil total N in the black earth and NO3--N in both soils was higher after lucerne than after other legumes, and NO3- in the black earth remained high after lucerne to the full depth (120 cm) of measurement during the following 3 years of wheat growing. Clover had the next largest effect on total N and NO3- accretion, and chickpea had the smallest effect except in the red clay where chickpea increased NO3- more than medic in 1990. However, none of the annual legumes had much effect on NO3- after the first year of cropping and their small residual effects, if any, were confined to the top 30 cm of soil. Levels of total N accretion after lucerne were higher than previously measured, because of the greater depth of measurement, but were similar on a per unit depth basis.
   High levels of NO3--N after long fallow, especially in the black earth, which tended to be higher than after medic or chickpea, were probably caused by accelerated mineralisation of organic N which has declined more in this rotation than in any other.
   There was no accumulation of organic C during the legume growing period in any rotation, and C tended to be lower after chickpea than after other legumes. Organic C was almost always lowest in the long fallow treatment. Summer-growing grasses, which occurred in all treatments to varying degrees, may have caused the organic C accumulation during the 3 years of cropping.
   In the first year of wheat growing, soil water was lower after lucerne than after other treatments and highest after long fallow, continuous wheat, and chickpea. It was replenished in the red clay to field capacity in all treatments by high rainfall during the fallow before the first wheat crop but not in the black earth, which failed to reach field capacity in any treatment even 2.5 years after the pasture legume phase.

AB The contribution of cotton stubble to the soil organic matter content of Vertisols under cotton production is not well understood. A 3-year experiment was conducted at the Australian Cotton Research Institute to study the effects of burning and incorporating cotton stubble on the recovery of fertiliser nitrogen (N), lint yield, and organic matter levels. This study reports on the changes in soil organic matter fractions as affected by burning and incorporating cotton stubble into the soil. Soil samples collected at the start and end of the 3-year experiment were analysed for total carbon (C-T), total N (N-T), and delta(13)C (a measure of C-13/C-12 isotopic ratios). Labile carbon (C-L) was determined by ease of oxidation and non-labile carbon (C-NL) was calculated as the difference between C-T and C-L. Based on the changes in C-T, C-L, and C-NL, a carbon management index (CMI) was calculated. Further analyses were made for total polysaccharides (P-T), labile polysaccharides (P-L), and light fraction C (LF-C). Stubble management did not significantly affect the N-T content of the soil. After 3 years, the stubble-incorporated plots had a significantly higher content of C-T, C-L, and polysaccharides. Incorporation of stubble into the soil increased the CMI by 41%, whereas burning decreased the CMI by 6%. The amount of LF-C obtained after 3 years in the stubble-incorporated soil was almost double that obtained in the stubble-burnt soil. It was concluded that for sustainable management of soil organic matter in the Vertisols used for cotton production, stubble produced in the system should be incorporated instead of burnt.

AB The relationships between fractions of soil organic carbon (C) oxidised by varying strengths of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and important soil physical and chemical properties were investigated for Queensland Ferrosols. These soils spanned a wide range of clay contents (31-83%), pH values (4.4-7.9; 1:5 water), and total C contents (12.1-111 g/kg). Carbon fractions were derived by oxidation with 33 mM (C1), 167 mM (C2), and 333 mM (C3) KMnO4, while organic C and total C were determined by Heanes wet oxidation and combustion, respectively.
   Aggregate stability was determined by wet sieving soil from the surface crust after 30 min of high intensity (100 mm/h), simulated rainfall on disturbed samples in the laboratory. The proportion of aggregates <0.125 mm (P125) was used as the stability indicator because of the high correlation between this size class and the final rainfall infiltration rate (r(2) = 0.86, n = 42). The soil organic C fraction most closely correlated with P125 was C1 (r(2) = 0.79, n = 42). This fraction was also highly correlated with final, steady-state infiltration rates in field situations where there were no subsurface constraints to infiltration (r(2) = 0.74, n = 30).
   Multiple linear regression techniques were used to identify the soil properties determining effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC, n = 89). Most variation in ECEC (R-2 = 0.72) was accounted for by a combination of C1 (P < 0.0001) and pH (P < 0.0001).
   These results confirm the very important role played by the most labile (easily oxidised) fraction of soil organic matter (C1) in key components of the chemical and physical fertility of Ferrosols. Management practices which maintain adequate C1 concentrations are essential for sustainable cropping on these soils.

AB Sugarcane cropping produces a large amount of crop residues, which offers considerable scope for residue management. Soil samples, collected from 2 long-term experiments in Australia and an experiment in Pernambuco State, Brazil, were analysed for total carbon (CT) and for labile carbon (C-L) by oxidation with 333 mM KMnO4.
   At the 2 locations in Australia, C-T and C-L concentrations were lower in the surface layer (0-1 cm) of the cropped soil compared with a nearby uncropped reference soil. Burning resulted in a greater loss in C-T and C-L at a depth of 0-1 cm than green cane trash management. At one of the sites, sugarcane cropping resulted in a decline in C-T relative to the reference in the green trash management treatment but an increase in C-L.
   In Brazil, trash management from one cane crop did not change C-T over a 12-month period but green cane trash return increased C-L. Sustainable sugarcane cropping systems must include crop residue return without burning in order to maintain an active C cycle in the system to drive nutrient cycles.

AB Comparisons between two forest localities were undertaken to assess the potential availability of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) within the low-diversity forests of Guyana. Information on the abundance and distribution of tree species, and local and national ethnobotanical surveys were used classifying species into five categories (timber, construction, technological, edible and medicinal). A total of 152 species were recorded from the two localities; covering 236 different uses, 33 known commercial timber species and 106 species with potential non-timber product utilization. The most important plant families with the highest number of uses at both localities were Leguminosae (subfamilies Caesalpinioideae and Mimosoideae), Arecaceae, Bombacaceae and Chrysobalanaceae, although these families were not the most abundant families at both localities. At both forest localities eight tree species represented over 50% of all the trees. At Kurupukari three species, each with more than three identified NTFPs, represented over 20% of the trees.
   Potential utilization of NTFPs are discussed in accordance with species richness, tree density, the number of different uses per species, and the percentage of trees represented by each utilizable species. Considering the constraints on the future potential commercialization of NTFPs, two scenarios for the extraction of NTFPs are discussed. Within relatively species-rich forest types the high diversity of products provides potentially viable multiple-species extractionism. In contrast, in low-diversity forest types, typical of the Guiana Shield, one or two NTFP species frequently represent over 50% of the canopy trees, and therefore substantially increase the potential sustainable extraction for single-species harvesting. It is suggested that these low-diversity types of forest are prioritized for conservation on the basis of ensuring future utilization, refuge, of non-timber forest products.

DE Scots pine; biodiversity; sustainable management
AB Three important parameters of biodiversity in first generation Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests on sandy soils have been evaluated: herbal layer diversity, natural regeneration and stand structure. The study took place in the Belgian Campine region, where the original oak-birch forest, degraded to heathlands in the course of time, were finally replaced by monocultures of Scots pine. These first generation pine forests are characterized by a low biodiversity. In maturing stands of this type, however, a spontaneous increase of biodiversity is noticed. Herbal species richness is very limited in all age classes. Different natural regeneration patterns are found. Referring to stand structure, the lengthening of the rotation favours the ingrowth of several hardwood species. As a consequence, the homogenous Scots pine stands are gradually and spontaneously transformed into heterogeneous mixed stands, featuring a noticeable increase in biodiversity. Selected human interventions may further increase biodiversity. The fundamental management principles are discussed: avoidance of major disturbances, lengthening of the rotation period, use of native tree species and natural regeneration, protection of microbiotopes and permanent monitoring.

TI Systems theory as a scientific approach towards organic farming
SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; THINKING
AB Systems theory differs from classic analytical science by producing statements in the context of a descriptive system rather than seeking to reduce a complex problematic situation to researchable entities. This paper analyzes the validity and applicability of systems theory as a scientific approach towards organic farming. The world-views on which organic farming and systems theory build, respectively. are discussed and the methodological consequences of these world views are clarified. The world-view inherent in organic farming, the ontological level, as reflected in stewardship towards nature, the ethic of animal husbandry, and the cycling processes in nature, is harmonious with the underlying ideas of systems theory as regards a hierarchical structure and a mainly anthropocentric stand. This world-view is not paradigmatically different from the world-view inherent in conventional agriculture but non-consistent with the world-view of deep ecology. The world-view of organic farming acknowledges the wholeness in every system with emerging phenomena we might not perceive on an epistemological level. This world-view also acknowledges that such emerging phenomena occur at the higher levels of the hierarchical structure, which is in accordance with systems theory. Originally, a system was defined by its relations to its environment. However, in order to avoid the potential reductionism that may arise when everything is reduced to the ultimate whole system, it is found necessary also to identify and describe the major mechanisms within each system. It is concluded that meeting this requirement, systems theory can be viewed as an extension of traditional methods as the problems become more complex at higher hierarchical levels. Unfortunately, biologically speaking, we still have a limited knowledge of these mechanisms or processes in organic fanning, but one of the challenges of today's science in organic farming is to identify and define these mechanisms on every hierarchical level.

AB The effect of inoculation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and indigenous AMF populations on biomass production and phosphorus (P) uptake by leek and on its utilization of P in Kola apatite and bone meal was studied in field soils. Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) did not enhance P uptake from KoIa apatite, which had no clear effect on P uptake by leek within one growing season, either in the field or in pots. AM increased P uptake from bone meal by 62% in a pot experiment. Inoculation did not increase the effect in unsterile soil as compared with the indigenous AMF populations. The results demonstrate a key role for AM in utilization of organic P.
   On conventionally managed soil monocropped with cereal, inoculation increased growth and P uptake by leek by 62 and 73%, respectively, in contrast to organically cultivated soil where it had a slight negative effect. The difference in the inoculation effect was concluded to be due to the more abundant and effective indigenous AMF populations in the organically cultivated soil. This was suggested by the fourfold higher spore density at the start of the trials and larger root colonization in the organic cropping system as well as by the fact that the inoculation effect was not dependent on fertilization. Superphosphate application in the conventional system resulted in soil P availability comparable to that in the organic system. Management history was the only important factor influencing AM effectiveness which was different on the two experimental sites. The results suggested that regular inoculation is not an appropriate AM utilization strategy in a sustainable farming system. The hypothesis for further study is that utilization of the indigenous AMF by system management would have more potential in sustainable agricultural practices.

AB This study was carried out in one of the plots at the Gambari Experimental Station (GES) jointly initiated by the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria (CRIN) and the Nigerian Institute of Oil Palm Research (NIFOR) in 1965. The experimental design, mainly agronomic, was randomized blocks consisting of three spacing arrangements: pure stands of cocoa and oil palm; avenue planting of cocoa and oil palm and hollow square planting of cocoa and oil palm.
   Three decades after planting, soil samples were collected from the 0-15 cm and 15-45 cm layers under pure stands of cocoa, pure stands of oil palm, avenue planting and hollow square planting. The soil samples were analyzed for particle size distribution, bulk density, total porosity, moisture content, pH, organic matter, nitrate-nitrogen, available phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium.
   Most of the structural, chemical and nutrient properties of soil had mean values that were significantly higher under hollow square treatment than under cocoa and oil-palm pure stands and to some extent under avenue planting. The results and their implications for soil productivity and management for sustainable tree cropping in the Nigerian cocoa belt are discussed.

AB Soil biological and biochemical properties are highly sensitive to environmental stress and thus can be used to assess quality. Any soil quality index should include several biological and biochemical variables so as to reflect better the complex processes affecting soil quality and to compensate for the wide variations occurring in individual properties. Many authors recommend the use of a native soil supporting climax vegetation that has undergone minimal anthropogenic disturbance as a high quality reference soil. In this study which examined three such native soils of Galicia (N.W. Spain) bearing Atlantic oak-wood as the climax vegetation, biological and biochemical properties were found to vary widely seasonally and with samplmg site and depth. These variations were closely correlated with the total carbon (C) and/or total nitrogen (N) contents of the soils. The following equation:
   Total N=(0.38x10(-3)) microbial biomass C
   +(1.4x10(-3)) mineralized N
   +(13.6x10(-3)) phosphomonoesterase
   +(8.9x10(-3)) beta-glucosidase+(1.6x10(-3)) urease
   explained 97% of the variance in total N for the soils studied, suggesting that a balance exists between the organic matter content of a soil and its biological and biochemical properties. A simplified expression of the above equation may be useful as a biochemical quality index for soils.

AB Biomass-for-bioenergy cropping and production systems based on willow (and poplar) planted and managed at high densities and short (3-4 year) coppice harvest cycles, providing fuel for co-firing with coal (or other types of energy conversion) must be ecologically and environmentally sustainable to be commercially successful. Current knowledge and ongoing research and development indicate that the production and utilization systems involved are environmentally and ecologically sustainable. Therefore two primary constraints to commercialization are being met. The remaining constraint is economic viability based on cost of production and use, the value of environmental externalities (such as atmospheric emissions), and potential government/public policy actions to promote this system of providing a locally produced and renewable farm crop and fuel. The environmental and ecological benefits of the system should act as a catalyst for developments needed to overcome the economic constraints of the system.

AB Pre-treated wastewater, sewage sludge and methanogenic landfill leachate were applied to short rotation energy forestry, i.e. Salix (willow) plantations. The nutrient content in wastewater was well balanced with the nutrient uptake in Salix stems. With sludge and leachate used as the main fertilizer resource, potassium and phosphorus fertilizers, respectively, must be added for sustainable biomass production. In most cases the growth was increased after application of the waste products. Production rates at same or higher levels as conventionally-fertilized willow plantations were recorded. Water is pointed out as the single most important growth factor. Waste management according to presented concepts could offer good treatment performance without adverse effects on soil, groundwater or vegetation. During the course of the held tests full-scale applications have been established. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When growing short rotation forest (SRF) crops as a supply of energy, the production and removal of large volumes of biomass from the site will, over time, lead to soil nutrient depletion. It is hence a non-sustainable practice in the longer term. The application of effluent on to SRF crops is a treatment system which, if properly designed and maintained, could both increase the productivity of the biomass crop and reduce the aqueous waste disposal problem. Several waste water land treatment systems are failing due to hydraulic over-loading and poor management causing stress to the trees. Good design and monitoring can influence the success of a system, but there is inadequate information available regarding the role that SRF trees can play. A lysimeter study is described to identify the capacity of selected tree species to take up both water and nutrients. The results will enable better design parameters to be set and over-loading and consequent failure of a system to be avoided. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The U.S. continues efforts to develop genetically superior short-rotation woody crops (hybrid poplar and willow) and herbaceous crops (switchgrass). These biomass crops can provide multiple environmental benefits as well as energy and fiber. This paper focuses on results of site-specific studies that are quantifying the environmental potential and ramifications of converting agricultural croplands to biomass crop production.
   At research-scales, no differences have been found in erosion and movement of nutrients from annual row crops, switchgrass, and tree crops with and without a cover crop in the initial year of establishment. Research- and watershed-scale studies on different soil types, in different regions, and to match tree species with specific site characteristics and management regimes will help determine whether research-scale results can be used to predict effects at larger scales and to identify best management practices to minimize environmental effects while maximizing yields.
   Studies in different regions of the U.S. are evaluating the habitat value of biomass crops compared to agricultural row crops, grasslands, or natural forests. Results to date from both research- and larger-scale plantings show that SRWCs support greater bird diversity than row crops, but less diversity than natural forests. Switchgrass plantings extended habitat for grasslands birds compared to row crops. Surveys on industrial tree crop plantings in the south-eastern U.S. are addressing the relationship between site characteristics (planting acreage, species, landscape context, and age of plantings) and breeding bird use. The environmental studies of water and soil quality and wildlife diversity are being used to identify management strategies for biomass crops to increase productivity while increasing agricultural sustainability.

AB The production and use of biomass for energy has both positive and negative impacts on the environment. The environmental impacts of energy crops should be clarified before political choices concerning energy crops are made. An important aid to policy-making would be a systematic methodology to assess the environmental sustainability of energy crops. So far, most studies on the environmental aspects of energy crops deal mainly with the energy production of the crops and the possible consequences for CO2 mitigation. The Dutch Centre for Agriculture and Environment (CLM) has developed a systematic methodology to assess the ecological and socio-economic sustainability of biomass crops. The method is best described as a multicriteria analysis of process chains and is very much related to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Characteristics of our methodology are the use of:
   definition of functional units;
   analysis of the entire lifecycle;
   definition of yield levels and corresponding agricultural practices;
   analysis of both ecological and economic criteria;
   definition of reference systems;
   definition of procedures for normalisation and weighting.
   CLM has applied the method to assess the sustainability of ten potentially interesting energy crops in four European regions. The results are used to outline the perspectives for large scale production of biomass crops with regard to the medium and long term land availability in Europe. For the crops considered, net energy budget ranges from 85 GJ net avoided fossil energy per ha for rape seed for fuel to 248 GJ net avoided fossil energy per ha for silage maize for electricity from gasification. The methodology of the tool and its results were discussed at the concerted action "Environmental aspects of biomass production and routes for European energy supply" (AIR3-94-2455), organised by CLM in 1996. Major conclusions of the research:
   Multicriteria analysis of process lifecycles is at present the best available option to assess the ecological and economical sustainability of energy crops. However, it is recognised that further research and development activities in the field of LCA are necessary;
   Use of crops for generation of electricity is preferred to use of crops for transport fuels since the latter score low on both ecological and socio-economical criteria.
   Large scale use and production of energy crops requires (a) choices and goals from agricultural, environmental, and energy policies, and (b) policy instruments for financial incentives e.g. with payments or with tax rebates, preferably per kilogram avoided CO2 emission.

AB Many influential organisations foresee biomass playing a key role in a future, more sustainable, global energy supply matrix. Countries such as Austria, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, India, the USA and the UK are actively encouraging the use of biomass for energy, and pushing forward the development of the necessary knowledge and technology for modern biomass energy systems. There is a growing consensus that renewable energy must progressively displace the use of fossil fuels, with fears of global climate change adding urgency to this need. Among the available types of renewable energy biomass is unique in its ability to provide solid, liquid and gaseous fuels which can be stored and transported. The potential resource for bioenergy is large, especially in forest-rich nations, in richer countries where there is a surplus of agricultural land, and in many low latitude countries where high biomass yields are possible. Therefore we expect biomass to be an important fuel of the future, but this cannot be taken for granted. The systems adopted must demonstrate clear environmental and social benefits relative to alternatives if the potential is to be realised. These benefits are not inherent to biomass energy, but depend on site- and fuel cycle-specific factors. Life-cycle analysis and evaluation of external costs are important means for assessing the social and environmental pros and cons of bioenergy systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB An important question for bioenergy is how a comprehensive use of forest fuel will influence the environment. Swedish scientists have contributed significantly to improving knowledge within this sector. This paper summarizes current research results on forest fuel and soil conditions, how ashes should be returned, forest fuel as a means to counteract the effects of nitrogen deposition, forest fuel and nature management. On the basis of current knowledge, it is concluded that it is possible to make use of large amounts of fuel from the forest with retained or perhaps even improved environmental status.

AB The present amount of biomass used for heat, and to a smaller extent electricity production, is already considerable in several European countries but the potential unused in Europe is even higher. Combustion is the most mature conversion technology utilized for biomass. The systems addressed in this paper are plants with a nominal boiler capacity greater 0.5 MWth. The main combustion technologies used for these systems are underfeed stoker furnaces, moving grate firings (over-bed stoker fired units), bubbling and circulating fluidized beds. The most important biomass fuels are sawdust, wood chips, bark, straw, cereals and grass. The essential differences between them are their different combustion behaviour as well as the different concentrations of combustion relevant elements (such as N, S, Cl, K) they contain, influencing the necessary combustion, process control and hue gas cleaning technology. Important points that are now under development focus on possibilities of NOx reduction by primary measures, as well as on higher plant efficiencies by efficient biomass drying by well adjusting the excess oxygen level in the flue gas to the requirements for a complete combustion and by recovering energy from the flue gas. Furthermore, possibilities of influencing the material fluxes of ash forming elements by primary measures aiming at a sustainable ash utilization and an efficient dust precipitation are in progress. Problems still unsolved that need comprehensive R&D in the near future are reactions taking place in the hot flue gas, causing depositions and corrosion in furnaces and boilers (especially when K-, S- and Cl-rich biomass fuels such as straw, cereals and grass are used). Research on possibilities to prevent or control them (by material selection or appropriate technologies) are of great importance. Furthermore, the ash melting behaviour and its influencing variables have to be treated as urgent. Staged combustion systems, hot fly ash precipitation as well as specially designed boilers could represent solutions for these ash and aerosol related problems. Combined heat and power (CHP) production, already realized in plants with a nominal boiler capacity greater 10 MWth based on steam turbines, is also of growing importance for small-scale applications. Moreover, the lower limit for CHP plants is a nominal boiler capacity of about 5 MWth at the moment, due to the lower electric efficiencies achievable and to the economy of scale. Interesting technologies which are right now under development are sterling engines, a newly developed steam engine (screw-type motor) and organic rankine cycles (ORC) with hydrocarbons as working fluids operating at low temperature and pressure levels tin comparison with conventional steam processes). The basic requirements for the selection of an appropriate CHP process are a high electric efficiency to investment costs ratio and a well tested technology to ensure a continuous and undisturbed operation of the plant.

AB Since the creation of the National Alcohol Programme (NAP) in 1975, commonly known as "ProAlcool", it has gone through a number of fluctuations reflecting Brazilian political, economic and energy priorities. In 1996-1997 over 175 Mt of sugarcane (65% of 270 Mt harvested) was converted to ethanol fuel. The ProAlcool started as a highly innovative programme, but in recent years has lost part of its technological zeal and in certain areas is becoming stagnant. This is due to a combination of reasons, e.g. unclear energy policy, high sugar prices in the international market and lower investment in ethanol production as a result of low international oil prices. A new impetus is needed to reflect changing economic and energy policy in Brazil. This paper reviews the implications for ProAlcool of the new economic policies and the possibilities for restructuring the programme to guarantee its survival as a pioneering and sustainable renewable energy source. This will bring new challenges, costs and opportunities to Brazilian society. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Short-rotation woody crop (SRWC) supply systems have been proposed over the past 20 years as a means of rapidly producing biomass for fiber and fuels. The U.S. Department of Energy, through the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program and its; partners, has selected model species, developed silvicultural systems and created genetically improved clonal planting stock for use in SRWC supply systems. Spacing, fertilizer and pesticide prescriptions have been developed for several species and regions within the U.S. Breeding and genetic improvement projects continue to identify and select plant materials which display increased productivity and pest resistance. Genetic transformation, somaclonal variation and marker-assisted selection are being used to supplement traditional breeding work. Harvesting and handling methods are currently relying on traditional combinations of existing equipment. Nevertheless, technical and environmental issues related to: (1) long-term use of fertilizers and irrigation; (2) deployment of clonal planting stock; and (3) development of customized harvesting equipment remain as unresolved issues related to further deployment and commercialization of SRWC systems. Overall determination of SRWC sustainability will require resolution of these issues. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The close of 1994 marked the end of one era and the start of another for members of the American Forest & Paper Association (AF&PA). This new beginning was ushered in by AF&PA when its members established a major industry goal: to enhance the environment by visibly changing the practice of forestry on industrial forest land, especially as it pertains to water quality, wildlife and biodiversity. Equally important, AF&PA members are engaging loggers and private woodland owners in an ongoing dialogue to encourage reforestation, to use environmental Best Management Practices, and to improve the appearance of harvesting operations, particularly in highly visible areas. AF&PA members are on their way toward meeting the goal of sustainable forestry. Through the collection and analysis of reports from individual companies, AF&PA compiled data on environmental performance across the industry. This information-available for the first time in 1996-is being used to identify trends in the practice of sustainable forestry. The data cover a variety of topics ranging from harvesting practices to wildlife habitat diversity on >21 million ha members own or control. An independent panel of experts, who reviewed these data and the first annual sustainable forestry progress report, noted that although it was too early to tell how far the changes in commercial forestry practices will go, or how fast they will occur, that they do see positive signs in many of the companies they visit and in the first annual progress report.

AB Under most conditions, fertilizers will be required to maintain production of short rotation forestry (SRF) plantations. Information from fertilizer trials together with knowledge of general soil fertility in an area permits approximation of fertilizer requirements. Refining those approximations for specific plantations is important for the following three reasons: the need to assure high production; the need to minimize production costs; and the desire to limit off-site effects of fertilizer application. To meet those goals, requires understanding the behavior of fertilizer in soils including leaching, immobilization and, in the case of nitrogen, denitrification. Knowledge of nutrient cycling in SRF including nutrient removal at harvest, other nutrient losses, and natural inputs of nutrients, helps in achieving good fertilizer practices. Cropping strategies that minimize fertilizer use can lower costs and reduce off-site effects of fertilizing. This review summarizes current knowledge of nutrient cycling, cropping strategies and fertility management in temperate SRF plantations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Pitting corrosion on aluminium in absence of chloride
SO BRITISH CORROSION JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID INITIATION; METALS; ALLOYS
AB Fitting corrosion has been the cause of numerous failures in industrial pipes and tubes, especially in environments containing chlorides. The problem is most acute when there is a source of copper ions, since these can plate out on, for example, aluminium and give rise to an effect similar to galvanic corrosion. Strong evidence is presented to suggest that, when copper ions are available, pits can initiate in aluminium even in the complete absence of chloride. However, the presence of chloride is still required if acidification is to occur in the occluded solution within the pit, a necessary precursor for sustainable rapid pit propagation.

AB While programmes such as the Rockefeller campaign were specifically targeted at a particular parasite species, the current trend is towards the simultaneous control of all the major geohelminth species. New, broad-spectrum, low-cost anthelmintics and new understanding of epidemiology have led to more cost-effective and sustainable strategies. The WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank all now support global and regional efforts to achieve control of morbidity from intestinal worms. In this paper, we aim to show what's new in clinical helminthology and what has brought about the great improvement in the success of the new approaches to control.

AB The building environmental assessment field is reviewed since it first came into prominence in the early 1990s. Key limitations of existing building environmental assessment methods are identified and the emerging importance of issues such as sustainability, life-cycle assessment, globalization and standardization are discussed. The author provides a constructive direction for emerging 'second generation' building environmental assessment methods and protocols. This includes a standardization of environmental assessment methodologies; a common, generalized framework which allows for adaptation of specific and changing explicit criteria and an increased emphasis on building performance over time.

AB This paper critically reviews current construction industry practice in environmental assessment, identifying gaps and shortcomings in current approaches when viewed from the wider perspective of sustainable development. Lack of common understanding is a significant problem. A number of blueprints for a more sustainable lifestyle which have merged from the business and manufacturing sectors such as 'natural step' and the 'service economy' are explored in order to identify changes that will be expected in the practice and procedures of the construction industry. This presents a considerable challenge, as the questions presented by the need to assess and create more sustainable buildings and cities require wider horizons, much greater resource efficiency and effective participation in decision making.

AB Sustainable cities in developing countries are explored in relation to a complex web of linked issues at the macro, meso and micro level. The eco-system is but one of many considerations. This paper presents an overview of sustainable human settlements. Social equity and quality of life are placed within the context of defining factors including public policy, regulation and performance, finance, technological development land policies as well as redefining professional roles and education. The linkages between the defining factors must be better understood and radically rethought, integrated and managed if cities are to be made sustainable.

ID ISSUES
AB Sustainability indicators integrate environmental, social, and economic factors such that the complex cause-and-effect relationships between these multiple factors can be more readily investigated. The whole systems approach of sustainable development differs from traditional environmentalism by its inclusion of economic and social factors. The selection of sustainability indicators will therefore inevitably be a human value-driven process. Environmental health will nonetheless be paramount. Empirical studies in the USA have found that states with lower pollution levels and more environmental regulation have healthier economies and fewer disparities in income between economic classes (Templet, 1995). In construction, indicators of sustainable construction are a necessary parallel to the macro-national and regional-scale indicators measuring society's movement toward or away from some approximation to sustainable development.

AB The features of the Hungarian construction industry are typical of the 'transition countries' of Central Europe changing from planned to market economies. Integration with the European Union is defined as the key issue of sustainable Hungarian development until 2010. Increased economic development is argued as a necessary strategy to pay for improved quality of life and improved environment, despite certain construction projects not being sustainable over the long term. The requirements for joining the European Union are discussed in detail in relation to the changing Hungarian construction industry and the challenges presented to Hungary's existing and proposed infrastructure, planning, human resources and research agendas.

TI Rehabilitation of the expanded programme on immunization in Sudan
   following a poliomyelitis outbreak
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB In 1993 a large outbreak of paralytic poliomyelitis occurred in Sudan as a result of an accumulation of large numbers of susceptible children that was accelerated by faltering immunization services. The extent of the outbreak led to the rapid rehabilitation of Sudan's Expanded Programme on immunization (EPI); the government began financing vaccine purchase, operational aspects of EPI were decentralized, vaccine delivery was changed from a mobile to a fixed-site strategy, a solar cold chain network was installed, inservice training was resuscitated, and social mobilization was enhanced. National immunization days (NIDs) for poliomyelitis eradication were conducted throughout the country, including the southern states during a cease fire in areas of conflict. Measles immunization coverage was increased by offering measles vaccine during the second round of NIDs and subsequently through routine immunization services. Supplemental tetanus toroid immunization of women of child-bearing age began in three provinces at high risk for neonatal tetanus. From 1994 to 1996 reported immunization coverage increased and the incidence of all EPI target diseases fell. Trends in coverage, disease incidence, financing, and the implementation of WHO-recommended disease-control strategies suggest that more sustainable immunization services have been re-established in Sudan.

AB Animal welfare is one of the expanding socioeconomic issues that the dairy industry must face, but which traditional animal science disciplines are poorly equipped to handle. Initial concern for animal welfare issues in North America was prompted by European animal welfare legislation. However, industry interest in animal welfare is likely to be driven in the future by increasing concern about the image of the industry and a perceptible shift in consumer demand toward "green" farm produce. Ecological milk is accounting for a significant percentage of the markets in a number of European countries. In addition, research has now identified the widespread effects of stress on animal health and productivity. In this article, we discuss four areas of research showing a close link between good welfare and good production. This research aims at: 1. understanding the factors that cause animals to become fearful of people and the effect this has on handling efficiency and milk production; 2. defining optimum spatial allowances for calves in terms of their growth, behaviour and physiology; 3. understanding the motivation of sucking behaviour of calves, the causes of cross-sucking in group housed calves; and 4. examining the advantages and disadvantages of cow/calf rearing systems. By identifying stress factors in the cows' environment, and then improving handling techniques and housing design to reduce stress, we hope to improve production and, at the same time, improve the welfare of dairy cattle, and thus maintain the long-term sustainability of the dairy industry.

TI Enset farming in Ethiopia. I. Soil nutrient status in Shoa and Sidamo
   regions
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS

DT Article
AB Soil samples were collected from farms in two enset (Ensete ventricosum) growing regions of Ethiopia and analyzed for plant nutrients. For comparative reasons, soil samples were taken both from fields where enset had been continuously cultivated for several decades and from other fields: annual cropping, grazing, or uncultivated. The results reveal that the enset fields studied had higher soil organic matter contents and better nutritional status than fields used otherwise, not only in the topsoil but also in the subsoil. This indicates more sustainable cultivation with maintained fertility in the enset fields. Possible explanations of this are discussed.

TI Sustainability of organic fertilization of macadamia with macadamia
   husk-manure compost
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB Macadamia husk-manure compost was evaluated as an organic fertilizer for the production of macadamia in an experiment over four years at irrigated and unirrigated sites on the MacFarms of Hawaii orchard, The treatments were (1) Fertilizer, a combination of solid and liquid chemical fertilizers applied based on leaf and soil analysis, (2) Compost, 10,000 kg ha(-1) of a macadamia husk-cattle manure compost alone applied annually between July and October, and (3) Compost+, compost plus mineral fertilizers applied based on leaf and soil analysis. In-shell nut and kernel yield and quality were higher at irrigated than unirrigated sites, but were not significantly affected by the treatments. Change in leaf nutrient composition appears minimum except for slightly lower nitrogen (N) and boron (B) at two orchard sites for the compost treatment. Compost increased soil pH, total ion exchange capacity, soil organic matter, potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) at all sites, and sodium (Na) at irrigated sites. Soil nitrate (NO3)-N was lower in the compost treatment. Fertilization with compost was not profitable because the cost of compost application exceeded conventional fertilization cost tenfold for MacFarms, the largest macadamia farm in the United States.

   cane plantation in Papua New Guinea
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS

DT Article
ID CROPPING SYSTEM; ORGANIC-MATTER; NITROGEN; REMOVAL; YIELD
AB Commercial sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) cultivation in Papua New Guinea started in 1979 at a plantation in the Ramu valley where Udifluvents and Hapluderts are the dominant soil types. The sugar cane is not irrigated and receives only nitrogen (N) fertilizers (+/-90 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Changes in soil chemical fertility were assessed by comparing soil fertility data from the mid-1980s and 1990s and by comparing soil fertility data from sugar cane and adjoining natural grassland. Between the mid-1980s and 1990s the topsoil pH had declined significantly (p<0.001) by 0.3 units and this was accompanied by a decline in cation exchange capacity (CEC) of 34 mmol(c) kg(-1). 'Total N levels in the topsoils declined (p<0.001) from 2.5 to 1.9 g kg(-1) and available P from 36 to 27 mg kg(-l )during the same period. Exchangeable potassium (K) also declined significantly (p<0,05) with 1.3 mmol(c) kg(-1), but changes in exchangeable calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were not significant. The decline in soil fertility was highest in the topsoil although significant changes occurred up to 0.6 m depth. Total N decreased in the 0-0.15 and 0.15-0.30 m soil horizons, but increased in the lower horizons, possibly because of nitrate leaching. A similar degree of soil fertility decline was observed when soils under sugar cane and adjoining natural grassland were compared. However, the interrow had a slightly lower fertility level in comparison to within sugar cane rows. The decrease in total N, available phosphorus (P) and exchangeable K in the soil coincided with a decrease in the leaf N, P, and K concentrations of the sugar cane over the past 10 years. It was concluded that soil fertility had markedly declined under sugar cane monocropping although levels remained favorable for sugar cane cultivation. For sustainable soil management, nutrient inputs as well as small applications of lime may eventually be needed.

AB Fertile soils are one of the most important resources on earth. Sustainable agriculture should use this resource in such a way that the present and future human needs for food or other agricultural goods are warranted whereas the quality of the environment and the natural resources remain preserved. Plant production needs resources of different origins and most of them are maintained according to certain soil parameters. But as soils are neither static, nor homogenous in space and time, the standard approach of uniform. application rates always results in a side by side of over and under supply. Precision Agriculture aims at addressing this spatial variability but for this task physico-chemical images [Digital Agro Resource Maps (DARM)] of the land are required. Efforts in acquiring these maps are actually one of the major bottlenecks for the exploitation of Precision Agriculture at the farm level. Most recent developments in strategies for reducing sampling efforts without loosing information are in "self surveying". This is a method by which basic spatial information of soil texture, organic matter content and geomorphology for instance are gathered just by human skills and "directed", or, "smart" sampling which uses already existing spatial information of a site to guide sampling to representative plots, Optical sensors for major important soil information like soil texture and plant available nutrients are far away from being realized. Already existing approaches for on-the-go measurements of soil features are still soil invasive and therefore slow and ineffective as far as human labor is concerned. However, these methods might benefit a lot from developments in robot techniques. Remote sensing is a promising method for gathering spatial information of soils, but will always need a certain amount of work on the ground to allow interpretation and calibration of images. In so far it fits well with the strategy of "directed" sampling, Temporal availability and visibility are major problems for remote sensing which might be solved by new technological approaches Like unmanned air vehicles (UAV) or stationary "surf-eyes". New approaches are also required for the interpretation of spatially distributed son and plant analysis data and how fertilizer recommendations are derived to be from this information. It is obvious from the first experiences with Precision Agriculture under practical farming conditions that the standard approach of fertilizer recommendation does not provide the best basis in the sense of sustainable farming for a successful implementation of Precision Agriculture.

AB New forms of communication and co-operation do not have the same environmental impact pattern as current forms of work. Environmental impacts are produced by work technologies (mainly communication technologies), buildings (construction, maintenance, operation and destruction) and transport (induced by work relations and housing). The thesis that new information technologies reduce transport and building energy consumption has not been verified in practice until now. The contribution discusses the interrelation between different impacts, gives quantitative data of environmental impact based on the combination of existing life cycle analysis and tries to estimate possible future developments. The question of the necessity of new buildings and the possible development of virtual buildings is discussed in relation with sustainable development.

AB The paper discusses the research and developmental background for initiating a holistic "Cooperative Building" project named office VISION. The influence of the increasing global competition on organisational practices, information technological advances, research on cooperative work and its support and advances in energy and ecological technologies are discussed. The case of office VISION is presented. Office VISION is both a building, the framework for innovative office functionality and a complete consulting scheme for the office of the future. Within the office VISION project, we have initiated the development of 4 main themes: Sustainable working methods, democratic organisations, a healthy indoor environment and liberating cooperative technologies and new ways of organising work. Office VISION will be build in June 2000.

ID CORRUPTION
AB Significant changes in the global political climate during the late 1980s sparked off dramatic enthusiasm for democratisation which swept across much of the developing world. Previously authoritarian governments, through the combined pressures from both external and internal arenas began to topple, to be replaced by regimes organised along liberal democratic lines. internally, the public reacted to the corrupt and repressive tactics of a predatory patron-client state system which had continually failed to operate in accordance with societal needs, with street riots, strikes and other outbursts of discontent as a result. Such events played a major part in introducing multi-party politics by demanding accountability from those in power. Such dramatic changes were also a product of marked changes in the external environment, with governments no longer able to rely on uncritical donor support to secure a bulwark against communism. Furthermore, excessive state repression and intervention, in terms of human rights violations were no longer deemed to be acceptable behaviour. This is mirrored by a clear policy change as evidenced by the British Government's White Paper (1997) which clearly outlines the need for a more enabling, effective and strengthened role for governments in the developing world which enables them to become more dedicated to promoting the interests of the most disadvantaged sectors of society. Only governments which demonstrate a commitment to good governance may receive funding and not adhering to these policy dictates could have drastic consequences in term of future levels and types of support. This article charts the issues concerning the new role for the state and its implications for achieving sustainable, participatory democracies in the context of the state in Africa.

AB Environmental problems have become a worldwide concern for economists, as is witnessed by the development of many theories and policies aimed at driving the economy towards a 'sustainable economy'. The problem becomes even greater if we discuss cities. As recognised in many studies, a high percentage of the world population lives in cities, where quality of life and environmental concerns undermine all advantages associated with agglomeration economies. The vast experience in terms of theoretical and empirical substance which has been built up around the theme of 'sustainable economy' has only partially helped to generate a framework for an 'urban sustainable development'. The city is in fact by definition an 'artifact environment', where well-established concepts of 'environmental economics' (such as natural capital stock, natural environment) can hardly be transferred and applied, in the way they are theoretically formulated. The first scope of the paper is to offer an analytical framework for 'urban sustainable development' to present the main economic concepts that are hidden under this label. In particular, different 'environments' co-exist in a city: the natural, the artifact and the social environment. Each of them generates positive and negative externalities for the city, since each of them represents 'use advantages' and 'use costs' for a city. If this is true, then it is a plausible assumption that the integration of these three 'environments' has to be supported with specific intervention policies. The main aim of this paper is to highlight the possible intervention policies which may be developed to achieve a balanced 'sustainable development' in terms of new policy principles that should govern the 'sustainable city'.

AB We analyzed 43 yr of live-trapping data for eight species of small mammals in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario. Our primary objective was to test whether complex nonlinear models are necessary to describe dynamics of the Algonquin rodent populations. Variation in abundance among species was related to mean abundance by a simple power function with an exponent of 1.77, implying that population variability did not increase with mean density as much as one might expect for strictly statistical reasons. Time-series analyses of annual population densities indicated no significant autocorrelation functions for five species. Southern red-backed voles, red squirrels, and flying squirrels had significant autocorrelations, but only flying squirrels had an autocorrelation function suggestive of cyclic population dynamics. Per capita rates of population growth were density-dependent in all eight species, although in most cases there was substantial deviation around the fitted regression lines. Response surface models with one- and two-year lags significantly improved the statistical fit to data for three species, but only one of these response surface models was sustainable in the face of realistic stochastic variation in per capita growth. These results suggest that simple logistic models are adequate for predicting the long-term dynamics of the Algonquin small-mammal assemblage. All eight species showed evidence of synchronized population fluctuations over time, suggesting trophic linkages due to shared food resources, shared predators, or both.

AB This paper investigates whether monetary and fiscal policies, such as lump-sum taxes, distortionary taxation and monetization of public deficit, have environmental impacts. We address this question extending the neoclassical monetary growth model. We include a state equation for natural resources, and consider natural resources as an input in the production function. Fiscal policy, through public spending, always has environmental impact. Monetary policy affects the environment if money is considered as a device to reduce transaction costs or as necessary to buy goods according to cash-in-advance models. However, the qualitative impact of both policies on the environment cannot be determined. All results depend on the effect of capital on the natural resources dynamics. The model provides a framework which relates public spending and inflation with environment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO ECONOMICS OF PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
DE Community Support Framework; externalities
ID INFRASTRUCTURE
AB The Greek Community Support Framework (CSF), which is operational during the period 1994-99, is designed to finance large-scale development projects and investment in physical and human capital in Greece, aiming to gear the economy onto a sustainable path of economic growth and development. This process of real convergence is viewed as a prerequisite for the cohesion of EU and the sustainability of the nominal convergence objective of the Maastricht Treaty in the way to Economic and Monetary Union of Europe. The paper provides, first, an overview of the Greek CSF and, second, an ex ante assessment of the effects that the Second CSF is likely to have on the economy of Greece. The analysis delineates four types of CSF actions according to whether they aim at (i) raising 'hard' infrastructure, (ii) financing 'soft' infrastructure interventions (such as R&D, health services, etc), (iii) supporting productive investment, and, (iv) training the labour force into new skills and improving the civil service. The effects are analysed first assuming that CSF operates only through raising the components of income and aggregate demand, and then bg incorporating externalities on the productivity of output in various sectors and the reduction in costs. We find that in the absence of externalities, output rises during the period of the CSF 1994-99 but then returns to the benchmark course without any lasting improvement. When all types of externalities are taken into account, total output in year 2010 will be higher than baseline by an impressive 9.5%, and will continue to grow at a rate faster by 0.26% per annum than would be otherwise, while employment expands by an average of 95,000 new jobs.

AB The paper argues that the sustainable development of Chinese agriculture is constrained by the continuing adverse effects of the policy of industrialisation. This has resulted principally in an excessive loss of capital from the agricultural to the industrial sector, a loss of strategic natural resources and infrastructure from agriculture and severe environmental degradation associated directly and indirectly with the development of industry. Quantitative links are established between changes in the growth of grain production and the progress of industrialisation in the pre and post reform eras. It is argued that a fundamental adjustment to the relationship between industry and agriculture is needed and that a more favourable socio-economic environment will be required if China is to develop a sustainable agricultural sector within the context of a national autarky objective in the grain sector.

AB We studied the spatial distribution pattern of Bolitophagus reticulatus L. (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) in a boreal forest in south-ear;tern Norway. The beetle is monophagous and lives in basidiocarps of Fomes fomentarius (L.) Kickx. We collected 900 basidiocarps from all of the 452 birch trees infected with tinder fungus in the 225 ha study area. We then used logistic regression analyses to relate trees with and without beetle occurrence to patch size, isolation and other habitat characteristics. To understand why the beetle had disappeared from certain trees, we also did similar analyses on trees without present occurrence but with signs of earlier beetle presence versus trees with present occurrence of the beetle. The probability of B. reticulatus presence increased with tree diameter and with the number of dead basidiocarps on the tree. We interpret these variables as indicating the habitat patch size. The probability of beetle presence decreased as the distance to surrounding inhabited trees increased, even on a scale of less than one hundred meters. The fungus-infected trees were utilized to a much. higher degree when they occurred in clusters. We discuss to what degree a metapopulation model is relevant in our case. Several other, less common forest insects depend on wood-rotting fungi or dead wood for their survival. If a similar response to increased isolation of habitat patches can be assumed for some of the rare species, guidelines for an ecologically sustainable forestry should include not only the need for more dead wood in the modern forest, but should also consider the spatial distribution of these key resources.

TI Valuation of national parks in transitional economies
SO EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA Slovak
DT Article
AB Most environmental assets are defined as public goods. Market failure in estimating market price for environmental goods can give the impression that they have little value or are unimportant relative to market prices, thus most environmental values can be lost.
   The main idea of this paper is to show that economic values of environmental and resource services can give valuable information supporting resource and environmental management decisions.
   The first part of: the paper explain difficulties in understanding the issue of environmental evaluation from the point of view of economics and the environment. Secondly it explores the theory concerned with valuation of non - market goods, stressing different approaches to measuring environmental values. Special attention is paid to the discussion on the theory of value, especially on non use values, e.g. intrinsic, bequest, philanthropic values of the environment.
   The paper also addresses the most critical problems in decision making and nature protection under the transitional economy of the Slovak Republic. Decision-making in pre-1989 Command and Control (CAC) regimes in Central and Eastern Europe was done by political representation and based on ideological or political principles, rather than economic characteristics. Environmental decision-making was generally limited to a supplement of land use - planning documentation with very low influence in the decision-making process.
   The key element missing in the former command and control approach to decision-making is consensus building and public involvement Political changes in 1989 and the economic transformation have resulted in a radical change in environmental policy in the Slovak Republic. The major accomplishment in the legal field today is a well-developed legislative framework in environmental decision-making. On the other hand, implementation and law enforcement is still inadequate. Citizens as individuals are not very active in environmental decision-making. Generally, there is a lack of interest in public matters and apathy towards getting involved in community life. Information is not transparent or accessible, either for the public or for non-governmental organisations or research institutions. Decisions are usually based on administrative principles without sufficient involvement of all interested parties. Any involvement of the public or other interested parties occurs in the late phases of the planning process when the detailed proposal already exists and it is too late to initiate meaningful change. Nature protection in the Slovak Republic is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment. The key piece of legislation in the field of nature protection is the Act on Nature and Landscape Protection, according to which the protection of nature is the fundamental priority within the protected areas., "Preservation of biodiversity, conservation and rational use of natural resources, and optimisation of land use" is one of the five priorities of the State Environmental Policy.
   The following most crucial problems can be summarised:
   Private property and economic interests versus nature protection
   After the political changes in 1989, property seized by the socialistic government in 1948 was returned to previous owners. Since all national parks (NPs) in Slovakia were created after 1948, much of the land within the parks is now privately-owned. However, the Nature Protection Act provides that the state will compensate private land owners for economic losses associated with any hindrance of their ability to use their property for economic gain but has not been realised yet. In order to generate economic profit within the shortest time period money generating activities e.g. timber, intensive tourism with the resulting emphasis on natural resource exploitation and over land-use, are provided.
   Competence in decision making process
   Under the present decision-making structure, NPs serves as an advisory body to the state administration. Most decisions affecting national parks are made by state administration and municipalities where most first hand knowledge and the needs of local communities are concentrated, but where also private interests of local stakeholders are more visible. Hence professional experience and skills concentrated within the NPs cannot be fully applied and their competence is limited to assistance with illegal constructions within the park or other radical activities, instead of active management of the park tied to sustainable land use.
   The major part of the paper focus on the description of the most common methods used in valuation of environmental values, focusing on traditional economic methods based on such real market observations as hedonic prices, opportunity costs, travel costs methods, as well as hypothetical market egg., contingent valuation, etc. Special attention is paid to the description of methods of complex environmental valuation, applicable directly for decision-making process (positional analysis).
   Finally, possibilities for the application of methods of environmental valuation under transitional economies are discussed in the conclusion.
   However research in valuation of environmental entities is a relatively undeveloped field in the Slovak Republic. Thus, my hopes are that this paper will help make these methods fully operational tools in policy and administrative decision-making.

AB This paper forms a part of the research project oriented on the development and support of the democratic decision making process and sustainable development at the local level in transition economies: The main task war to show that environmental valuation form crucial elements of a successful planning process especially when dealing with intrinsic and philanthropic values associated with sustainable development.
   Most critical problems in decision making and nature protection under the economy in transition are addressed in the introduction. Part two discuss theoretical and methodological premises of several fundamental approaches to valuation of environmental good; with special emphasis on direct measurement of individual preferences - contingent valuation. Finally, part three deals with the first application of this approach in the Slovak Republic. Case study is based on survey research where preferences of various stakeholders (visitors, residents, local enterprises, municipalities, state administration and others), were taken into account in the initial phase of the planning process.

AB This paper examines recent modeling efforts and case studies to evaluate the economic viability of off-grid renewable energy technologies for rural application in developing countries. Case studies have been conducted for a representative sample of 41 households from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, who have operating experience of at least one year with small, off-grid wind (less than 400 W) and photovoltaic (less than 150 W-p) systems, Our analyses indicate that levelized costs of off-grid, household-scale renewable energy systems are cost-competitive with conventional gasoline gen-sets and PV/wind hybrid systems appear to be an economic means of providing year-round electricity service and meeting the rising energy demands of remote households in Inner Mongolia, Policy recommendations for spurring the market development of renewable energy technologies in developing countries are provided in the final section of the paper, (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The public, industry, and governments have become increasingly interested in green design and sustainable development. Construction activities affect the environment significantly, so environmental issues should be considered seriously. Thousands of miles of roads are paved every year with asphalt and steel-reinforced concrete. What are the environmental effects of the two materials? If asphalt has been used overwhelmingly over concrete, is it a better choice for sustainable development? We present results of a life cycle inventory analysis of the two materials based on publicly available data. We find that for the initial construction of equivalent pavement designs, asphalt appears to have higher energy input, lower ore and fertilizer input requirements, and lower toxic emissions, but it has higher associated hazardous waste generation and management than steel-reinforced concrete. When accounting for the uncertainty in the data and when annualizing environmental effects based on assumed average service lives of the two pavement types, the resource input requirements and the environmental outputs are roughly comparable for the two materials. However, asphalt pavements have been recycled in larger quantities than concrete pavements, with consequent resource savings and avoided pollution, which suggests that asphalt may be a better choice from a sustainable development viewpoint. Of course, special functional requirements or economics may dictate the use of one material over the other in particular applications regardless of the overall environmental effects.

TI Bilateral monopoly: A market for intercountry river water allocation

DE bilateral agreements; water markets; efficient allocation
AB Collaboration of countries with an aim to share fresh surface water resources promises to generate potential joint benefits. Unfortunately, existing agreements lack the perspective and capacity to produce any real action in efficient cross-border water allocation. When that problem is encountered by any two adjacent countries claiming riparian rights to the same watercourse, this paper suggests that a possible solution to be examined is a water market. This market requires the relevant countries to engage in a bargaining process as described in the theory of bilateral monopoly. The bargaining process should determine both the water quantity to be transferred and the price to be paid. However, there has to be a fair allocation of the joint benefits resulting from the transfer for a sustainable price solution. As an empirical illustration, the paper examines the case of river Nestos shared by Bulgaria and Greece in the southern Balkans. A net revenue function quadratic in water is specified and estimated using scarce data on three agricultural crops in Greece. Sensitivity analysis on the size and distribution of the net benefits is also performed.

ID POPULATION; AMERICA; FORESTS
AB Key causes of tropical deforestation are investigated using cross-sectional data for 90 developing countries for the period 1981-1990. Regression results reveal that deforestation is associated with both development and scarcity. Deforestation accelerates with expanding infrastructure, trade, debt, investment in the human capital base, and resource-based economic expansion. On the other hand, absolute and relative scarcities-manifested by growing population pressures, food and land shortages, fuelwood dependency, and inequalities in access to land-are also key factors explaining forest loss. Thus, results point to a fundamental environmental conundrum: Development is required if countries are to alleviate scarcity-driven forms of forest exploitation but is itself a major cause of deforestation. Can countries balance development goals with forest protection? Setting aside the issue of its practical realization, the paper concludes that forest sustainable development cannot be achieved by implementing simple technical improvements in land-use practices alone. Securing the foundations for the sustainability of the forest base will require that countries address the underlying social processes driving tropical forest loss as well.

AB This paper discusses a practical, computerised eco-management system for agriculture which has been developed at the University of Hertfordshire, UK for use by farmers and their advisers to encourage more sustainable practices. The research and software development has been funded by the UK's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Milk Development Council. The computerised system helps to measure environmental performance by evaluating an eco-rating that compares actual farm practices and site-specific details with what is perceived to be the best practice for that site using an expert system together with scoring and ranking techniques. The eco-ratings system utilises a positive-negative scale to aid transparency and interpretation. In practical terms this means that undesirable and unsustainable activities will lead to negative eco-ratings. Activities which adhere to the principles of best practice and sustainable agriculture will lead to positive eco-ratings. The zero position may then be interpreted as representing an environmentally benign activity. In support of the assessment, the system incorporates modules to explore "What If" scenarios and a hypertext information system. This paper describes the approaches and methodologies used to develop the eco-ratings and outlines the software which utilises these indices within a comprehensive decision-support framework.

AB One of the most visible symptoms of eutrophication in the Gulf of Finland is blooms of unattached filamentous algae. This decomposing algal biomass causes serious nuisance problems for recreational uses of the coastal zone, particularly when cast ashore. The nutrient availability for these macroscopic filamentous algae is regulated by a superior competitor, the phytoplankton. Nutrients are left for the weaker competitor only when the conditions are not suitable for the growth of phytoplankton. This happens during vertical mixing of the water column. The lack of stratification prevents the formation of phytoplankton blooms, but does not limit the growth of filamentous algae when still growing attached to the bottom. A simple growth model was developed to describe the growth and biomass of filamentous algae. In the absence of suitable nutrient measurements, the model was linked to a 3D-ecohydrodynamic model which generated the nutrient input data. The model was calibrated with three-year monitoring data of filamentous algal biomass at one location. Validation was carried out with one-year monitoring data from an adjacent location. The model was able to describe the number of biomass peaks and their timing with good accuracy. After further development, the filamentous algal model will be used as one of the management tools for the evaluation of the sustainable nutrient load to the Gulf of Finland.

AB Nitrogen plays an important role in animal production because it is essential for the production of animal tissue, milk, eggs and wool. Grasses provide more than 70% of the global protein intake by animals. Two-thirds of the remaining protein is supplied by feedstuffs and one-third by products like kitchen wastes. The global efficiency of nitrogen in animal production is slightly over 10%, with the result that 102 Tg (10(12) gram) nitrogen are excreted on a yearly basis by all domesticated animals. This article presents the nitrogen balance sheets for global animal production, global crop production and the global agricultural sector. It discusses the present nitrogen efficiency in animal production and possible improvements. For a sustainable world it is necessary to study and to establish the desired balance between human food and animal feed production.

AB In its policy and indicators work on agriculture and the environment, the OECD has been addressing a large range of policy relevant issues of concern to countries, including the issue of nutrient use in agriculture. The policy issue in the case of agricultural nutrient use is to maintain sufficient nutrients to ensure the sustainable use of soil resources to improve crop and forage productivity, while reducing surplus nutrients from agriculture from causing water and air pollution. It is against this background that the paper describes the overall policy context of the nutrient use issue, in particular nitrogen use. The paper examines the use of the soil surface nitrogen balance indicator in the OECD work to analyse national trends in nitrogen use, and examines the data requirements, availability and coverage to complete nitrogen balance calculations. A brief overview of the current situation and recent trends in national nitrogen balance across OECD Member countries is provided. Finally, the paper discusses the interpretation of trends in national nitrogen balances, including consideration of benchmarks and targets, linkages with other agri-environmental issues, such as water quality, and also future challenges for quantitative work on nitrogen use issue in agriculture.

TI Nitrate in sources of drinking water? Dutch drinking water companies aim

DE drinking-water; nitrate; prevention, linear programming, costs
AB In the Netherlands 65% of the drinking water is extracted from groundwater. A quarter of the groundwater wells, in particular those on the sandy soils in the east and the south of the country, face rising levels of nitrate, mainly of agricultural origin. In 1998 the Dutch Government launched a policy (MINAS) which aims at a drastic reduction in nitrate leaching by 2010. However, this program will not achieve a sufficient reduction in leaching on the dry sandy soils in the east and south of the country. As a result, drinking water companies are facing purification costs of US$ 35-70 million/year, by the next century. So far, the Government has failed to introduce additional policies. Therefore drinking water companies have extended their own preventive approach, aimed at reducing the total nitrogen load in a catchment area to a sustainable level. In this approach extra measures are to be taken in those parts of the area where they are most effective and cost-effective. This can compensate for higher nitrate leaching in other parts of the area, as long as the average nitrate concentration is safe below the norm of 50 mg NO3/l. That opens the door to a wide range of measures: e.g. taking land out of cultivation, supporting farmers to change to organic farming, contracting farmers to grow low-leaching crops, and so on. Different measures can supplement each other. The most cost-effective set of measures for each specific catchment area is generated by means of a linear programming model.

AB The Basic Rule of Environmental Hygiene BREH (DIETER 1996; 1998b) is a suitable starting point for proactive chemicals management. Three definitions (double right arrow LV) for corresponding proactive LVs can be derived from the BREH:
   (1) Functional anthropogenic exposure of the type residues = substance group B is accepted at least at a minimal technical threshold F-B > 0 to maintain desired functionality distinctly below the most sensitive adverse effect threshold E-alpha, (0 < F-B double right arrow LVB < E-a).
   (2) Group C exposure = Non functional contaminants (F-c = 0) is to be tolerated only at technically low if not "zero" levels T-c, hence 0 = F-c < T-c double right arrow LVC < less than or equal to E-a.
   (3) Group A = natural exposure with neither a technical background nor defined functionality (N-A = F-A greater than or equal to 0). It may be tive of how wide or narrow the margin of safety between both might be (0 much less than N-A double right arrow LVA less than or equal to E-a).
   The BREH is not only a suitable starting point for finding proactive LVs, but also for sustainable environmental care by responsible management of chemicals. Additionally, it helps to minimize "adverse effects" at the level of society by motivating competing groups to follow conflicting interests in a consensual manner.

AB The increasing demands of the global economy and our growing human population exert profound effects on the ecosystem. As a species, we have an essential need for quality air, water, and soil and a diversity of living organisms, so any vision of a sustainable future must be formulated on the basis of their protection. Decisions on the most effective ways to protect ecosystems must be prioritized on the basis of science and our understanding of the most important factors that affect wildlife populations. In the case of endocrine disrupters, it is important that further research be conducted (1) to determine the status and trends of wildlife populations and the evidence for a widespread effect of endocrine disrupters, (2) to determine the extent to which species differences in the mechanisms that control reproduction and development will affect their sensitivity to endocrine disrupters, and (3) to ensure full validation and refinement of new test methods for assessing the effects of endocrine disrupters across diverse species. Premature implementation of testing and assessment methods for endocrine disrupters, without appropriate consideration of the above points, may result in assessment schemes that placate public opinion but neither alleviate the major factors affecting wildlife populations nor protect diverse species with distinctive endocrine systems.

DE randomization; economics; common-pool resources
AB The relatively recent movement to test economic theory and policy in the laboratory has placed new demands upon researchers' data analysis skills. Without any idea of the distribution of errors about the mean, researchers are often forced to resort to a battery of tests in case some of the assumptions for a particular test are not met. Their efforts are further hampered by the small sample size generally associated with laboratory data. The exact randomization technique permits the researcher to make use of standard parametric tests (avoiding the less powerful non-parametric techniques) with few restrictive distributional assumptions. In this paper, the exact randomization t-test is used to analyse data from a common-pool resource experiment, The model used to generate payoffs in the laboratory shares the characteristics of many environmental situations, particularly those associated with sustainable development. The results indicate that monitoring, on its own, serves to make people more competitive over resource use. Only when monitoring is backed up by some punishment scheme such as sanctioning, do groups achieve some success in governing themselves. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Mustard (Brassica napus) is an important oilseed crop grown in semi-arid subtropical soils of South Asia. Information on its fertilizer N and S requirements, nitrogen supplying value of green manure, and complimentary and synergistic effects of green manure and fertilizer N is needed for the development of a sustainable mustard-rice cropping system. A field experiment was conducted for 4 years (1990-1991 to 1993-1994) to evaluate the effects of different rates of fertilizer N and S with or without cowpea green manuring on yield, nutrient uptake, protein and oil content of mustard. The residual effects of green manuring were assessed on the succeeding rice crop.
   The seed yield of mustard increased significantly up to 100 kg N ha(-1), but decreased thereafter with further increase in fertilizer N rate (150 kg N ha(-1)). Cowpea grown as green manure crop in situ for 45-50 days during September-October, prior to seeding of mustard, accumlated 62-86 kg N ha(-1). Green manuring, in the absence of fertilizer N, significantly increased the mustard yield. All through the 4 years, the combined application of green manure with 100 kg N ha(-1) (otherwise optimum rate) further improved the yield potential of mustard, illustrating the benefit that any amount of fertilizer N cannot achieve. Green manuring to mustard substantially improved the yield (920 kg ha(-1)) of the succeeding crop of rice. Protein concentration in mustard seed increased greatly from 14.0% in the control to 21.6% under fertilizer N and S treatments. Application of 100 kg N ha(-1) + 20 kg S ha(-1) + green manure increased the oil yield to 992 kg compared with 518 kg in the control. These results illustrated the complementary effects of green manuring in conjunction with the optimum rates of 100 kg N and 20 kg S ha(-1) in maximizing the yields, uptake of N and S, protein, percentage of oil and oil production in mustard and its residual effect on succeeding rice crop.

AB We consider a three sector demoeconomic model and its interdependence with the accumulation of human capital and resources. The primary sector harvests a renewable resource which constitutes the input into industrial production, the secondary sector of our economy. Both sectors are always affected by the stock of knowledge. The tertiary sector is responsible for the accumulation of this stock that represents a public good for all three sectors. Labour is divided up between the three sectors under the assumption of competitive labour markets. The economy exhibits two externalities - free access to renewable resource harvesting and the existence of a public stock of knowledge - that are not properly reflected in competitive markets. We internalize these externalities by taxing the output of the primary sector and use these taxes together with taxes on labour income to finance the inputs of the tertiary sector. The central focus of this study is whether and what kind of interactions between the economy, the population and the environment foster sustainability and if possible, continuous growth.

AB Farmers' maize (Zea mays) yields in semiarid Kenya are low because of low and erratic rainfall and soil nutrient depletion. An experiment was conducted in Machakos, Kenya, during November 1989-July 1995 to explore the potential of hedgerow intercropping (HI) with Leucaena leucocephala as an alternative strategy to the use of inorganic fertilizers for improving maize yields in semiarid bimodal highlands. The study, conducted in a randomized block design with three replications, evaluated on an operational scale with four treatments: sole maize with or without fertilizer; and HI with prunings of L. leucocephala hedges used as green manure or with prunings and maize stover fed to oxen and manure returned to soil. About 1.4 t ha(-1) of L. leucocephala foliar biomass and 1.2 t ha(-1) manure were incorporated each season in green-manure and ox-manure systems, respectively. Although sole maize responded to inorganic fertilizer in six of 11 seasons, maize yield was improved by HI, with prunings used as green manure, only once, 5 yrs after the commencement of the study, when rainfall exceeded 500 mm. Over the experimental period, maize yields were 15% and 30% less in green-manure and ox-manure systems, respectively, than in unfertilized maize, primarily because of the competition of hedgerows with crops for water. The fodder system of HI recycled only 27% of N and 50% of P exported from the field in fodder, grain and stover, and depleted nutrients more than the other systems. The green-manure system made a positive N balance, with similar P depletion as in the fodder system. No changes were detected in soil organic carbon or cations in any of the systems during the experimental period while extractable P was significantly improved by fertilizing maize. Net present value of returns from fertilizing maize at 40 kg N and 18 kg P ha(-1) was 10% higher than from the unfertilized control. Fertilizer use would be 25% more profitable, however, if P were applied only to match the amount of P removed by crop (9 kg P ha(-1) per season) and if maize were not topdressed (amounting to 50% of the recommended N) in poor rainfall seasons. Of the two HI systems, only the fodder system was more profitable than either system of sole-cropped maize because the high value of fodder more than compensated the smaller maize yield obtained in HI. However, the fodder system may not give higher economic returns than a sole L. leucocephala fodder bank. Hence, HI using competitive species such as L. leucocephala and with the level of productivity observed in this study, is not appropriate for semiarid climates to increase cereal yields, either directly through green manuring or indirectly by fodder production and nutrient cycling through livestock.

AB This article is based on a paper, "The Banking Sector's Role in Restructuring of CEEC Economies (Case Study of the Czech Republic)", that was presented at a workshop held in Vienna in May, 1997. The study deals with problems of restructuring the Czech economy as regards i) the effect of privatization on the restructuring process and its circumstances, and ii) the role of the financial sector in the restructuring process as such.
   According to the study, the circumstances of the privatization process (its chosen forms, speed, type of new owner and the like) determine to a great extent the need for external capital resources for enterprises, the possibility and farms of acquisitions etc.
   The study then tries to summarize the possible ways in which enterprises can acquire the necessary funds, i.e. to identify specific "capital channels". From this point of view it deals with self-financing through home capital, foreign portfolio investments, and - last but not least - foreign direct investments. Foreign loans and direct credits to enterprises are also included.
   The last part of the article draws certain conslucions about the commercial banks' role in the restructuring process. The bank credits are discussed in terms of their compatibility and/or sustainability with other "capital channels".

AB Recent reviews of government mandates and restructuring of the forest industry are changing roles and responsibilities in forest management in Canada. Companies are increasingly responsible for operational management while federal and provincial governments are focusing more on forest-related policies and regulations, altering in turn the context for forest research.
   The adoption of sustainable development as a policy framework is forging stronger links among policy makers, operational forest managers and researchers. Collaboration is growing among research organizations, often in partnerships with clients, in spite of a more competitive fiscal environment. The need to bring the relevant expertise to bear on the issues of sustainable forest development is reinforcing interaction among biological scientists, economists and social scientists, often through computerized communications and information exchange.
   Mechanisms have been established by government to develop a common agenda for forest science and technology by all stakeholders, similar to China's Agenda 21. International agreements such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Convention on Biological Diversity are exerting increasing influence and demand for additional scientific and technological information.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Soil quality is one of the most important factors in sustaining the global biosphere and developing sustainable agricultural practices. It has been defined in several different ways in recent years from view points of bioproductivity, sustainability, environmental protection, and human and animal health. In this paper, soil quality refers to its capacity to meet the need of plant growth. Land use and management practices greatly impact the direction and degree of soil quality changes in time and space. Understanding the effects of land use and management practices on soil quality and its indicators has been identified as one of the most important goals for modern soil science. This paper presents a method for assessing and mapping soil quality changes in time and space in small watersheds. It was developed and used to evaluate the changes in soil quality after 11 years of reclamation at Qian-Yan-Zhou experimental station (QYZES), which is located in subtropical China. Changes in soil quality was assessed and analyzed for cropland, citrus orchards, pastureland, grassland, sparse weed land, artificial forests, natural forests, bare land and other land uses. The Qian-Yan-Zhou Soil Quality Information System (QYZSQIS) has been developed using ARC/INFO and FOXBASE software. Two concepts of Relative Soil Quality Index (RSQI) and its difference (Delta RSQI) are introduced and used in the evaluation and analyses. By combining the QYZSQIS with databases of soil properties for different time periods, the system provides an effective method for evaluating soil quality changes in time and space in small watersheds. The RSQI provides a standard for comparing regional soil quality and the Delta RSQI a standard for evaluating soil quality changes over time. After 11 years of reclamation, there was a decrease in the area of both low quality and high quality soils, while medium quality soils increased. In terms of land use systems, the soil quality in paddy fields, vegetable fields and citrus orchards was dominated by improvement, whereas fuel woods, sparse weed land, and bare land were mainly degraded. Annual grass played an important role in the conservation and improvement of soil quality in the area. Except for land uses and management practices, original soil quality level also plays a major role in soil quality changes. Soils with higher quality were degraded more rapidly, because they usually need more nutrient input to maintain their quality status than those with lower quality. These analyses show that it is of equal importance to improve soil quality in degraded locations and to sustain it in high-quality areas. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO HOLZ ALS ROH-UND WERKSTOFF
LA German
DT Article
AB The interest of economy and policy as well as research and development is focussed on the "reduction of carbondioxid-emissions" and the "sustainable development" Therefore the thermal utilization of biological material as fuel has become most important.
   Among the biological material wood, and especially waste wood, has a particular position. Concerning the thermal utilization of wood/waste wood the gasification is advantageous compared to the combustion, because of the possibility to generate electric current in a gasmotor or a gasturbine. To optimize the utilization of the caloric value under economical and technical aspects decentral concepts and fixed bed gasifiers should be applied.
   In Middle and East Europe experts determine a considerable requirement for gasification plants of 1 to 5 MWth. Unfortunately none of the existing gasification concepts can guarantee a safe and efficient, much less a continuous operation.
   The article describes the principles of different gasification concepts (such as fixed bed or fluidized bed gasifiers), the disadvantages and benefits of the types of fixed bed gasifiers as well as the experiences gained at several pilot plants. The demand for research and development is discussed.

CT International Conference on Water and Sustainable Development
CY MAR 19-21, 1998

AB This article describes current schools of thought on water as a finite resource and, as such, a factor to be contended within the pursuit of sustainable development. The media, in inflating this topic, has tended to create stereotypes in the minds of the public and the leaders of opinion. These issues must be put into their proper perspective if a constructive debate is to ensue.
   The four main schools of thought, addressed schematically in this article are as follows:
   the neo-Malthusian school, which focuses on water as a key factor in global food security and asserts that, overall, rite continued growth of man-made pressures on the hydrological cycle cannot fail to have adverse consequences for Biodiversity
   the Planning-centred approach which places the emphasis on water resources as all aspect of economic development at the state level,
   the Geostrategic viewpoint, which stresses transboundary issues and the vulnerability of certain nations due to their lack of autonomy regarding water resources,
   the Economy-centred theory which advocates market mechanisms as a means of regulating resource allocation.
   This works by conciliating the interests of the individual with those of the economic community through instruments such as fees, incentives and water right transactions.

AB Renewable energy technologies offer many advantages for energy supply and sustainable development. Meanwhile, their large scale deployment is often difficult to achieve due to the harsh competition with fossil fuels, both for comfort and ease of use for decision makers and users and for direct cost competitiveness, which often do not take into account the social and environmental costs. So, the example of Hydro Power which is still the main non fossil source for electricity in the world and which continues to develop strong markets is presented here as a success story which could be repeated in the short and medium term by other renewable energy technologies. Moreover, as only a small part of the world hydro technical potential has been tapped, the hydropower contribution to sustainable development will be secured in the future, as well as for large scale projects including new technologies and behaviour to lower potential impacts on local environment and for small hydropower projects well designed for rural electrification in developing countries.

AB Hydrobiologia, with which I have had a long association, is celebrating its 50th anniversary in 1998. This year is also the 200th anniversary of Robert Malthus' still hotly debated publication on overpopulation. Readers of Hydrobiologia know well the impacts on the water resource of a growing human population, increased per capita affluence, major industrialization over much of the planet, and the explosion of new technologies that have effects on the water resource. Those concerned with the integrity and condition of water resources should be deeply involved in the debate on the exemption of human society from the biophysical laws of nature and its dependence on the life support services of ecosystems. Arguably, water resources will be the main battleground on which this debate is resolved. This discussion is a preliminary exploration of the primary issues. Even though the word water does not appear frequently in this paper, the connection to our profession and the future of the hydrobiological ecosystem and Hydrobiologia is present in every page.

AB Routine metabolic rate (RMR) and heart rate (HR) were measured simultaneously in 15 degrees C-acclimated and free swimming European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The RMR fell within the boundaries previously reported for that species, i.e. the standard metabolic rate and the LOCMO2-curve which describes the relationship between maximum sustainable oxygen consumption (MO2) and water oxygen concentration (CwO2). Heart rates values distributed below a LOCHR-curve which figures the relationship between the maximum HR and CwO2. A mathematical model describing this relationship is proposed. Using the LOCMO2- and LOCHR-curves, the range of the correlated changes of HR and MO2 is delimited. The influence of CwO2 on these limits is also considered and discussed. Two examples illustrating the limiting effect of low ambient oxygenation level on fish metabolic demand are described.

AB We sampled periphyton in dominant habitats at oligotrophic and eutrophic sites in the northern Everglades during the wet and the dry seasons to determine the effects of nutrient enrichment on periphyton biomass, taxonomic composition, productivity, and phosphorus storage. Areal biomass was high (100-1600 g ash-free dry mass [AFDM] m(-2)) in oligotrophic sloughs and in stands of the emergent macrophyte Eleocharis cellulosa, but was low in adjacent stands of sawgrass, Cladium jamaicense (7-52 g AFDM m(-2)). Epipelon biomass was high throughout the year at oligotrophic sites whereas epiphyton and metaphyton biomass varied seasonally and peaked during the wet season. Periphyton biomass was low (3-68 g AFDM m(-2)) and limited to epiphyton and metaphyton in open-water habitats at eutrophic sites and was undetectable in cattail stands (Typha domingensis) that covered more than 90% of the marsh in these areas. Oligotrophic periphyton assemblages exhibited strong seasonal shifts in species composition and were dominated by cyanobacteria (e.g., Chroococcus turgidus, Scytonema hofmannii) during the wet season and diatoms (e.g. Amphora lineolata, Mastogloia smithii) during the dry season. Eutrophic assemblages were dominated by Cyanobacteria (e.g., Oscillatoria princeps) and green algae (e.g., Spirogyra spp.) and exhibited comparatively little seasonality. Biomass-specific gross primary productivity (GPP) of periphyton assemblages in eutrophic open waters was higher than for comparable slough assemblages, but areal GPP was similar in these eutrophic (0.9-9.1 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and oligotrophic (1.75-11.49 g C m(-2) d(-1)) habitats. On a habitat-weighted basis, areal periphyton GPP was 6- to 30-fold lower in eutrophic areas of the marsh due to extensive Typha stands that were devoid of periphyton. Periphyton at eutrophic sites had higher P content and uptake rates than the oligotrophic assemblage, but stored only 5% as much P because of the lower areal biomass. Eutrophication in the Everglades has resulted in a decrease in periphyton biomass and its contribution to marsh primary productivity. These changes may have important implications for efforts to manage this wetland in a sustainable manner.

AB The paradigm of sustainable construction has substituted in recent years the paradigm of industrialized housing construction that was basically based on prefabrication techniques: the substitution of manpower by capital. Habitat 11 Conference -Istanbul, June 1996- has reinforced the vision and necessity of a sustainable development of the urban space supported by decentralization policies, small scale production, local-resources utilization, recycling of production processes and construction residues, reduction of embodied energy in buildings and infrastructural works, among other factors. This concept affects the organization of the productive process and the production units, the building materials industry, the specialization of the labour force, the equipment and tools used in the process, just as other exogenous factors like transportation. But, parallel to the generalized (globalize) objective of sustainable construction, the materials. and building technical processes are modified through the innovations, from other branches of the scientific-technologic knowledge like materials science, biotechnology, solid states physics, organic and inorganic chemistry, process engineering production engineering and management, and other interdisciplinary areas. The tendency is towards an approach they call technological syncretism in housing production (Cilento, 1996a). In this essay are analyzed with that syncretic vision the processes of construction innovations and its limitations, the importance of building products life-cycle analysis, the idea of technological, economical. social and ecological sustainability of construction, and the tendencies in new materials and processes that affects -any way- the professionals, promoters, contractors and the users.

AB This article sums up some of the main events of the economic downturn in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea. With a well functioning bankruptcy mechanism, and with relatively greater reliance in small-scale businesses, Taiwan has benefited from more continuous 'creative destruction', along Schumpeterian lines. In order to return to a sustainable growth path an acceptable distribution of the losses entailed by, e.g., falling assets prices, must be found. The experience of banking crises in the US and Norway is of relevance here. In contrast to foreign banks' lending in Africa and Latin America the bulk of outstanding loans in Asian countries is to private rather than public entities. This makes bail-out of foreign banks less likely.

AB Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure is considered as the most dominant paradigm of development in the recent years. It consists of the information transfer mechanisms like newspapers, radio, television, telephones, mobile phones, far machines, Internet hosts, computers etc. The key component of the new paradigms is to provide greater equality in the distribution of these ICT parameters to facilitate development It is believed that constructive changes in the socio-economic development of the nations could be established only through the widespread diffusion of ICT infrastructure among the communities. There are a number of other fields that have been affected by the development of ICT Besides, there seems to be a strong correlation between the growth of ICT related activities and the development in the national economy, the evidence for which is found in a ss ies of reports. The penetration of ICT parameters ensures a competitive economy, democracy and nation building. [I] A greater percentage of the Gross National product (GNP) has been accounted through knowledge, communication, and information work. [2] The economic advancement of the majority of the developed nations has been attributed to their fast and widespread diffusion of ICT. [3] Apart from these, in several countries ICT has become the largess component of fixed capital formation. Those countries which intend to participate actively in the world economy could not afford to ignore the development ICT in their regions. [4] In order to establish a wider distribution of informatics, a vast majority of the developed countries have framed effective ICT related polices and operational strategies conducive to achieve their goals.

AB Productivity and cost performance within the UK construction industry must improve substantially if the demands of the industry's clients are to be met. Experience also dictates that this must be accomplished without compromising standards of quality and individuality. One way to achieve this goal would be for designers, suppliers, specialists and clients to work together and adopt an integrated strategy for business process improvement and change. This paper will discuss the application of the concept of business process reengineering and outlines a methodology whereby this can and has been achieved in construction. The relationship between information technology (IT) and BPR for construction projects is subsequently developed. Following this is a description of clients' perceptions, detailing their views on the potential for IT within the construction process. The key factors which IT must address if it is to become accepted within a construction project following the reengineering process are discussed. Finally, if the strategy for sustainable performance improvement were to be widely adopted, the implications for the industry are discussed and key recommendations are posited.

   urban sustainability
AB The concept of sustainable development is steadily approaching recognition, if not full disciplinary autonomy, becoming the focus of new theoretical and normative reflection. However, the same cannot be said of a more specific field of application of that same concept - the urban environment. In our opinion, this has been hindered until recently by some unresolved problems - of definition, methodology and epistemology - intrinsic in the more general concept, and also by some specificities of the urban case that have not been sufficiently borne in mind. This paper aims at directly facing these unresolved problems, and proposes a definition on which later empirical studies and new theoretical elaborations may be based. A city is, by nature, a manufact, an almost entirely artificial object, constructed for historical goals of socialization, synergy, increase of knowledge and social wellbeing. A 'weak' concept of sustainability, which permits ample substitutability between production inputs and utility function inputs, is almost impossible to avoid. When considering the problem in its entirety, we must combine the sociocultural, economic and environmental elements, which all go towards the construction of that complex set of relations we call city. Sustainable urban development may be defined as a process of synergetic integration and coevolution among the great subsystems making up a city (economic, social, physical and environmental). which guarantees the local population a nondecreasing level of wellbeing in the long term, without compromising the possibilities of development of surrounding areas and contributing by this towards reducing the harmful effects of development on the biosphere.

AB Sustainable development has become a globally accepted policy objective. It is however, increasingly recognized that the implementation of sustainability strategies has to take place at a decentralized level. This has also provoked the idea of urban sustainability. This paper aims to offer a refreshing contribution by making a plea for market solutions for urban sustainability problems. particular attention is given to the potential contribution of tradeable permits for various polluting activities (air pollution, water pollution, congestion energy consumption, etc.). The idea is that such market strategies may favour efficiency, equity and environmental quality in the city. An overview of various possibilities is given, followed by policy guidelines and conclusions.

AB Much of the debate over urban sustainability has revolved around the key components of sustainable development, and this has resulted in the identification of key concepts and principles that should be followed. Very little attention has been given to the difficulties encountered in the implementation of urban sustainability. This paper sets out the background to urban sustainability within clearly parameters, namely land, energy and transport. Development principles are established and the implementation issues me addressed at four levels: decisions relating to the use of existing resources; decisions relating to new development; decisions relating to transport; and decisions relating to increasing energy efficiency within urban areas. At each level, the objectives of sustainability, together with the key concerns and actions, are described. The barriers to implementation explain why progress towards urban sustainability has been slow. Recommendations are presented as to how these barriers can be overcome so that the: objectives of urban sustainability can be matched with other objectives, such as improvement of the quality of life in urban areas.

AB Following the emergence of sustainable development as a key environmental management concept in the late 1980s, much discussion and debate has occurred pn how the general concept can be understood in the context of particular resources, economic sectors and fields of academic study. This paper attempts to integrate two such particular areas of study, urban development and fresh water resources management. Following an overview of the concept of sustainable development, where the flesh water resource base is used to illustrate different interpretations of sustainability, the paper advances a number of perceptions of the sustainable city and the implications far fresh water management. Key concepts that emerge include a need to reduce the urban ecological sphere of influence, best understood in the context of a quasi-autonomous vision of the sustainable city, requiring a radical shift away from 'engineering-fix' water supply augmentation towards demand management and other approaches that sit more easily with the prime need to maintain the functional integrity of ecosystems.

ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; COMPACT CITY
AB This paper considers the implications of changing land use and transport patterns in cities in Central and Eastern Europe. It reviews experience elsewhere, primarily in Western Europe, where a spiral of increasing mobility and dispersal is widely acknowledged to be environmentally, socially and economically unsustainable. Policies being adopted at different scales in attempts to modify these trends are outlined, and some considerations for CEE cities are highlighted. It is argued that sustainable land use and transport systems are a matter of political choice.

DE densities; local policy; PPG13; sustainable development
AB This paper reports on a research project investigating the relationship between travel behaviour and residential densities. The specific focus is on the question of local authority attitudes to raising density standards as current policy suggests they should be doing. The results of a survey of English district councils are presented. The survey tries to identify the degree to which density standards have been changed in response to policy. The results suggest widespread resistance to the raising of standards, implying that the urban compaction agenda is being undermined. The paper finishes with thoughts on the reasons for this resistance.

AB Sustainable urban development consists of the intentional construction of a dynamic balance between the different logics of the private, public, social (or civil) and natural economic systems, through new organizational rules. These are the institutions. For a co-evolution of the four systems they should not only ensure the conservation of natural and man-made capital, but also produce human and social capital. The production of social capital is the crucial issue for the sustainable development of cities: without this form of capital, any strategy of institutional techno-modernization (either decentralized or centralized) is bound to fail.

AB This paper presents an overview of the environmental consequences of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture and the measures needed to mitigate the adverse impact of these chemicals on environment. The issues are then analysed from the perspective of the use of fertilizers and pesticides in Indian agriculture. Fertilizer consumption in India is concentrated in about one-third of the cultivated area. Its use has been increasing but it is being used inefficiently. Pesticide use is also concentrated in five states and on a few crops such as rice, cotton and chillies. Evidence from micro studies on the environmental consequences of these chemicals is presented. It is suggested that the present methods of fertilizer and pesticide use and growth are not sustainable. There are several possible technologies and alternatives to reduce the adverse impact of these chemicals on the environment, such as biological control of pests, integrated pest management, development of pest-resistant varieties of crops, vermiculture, etc., that need to be supplemented through an economic approach. These issues need to be considered while formulating strategies for sustainable agriculture in India and other developing countries.

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Two of the key concepts of the modern era have been development and economic growth. From the early very close identification between the two has emerged the concept of human development, which includes economic growth but goes beyond it, More recently still, because of unambiguous evidence of serious damage to the global environment, the concept of sustainable development has also gained currency. By exploring the contribution of the environment to the economy and human welfare, the paper weaves together the notions of human and sustainable development to derive a new paradigm for the next century.

AB The concept of 'sustaining production' is based on an integrated understanding of sustainability that recognizes the limits to the regenerative capacity of natural and social systems within which all economic activity takes place. Sustaining production thus is defined as a quantity and quality of production that does not result in perturbations of natural and social systems that impede their assimilative and regenerative capacities to a critical degree. This definition places production not only within the temporal and spatial context of biological and ecological processes and functions but also within the socio-cultural context of social processes and functions. The knowledge demand of sustaining production is dramatically different from the standard concept of production put forth in mainline production theory. Sustaining production requires knowledge particularly of the linkages between production processes and the social, biological, chemical and physical parameters and functions that characterize their context. This contextual knowledge cannot rely on the contributions of experts alone, but needs to include the experience of those who provide essential social and environmental sustaining services, and of those most severely effected by their loss.
   In addition, the need to explicitly consider path-dependent definitions of sustaining production scenarios points to the limits of markets as allocation mechanisms. The need for participatory discourse in the public sphere between markets and macroeconomic institutions is offered as an institutional alternative. An example of narrative methodological expansions to standard economic assessment methods is presented to illustrate possibilities for a broad-based participatory assessment process based on discourse.

AB Strategy model making has become a lucrative and growing industry. This industry appears to have no real purpose but superficially peddles the idea of a turnkey solution which is neither generic nor sustainable. As a result, the solution has now become part of the problem, obscuring the real issue. This paper exposes the risks and limitations associated with the products of the model-making industry in order to demonstrate how organisations should treat strategy formulation and implementation This remains an important but misrepresented area. The approach proposed in this paper links the concepts of continuous revolution with constant evolution in a way that explains competitive survival.

AB The paper sets out our theoretical and empirical approach to delineating predictors of stakeholder performance in medium-sized computer service firms. It combines a resource-based approach with recent insights from the literature on small and medium-sized firms, professional service, and computer-service firms. Top managerial capital (in terms of inspiration, competence, and communication) and organizational capital (in terms of external, professional, and employee orientation as well as networking, financial management, and market focus) are assumed to be major predictors of organizational performance.

AB This research examined the Innovation Process, for 34 UK medical equipment innovations developed by 11 companies, 26 through multiple and continuous interaction between the entrepreneurs and other actors in networks. There were ten stages identified in the innovation cycle and the effective management ensured opportunities for sustainable cost advantage and/or product or process differentiation at the different stages in the cycle. The networking enabled both 'outside and inside product champions' to flourish within a learning process consisting of learning by doing, learning by using and learning by interaction. The speed and flexibility of the innovation process was enhanced by an overlapping approach at the different stages and the sharing of intense and rich information, the latter being enabled through linkages within the organization and with the accumulated knowledge embedded in society and with research. For successful innovation, the integration of the activities of the actors in the network, the management of the sequential learning process, the adoption of an overlapping approach, the linking to knowledge in society, using complementary assets and creating credibility in the innovations was seen as essential.

AB Waters abstraction for irrigated agriculture is a common practice worldwide. It is estimated that in the year 2010, 45% of the total global food production will come from irrigated lands. In developing countries 80% of water, or even more, may be used for irrigation. Many of today's over 36,000 existing dams serve to store water for irrigation. The impact on fish stocks of damming rivers is well known: the riverine fish stocks in dammed rivers decline and in the best circumstances are replaced by fish species of standing waters. The largest demand for irrigation is in arid and semiarid countries. It is there that the species diversity of native fish has most drastically declined, this being mostly accompanied by a decline in fish yields. In regulated rivers, where much of the water is diverted for irrigation, in order to rehabilitate fish stocks and fisheries and then to maintain sustainable yield, fishery managers have been translocating or introducing fish species, in same instances with their fish food organisms. Regular stocking of hatchery produced fingerlings has become a routine in many irrigation reservoirs. Where an increase in water salinity resulted from discharges of drainage waters and high evaporation. more salt-tolerant fish species have been stocked. While some countries of Central Asia have gathered considerable experience with the management of freshwater fish stocks in a diversity of irrigation water bodies, other arid and semiarid countries in the region still need to introduce sound management practices which would result in an efficient and full utilization of irrigation reservoirs, irrigation canals and residual water bodies for fish production. This paper briefly reviews the major achievements and challenges facing fisheries managers in such countries.

AB Fish communities of a small Nigerian reservoir and its upstream were studied from 1984 - 1985 and 1988 - 1989. The number of species upstream was considerably reduced from 1984/1985 to 1988/1989. The fish communities of upstream and reservoir were similar in 1988/1989. The comparison of upstream and reservoir showed that benthic invertivores and mud/detritus feeders were adversely affected by habitat alterations. The numbers of species valued as food were low in both upstream and reservoir. Both these habitats supported a large number of species sought by aquarists. The value of fish communities in evaluating biotic integrity of stream ecosystems and the need for the sustainable management of reservoir fisheries resources are discussed.

TI Settlement and recruitment in fishes: the role of coastal areas
SO ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY

DT Article
DE coastal zone management; fishes; microhabitat; recruitment; settlement;
   visual census
AB A three-year investigation was conducted in littoral areas of Elba Island using visual census to investigate settlement and recruitment of several coastal fish species both unfished and those important to small-scale fisheries. Fish microhabitat preferences at different stages of development were examined to determine features that make these coastal areas suitable for their settlement and recruitment. Post-larvae and recruits of 46 species, belonging to 18 families, were observed in the study area; the most important families were labrids (11 species) and sparids (10 species). Many of the species observed settled in shallow water (< 1 m) and near shore (< 2 m from shore) of littoral rocky areas. Three sparids, Diplodus puntazzo, D. sargus and D. vulgaris, settle in shallow water with a slope of less than 30 degrees and reduced algal cover. They have very similar spatial requests during the first year of their life and they use the nurseries at different time. This is probably an adaptive strategy to reduce inter-specific competition among sea-bream settlers and recruits. Knowledge of fish settlement and spatial requirements are important to develop models for integrated and sustainable coastal zone management.

AB Cellulose acetate electrophoresis of allozymes was used to differentiate the mio endangered Mediterranean killifishes, Aphanius iberus and A. fasciatus. Thirty-eight putative enzyme-coding loci were examined in two populations from the Albuixec lagoon (Spain) and from the Biguglia coastal pond (Corsica). Low within-population polymorphism was detected. The mean number of alleles per locus, percentage of polymorphic loci, and heterozygosity were A = 1.2 (SE 0.1), P-99 = 21.1%, H = 0.050 (SE 0.018) in A. iberus, and A = 1.3 (SE 0.1), P-99 = 28.9%, H = 0.057 (SE 0.019) in A. fasciatus. A general concordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was detected. Allelic distribution for 13 loci proved diagnostic at species level. The genetic distance between the two species analysed was relatively high (D = 0.539), indicating considerable genetic divergence between the mio congeneric species. These results represent a valuable basis for further studies on the genetic structure of Mediterranean cyprinodontids to ensure sustainable management of these species.

ID BASIN
AB The fishes of the Laurentian Great Lakes have been studied and managed with various philosophies involving single species, groups of species, and ecosystems. Only recently has the emphasis shifted to a concern for biodiversity. Biodiversity has been strongly effected by habitat change, loss of indigenous species, introductions, contaminants, and changes in societal attitudes to 'conservation' and resource partitioning. Ar present there are approximately 153 established species in the lakes (not the basin). Of that total, 124 are indigenous, and 30 are naturalized. The number of species now known to have been introduced into the lakes is 57. Introductions result from authorized and unauthorized vectors. Introductions serve to indicate only one of the many impacts. In 1955 the binational Great Lakes Fishery Commission established a three-year study entitled 'The Role of Biodiversity in the Management of the Fishes of the Great Lakes'. The objectives of the study were the elucidation, for fishes, of the historical changes in diversity and zoogeography, food webs and ecological relationships, and human attitudes in regard to sustainability and utilization. The ultimate goal of the study was a set of recommendations to the resource managers that incorporate a concern for the maintenance of biodiversity in the goal of sustainable, consumptive and non-consumptive, use of the resource.

AB The requirement for fish stock conservation became law in 1991 at the same time of the declaration of the Danube Delta as a Biosphere Reserve. Conservation of biodiversity is the major objective of the reserve, with sustainable use of fish stocks introduced as the target objective in the fisheries. The present threat is over-fishing by more fishermen with new fishing gears entering the fishery after abandonment state monopoly economy. The introduction of a Total Allowable Catch was the first strategy adopted for the sustainable use of the fish resources. Poor quality of catch data, lack of fishing effort data, and unfulfilled model assumptions in the estimation of Maximum Sustainable Yield are the principal constraints to achieve this goal. Limiting the fishery to 1000 individual fishing licenses should be one practical regulation for fish stock conservation.

DE fish; marine biodiversity; conservation; Oman
AB The rich and diverse fish resources of Oman constitute its main natural resource after oil and natural gas. A total of 1142 species were identified, distributed among 520 genera and 164 families. Most of these are marine with broad geographical distribution; only four are freshwater species (Cyprinion micropthalmum, Garra barreimie, G. longispinnis, and Oreochromis aureus). The ichthyofauna of Oman is characterized by large number of species in 21 families, comprising 92.6% of the estimated total number of marine families of the whole Indo-Pacific region, and 49.9% of the world's marine families. The Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman are more diverse in fish species (similar to 1000 fish species) than the Arabian Gulf (> 500 fish species). More than 400 species are demersal, 511 species inhabit coral reefs and coastal lagoons, two are mesopelagic species, and the remainder are pelagic (157), bathypelagic (30), and bathydemersal (7 species). Current fishing effort levels on some target species are either close to maximum sustainable yield or exceed it. A shift in species composition has resulted in declining landings of some high value fishes. A pilot aquaculture program has just started with the introduction of sea bream, Sparus aurata and tilapia Oreochromis aureus. Fisheries management is hampered by lack of appropriate management regulations, enforcement, and data on most stocks. Coastal habitats are being threatened by both natural and manmade impacts. Fisheries research programmes are directed to fish taxonomy, ecology, biology, and stock assessment of some commercially important species. An extensive fish database and reference collection are currently being established at Fisheries Science and Technology Department, Sultan Qaboos University. Local human resources are needed to support the rational development and management of fishery resources.

CT AgEng 94 Conference
CY AUG 29-SEP 01, 1994
CL MILAN, ITALY
AB This paper describes a methodology to optimize spatial allocation of multiple agricultural activities following the preferences of a decision maker. The optimization is based on an iterative method which converges to the land use with the largest probability of being the best one. An example application to a pilot area in the centre of Spain shows an outcome which matches the subvention policies, allows sustainable development and fits the social requirements of the population.

   in Nnewi, Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Nnewi is situated some 30 kilometres South East of Onitsha in Anambra State in the southeastern part of Nigeria. This highly commercial town has undergone rapid urbanisation and industrialisation within the past two decades, since the end of the 1967-1970 Nigerian civil war. The Igbo community of the study area had traditionally employed bioconversion methods and other indigenous technology to process or recycle bio and non-degradable wastes. Industrialisation has enjoyed priority status in this locality as a requirement for modernisation and economic progress. The rapid urbanisation, aggressive industrialisation, and the attendant uncontrolled population growth have had a deleterious impact on the environment. There is now a wide range of industrial wastes that are released daily into the environment. Effects of these activities on the socio-cultural practices of the people, plant genetic resources and the environment are highlighted. Ln addition to palliative measures suggested here, a call is made to revisit the successful indigenous waste treatment and management technology formerly practised by the Igbo community. The importance of combining modern biotechnological approaches with the indigenous technology, norms and practices of Nwewi people to effect suitable waste treatment and management, as well as improving the living habits and the education of the people about their environment, is recommended.

AB The effects that different intensities of frond harvesting have on frond regeneration and subsequent production of reproductive structures were investigated for the red intertidal alga Mazzaella comucopiae (Postels & Ruprecht) Hommersand from British Columbia, Canada. Harvesting was done by pruning fronds in the late spring (when stand biomass is highest) of 1993 at two intensities: total and partial collection of fronds, in this second case leaving all frond biomass less than 1 cm high in place. Holdfasts were not damaged. Total percent cover of thalli, frond density, mean frond length, and stand biomass for these experimental quadrats were statistically similar to values for control quadrats in the spring of 1994. These results suggest that one total harvest of fronds per year, done in late spring without damaging holdfasts, may give the highest sustainable yield of biomass. The effects of harvesting intensity on reproduction were variable and difficult to explain. Neither the appearance nor the abundance of cystocarpic fronds were affected by frond pruning, compared with control areas, but pruning did affect the appearance and the abundance of tetrasporic fronds. Partial pruning resulted in a longer presence of tetrasporic fronds, whereas total pruning was associated with their complete absence. Results are compared with those for the few other species of the Gigartinaceae for which experimental harvesting has been done.

AB The formation and sustainability of burn edema require substantial change in net microvascular forces. We directly measured interstitial hydrostatic pressure (Pi) and total interstitial absorptive pressure (Pi + Pi i), in dermis of anesthetized sheep, before and after a 70% to 85% total body surface area scald and during fluid resuscitation. The most rapid change occurred in Pi in the burn wound, which rapidly decreased from its baseline value of approximately -2 mm Hg to -11 mm Hg in the first 5 minutes, and thereafter increased but remained approximately -4 mm Hg through 4 hours of resuscitation. Pi in nonburned skin slowly increased from its preburn level -2 mm Hg, to become positive +1 mm Hg after 4 hours of resuscitation. The total interstitial absorptive pressure, Pi + Pi i, slowly declined similarly from 15 to 16 mm Hg to approximately 10 to 11 mm Hg over 6 hours of resuscitation in both burned and nonburned dermis. Taken together, these data suggest that the rapid formation of burn edema is the result of development of a negative Pi in the burn wound, and its sustainability is the result of a large increase in interstitial compliance. Edema in nonburned skin did not start until after fluid resuscitation was initiated, and then developed as the plasma oncotic pressure declined from 21 to 10 mm Hg.

AB The article examines the effects of agricultural development, agrarian structure and some related variables on rural poverty in India. The results while asserting the existence of trickle-down process, indicate its limited and declining power. Moreover, the process of marginalisation and proletarianisation of the peasantry and inequality in the distribution of land have poverty-aggravating effects. The study underlines the needs for increasing productive employment with real wages sufficient to maintain basic needs for sustainable reduction in rural poverty. It also suggests that an increase in the average size of the marginal and small holdings through appropriate land reforms would be poverty alleviating.

AB This paper describes the development of a set of sustainability indicators for the Cairngorms, an ecologically and economically fragile mountain area in NE Scotland. It takes as a starting point the OECD pressure-state-response (PSR) framework for environmental indicators and adapts this for application in a sustainability context However it is argued that indicators must be developed from an understanding of the processes that link human activity to environmental change and policy response. An expert group was assembled to identify the underlying processes and propose indicators that would be useful for the agency which has responsibilities for sustainable management of the Caimgorms. In selecting indicators a thematic approach was used in which PSR indicators were derived in the context of 18 socio-economic, environmental and institutional themes. Indicators were selected on the basis of feasibility of measurement and an informal cost-benefit analysis of the contribution of information in a policy context It was concluded that to improve the use of indicators for sustainability assessment a greater understanding of economic-environmental processes is required, and performance indicators need to be developed which incorporate a comparison of current state with policy defined capacity criteria.

ID PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
AB This paper reviews the current state of knowledge in defining sustainable agriculture within the broader sphere of sustainable development We conclude that agricultural sustainability encompasses biophysical, economic and social factors operating at the field, farm, watershed, regional and national scales.
   The immediate challenge is to determine what are sustainable agricultural uses before they are implemented-at the planning stage. The final section outlines a framework within which current land evaluation, environmental impact and strategic environmental assessment approaches to land use planning may be extended, and argues that these approaches must include, from the beginning, sustainability criteria.
   The framework for integrated sustainability assessment encompasses a mosaic of factors and hierarchy of scales important to agricultural sustainability. The keys to this framework are characterizing sustainability indicator groups and identifying 'threats' to sustainable practice. In this way, the framework can be seen as a guide for unsustainability assessment using indicators. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB Environmentally responsible use of anaerobically digested biosolids (municipal sewage sludge) is an increasingly urgent ecological and societal concern, There is relatively little information available on effects of biosolids in arid and semiarid rangelands, The purpose of this research was to evaluate effects of rate, season, and number of consecutive gears of biosolids application on tobosagrass (Hilaria mutica) and alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), two commonly occurring native grasses in the Chihuahuan desert grassland, Biosolids were topic ally applied at rates of 0, 7, 18, 34, or 90 Mg ha(-1) either during the dormant season or just prior to the onset of the growing season for 1 yr only, or for 2, 3, or 4 consecutive years; one-half of the experimental plots were provided supplemental irrigation. In general, biosolids increased plant length and aboveground standing crop of these species. Plants responded more to dormant season application than to growing season application in the first year of the study, Carry-over effects from earlier applications on current gear's growth were species-specific and depended on growing conditions.

AB Leopolds's teaching is based on the belief that "the land is one organism." Will an ecosystem collapse if a single species is removed, as would an organism without a single organ? What would happen if all native plants and the animals that depend on them were replaced by a single introduced species? The answer: a sustainable wheat field, without which Leopold would not be able to create his ethnic, nor we conduct this discourse.

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Discussions about Technology Assessment (TA) have increased in the last years. The aim is to provide entire knowledge about the consequences of recent and future applications of technologies. In this paper the problems of entire studies are treated. To ensure sustainability of technical applications it is necessary to consider unintentioned impacts and interactions. Performing such sustainable feasibility studies is characterized by modelling of the interactions between a technical system and its system environment. This is complicated by highly aggregated entities which resist a description with classical mathematics, like a formulation by a few elementary and measurable quantities. So the application of classic-analytical tools is restricted. However, these entities can be modeled with the methods of soft computing. It is possible to identify and estimate consequences of technical applications by examining dynamic systems verbally. Even differential equations can be solved by computing with words using fuzzy logic, as shown in case of the recycling of waste paper and glas in Germany.

AB The Canadian Dietetic Association (CDA) has identified food security as a key action issue for its members. Since any course of action depends on how an issue is understood, we undertook a telephone survey of 487 CDA members to assess their understanding of food security. Dietitians were asked which of the following List they include in their definition of food security: (1) food safety; (2) food as a basic human right; (3) adequate food to maintain health; (4) sustainable agricultural systems; (5) affordability; (6) charitable food distribution systems; and (7) individual choice of personally acceptable foods. Overall, there was a fairly high level of awareness and broad conceptualization of food security. Ninety-three percent included food safety, 87% included food as a human right, adequate food for health, and sustainable agriculture; and 81% included affordability of food. Fewer dietitians included charitable food sources (62%) and individual choice of personally acceptable foods (51%) in their definition. Understandings of the term differed by area of practice but not length of time in practice. Different understandings of food security may lead dietitians to take different, but equally important, courses of action. This may make dialogue confusing and collaboration difficult until the differences are clarified and appreciated.

DE economy; entrepreneurs; environment; green issues; values
AB Presents a discussion on the nature of environmentalism and the nature of enterprise. It argues that while, superficially, these concepts might appear to be contradictory, on examination key communalities become evident. Crucially, both are recognised to be social processes which are based on the notion of value. In environmentalism the value of economic growth per se is questioned. It challenges ideas about what society should consider to be valuable; about whether quality of life is more important than standard of living. Entrepreneurship is argued to be about the creation of value, first at a social level in terms of new products or services, and second, at an individual level in terms of the production of idiosyncratic values, such as self-satisfaction and gratification. The paper proposes, and demonstrates, by examples, that changes in social evaluations, brought about by "greening", mean that new entrepreneurial opportunities have arisen to develop new businesses. Consequently, these new businesses are embedded in, and valorised by, the emergent social values. Given that they are also energised and motivated at a personal level they are seen to be both viable and environmentally sustainable.

DE ecology; entrepreneurs; market economy; sustainable development
AB Business entrepreneurs contribute to socioeconomic development and change through their commercial enterprises. Enterprising individuals seeking to change society or address social issues through an organized initiative have often been referred to as social entrepreneurs. The past decade has witnessed the emergence of a new breed of eco-conscious change agents who may be called ecological entrepreneurs (ecopreneurs for short). This paper focuses on the strategies developed by six grassroots ecopreneurs drawn from two Indian states, Gujarat and Maharashtra, in the field of alternative agriculture. The cases in this sample consist of individuals who try to diffuse innovations developed by themselves. The paper also explains the conceptual differences between two types of ecopreneurs and provides the theoretical sampling frame; it discusses the research objectives and methodology and presents the ecopreneurs and their efforts at diffusing their eco-friendly ideas and innovations. Finally, the paper focuses on two important barriers to ecopreneurship, describes the strategies used to overcome these barriers and draws conclusions.

SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
LA English
DT Article
AB The native rhizomatous cool-season perennial grass, Texas bluegrass (Poa arachnifera Torr.), has recently been recognized again as a plant with considerable potential for range and pasture plantings. Throughout the first half of this century, sporadic efforts at evaluation and commercial use of Texas bluegrass were thwarted primarily by slow stand establishment and difficulties with seed processing. Subsequent advances an seed harvesting, processing, and planting equipment and selection of superior plant genotypes could reduce effects of these limitations. In much of the southern mid-and tall-grass prairie regions and lower southeastern states where Texas bluegrass appears to have potential, there is no currently available sustainable cool-season forage grass. Effects of initial plant spacing and lime, phosphorus (P), and nitrogen (N) application were evaluated in a field and a green house experiment on acid infertile Louisiana Coastal Plain soils. Stands from transplanting on 10- and 30-cm spacings were comparable by the third growing season as the sparsely planted stand spread aggressively. The only consistent response to soil amendment was enhanced forage production from N fertilization in the spring. A plant photoperiodic response appears to limit potential to respond to N in autumn and winter. Forage production of dense stands and responses to spring application of N indicate that Texas bluegrass has considerable potential as a productive, sustainable cool-season forage grass for at least some soils on the southeastern Coastal Plain as well as that recently reported for the southern mid-and tall-grass prairie regions.

TI Integration of rice crop residue into sustainable rice production system
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
LA English
DT Article
ID SILICON
AB Rice is the staple food for nearly 40% of the world's population. In Malawi, rice is ranked second only to maize as a cereal food crop. In rainfed areas of Malawi, grain yields typically average 1.0-1:5 t ha(-1) while potential yield is 4-5 t ha(-1). To bridge the gap between current and potential yields, several novel nutrient management systems were studied. Many research reports indicate that rice responds to silicon (Si) application as well as to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) which are commonly applied. Rice crop residues (straws and hulls) are rich in Si and K, but are not utilized currently in rice production. The effect of rice-hurl ash, rice straw, and method of N application (prilled or briquetted urea) on a transplanted rice crop was studied through field experiments in Malawi during 1995 and 1996. Application of urea in briquette form increased rice grain yield by 1056 and 122 kg ha(-1) compared to prilled urea in the 1995 winter and 1996 summer experiments, respectively. However in the 1996 winter experiment, prilled urea was superior to urea briquette and increased the rice grain yield by 307 kg ha(-1). Incorporation of rice straw significantly sincreased rice grain yields over the control in three consecutive experiments. Rice-hull ash alone increased the rice grain yields in all three experiments up to 12%; however, the increase was not statistically significant. The combination of rice straw and rice-hull ash along with optimum N rates (60 kg ha(-1)) increased the rice grain yields significantly in 1996 winter season but the increase was not significant in the other two experiments.

AB Biosolids are stabilized solids from municipal wastewater treatment that meet federal standards for land application. Good estimates of biosolids N availability are needed to develop sustainable biosolids management programs. We conducted this study to (i) determine the availability and fate of biosolids N applied to a dryland soft-white winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow rotation, (ii) determine if N availability predictions for biosolids are applicable under dryland conditions, and (10) make practical recommendations for biosolids management. We applied dewatered (21-30% solids) biosolids (4.3-5.5% total N; 257-853 lb N/acre) to on-farm test plots at three locations in the 9-12 in. rainfall zone of eastern Washington. Fertilized (anhydrous or aqua ammonia [AA]) and unfertilized treatments were established at each site for comparison. We measured yield and N uptake of grain and straw at harvest, and determined soil profile nitrate N (plus ammonium N, 0-12 in. depth only) before application, during fallow, and post-harvest. We determined apparent N recovery from the soil at the end of the fallow (ANR(fallow)). Nitrogen release from biosolids as measured by ANR(fallow) was dependable and consistent over the three sites, despite differences in environment among the sites. ANR(fallow) averaged 29%, similar to predicted values of 26-31%. The lowest biosolids rates (257-330 lb/acre) supplied more available N than AA. Yield, grain N, and flag leaf N all indicate that N was sufficient at the lowest biosolids rates used, and that higher levels of biosolids did not benefit the crop. Drawbacks to higher rates include risks of reduced crop yield (from moisture stress) and quality (from increased protein), and increased risk of nitrate movement below the root zone. Storage of nitrate in the soil profile does not appear to be a reliable strategy for supplying N for a second crop. Lower biosolids rates seem to reduce economic risks to the farmer and reduce leaching risk Evaluation of low biosolids rates (10-300 lb total N/acre) and second crop response will be valuable in refining biosolids application recommendations.

TI Commercialization and privatization of agricultural extension: The New
   Zealand experience
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The U.S. Cooperative Extension System (USCES) fates some serious challenges. Its relevancy and necessity are under continuous scrutiny as the number of farmers and the political power of the agricultural vote diminishes. These challenges provide an excellent opportunity to explore alternative sources of funding for the USCES and methods of technology transfer to farmers. Our objectives were to review the process and results of commercialization (the transition to user-paid consultancy) and privatization (the transition from government to privately owened) of New Zealand's agricultural extension service. Full commercialization of the New Zealand extension service took nearly 9 yr (1986 to 1994) and 3 yr (1992 to 1995) of negotiating before it was sold to a private company. During the commercialization process, the market for paid advisors increased and many of them left the public extension service to become private agricultural consultants. Many farmers were initially unwilling to pay for consultancy services. On the other hand, implementation of advice and adoption of new technologies has been greater among farmers when advice and technology are purchased than when they are provided "free." Since the commercialization of publicly funded extension, farmer cooperatives and commodity boards have begun to provide "free" or low cost services to transfer information to farmers. Educational models and goals, and client-advisor relationships have also changed as a result of user-pays. The commercialization and privatization of publicly funded agricultural extension is a relatively new process and its affect on the long-term sustainability of agriculture within a country are uncertain. Consequently, additional in-depth investigation into the process and its long-term consequences on agricultural productivity, profitability, and social well-being should be completed before initiating such a plan in the USA.

ID SPRING WHEAT; PRAIRIE
AB A grazing study was initiated in the foothills of southwestern Alberta on the rough fescue grasslands (Festuca campestris (Rydb.) in 1949 comparing various grazing intensities. In 1992, soil samples were obtained from the Ah horizon of paddocks grazed at 1.2 (light), 2.4 (heavy), and 4.8 (very heavy) animal unit month ha(-1) and from an ungrazed exclosure (control). The thickness of the Ah horizon of the control averaged 22 cm while that of the lightly, heavily and very heavily grazed paddocks averaged 18, 12, and 8 cm, respectively. Soil color changed from 10YR 2/1 (black) to 10YR 4/3 (dark brown to brown) in response to very heavy grazing. Grazing pressures decreased the mean-weight diameter of water-stable aggregates, total C and P, monosaccharide content and the galactose + mannose/xylose + arabinose ratio, while it increased bulk density, pH-CaCl2, and total N. The loss of P must be viewed with concern. Treatment effects on most soil parameters were most pronounced at the two heavier grazing pressures. Particularly, the heavy grazing pressure jeopardized the sustainability of the ecosystem by reducing fertility and water-holding capacity.

AB About 1500 preantral follicles can be recovered from a single cat ovary by mechanical dissection. This is a potentially rich source of genetic material if ova could be preserved and grown in vitro, especially from rare or endangered species that die abruptly or are ovariectomized for medical reasons. The aims of this study were to examine cryoprotectant toxicity and then the potential of successfully cryopreserving preantral cat follicles. In the initial toxicity trial, isolated cat follicles (40-90 mu m) were exposed to dimethylsulfoxide, glycerol, 1,2-propandiol or ethylene glycol at 0 degrees C for 15 min. Follicle viability was assessed by supravital staining using a combination of Trypan blue and Hoechst 33258 at 0 h, and after 18 h and 1 week of culture. Percentages of follicles with intact oocytes and granulosa cells were similar (P > 0.05) among control (no cryoprotectant), dimethylsulfoxide, 1,2-propandiol and ethylene glycol treatments at all time points, but were reduced (P < 0.05) after glycerol exposure. On the basis of this finding, dimethylsulfoxide and 1,2-propandiol were used to cryopreserve intact follicles, and post-thaw viability was assessed by supravital staining and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine uptake into oocytes and granulosa cells during culture. Of control (noncryopreserved) follicles, 31.4%+/-2.9%, 18.8%+/-1.9% and 16.2%+/-1.6% were intact after 0 h, 18 h and 1 week of culture, respectively. Uptake of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine occurred in approximately 20% of follicles at all time points. On the basis of the presence of both a healthy oocyte and granulosa cells, cryopreservation in dimethylsulfoxide or 1,2-propandiol allowed approximately 19% of follicles to survive. Approximately 10% demonstrated clear evidence of cell activity that was sustainable for I week. In conclusion, the cat ovary contains a population of: preantral follicles that are not adversely affected by short-term exposure to most conventional cryoprotectants. Furthermore, there is a subpopulation of these follicles capable of surviving cryopreservation, remaining structurally intact and physiologically active after thawing.

SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES

DT Article
ID BUSINESS
AB This paper explores some connections between the 'cultural turn' in recent social theory, and the emergence of new models of local and regional development which have potential importance for the pursuit of sustainable rural development. Two particular examples of attempted cultural engineering, centred on ideas of 'enterprise culture' and of 'corporate culture', are reviewed and both shown to be flawed by their weak conception of culture. A more convincing account of its importance is derived from work on regional development which emphasises the role of social networks and institutional thickness in enabling the growth of confidence and trust as preconditions for success. It is noted that these institutional conditions show some surprising similarities to traditional social features of rural areas, and so help explain the shift from failed strategies of rural development towards more integrated approaches. A number of examples of contemporary development practice in rural Wales are described, to support the suggestion that the attainment of sustainable economic and social development in rural areas depends upon creating social and institutional networks which embed change within the prevailing social and cultural resources of rural populations.

TI Self-censorship in African scholarship and scholarly publishing
SO JOURNAL OF SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING

DT Article
AB Since the late 1980s, the African continent has been witnessing an enormous socioeconomic transformation, and yet the writings of many African scholars today bear signs of self-censorship: censorship outside the direct influence of the state. This form of censorship is part of the African educational system, its official languages, and its societal values; it is packaged in the form of ideology and therefore constitutes part of the intellectual make-up of the African scholar, ultimately endangering the development of sustainable scholarly publishing in Africa.

AB The information age of the 1990s is a global consciousness where scientific and technological advances are assumed capable of salving global environmental problems. A significant characteristic of nonpoint source (MPS) pollution problems is the lack of regard for political boundaries and physical barriers between cities, states, nations, and continents. The widespread nature of such environmental problems often results in an analogous diffuse acceptance of responsibility for resolution. Thus, art ability to accurately assess the present and future impact of human activities on the global ecosystem would provide a most powerful basis for environmental stewardship and guiding future human actions. To responsibly respond to impaired ecosystem functioning (i.e., with respect to such issues as climatic change, stratospheric ozone depletion, species diversification, erosion, deforestation desertification, agricultural sustainability and nonpoint source pollution), it is necessary to examine these issues not only from a multidisciplinary systems-based approach, but also with an approach that accounts for spatial and temporal context The problem and philosophical issues of addressing NPS pollution is the vadose zone within a spatial and temporal context are presented.

AB A recent proposal for an average erosion rate for Europe is challenged. The proposed figure is shown to be derived by a tortuous route from plot experiments in Belgium. The original researcher, A. Bollinne, was careful not to extrapolate his results; subsequent workers have not been so circumspect. Further, the concept of an average rate for any continental-size area-Europe or North America-is unsound, because rates vary vary in time and space. There is also a shortage of reliable data for anything other than small areas. Plot experiments are a poor basis for regional generalization: monitoring schemes are preferred but ave uncommon. The proposed average rate has no basis in reality but is already being widely quoted-a myth is perpetuated.

AB It is generally believed that soil erosion is the greatest single factor causing loss of soil productivity, However, the exact nature of these losses in terms of the concentrations of nutrients removed in windblown sediment vs, the parent soil from whence the sediment originated has not been adequately quantified. Two field sites were established in southern Alberta (one in 1990, one in 1993) as validation sites for the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) model. As part of this project, move than 400 windblown sediment samples (dt heights of 10-100 cm above the soil surface) were collected from a total of 29 erosion events. Analysis of windblown sediment sampler presented an opportunity to compare the nutrient content of windblown sediment with that of the adjacent surface soil where it originated Additionally, the effects of natural wind erosion on crop productivity were monitored. At Site 1, total N in windblown sediment trapped at 25-cm height showed an average (13 events) enrichment ratio of 1.11, while organic C in windblown sediment showed an average enrichment ratio of only 1.02 compared with soil from the erodible surface. At Site 2, the average (4 events) total N enrichment ratio was 1.08 and the average organic C enrichment ratio was 1.05. The depositional area at Site 1 showed nutrient enrichment compared with the erodible surface. Changes in soil productivity due to natural erosion were reflected in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields in 1992, but not in canola (Brassica napus L.) yields in 1993. Spring wheat yields showed a linear decrease with increased severity of erosion. For every 1 m increase in the distance from non-erodible surface there was a decrease of 3.6 kg ha(-1) in grain yield. The results provide further evidence that every effort should be made by producers and government agencies to prevent erosion of the thin layer of surface soil that ensures the future sustainability of agriculture on the semiarid Canadian prairies.

AB Soil erosion from water has been occurring for centuries in some areas of Chile. Chequen Farm in Concepcion, Chile, has not been plowed for 38 years and has been in continuous no-tillage for the last 19 years. Carlos Crovetto was invited to present information about his farming operation on Chequen farm. He presents various observations and measurements of soil changes that have occurred after the transition to no-tillage. Many positive changes in soil quality and productivity have been observed. Chequen Farm has become an international example of how no-tillage can be used to enhance long-term agricultural sustainability.

ID CORN
AB Maintaining environmental quality implies sustainable agricultural production systems that preserve and protect soil resources. Cover crops play a dual role maintaining resource quality by providing ground cover to prevent wind and water erosion and carbon input to enhance soil quality. Carbon input from cover crops and crop stover play a vital role in agroecosystems for insuring long-term economic benefits with minimal impact on soil, water and air quality. The fresh carbon from cover crops is critical because of the role of the soil organic carbon cycle in controlling water, temperature, aeration, and soil structure. Both aboveground and root biomass are important to chemical and biological properties for the role in nutrient cycling. The benefits of available nitrogen from symbiotic fixation makes legume cover crops an environmental and economic preference. Use of selected cover crops and associated allelopathic effects can reduce chemicals required for weed control. While there are positive and negative aspects of cover crops from the economic viewpoint, when environmental costs are properly credited, cover crops surface as a major contribution to soil and environmental quality. The challenge is to assure cost-effective production using cover crops to maintain a healthy environment, a healthy economy, and a high quality of life.

AB Crop-fallow using conventional mechanical tillage has been the traditional management practice for farmers in the semi-arid northern Great Plains. This practice reduces soil quality and is not sustainable. More intensive management systems utilizing reduced- or no-tillage, fertilization to meet a yield goal! and systems producing a crop annually are being developed. In 1984, a study Ic,ar initiated to compare crop yield, water-use efficiency, and nutrient-use efficiency under a spring wheat-fallow system to that under a spring wheat-winter wheat-sunflower annual cropping system. In 1995, sail samples were collected and laboratory analyses performed to quantify a number of soil quality attributes and determine the effect these management practices have had on soil quality after II years. Soil quality attributes were greater under annual cropping than under crop-fallow and improved as tillage intensity decreased these results suggest that the more intensive management strategies are more sustainable.

AB A rapid increase in population is causing severe strain on natural resources and environment of East Africa. Per capita arable land area is declined in several densely populated regions of East Africa. Two major issues in soil and environmental degradation, i.e., greenhouse effect and water quality are described. Three principal soil degradation processes with reference to productivity are physical, chemical and biological degradation. Soil physical degradation can affect crop growth and yield by decreasing root depth and available water and nutrient reserves and soil erosion can lead to yield loss by affecting soil organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents and soil pH. Reduction in maize grain yield on moderately and severely eroded soils compared with uneroded soils in Tanzania was 14 to 39%. Chemical degradation is caused by the processes of nutrient depletion and/or loss of organic matter, acidification and toxic aluminum, salinization, and industrial and mining activities. In Tanzania, a modest cropping system of maize and bean removed about 58, 13, and 56 kg ha(-1) of N, P, and K, respectively. The average use of fertilizers in this cropping system was only 22.5 kg ha(-1) and thus resulting in "nutrient mining." Principal issues of agricultural sustainability are discussed.

AB Most soils in Africa ale low in both total and plant-available nitrogen (N) and hence the balance of N in most of the cropping systems is negative. The main sources of N inflow to agricultural systems are commercial fertilizer, farmyard manure, atmospheric deposition and biological N fixation. Nitrogen is lost through crop removal, leaching, erosion and gaseous losses. In this paper gains and losses are estimated for East Africa based on available data to assess the sustainability of N management. Data show that the removal of N through crop harvest (5-17 kg ha(-1) y(-1)) and through the processes of soil erosion (2-13 kg ha(-1) y(-1)), leaching (2-3 kg ha(-1) y(-1)) and gaseous losses (4-5 kg ha(-1) y(-1)) far exceeds the amounts added through fertilizers (2-10 kg ha(-1) y(-1)), organic manure (<1 kg ha(-1) y(-1)), atmospheric deposition (1-3 kg ha(-1) y(-1)) and N fixation (1-4 kg ha(-1) y(-1)). The total depletion (input-output) of N in Tanzania was found to be several fold higher than that in Zambia. Lower rates of N application through fertilizers and greater losses of N through soil erosion have contributed to higher depletion rates in Tanzania as compared to Zambia. Alternative source of N and some strategies for sustainable management in East Africa are suggested.

   agricultural development options
AB On-farm trials were used to evaluate the agro-economic feasibility of growing a second rice crop in Northwest Kampuchea in the dry season, and to calculate the costs and benefits of ecological inputs in agricultural production. A comparison of production and external input-use was made in two contrasting environmental conditions: lowland irrigation and water receding environment. Measurements were made in fields of 17 lowland and 33 water receding farmer cooperator fields in a single year. Results show that yields from water receding environments (3.94 t . ha(-1)) were significantly higher (27%) than those from lowland environments (3.10 t . ha(-1)). In addition, the external input costs per ha far the lowland environments were US$196.26, 65% higher than those for water receding environments (US$118.94). As a consequence, the gross margin per ha (US$431.06) and return per day of cultivation (US$3.92) were higher in water receding environments than those in irrigated lowland environments (US$270.25 per ha and US$2.46 per day). These differences in costs and bene fits under the two conditions gave a measure of ecological input-subsidy in the agricultural production process. In the absence of clear methodologies to measure ecological inputs and their productivity, we conclude that the: above measures can be used as indicators to assess agricultural development options in situations such as in Kampuchea.

AB Sainfoin, Onobrychis viciifolia Scop., is an introduced forage legume grown on a, limited basis in the Rocky Mountain region of the northern United States and southern Canada (Heath et al., 1973). The major attributes of sainfoin are its non-bloating characteristic as green forage and the high digestible nutrient content. It is drought tolerant, resistant to the alfalfa weevil, winter-hardy, and produces good early spring growth tolerant to frost. If commercial Rhizobium inoculant is used, it requires no nitrogen fertilizer and has a low requirement for phosphorous. It has extremely good forage palatability. Therefore, it was the potential to provide a sustainable pasture system without required chemical inputs. The objective of our study was to determine if the combination of meadow bromegrass and our nematode-resistant sainfoin line would increase the sustain ability of sainfoin in the presence of the northern root-knot nematode (NRKN). Under environmentally controlled conditions, initial population density of five NRKN (Meloidogyne hapla Chitwood) eggs/cm(3) soil resulted in 100% of sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) roots with galls after 70 days. One hundred percent of remaining sainfoin plants were galled in two other controlled studies after 6 months, and 86% were galled in a field study after 2 years. Resistance to NRKN in an experimental sainfoin line was expressed in lower plant mortality, lower root galling, and lower egg production, compared to the susceptible cultivar Remont. The NRKN also appeared to be parasitic on roots of 'Regar' bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm.). Although root and shoot biomass were both reduced, there was no reproduction on roots and no bromegrass plants were killed. Under relatively high nematode soil populations, intercropping sainfoin with bromegrass provided no protection for sainfoin against the NRKN in either environmentally controlled or field plot studies. Our study further documents the extreme susceptibility of sainfoin to the NRKN. Care should be taken to avoid establishing this crop in fields having a sandy loam soil infested with this nematode.

ID HERBAGE; PATTERNS; DISK
AB Sustainable use of mixed species pastures under management intensive rotational grazing requires information on forage dry matter availability on a daily basis for feed budgeting purposes. Forage availability, forage nutritive quality, and species composition were measured during May to September in 1994 and 1995. Forage available for daily consumption declined in both years as the season progressed. However, the magnitude of this decline varied between years during summer (July to September), which was attributed to differences in soil moisture availability. Under adequate moisture conditions observed in 1994, forage was available at an average rate of 70, 68, 51, 66, 24, and 11 kg dry matter ha(-1) d(-1) during May, June, July, August, September, and October, respectively. Due to extended periods of dry weather in the summer of 1995, forage availability during the months of July, August and September was reduced to 26, 47, and 11 kg ha(-1) d(-1), respectively. Total forage consumed during 1994 and 1995 was 8580 and 6460 kg dry matter ha(-1), respectively. Averaged over the two years, forage dry matter consumed during the grazing season contained 22% crude protein (CP), 45% neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and 24% acid detergent fiber (ADF). Averaged over the two years, forage cut at ground level was composed of 22% Kentucky Bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), 33% of mostly smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and quackgrass (Elytrigia repens [L.] Nevski), 13% legumes (mostly white clover, Trifolium repens L.), 27% dead matter, and 5% of all other species. These fractions remained stable during the season, except under intense drought when dead matter increased as the bluegrass and white clover fractions declined. However, bluegrass and clover recovered quickly upon return of favorable moisture conditions. The results indicate that these pastures can provide significant amounts of forage under management intensive rotational grazing, but additional feed may be needed for a month or two under extended periods of water stress. While more years of data are needed to accurately assess the effects of rotational grazing on species composition, the limited set of data presented suggests that the pasture composition, a measure of pasture persistence, may remain fairly stable from year to year under the system of grazing management imposed, even though significant but transient changes were observed within a grazing season.

AB Communication of technological information iis a vital factor in the change process of the farming community. Development communication networking varies depending on the nature and importance of the technologies and the level of village development.
   Sociometric information was gathered on three improved farm practices-high yielding varieties (HYVs) of rice, improved management of vegetable cultivation, use of insecticides-fi om a progressive and a less progressive village of Mymensingh district of Bangladesh. The information seeking pattern for these farming practices was dominated by official sources in the progressive village, while it was characterised by interpersonal and "within family" interaction pattern in the case of the less progressive village.
   In determining the explicit dynamism of the web of networking this paper demonstrates that: (a) information flow followed a multistep process, although such steps often reduced to one-step connection, depending on the importance and complexity of the technology, (b) close communication links existed among key-communicators, between key-communicators and communicators, and among communicators, (c) farmers in the less progressive village with a comparatively remote location experienced very limited contacts with the government agricultural extension service systems, (d) farmers' network of communication for seeking information to solve farm problems operates in a sustainable basis since it is perpetuated continually for many human generations. Appropriate agricultural extension strategies are discussed.

ID ALLELOPATHY
AB Except where a good legume sod is plowed under or a heavy application of manure is used, N fertilizer applications are generally necessary for producing high yields from grain crops. A soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation appears to be a logical opportunity to use legume N as a sustainable grain production resource. An experiment conducted to compare N from soybeans with fertilizer N resulted in a 46% reduction in wheat yield following soybeans where wheat was not fertilized with N. Subsequent research showed that when soybeans were allowed to grow to bloom stage or later preceding a wheat or triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack) crop a significant reduction in grain yield resulted from the previous soybean crop. When the grain crop was fertilized with 80 lbs/acre of N this response did not occur. The experimental results suggest that soybean root exudates are responsible for the decrease in wheat and triticale growth and yield.

AB The concept of research impact is defined. Methods currently in use for impact assessment of projects on sustainable development are reviewed as well as those used in different fields of research. The choice of appropriate indicators of research achievement is discussed and properties of quantitative and qualitative indicators are assessed. A detailed discussion is included of current research on indicators in many research fields such as health, economics, industry, education, politics, medicine, social development, ecology, and general environmental sustainability.
   It is proposed that research impact assessment involves a long-term management approach based on proper project design incorporating an impact assessment component and that the generated information requires skillful summary to determine impact in an unbiased way. While management issues have been addressed to some extent, the issues of data quality and summary have received inadequate attention. A method is proposed for collection of core indicators for monitoring and evaluation and subsidiary indicators for broader impact evaluation within a time period and locality beyond the immediate project zone. The resultant data set will be large and multidisciplinary; technical methods for its summary are discussed.

AB Agricultural sustainability is challenging 'conventional' or 'mainstream' agriculture as the dominant organizing paradigm for teaching research, and outreach in American land grant universities. However, not all faculty members subscribe to the tenets of sustainable agriculture. This paper examines how a sample of faculty members from all land grant universities in the U.S. view sustainable agriculture. Results show that, in the minds of agricultural academics, agricultural sustainability is closely aligned with enhancing environmental quality. It is less closely tied, for them, to increasing profitability for farmers or with improving the quality of life in rural areas. Results vary by academic discipline and by personal background characteristics.

AB Rising production costs, unstable cereal grain prices, soil degradation due to excessive tillage and nitrate leaching are main constraints to sustainable agriculture in the Canadian prairies. Replacing conventional tillage (CT) with no-till (NT) and cereal-fallow rotations with crop rotations comprising cereals, oilseeds and legumes is thus encouraged, but information on crop rotation by tillage interaction is scarce. Properties of a silt loam (Dark Gray Luvisol), weed population and wheat production (Triticum aestivum L.) in canola (Brassica campestris L.)-wheat-wheat (C), fallow-wheat-wheat (F), field pea (Pisum sativum L.)-wheat-wheat (P) and continuous wheat (W) cropping systems were compared under CT and NT. Percentage of water stable aggregates (WSA) was reduced after a fallow season. Soil NO3-N was similar among cropped plots which was significantly lower than fallow plots in two of the three years. Ammonium-N, extractable P and penetration resistance (PR) of soil were not affected by crop rotation. The W plots tended to have more weeds than both the first (W1) and second (W2) year wheat plots in rotations. Wheat appeared to suppress weeds better than canola, field pea or fallow. Average production of 3.95 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) as grain and 10.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) as above-ground dry matter (AGDM) by the W1 were significantly greater than the corresponding production by W2 and W. Wheat grain and AGDM production in the two years of C, F, P and W systems were not significantly different in most cases. However, cumulative yields by C, P and W systems for three years of rotation were greater than the corresponding grain and AGDM yields from F rotation by 1.10 to 4.19 and 4.3 to 8.7 Mg ha(-1) respectively. Tillage did not affect NO3-N, NH4-N, P and WSA in soil but reduced its PR. The NT system provided better control of annual broadleaf weeds whereas perennial weeds were better controlled by CT. The CT system produced more grains (average of 0.42 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) than NT system. Crop rotation by tillage interaction effects on soil properties, weed populations and crop yields were not significant which indicated that the crop rotations were equally effective under both the tillage systems. Benefits of crop rotation over monoculture in this study were of similar nature as in earlier studies conducted on fields already under annual cropping systems. Canola and field pea were more beneficial than wheat as previous-crop for wheat production. Replacing fallow with a crop resulted in (a) increased crop production and straw returned to soil; (b) reduced potential for leaching of NO3-N; and (c) improved water stable aggregation of soil.

TI Building and sustaining the high production capacity of Egypt's

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

DT Article
AB Egypt's already high productive irrigated agriculture is currently subject to unprecedented expansion in area and intensification, while competition with industrial and domestic sectors for the fixed supply of Nile water continues to increase. Salinization, heavy input use nutrient export and pollution all threaten the health of soils that have been feeding Egypt for centuries. At the same time, the build-up of newly reclaimed desert soils to economically sustainable productive capacity is a major challenge. A new long-term research program addresses these issues in a multidisciplinary way; long-term agronomic trials (with such variables as water quantity, water quality, nutrient inputs and crop rotations) at sites in both the old lands and the newly reclaimed areas will be complemented by extensive long-term monitoring in villages close to the experimental sites for fanners' perspectives, farming practices and condition of their soils and crops.

AB Tropical tree crops are produced either in commercial plantations or by smallholders. In this article, a methodology for assessing the sustainability of peasant cocoa production in West Africa is outlined. We propose a procedure for testing the hypothesis that shaded and less intensively managed cacao plantings are more sustainable than unshaded, more intensive plantations. The approach is based on ecological, economic and social indicators for sustainability and takes into account the requirements of experimental design to allow for statistical evaluation.

TI A survey of soil fertility management in small-scale farming systems in
   north eastern Zimbabwe
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTHERN ZIMBABWE; COMMUNAL AREAS; LIVESTOCK; WOODLAND; MANURE; SITE
AB This paper examines the soil fertility management practices of smallholder farmers in north eastern Zimbabwe and investigates whether mixed farming systems like these are sustainable. To maintain crop production, farmers used inorganic fertilizers and a variety of locally-derived fertilizers: manure, termitarium soil, crop residues, woodland litter, compost and household waste. On average, locally-derived fertilizers provide about 25 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 65 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for fields and gardens, respectively, indicating the importance of gardens as a focus for soil management. Farmers achieve target yields without the high application rates recommended by the extension service, probably because of the positive interactive effects of applying inorganic and organic fertilizer. Current yields on these nutrient-poor sands cannot be maintained in the absence of the inorganic inputs, thus sustainability is threatened by rising human populations and the recent massive increases in fertilizer prices.

AB Management of the bollworm (Helicoverpa tea [Boddie]) and tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens [F.]) complex in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is a significant production cost and a large contributor of insecticides to the environment. Genetic resistance or tolerance could help alleviate these problems. We conducted a trial to identify and exploit sources of bollworm/tobacco budworm resistance in the Pee Dee (PD) cotton germplasm. The experiment consisted of selecting phenotypically desirable cotton plants in segregating populations when produced with limited control of bollworm/tobacco budworm. Although this methodology had previously been successful in identifying resistant types, we were unable to demonstrate a response to selection. The study did find that PD 0762, a germplasm released as possessing resistance to bollworm/tobacco budworm based on lint yield in limited control experiments, likely is tolerant of square loss as its reaction to this insect complex does not suggest resistance. We also found that a new germplasm PD 0786 has a low level of resistance to bollworm/tobacco budworm and therefore could be a component of sustainable cotton production systems for the USA and developing countries.

   effect on sweet corn yield
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

ID DRY-MATTER; NITROGEN-SOURCE; GROUND COVER; TURNIP; CROPS; DATE
AB Relay intercropping can increase nutrient cycling, cropping system diversity, and profitability, all factors that can contribute to agricultural sustainability. A frost-tolerant crop interseeded into sweet corn is an example of an opportunity for relay intercropping. Four forage brassicas ('Premier' kale, 'Sparta' rape, 'Rondo' turnip and 'Forage Star' turnip) were interseeded into 'NK 199' sweet corn at last cultivation ('early' interseeding) and at about blister stage of the corn ('late' interseeding) in 1993 and 1994. Our objectives were to determine the effect of interseeding on sweet corn yield, and November dry-matter yields of brassicas. Corn ears and stover were harvested 2-3 Sept. 1993 and 12 Aug. 1994. Corn yields were not significantly affected by interseeding. Rondo turnip yielded more top (herbage) dry-matter than either kale or Forage Star turnip averaged across years and planting times. Total forage yield of the turnips (tops + roots) was similar to or higher than top yield of kale or rape.

AB Agriculture is a major agent of environmental change and since its inception c.10,000 years ago it has caused the transposition of large areas of natural ecosystems into agricultural systems. As world population is set to increase from 5.7 x 10(9) to 8.3 x 10(9) in the next 25 years agriculture must meet the needs of these additional people. It can either expand, to cause the demise of yet more natural ecosystems and so impair the services they provide and accelerate extinctions, or existing agricultural systems can intensify production. Biotechnology can undoubtedly contribute to this intensification but it is not without environmental and social/economic risks.

TI Sagebrush as a short-term arthropod repellent
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of biological pest control materials can contribute to sustainable agriculture, especially if such materials are derived from a plant species normally considered to be a weed. A study was conducted to Investigate possible repellent properties of shredded material of big sagebrush on the activity of house cricket, American cockroach, and two types of spiders. Arthropod net movement rates away from a source of shredded sagebrush plant material placed in an enclosed insectary were determined after a 24-h period. Cockroaches were the only arthropods for which the net movement rate out of the side of the insectary with the sagebrush was greater (P = 0.10) than random movement of cockroaches in the control treatment. We conclude that sagebrush may have some capacity to repel cockroaches, and that further research on its effectiveness as an insect repellant may be warranted.

TI Mulching effects on runoff soil erosion, and crop response on alfisols
   in western Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Soil quality and resilience characteristics determine productivity, sustainability, and risks of soil and environmental degradation. Soil surface management, comprising residue mulch and tillage methods, affects soil quality and resilience. Field experiments were conducted in western Nigeria on soils prone to erosion and degradation to evaluate the effects of mulch rates on runoff, soil erosion and crop yield. Effects of five mulch rates (4, 3, 2, 1 and 0 Mg/ha/season of rice straw mulch) with notill on crop response were compared with that of plow till treatment on field runoff plots for four consecutive years from 1981 to 1984. Runoff and soil erosion effects of different mulch rates were measured for only 1981 and 1984. Maize grain yield was significantly affected by mulching in 1 out of 3 seasons, and was the highest at 5.4 Mg/ha for 4 Mg/ha mulch rate and the lowest at 3.5 Mg/ha for 1 Mg/ha mulch rate, a difference of 54%. Soybean grain yield was significantly higher at 1.4 Mg/ha for 4 Mg/ha mulch rate than 0.8 Mg/ha for 1 Mg/ha mulch rate, a difference of 62.5%. Mean cowpea yield was the highest at about 1 Mg/ha for 4 Mg/ha mulch rate and the lowest at 0.7 Mg/ha for unmulched plots. Runoff and soil erosion were lower in 1981 than in 1984, with higher losses generally for the plow till treatment. The index of relative mean annual soil erosion was in the order 100 (plow till), 35.1 (0 Mg/ha mulch rate), 25.0 (1 Mg/ha mulch rate), 30.9 (2 Mg/ha mulch rate), 20.8 (3 Mg/ha mulch rate), and 16.1 (4 Mg/ha mulch rate). Reductions in soil erosion by mulching were due both to decreased runoff and to lower sediment concentration in runoff. The data show that the desirable mulch rate for soil and water conservation is about 4 Mg/ha/season for these soils.

TI Telemedicine and developing countries - A report of Study Group 2 of the
   ITU Development Sector
SO JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY
AB While there are significant potential advantages and benefits from telemedicine, the evidence of its cost-effectiveness and sustainability is meagre. This is because much of the telemedicine activity so far has been in the form of pilot projects or demonstrations in universities and hospitals with subsidized funding from government or other sources. The number of self-sustaining, commercial applications of telemedicine is still very small. Telemedicine undoubtedly yields cost savings in certain circumstances, but often the savings and benefits accrue to those who do not have to pay for the service. Thus, few service providers have found a way to recover their costs (and make a profit) from those to whom they provide their service. Even fewer countries have actually budgeted for the provision of telemedicine as a service widely available to their citizens. Nevertheless, with the rapidly declining cost in hardware and telecommunications, the level of interest and the corresponding activity in telemedicine is rising rapidly.
   Most of the telemedicine experience to date has been in the industrialized world. It is apparent that the first requirement of developing countries is for more information about telemedicine, what it is, and how it might be able to help solve some of the shortages in medical and health care.
   Given the potential of telemedicine to facilitate the provision of medical information and health care in rural areas, it seems useful for developing countries to undertake pilot projects in order to evaluate its potential and cost-benefits. The results of such pilot projects could be part of the development of a national health for all policy which takes telemedicine into account.
   In view of the other priorities of developing countries, especially those of the least developed countries, financing telemedicine activity is likely to remain a challenge for some time to come. Funding from external donor agencies may well be necessary, but local commitment and participation in pilot projects is essential if the project is to have a chance,of success. As telemedicine requires a multidisciplinary approach, the active participation of telecommunication operators must be assured.
   Despite some false starts in the deployment of telemedicine as a continuing service to the general population-as opposed to a few well-to-do clients-telemedicine has great potential to improve access to health care and to contain costs in developing countries.

ID TI3SIC2; SHS
AB In the foreseeable future the main matter of concern for applied research into ceramic materials will be, on the one hand, the need to ensure the sustainable development by a reduction in the consumption of nonrenewable energy and natural resources and, on the other, the challenge associated with the tendency of the industry to move towards a sales-orientated and 'just-in-time' production of materials. The former concern should foster a growing utilisation of ceramic materials because these are, to an overwhelming majority, constituted by light elements that are abundant in the earth's crust and air. This endeavour emphasises a perfectioning of existing ceramic systems and their tailoring to a host of advanced applications by improving the properties, by using new or improved technologies, and by 'discovering' new properties of known compounds. This trend is illustrated in the paper by considering the applications of successively developed types of SiC-based materials and by the perspectives opened by newly revealed properties of earlier known materials, like Ti3SiC2. In addition to providing improved properties, newly developed ceramic technologies comply to an increasing degree with requirements for sustainable development and for 'just-in-time' production. To illustrate this tendency, the RBAO (reaction bonded aluminium oxide) method and several variants of combustion methods are reviewed in the paper. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

AB The struggle to find and use indicators of sustainable development is intimately bound up with the process of deciding what we mean by sustainable development and what we shall do about it. In this field at least, indicators are intrinsically and unavoidably normative and political. The paper proposes an approach to indicators which reflects, and can further clarify and help to achieve, an important aspect of sustainable development. The paper is written from a practical, instrumental interest in indicators as a tool to put sustainable development principles into practice in public policy. The author is not a statistician and makes no claim to technical expertise but hopes that this 'barefoot' practitioner perspective may be of some interest to the professionals. The main argument is introduced by a discussion of some of the pitfalls and limitations of sustainability indicators to date.

AB Nine councils of government in the Chicago region exemplify a new institutional arrangement in regional governance. Formed partially from the need of mayors and managers to consult on issues specific to their subregions and from the federal requirement for local consultation on transportation issues, the councils of government have become articulate advocates for suburban and regional, rather than urban or rural, policy agendas. They exemplify a new form of functional regionalism that emphasizes cooperation and collaboration in transportation planning solid waste management, regulatory standardization, and intergovernmental agreement. The research examines the historical development, functional responsibilities, and subregional economic development agendas of nine councils of government in the six-county northeastern Illinois region and suggests explanations for their emergence and effectiveness.

ID INTERGENERATIONAL ALTRUISM; INCENTIVES
AB This paper carries out a numerical thought experiment on greenhouse gas abatement. There are two states of the world: one in which climate policy is purely based on intrinsic motivation in the sense of intergenerational altruism, one in which agents distrust voluntary cooperation, but have agreed to provide an extrinsic stimulus for greenhouse gas abatement through a system of tradable carbon rights. The main results can be summarized as follows: First, a high degree of intergenerational altruism might support 'sustainable' atmospheric carbon concentration, but imposes high welfare losses on current generations. Second, if agents realize that greenhouse policy is an alternative to investing into physical capital, then even without intergenentional altruism a pareto-efficient internalization of the external effect of climate change will stabilize the atmospheric carbon concentration at ecologically sustainable levels, bur at significantly lower economic costs.

   sustainable development
ID KENYA
AB The dryland environment of Africa poses formidable problems for sustainable development. Among these are unpredictable and severe drought, desiccation or aridification due to persistent drought and dryland degradation or desertification. Because these problems overlap in their effects on the ground, often those who seek sustainable development for these drylands tend to view the problems as one and the same. Yet to facilitate the development of appropriate and effective mitigating measures it is important that the differences and interrelationships be clearly understood. This article starts by outlining the differences and interlinkages between desertification, drought, desiccation and climate change and their causal factors. The central theme is the human causes and consequences of desertification in the drylands of Africa. An attempt has been made to unravel the changing views on the human causes, this is followed by a brief outline of the intervening plans and actions to stem the problem. A significant drawback in combating desertification and drought is the failure of African governments to devolve power to the people who are affected, and to link environmental degradation to economic policy. Consequently, many programmes lack local support or are undermined by conflicting trade and agricultural policies pursued by governments. It is contended that, for sustainable development strategies to work, policies should put the welfare of the people in these drylands at the centre of the development agenda and give them the rights and the power to determine their future. They should empower the people to sustain adaptive strategies towards sustainable livelihoods. Also the threats posed to environment and sustainable development by protectionism and overconsumption in the north and structural adjustment programmes (SAPs), call for the removal of distortions created by the import barriers of developed country, the curbing of overconsumption and a fundamental revision in the structure of SAPs to help alleviate poverty and protect the environment in these African countries. It is in the interest of the global community that the environment in Africa is protected. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Sustainability and sustainable development have been, perhaps, the most debated yet least applied concepts in urban and regional planning in recent years. Missing in all the rhetoric on and research into sustainable development are guidelines for moving toward plans that, either incrementally or comprehensively, incorporate sustainable objectives and the steps necessary to implement them. An approach is outlined for developing measures and steps to transform a traditional community-based comprehensive land use and transportation plan into one incorporating sustainable development objectives and measures. Traditional objectives of comprehensive land use and transportation planning are identified and linked to their sustainability equivalents. Four elements are discussed: land use, transportation, environmental factors, and economic development. A four-step, dynamic process is described for implementing the model and transforming the plan objectives, its implementation, and its measures of success. A tool for strategically assessing the political climate for change is included to assist planners in identifying an acceptable scale of movement toward sustainability. In conclusion, the elements presented provide a strategy and tools for moving forward in adopting sustainability as a local objective for land use and transportation planning.

AB This paper examines two explanations for the acceptance of technological facilities in a community. One explanation argues that facilities are accepted as a function of the benefits and inherent risks associated with the technology involved. The alternative explanation argues that facilities are accepted on the basis of the conditions of acceptability. Because the former posits that facilities are accepted as a function of the technology, policies based on this explanation attempt to redistribute the risks and benefits associated with technologies to achieve fairness. The latter suggests that the acceptance of facilities that pose risk to the community is as much a function of the conditions of acceptability as it is the type of technology involved. From this perspective policy should be sensitive to the process of siting, construction, operation and shutdown of the facility in the context of the comprehensive relationship between the technology and the community (i.e., in an ecological sense). Rather than focusing on the characteristics of the technology, this perspective focuses on the social institutional arrangements that make the technology acceptable. This paper examines six different technologies and eight separate conditions of acceptability in terms of public perception and acceptability of risk. The pattern of responses from a 1992 national survey of the United States reveal a stable pattern from technology to technology among the eight conditions of acceptability. The importance of the conditions examined in deter mining acceptability provides insight into the siting process by demonstrating an emphasis on sustainability through empowerment of self-determination.

AB A survey of the coastal zone of Abu Dhabi identified 22 halophytes of which nine are tolerant to inundation by seawater. A preliminary assessment suggested that 3.550 km(2) of saline land with a complete absence of natural vegetation was potentially suitable for the development of sustainable agro-ecosystems with halophyte crops and seawater irrigation. Such development plans, however, require the implementation of environmental impact assessments. The inter-tidal plant communities need special protection, as they are fragile, and economically and ecologically valuable.

TI By-catch of sharks in Patagonian coastal trawl fisheries
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH

DT Article
ID NURSERY; BAY
AB In coastal Patagonia, Argentina, an unknown number of species of sharks are frequently caught in bottom-trawl nets. Between 1993 and 1996, 454 trawls by Patagonian coastal fisheries (41 degrees-51 degrees S) were analysed; 264 included sharks. Of the seven species of sharks caught, the most frequent was the smoothhound Mustelus schmitti, mainly in Bahia Engafio (off Chubut). The argentine angelshark (Squatina argentina) and the tope (Galeorhinus galeus) were common in the north of Patagonia, the piked dogfish (Squalus acanthias) in the central zone, and the narrowmouthed catshark Schroederichthys bivius in the south. The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorhynchus cepedianus) was rarely caught. A single basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) was caught in San Matias Gulf(off Rio Negro). Although undesirable, the by-catch of sharks is growing as a result of the increase in the fishing activities of the region, and the sustainability of the shark populations in Patagonian coasts is a matter of concern.

DT Article
ID ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION
AB The concept and goals of mangrove ecosystem rehabilitation are considered and contrasted with ideas of ecosystem restoration. Three reasons for mangrove rehabilitation: conservation and landscaping; multiple use systems for high sustainable yield and protection of coastal areas, are then examined in detail. In each case, the underlying philosophy and limitations are presented. The practical problems of site selection for mangrove planting and techniques for regenerating mangroves are then considered. Some comments and data are then offered on mangrove ecosystem rehabilitation that is being carried out world-wide. Comment is made on the paucity of information. The practice and importance of monitoring and maintaining rehabilitated mangrove ecosystems is then presented. Finally, there is a discussion on the future management and research needs of mangrove ecosystem rehabilitation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID BRAZIL
AB Some municipalities in Brazil have been requesting orientation for the implementation of health education programs related to the control of schistosomiasis. This demand was based on experiences in the development of health education researches, strategies and materials for school-age children, involving the communities and secretaries of health and education. Motivated by this request and the recently implemented plan of health services (Unified Health System - Sistema Unico de Saude SUS) that gives autonomy to the municipalities to utilize health resources and services in Brazil, this paper presents an interactive perspective of planning health education research and programs; The purpose of this perspective is to stimulate a reflection on the needs and actions of institutions and people involved irt health education research and/or programs to obtain sustainability, commitment and effectiveness - not only in the control of schistosomiasis, but also in the improvement of environmental conditions, quality, of life and personal health. This perspective comprises interaction among three levels I elated to health education programs: the decision level, the executive level and the beneficiary, level. The needs and lines of action at each of these levels are discussed as well as the ways in which they can interact with each other. This proposal may lead to useful interactive ways of planning organizing executing and evaluating health education research and/or program, not only towards the prevention and control of the disease at stake, but also to promote health in general.

ID HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; TRANSMISSION; TYPE-1
AB This article contends that public heath ethics are becoming increasingly globalised. The ethics of health development intersect with other global issues, such as environmental degradation and poverty, and thus, represent a core component of sustainable development strategies. An analysis of several ethical issues in public health demonstrates that ethical concerns transcend state borders, and therefore, do not conform to conventional notions of state sovereignty. Furthermore, the ethical debates outlined in this paper point towards an increasing interdependence of public health risks and opportunities, and the need for 'good governance systems for health' which link together the political will and action of diverse sectors and partners at all levels from civil society to the global community.

AB We analyzed biological information from an area in which salt production activities are occurring-Ojo de Liebre (also known as Scammon's Lagoon), a coastal lagoon located within Mexico's largest protected area, the Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve. Population trends of the primary animal species inhabiting and visiting the area on a yearly basis, such as gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) and many species of marine birds, from before and after the onset of salt production activities, clearly indicated that salt production is compatible with both biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources. Although similar compatibility has been observed for most salt works around the world, this case study is particularly relevant because it is an example of how productive activities and nature conservation are compatible. Sustainable development is not achieved by suppressing the growth of human population, but by searching for production activities that are efficient in terms of environmental protection and income revenue for local people. In Mexico, salt production activities at Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve exemplify how nature conservation and human activity can coexist in a Latin American protected natural area.

AB The U.S. Air Force is entrusted with stewardship of a diversity of natural resources on installations throughout the United States. For many years these resources were managed with a commodities-based approach emphasizing multiple use, sustained yield, and the protection of single species regulated under the Endangered Species Act. Beginning in 1992, Air Force policymakers and field personnel recognized a need to adopt a new management policy. An ecosystem-based approach was adopted as a process for making, implementing, and evaluating decisions affecting the management of natural resources. This approach was implemented with a new policy directive, changes in funding priorities, and a new training course. We believe the ecosystem approach will better support the military mission and ensure the sustainability of natural resources on U.S. Air Force installations.

AB Ni/Ca0.8Sr0.2TiO3 and Ni/BaTiO3 catalysts have been prepared by solid phase crystallization (spc) method and used successfully for CO2 reforming of CH4 into synthesis gas at 850 degrees C. The Ni catalysts were in situ obtained during the reaction from starting materials, where nickel species was homogeneously incorporated in the perovskite structure. The high activity as well as the high sustainability against coke formation may be due to well dispersed and stable Ni metal particles over the perovskite, where the nickel species thermally evolve from the cations homogeneously distributed inside an inert perovskite matrix as the precursor. Oxygen mobility in the perovskite was also important for removing coke from nickel surface, resulting in the effective sustainability.

DT Article
AB As we approach a new century and a new millennium, much attention is being given to water and our management of it, reflected in 1997 in the diffusion of a comprehensive assessment of the freshwater resources of the world and in the convening in Morocco of the First World Water Forum. Events such as these have served to bring new perspectives to bear on the management of water resources. An example is in South Africa, where water and its management is being viewed at the highest levels of government as a metaphor for development and people's relations with one another. Here, the old heroic concept of water resource development, which challenged engineers to make water available to those who needed it, has been replaced by a more modest vision - that of managing the quantity, quality and reliability of the nation's water resources to achieve optimum long-term, environmentally sustainable, social and economic development for society from their use.

AB The effects of environment and management on the composition of short-tussock grasslands and the abundance of the invasive weed Hieracium pilosella were investigated in two small catchments. Species composition and site factors were recorded on a total of 182 plots and the management history of each catchment was reviewed. H. pilosella was present on >80% of all plots, but was at an early stage of invasion in one catchment (<5% cover) and dominant in the other (25% cover). Classification and ordination revealed strong between-catchment differences in community composition that reflected differences in environment (soil fertility and rainfall), disturbance history (animal populations and burning), and the stage of invasion by H. pilosella. In both catchments H. pilosella tended to be least abundant on the wettest, driest, and most fertile soils. However, such relationships were weak. Generalised additive models and regression showed that in the earlier stage of invasion individual site factors explained less than 20% of the variation in H. pilosella cover. Topographic position and slope (both indicative of soil moisture) were the most significant combined predictors, but together explained only 32% of the variation. In the later stage of invasion individual factors explained up to 33% of the variation. Topsoil sulphur, slope, and topsoil calcium were the most significant combined predictors, but together explained only 53% of the variation. Between-catchment comparisons highlighted the inter-related roles of environment, disturbance history, geographic location, availability of H. pilosella propagules, and stage of invasion in more fully explaining the abundance of H. pilosella. Of five models that have been proposed for Hieracium invasion, the: "grassland decline" model best incorporated the inter-related factors that influence spatial and temporal variation in H. pilosella abundance in the study area. This model concentrates on identifying predisposing and trigger factors that increase the likelihood of invasion and accounts for multiple causes and interactions by specifying five key factors that influence the ability of a plant species to invade existing vegetation: environment, disturbance, vegetation structure and composition, life history attributes of the invader, and the availability of invading propagules. The model potentially provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the causes of Hieracium invasion, targeting research effort, and developing sustainable management strategies.

AB Six 1 ha plots were established in a coastal savanna, called Fathala Forest, in Delta du Saloum National Park, Senegal. Two plots were placed in woodland, two in wooded.grassland, and two in transition woodland in order to describe structure and floristic composition of the vegetation. All trees greater than or equal to 5 cm dbh were sampled. The three selected vegetation types showed distinct differences in structure as well as in species composition. Woodland had high density (440-449 individuals per ha), many small trees, and high basal area (13.4 m(2) per ha). Transition woodland was characterised by low density (54-118 individuals per ha) but many large trees and a relatively large basal area (8.6-12.8 m(2) per ha). Wooded grassland was characterised by medium sized trees, it had low density (86-102 individuals per ha) and low basal area (3.8-5.7 m(2) per ha). Species richness ranged between 17 and 27 species per ha in the six plots. Only two species were found in all plots, Daniellia oliveri (Caesalpiniaceae) and Prosopis africana (Mimosaceae). Legumes dominated all plots. Wooded grassland and transition woodland had many characteristics of fire-affected vegetation in contrast to woodland. Today wooded grassland encroaches on woodland and transition woodland. Management of the latter two vegetation types should be given priority as they maintain structural and floristic characteristics that are essential to conserve biodiversity and original features of the vegetation, and they are also important for local people who are allowed to make sustainable use of the vegetation.

ID FORESTS
AB The question of whether ecosystem process studies can be made relevant to new, emerging management strategies to achieve ecosystem sustainability on U.S. Federal lands is addressed by examining a small sample of studies underway in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. Processes being studied by many researchers-other than those directly associated with habitat creation-appear largely unrelated to policy statements such as the Northwest Forest Plan (ROD 1994). Yet these processes appear to underpin the broader goals of ecosystem sustainability and, fundamentally, the Plan itself. Studies of successional, windthrow, podzolization, and productivity processes in southeast Alaska forests, and studies on the role of early-successional species in changing mineral-soil organic matter in Pacific Northwest forests, are briefly described. Examples are given of how to use information from these studies in management strategies, some of which are being implemented by managers. We conclude that management studies-designed with help from ecosystem-process researchers-are a viable method to link process research with management for ecosystem sustainability.

ID OLD-GROWTH FORESTS; SPOTTED OWLS; HABITAT
AB Fifteen years of research on old-growth and managed coniferous forests have provided sufficient understanding of biodiversity to suggest a basis for ecosystem management. First, natural old forests have a metaphysics-values associated with their existence and function can never be addressed fully with the scientific method alone; we cannot recreate old growth. Second, five processes underly forest development: crown-class differentiation, decadence, canopy stratification, understory development, and development of habitat breadth. Habitat breadth results from fine-scale spatial heterogeneity that produces structural and compositional diversity-tree species diversity, foliage-height diversity, and variety of recurring vegetation site-types. Third, the processes shape trophic pathways, lead to niche diversification, and help to structure fungal, invertebrate, and vertebrate communities. The contribution of each process to niche diversification differs in strength from its contribution to variance in forest structure and composition. Decadence seems the most fundamental, unpredictable, and intractable of the processes. Theoretically, ecosystem management based on these processes can produce landscapes that provide habitat for wildlife associated with late-seral forests, sustainable production of timber and alternative forest products, ecological services such as carbon assimilation and sequestration, economic activity that sustains rural communities, and win-win solutions with good cultural fit to conflicts over land use. Fourth, substantial uncertainty exists in every aspect of ecosystem management. Thus, achieving diverse benefits from forests requires active, intentional, adaptive ecosystem management.

AB This paper examines the progress made in Malaysia in implementing Chapter 17 in Agenda 21 since 1992. The progress is measured against the programme areas identified in Chapter 17 and the challenges which are faced by those involved in marine environment management in the country. In summary these challenges are reduction, prevention and elimination of marine pollution, improving the management of Malaysia's coastal areas, conservation of marine and coastal biological diversity and sustainable management of marine resources. As it stands there is no overall programme to implement Chapter 17 in Malaysia, and present activities consist of largely individual initiatives at agency or departmental level. The lack of integration and an overarching policy on marine matters in general, are found to be the main obstacles to marine environment protection. However, efforts are being made to at least identify and define key concepts such as integrated coastal zone management. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

To mirror the great complexity of impact of shrimp culture, both environmental and socio-economic issues have been examined. There is evidence that some of the impacts adversely affect the long-term sustainability of shrimp culture itself. The paper reveals the fact that if the societal value of the coastal environment that supports life-and-livelihood of millions of coastal communities of Bangladesh is not recognized, aquaculture industry might give rise to severe ecological, economic and social problems and conflicts. Some recommendations are made to improve the present situation and develop sustainable aquaculture (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The 'Beneficial Uses' approach in coastal management in Hong Kong: a
   compromise between rapid urban development and sustainable development
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER-QUALITY; POLLUTION
AB In Hong Kong, continuing population increase, economic growth and fast urban and infrastructure developments have exacerbated the already polluted inshore waters and exerted an unprecedented pressure on the coastal environment. Coral, seagrass and other marine habitats have been adversely affected and estimated fisheries loss has exceeded US$ 26 million. As a compromise between the rapid urban expansion and sustainable development of the coastal environment, a long-term strategy for the protection of the marine environment has been introduced on the basis of the 'Beneficial Uses' approach. Coastal habitats are classified in terms of their ecological, economic and scientific importance, and priority of protection assigned according to their relative importance, beneficial uses and susceptibility to pollution. Although not entirely satisfactory, this approach minimises major conflicts between different beneficial uses and the impact of developments on sensitive coastal areas. It affords realistic protection to vital coastal resources under the enormous pressure of rapid urban development. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The Russian Arctic coastal zone management problems: past lessons and
   new realities
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The growing attention to the development of coastal zone resources is notable not only for moderate and southern latitudes but also in the Arctic regions. In Russia this process has a history related to exploration of non-renewable resources and the lone-term policy of moving labour forces to the Far North and East. The role of the Russian Arctic coastal zone in the national economy had been stimulated by active usage of the Northern Sea Route for 60 years as a mainstream Arctic transport line. Diversified human usage of all kinds of natural resources is getting more controversial. A deep revaluation of existing methods and management approaches is needed in accordance with the complexities of Russian social/economic and ecological factors in the Arctic. The modern challenge of transition towards sustainable development also needs to be reevaluated. The last decade has shown a real effort of all Arctic countries to expand cooperation in joint scientific multidisciplinary studies. The studies are aimed at elaboration of common views on Arctic development and protection of environment. Moreover, the Arctic shelf and coastal zone are getting a new arena of international investments for industrial projects and implementation due to recovery of huge deposits of oil and gas resources of sophisticated technologies. All this makes international scientific cooperation more of a reality. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Towards sustainable development for the Murmansk region
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Murmansk region is situated in northwest Russia and is bordered by the Barents Sea. Most of the region (an area of 145 000 sq km) lies beyond the Arctic circle. Historically, the region has been of great importance politically and economically to the Russian Federation, providing the country with its only all-weather northern port and serving as the home to the Northern fleet of the Russian Navy, and the Murmansk Shipping Company (the main shipping agent for commercial cargo along the Russian Northern Sea Route). The main economic activities of the Murmansk region are mining and metallurgy, fishing, shipping and forestry. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the potential for oil and gas development in the Barents Sea which provides economic opportunities as well as environmental challenges for the Murmansk region.
   Despite the rich mineral resources and bioresources of this coastal region, Murmansk is suffering economically and is also facing severe environmental problems. It is officially recognized as the most environmentally devastated region of the Arctic. Key problems include air pollution, nuclear and other hazardous wastes, and resource depletion. Industries of the region are in need of investment for development and modernization.
   In order to protect the region's natural resource base and fragile ecosystem, and improve socio-economic conditions, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)-Capacity 21, in cooperation with the government of the Russian Federation, initiated the Murmansk Region-Barents Seu Sustainable Development Project. This project aims to strengthen the capacity of institutions in the region to effectively plan and implement environmentally sustainable economic development policies and programs.
   Phase 1 of the UNDP project resulted in development of a Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) for the region which presents action strategies and specific recommendations to strengthen the economy and environment of the Murmansk region. In preparation of the SDAP and other project activities, multi-disciplinary and inter-sectoral Task Force teams addressed a broad range of topics including coastal zone management (CZM), radioactive waste handling, mining and metallurgy, energy, and public health.
   This article provides a brief overview of the Murmansk Region-Barents Sea Sustainable Development Project. It then focuses on the CZM component, discussing priority environment and economic development issues for ocean and coastal areas and looking at Integrated Coastal Zone Management as a framework for addressing some of the region's needs. Specific recommendations for sustainable development of ocean and coastal areas are proposed (for fisheries, oil and gas development, shipping, waste management, etc.). The article concludes by summarizing the overall project achievements and highlighting priority programs identified by regional specialists as well as some factors influencing regional progress towards sustainable development.
   The Murmansk Region State Committee on Environmental Protection served as the National Executing Agency for the UNDP project. Project management and technical services were provided, under contract with UNDP, by Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), an international NGO whose work focuses on human and organizational capacity building for sustainable development. Over 150 local and international experts collaborated on the project. Key institutions contributing to the coastal zone management component of the project were: Murmansk Marine Biological Institute (Kola Science Center); Murmansk State Committee on Environmental Protection (Marine Inspection); Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries (PINRO); Urban Harbors Institute, University of Massachusetts, Boston; Fritjof Nansen Institute, Norway, and the Coastal Zone Management Centre of the Ministry of Transport, Public Works, and Water Management, The Netherlands.

TI Tributyltin: case study of a chronic contaminant in the coastal
   environment
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID NUCELLA-LAPILLUS; UNITED-STATES; TBT; OYSTER; REGULATIONS; BUTYLTINS; UK
AB As early as 1975, significant and repeated disturbances were observed to occur in the Crassostrea gigas oyster farms of the Arcachon Bay along the French Atlantic Coastline. TBT contamination of the local breeding waters was found to be responsible for failure to reproduce and for anomalies occurring in the shell calcification of adult oysters leading to stunted growth. On 17 January 1982, the French Ministry of the Environment issued a 3 month ban on the sale of marine anti-fouling paints with an organotin compound content exceeding 3%.
   The Ministerial ban was subsequently renewed and reinforced and ultimately converted into an enforcement decree transcribing an European Union directive into French law, in October 1992. The ban was the first official action in response to a growing awareness to the TBT-related pollution of some coastal areas and to its unacceptable impact on shellfish farming.
   These measures were adopted as soon as the first scientific evidence of a causal relationship was established between tributyltin and oyster shell anomalies. Since then numerous research studies have been conducted on the geochemical behavior of tributyltin, its ecotoxicity and on TBT-related risks presented by antifouling paints. The knowledge gained on this topic since 1982 reveals in particular that:
   TBT is extremely toxic to aquatic organisms in general and to molluscs in particular for which the NOELs are below I ng l(-1) (imposex, calcification anomalies),
   Contamination levels can reach very high values in port areas, and even exceed no effect levels beyond which mollusc reproduction and growth are affected, in estuaries or semi-enclosed areas,
   Contamination of breeding waters has a significant economic impact, jeopardizing the sustainable development of some highly exposed marine activities,
   The ban on TBT use in antifouling paints for crafts under 25 m represents an efficient way of reducing TBT inputs in coastal areas and restoring proper water quality,
   The regulations adopted by many countries to ban or restrict TBT use on ships sailing along the coastline, have prompted manufacturers to develop less toxic paints.
   Fifteen years after TBT was first implicated as a major cause of coastal contamination, the issue no longer lies in finding out under which conditions TBT could still be used in antifouling paints, but rather in developing environmentally-harmless formulations. While the ban on TBT-based paints may be justified due to their harmful impact on coastal ecosystems, substitutes based on the release of biocides (copper oxide, pesticides...) also give rise to major concerns. Prevention of marine biofouling is not motivated merely by esthetics: it responds to economic needs and to navigation safety requirements. Protection of the ships while preserving the coastal ecosystems remains a major challenge for future research. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Marine-related physical natural hazards affecting coastal megacities of
   the Asia-Pacific region - awareness and mitigation
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT

DT Article
ID SEA-LEVEL RISE; VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE
AB The fast-growing, coastal megacities of the Asia-Pacific region are expanding into areas that are vulnerable to marine-related physical natural hazards, or, because of physical environmental changes, will become increasingly vulnerable within the timescale of city planning. The hazards comprise those that are due to extreme events such as storm surge and tsunami which may be catastrophic in their impacts; and those that relate to continuing changes over the long-term, notably global sea-lever rise, sedimentary consolidation and coastal erosion. The latter may be exacerbated by human activities such as the increasing production of 'greenhouse' gases and over-abstraction of groundwater, and, while not threatening catastrophic loss of life or destruction of property, do have important economic and social implications for the future.
   There are two complementary approaches to hazard mitigation - constraining the hazard, and reducing vulnerability to the hazard. The contributions that science can make in the planning and implementation of sustainable adaptive measures are to improve the quantification of the incidence and severity of the various hazards, establishing realistic timescales of incidence, estimating return periods; and to establish the geographical limits of vulnerability to the hazards in a range of likely scenarios over timescales appropriate to the planning cycle. Contemporary, high risk, hazard scenarios for existing city developments demand an approach which focuses on effective warning networks and emergency planning; long-term, incremental hazards that are forecast to affect both developed and periurban areas can be addressed with a strategic planning approach, involving relocation and capital protective works. The selection of strategic measures demands the best possible predictive information on hazards and on vulnerability, including its full socio-economic evaluation so that the costs and benefits of the possible mitigation options can be realistically assessed. A predictive capacity, developed through modelling, requires the collection of reliable baseline and monitoring data relating to the hazards over a range of timescales in local, regional and global perspectives.

ID MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS; SEA-LEVEL RISE; CANADA; ZONE
AB Between 1972 (Stockholm) and 1996 (Rimouski), global awareness in relation to coastal management moved from a sectoral to a comprehensive and integrated approach, from the protection of the marine environment and coastal resources to the concept of sustainable development. This paper summarizes the progress made at the international level in relation to coastal management issues, with particular emphasis to the post-UNCED Rio Declaration. A synthesis of the main highlights and outcomes of the Coastal Zone Canada '96 International Conference (CZC'96) held at Rimouski, Canada, is then presented. Two declarations of principle (The Rimouski Declaration and Call for International Action) were adopted by the participants at CZC'96, They call for Canada and other international governments to better define national objectives, programs, and mechanisms permitting coastal communities to play a full and active role in the intelligent and practical management of coastal and maritime resources, and to meet their international coastal and ocean obligations thereby contributing to the sustainability of the oceans.

AB An indicator is essentially a statistic based upon a time trend data set which is relevant to a particular issue of concern, The "added value" of an indicator over a raw data set is that the indicator is presented in a way which represents the broader significance or implications of the data. Indicators tell a story, Indicators could be a useful tool within coastal zone management for purposes of communication and decision making. The National Marine Indicators Working Group has been tasked with developing indicators of marine ecosystem health and sustainable resource use in Canada. The methods, criteria and categories used by the Working Group as a part of Canada's national set of environmental indicators are presented. A list of marine indicators is outlined along with an example (Pacific herring fishery). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MARINE PROTECTED AREAS
AB Uncertainty will always be part of managing marine ecosystems, and resource conservation must be based on explicit recognition of this fact coupled with suitable mechanisms for dealing with uncertainty. Science programs in Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans are evolving to meet the challenges of resource conservation in a context of increasing pressure for access to resources and declining public funding. Studies of stock dynamics in an ecosystem context and of the links between variations in environmental conditions and stock productivity are helping to reduce uncertainty about long-term production potential. New forms of cooperative relationships between government, industry, universities and the general public are contributing to better knowledge of marine systems and to development of consensus views on conservation requirements for fishery resources. The precautionary approach to conservation has been adopted and use of marine protected areas will be expanded to complement other conservation approaches. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Coral reef management in Belize: an approach through Integrated Coastal
   Zone Management
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Belize has one of the most extensive reef ecosystems in the Western Hemisphere, comprising one of the largest barrier reefs in the world, three atolls and a complex network of inshore reefs. Until recently, the main impacts were probably from natural events such as hurricanes. However, anthropogenic threats such as sedimentation, agrochemical run-off, coastal development, tourism and overfishing are now of concern. To limit these impacts, Belize is taking the approach of integrated coastal zone management. The programme is building on the existing legislative framework and involves the development of an appropriate institutional structure to co-ordinate management activities in the coastal zone. A Coastal Zone Management Plan is being prepared, which will include many measures that will directly benefit the reefs: a zoning scheme for the coastal zone, incorporating protected areas; legislation and policy guidelines; research and monitoring programmes; education and public awareness campaigns; measures for community participation; and a financial sustainability mechanism.

ID COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The GEF/UNDP/IMO Regional Programme on Marine Pollution Prevention and Management in the East Asian Seas (MPP-EAS) conducts annually a regional training course on the application of the integrated coastal management (ICM) system for addressing marine pollution problems. The training initiative is unique in that: (a) the training curriculum is tailored for strengthening environmental protection and management capacity in the developing countries; (b) it is conducted in the ICM demonstration sites which provide practical exposure to the problems and their solutions; (c) it is a joint effort of a number of educational and research institutions in the region; and (d) it focuses on providing a broad-base, multidisciplinary training to environmental and natural resource planners, managers and trainers. The training package includes ICM approaches, tools and methodologies particularly concerning institutional arrangements, improving legal regime and enforcement, environmental monitoring, scientific services, sustainable financing and information management. This paper attempts to review the outputs, experiences and lessons learned from the past three years. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Coastal tourism development in Southeast Asia: relevance and lessons for
   coastal zone management
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID EVOLUTION
AB The increasing demand for resorts has brought about substantial changes in the spatial and structural patterns of coastal tourism development in Southeast Asia. While unplanned resort development has resulted and will continue to have negative impacts on the coastal environment, integrated resort development will increase significantly in future. Islands, which often are ideal locations for resorts, are more vulnerable because of their limited resources and size. Coastal tourism development has often insufficiently understood the coastal environment. The tourism experience provides valuable lessons for coastal zone management: the necessity for Environmental Impact Assessment, management of increasing tourist numbers, evaluation of small-scale resort development, consideration of conservation, defining and revising planning standards, and aiming for sustainable development.

TI Policy issues and management framework of Chinhae Bay, Republic of Korea
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID COASTAL
AB By recognizing the rapid degradation of coastal resources and responding to Agenda 21, the Korean government has recently made a series of initiatives to apply the concept of integrated coastal management (ICM) at both national and local levels.In the Marine Development Basic Plan of 1996, the Korean government proposed to establish national mechanism of implementing ICM principles by enacting the Coastal Management Act and developing the National Coastal Management Plan. To support the efforts at national level, an ICM pilot study has been carried out by the Korean Ocean Research and Development Institute (KORDI) since 1994, in one of the most severely impacted estuarine system on the south coast, Chinhae Bay. The main goals of this pilot study are to develop an integrated coastal management model that is implementable in Korean coastal governance system, and to identify area-specific solutions for the sustainable development of coastal resources. This paper reviews major policy issues and the management framework of the Bay and explains the ICM processes adopted to formulate the Chinhae Bay Integrated Management Plan.

AB Agency theorists argue that organizations typically get little value from using employees and that they should instead use nonemployees operating fully as residual claimants. Yet, even in a context where those theorists would predict virtually no employees-taxicab organizations-they are common. What drives the use of employment relationships in these organizations? The authors show how employment relationships are linked to firm capabilities and strategic opportunities in a sample of taxicab organizations, relying on arguments about the linkage of employment to the internal liquidity of labor, organizational routines, and internal cooperation. The theoretical arguments and Endings suggest what organizations gain by having employment relationships and show that integrating the agency theoretic argument with the other theoretical arguments leads toward a resource-based view of strategy and human resources. The authors highlight the importance of embedding arguments on the internal management of human resources in the strategic and competitive context in which organizations operate. Their arguments also have implications for the resource-based approach to strategy in mapping the resource space of human assets in organizations and, within that space, directing attention to how organizations gain sustainable competitive advantage through managing human resources.

ID EMOTIONAL MAN
AB Leading critics of technology - particularly Jacques Ellul and Langdon Winner - argue that social or human techniques serve exclusively the purpose of adapting human beings, in an irreversible process, to the growth of technique towards ever greater efficiency and complexity. The article first illustrates this argument; however, these very asssumptions are then challenged by examples drawing on psychological techniques of human growth. Those examples describe techniques which serve to strengthen the self (human "nature") against technical adaptation and which are capable of reversing technicization in human beings and thus of reducing technical complexity.
   One might speak of "renaturalizing" life processes which have been largely technicized. Such techniques seem to have no place in Ellul's thought. However, their goal is not the reestablishment of a "nature" conceived as pristine (nor one constructed along social-darwinist lines). What such techniques aspire to is to preserve the integrity of life processes while simultaneously adapting them to long-term (sustainable) human enjoyment.

AB The agricultural landscape is associated with secondary vegetation. It is one of the most represented landscapes in the Far-East and represents the ecological linkage of landscape boundaries between urbanized and natural systems. The pattern and process of secondary vegetation in rural landscapes have been effected by spatio-temporal natural and cultural landscape elements. The current Status-Quo of the vegetation landscape is faced to risk of abandonment, over-use of forest-land and other socio-economical problems in the Far-East. In this situation, the notion "sustainability" is necessary to establish a framework for landscape-ecological planning in the rural region. This paper describes that sustainable vegetation management acts as a positive factor to maintaining secondary vegetation. Holistic management strategies with improved traditional management regimes, economic assistance, and environmental education, must be adapted to sustainable development of rural vegetation landscape in the Far-East.

AB In Canada, microbia[ pest control products and agents are regulated under the Pest Control Products Act, administered by the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) for the Minister of Health. A microbial includes bacteria, algae, fungi, protozoa, viruses, mycoplasmae or rickettsiae and related organisms. Microbial pest control products and agents can include those derived through genetic engineering.
   When the PMRA was established in 1995, specific directions were given by government to facilitate access to alternatives to traditional chemical products; to support environmental sustainability; and to pursue international cooperation to accelerate registration.
   Currently in Canada, there are 8 active ingredients and 34 products registered. In 1998, there were 19 research permits and notifications for active ingredients, an increase from 1997.
   Data requirements are set out in guidelines (Pro98-01 Regulatory Proposal: Guidelines for the registration of microbia[ pest control agents and products), rather than in regulation. General categories for data requirements for Tier 1 ( the set of information which is typically sufficient to allow regulators to determine that a product presents an acceptably low level of risk) include information or data on characterization, health toxicity, environmental toxicity, and efficacy. Pre-submission consultations between registrants and PMRA are encouraged. The main objectives of these consultations are to determine the appropriate study protocols and the subset of data requirements from the guidelines that may be required for the registration of a particular proposed product as well as the type of information required to support data waivers.
   Key issues, questions and challenges regarding registration
   1. Characterization of the microbial active ingredient is seen as critical and fundamental to the determination of the other data requirements both in environment and in health. The key components are:
   identification of the microorganism
   relationship to mammalian or other pathogens
   toxin producing potential
   manufacturing process, including potential for contaminants
   physical/technical properties, including storage stability.
   2. Building on good information on characterization, for environmental risk assessment, information on host/ target range, geographical distribution of host/target, a nd the geographical distribution of the microbia[ are key questions.
   4. With respect to publicly-funded research groups, there is a need for links with commercial partners at an appropriate stage in order to move their products into the regulatory system and onto the marketplace.
   PMRA is working to support the registration and use of microbial products through developing data requirements appropriate to microbials, working with growers and other stakeholders to support the implementation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies that include the use of microbials, harmonizing data requirements with both the US and other OECD countries, and ensuring the development of regulations and policies to encourage registration of these products.

AB In Denmark several factors like the national pesticide action plan, ethical questions, national research strategy, increasing share of organic farming and fees are affecting the policy regarding regulatory agencies approach for products supporting sustainable pest management.
   The use of microbial pesticides in Denmark are limited, with the relatively largest share used in the greenhouse sector.
   Approval of a product not sold in Denmark before July 26, 1993 consists of two parts: An EU approval of the active micro-organism, and a national approval of the product containing the active micro-organism. An EU approval of an active micro-organism is only granted if the active micro-organism is included in Annex I of the directive of authorized active organisms. As a main principle, an active micro-organism shall be entered on the list of authorized active organisms before the Danish EPA may grant an approval for sale or import of products containing active micro-organisms. Until now five new organisms have been recommended for EU approval and inclusion in Annex I of the Directive, but so far none have been included.
   For products sold in Denmark before July 26, 1993 a transitional scheme specified in the Order is applied. Under this procedure application for approval of such products should be submitted to the Danish EPA before July 26, 1994 if the products were intended for sale in Denmark after this date. The application is considered at a national level only by the Danish EPA. The Danish EPA has received applications concerning nine different active micro-organisms.
   Both GMO's and biocides are covered by specific legislation. If the GMO's are also pesticides, they must also comply with the Danish pesticides legislation. As no transgenic microbial pesticides or microbial biocides have yet been registered in Denmark, there is no legal practice on this issue.

AB The registration procedures for microbial pesticides have been based by and large on those developed for registration of chemical pesticides. However, fungi as living organisms differ in many aspects from inert substances. These differences are pointed out and discussed in the light of practical experiences. A pragmatic registration procedure is proposed taking into account the use of a fungus based product in relation to its natural distribution and behaviour. On the one hand, the use of a fungus naturally occurring on the target host does not need a sophisticated registration procedure. On the other hand, however, a genetically altered fungus applied against a non natural host in a non natural habitat needs very careful examination.

AB Understanding the contributions of soil microorganisms to soil stabilization at the molecular level will lead to ways to enhance inputs for sustainable agricultural systems. Recent discoveries of copious production of glycoprotein (glomalin) by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and the apparent recalcitrance of this material in soils led to the comparison between concentration of glomalin and aggregate stability. Stability was measured on air-dried aggregates rewetted by capillary action and then subjected to wet sieving for 10 min. Thirty-seven samples from four geographic areas of the U.S. and one area of Scotland were tested. The monoclonal antibody used to discover glomalin on AM hyphae was employed to assess immunoreactive glomalin on aggregate surfaces by immunofluorescence and in extracts from aggregates by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunofluorescence was observed on at least some surfaces of aggregates from all soils examined, but was most evident on aggregates with high glomalin concentrations. Easily extractable glomalin (EEG) was solubilized by 20 mM citrate, pH 7.0 at 121 degrees C for 30 min, and total glomalin (TG) was solubilized with 50 mM citrate, pH 8.0 at 121 degrees C for 90 to 450 min. Some soils required up to seven sequential extractions to remove all of the glomalin. Aggregate stability was linearly correlated (p < 0.001) with all measures of glomalin (mg/g of aggregates) in these soils. The best predictor of aggregate stability (AS) was immunoreactive easily extractable glomalin (IREEG) according to the following relationship: AS = 42.7 +61.3 x log(10) IREEG (r(2) = 0.86; p < 0.001, n = 37).

ID WHITE LUPIN; YIELD; PROTEIN
AB Currently, white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is gaining importance due to its high nitrogen fixation capability and potential in sustainable crop production systems. Even though research conducted in Australia, Chile, Germany, New Zealand, and Portugal has indicated lupin's positive potential as human and animal food, such information from Virginia and adjoining areas of the United States is not available. In addition, effects of growing environment and genotypes on lupin seed composition need to be characterized to evaluate lupin's potential as a food and feed crop. Towards this end, seed of 12 lupin genotypes produced in Maine (USA) and Virginia (USA) were compared to determine genotypic and environmental effects on contents of protein, sugar, oil, various fatty acids, amino acids, and minerals. The protein content of dry seed was not affected by growing environment. However, growing environment had significant effects on contents of total sugar, amino acids, oil, fatty acids, and minerals. Significant variation existed among 12 lupin genotypes for various traits when composition of seed produced in Virginia was evaluated. The results indicated that site-specific evaluation of adapted lupin genotypes for chemical composition should be included in efforts to evaluate lupin's overall potential as a food or feed crop.

AB This article deals with the construction of the content and goals of Finnish environmental policy. The basic issue is whether there are discourse and strategy coalitions of key players to be identified as well as interests with which the discourses and strategies coincide. In the study, 41 key players in the Finnish National Commission on Sustainable Development were interviewed. The main result is that environmental discourses show diversity. Two ideal types of basic environmental policy strategies, termed 'ecological modernisation' and 'structural change', were found. It is concluded that there is no easy starting point for unity in environmental policy making. However, additional research is needed to examine the relevant policy sectors from the broad viewpoint of social development and environmental politics.

AB Biodegradable and compostable plastics, especially those based on renewable resources from the agricultural industry, are an essential innovation. This innovation offers substantial impulses for the future technologies. A lot of jobs and a potential market of > 1 million tonnes/year for biodegradable plastics in Europe is proposed by the EU Commission Directorate General XII. Bioplastics based on starch use the benefits of natural polymerization and the availability of raw material and process technology. Thermoplastic starch TPS(R) and blends of TPS(R) with hydrophobic biodegradable polymers are in the BIOTEC(R) research and production program. Latest development results are reaction-compounding process technologies to produce TPS(R) derivatives and starchesters in a continuous extrusion process. Applications for TPS(R) bioplastic granules BIOPLAST are film extrusion and injection moulding. The BIOFLEX film has mechanical properties, such as PE films are opaque to transparent, printable, sealable, shrinkable and can be colourized. BIOFLEX is permeable to vapour and has good barrier properties to oxygen. BIOFLEX can be used in the same way as conventional foils, for instance for garbage sacks, shopping bags, packing up, nets for food packaging, diapers, agricultural or technical uses. According to DIN 54900, TPS(R) bioplastics are completely biodegradable and compostable. The innovation of this bioplastic technology is an excellent example for a sustainable development, which means the responsible use of available natural resources and production processes that take environmental aspects and natural circulations into consideration.

TI Nuclear energy system for the global environmental regulation in Korea -
   Energy-economy interaction model analysis
SO PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Global environmental regulation such as limits on CO2 emissions will change the energy cost as well as energy mix, and it will eventually affect the potential economic growth and future energy demand. The rise of energy price from the environmental regulation will encourage the efficiency increase of energy use, fuel switching and the substitution between the energy and the other factors of production like labour and capital. Such situations can be successfully simulated through an energy-economy model which permits two-way interaction between energy and economy.
   An analysis on the role of nuclear energy system for meeting the global environmental constraint like CO2 emission regulation, has been performed through an energy-economy interaction model EFOM-MACRO-KOREA. In case carbon taxation which is a widely discussed policy measure for CO2 abatement should be introduced, the role of nuclear energy in the domestic sustainable energy system as well as the economic impacts has been assessed. For the analysis, various scenarios in tax rate have been considered. Levying carbon tax will decrease future economic growth, and the decrease will be bigger in case that there are some restrictions on nuclear installation. It is shown that nuclear energy system will play an important role in Korean sustainable development up to 2040 in most cases. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

SO PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) review of global warming issues suggests man's activities have resulted in a discemible influence on global climate. The panel identifies options which could be employed to ameliorate the climate influencing greenhouse effect which is attributed primarily to carbon dioxide and other gaseous emissions from fossil fuel energy sources. One option identified is nuclear power, as an alternative energy source which would reduce these emissions. The panel observes that, although nuclear power is a relatively greenhouse gas free energy source, there are a number of issues related to it's use which are slowing it's deployment. This paper enumerates the issues raised by the IPCC and addresses each in turn in the context of CANDU reactors and sustainable development. It is concluded that the issues are not fundamental barriers to expanded installation of nuclear fission energy systems. Nuclear reactors, and CANDU reactors in particular, can meet the energy needs of current generations while enhancing the technological base which will allow future generations to meet their energy needs. The essential requirements of a sustainable system are thus met. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Muddling toward sustainability: The transformation of environmental
   planning in Israel
SO PROGRESS IN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID POLICY; PLANNERS
AB This papers asks two questions. First, is the implementation process of sustainable development programs indeed a top-down process, whereby countries try to implement Agenda 21 or supra-national guidelines derived from global concerns? Second, what role can planners play in promoting sustainable development programs? An in-depth analysis of the seemingly unlikely Israeli case suggests that the content, processes and role of environmental planning have been transformed amidst a multi-faceted crisis. Without political support, well-placed planners have managed to attach significant environmental clauses to most major plans prepared since 1990 (when the crisis erupted). While these measures do not amount to a sustainable development program, significant steps toward such a program have been made. On the basis of this case study, as well as some supporting evidence from Europe, it is argued that the main decisions are made at the national level, exploiting country-specific policy windows. At this level planners can take an active role as policy entrepreneurs in linking problems, actions and political opportunities at propitious moments to promote sustainable development policies.

AB The natural variability of precipitating cloud systems over the western Pacific 'warm pool' is investigated by analysing aircraft C-band radar data collected on 24 aircraft missions during the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment of the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere programme (TOGA COARE) in relation to the infrared (IR) temperature patterns measured contemporaneously by geosynchronous satellite. The data are analysed at fine (24 km x 24 km) and coarse (240 km diameter) horizontal resolutions, which correspond to typical resolutions of mesoscale and general-circulation models, respectively. The analysis is statistical and imposes no a priori conceptual model or subjectively decided-upon structure categories. The mean IR temperature of cloud tops, and the sizes of rain areas mapped by radar (and objectively subdivided into convective and stratiform subareas), are tallied and related to each other to obtain statistics representative of the four-month period of the TOGA COARE.
   At fine resolution the precipitation region underlying very cold cloud tops (<208 K) always contained stratiform precipitation and had less than a 50% probability of containing some amount of convective precipitation. The frequency of occurrence of precipitation, the area covered by all types of precipitation, and the area covered by stratiform precipitation all increased with decreasing mean IR temperature. In contrast, the area occupied by convective precipitation was independent of mean IR temperature.
   Over a period of sustained convective cell activity, the cells never instantaneously occupied more than a small fraction of the coarse area, and never more than 30% of a fine-grid element. However, as cells weakened they evolved into stratiform precipitation, and the stratiform region grew as each cell finished its active convective phase and was added to the stratiform area. The sustainability of convective cells over time thus determined the overall size of a precipitation area.
   Rain-area size did not correlate linearly with mean IR temperature nor any other statistical measure of the IR temperature pattern at coarse resolution. However, two-dimensional joint-probability distributions of mean IR temperature (a measure of cloud structure) and radar echo parameters (which measure precipitation structure) on the coarse scale yield insight into the natural variability of precipitation processes over the warm pool: most notably, large precipitation areas (>50% of a coarse area) tended to have low mean cloud-top temperatures (<235 K), and high mean cloud-top temperatures (>235 K) were associated with small precipitation areas (<50% of a coarse area). However, the converse of these two results was not true. Low mean cloud-top temperatures (<235 K) were associated with a wide range of precipitation areas from near 0 to 90% of a coarse area, and small precipitation areas (<20% of a coarse area) had mean IR temperatures ranging from 210-295 K.
   Once precipitation regions reached a large enough size (near 20% of a coarse area), the cloud systems were efficient at spreading ice outside of the boundaries of the precipitation regions. Larger rain areas (>20% of a coarse area) were predominantly stratiform (>75% by area and >50% by rainfall amount). Precipitating cold clouds (containing ice) with stratiform area fractions <50% were not observed.
   During active phases of the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO), the probability that there were no satellite-observable clouds within a coarse-resolution area of the aircraft sample was practically zero (maximum mean IR temperature never >286 K), while during suppressed phases the near or total absence of clouds was common. Large rain areas with very cold cloud tops were common under active conditions but not under suppressed conditions. The large rain areas with very cold cloud tops (>20% of the coarse area and <235 K mean IR temperature) occurred primarily during the active phase and were 75-100% stratiform by area and >70% by rain fraction. In the suppressed phases, stratiform rain fractions varied widely since most of the rainfall was associated with small precipitation areas.
   Although the joint-probability distributions differ substantially between active and suppressed phases of the ISO, the overall precipitation-area size is not strongly related to wind speed, wind direction, or thermodynamic variables, as seen in the storm inflow soundings obtained by the TOGA COARE aircraft.

AB The main aims of this study were to investigate (1) the relationship between the energy balance of young stages of a rheophilic cyprinid, Chondrostoma nasus, and water current and (2) the critical water velocities for this species during its early ontogeny, Experiments were conducted in a recirculating flume. Water velocity and type, size and density of prey were varied. The foraging behaviour of three size classes of nase (15, 20 and 25 mm TL) was filmed and analysed with an Image Analysis System. Capture success and consumption were determined and the following critical water velocities were measured: (1) nul benefit water velocity (NBWV); (2) nul consumption water velocity (NCWV); and (3) maximum sustainable water velocity (MSWV). The capture success drastically declined above a certain value of water velocity which increased with body size. Consumption varied with density and size of prey and with fish size. It was high within a range of water velocities which increased with fish size and then declined to the NCWV. The profitable range of water currents increased during ontogeny, and swimming costs in early larvae were higher in proportion to the maximal energy intake, compared with larger fish (positive net energy gain between 0 and 7 cm s(-1) in 15 mm TL nase and between 0 and 15 cm s(-1) in 20 and 25 mm TL nase). Although the three defined critical water velocities did not differ from each other in early larvae, MSWV in 20-25 mm TL nase were significantly higher than the NBWV and the NCWV. The MSWV of nase showed a linear increase with fish size. A comparison with values from the literature for other fish species shows that MSWV may depend more on body shape than on species-specific life history patterns. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Many archive, library and museum in hot and humid regions of the world constitute microenvironments in the building that are conducive to the growth of micro-organisms, on their collections. Conservators have often dealt with the problem through an extensive disinfection and cleaning of the collections which use harsh and toxic chemicals. Consequently, it became necessary to search for a safe, effective and locally sustainable solution for the problem. It is commonly considered that high relative humidity environments are the main factor for activity of micro-organisms on collections. However, ventilation has been proved to moderate the biodeterioration even when the objects contained high enough moisture for microbial activity. In the present work the efficacy of ventilation to arrest microbial growth and reduce activity in both contaminated air and historic objects has been investigated. Laboratory experiments were carried out using a 500-liter environmental chamber to simulate contaminated rooms in buildings. Specific ventilation requirements to control fungal and bacterial activities in the air and paper samples have been established. These constitute a safe, reliable, and low cost control method for fungal and bacterial contamination of historic objects. In addition, ventilation is an appropriate alternative to air conditioning for those buildings located in humid regions. Most importantly, it avoids the use of chemical disinfecting treatments.

AB This paper analyses the sustainability of inter-generational transfers in Samuelson's consumption-loan model when agents are imperfectly informed about past events. We find that with mild informational constraints, transfers cannot be supported by pure-strategy equilibria. Mixed strategies allow transfers to be sustained even if agents have little information, so that a version of the Folk theorem holds. However, these equilibria are not robust. If each agent's utility function is subjected to a small random perturbation as in Harsanyi (1973), these mixed strategy equilibria unravel, and only the zero-transfer allocation survives as the unique rationalizable outcome. This result is an example of mixed strategy equilibrium of an extensive form game which cannot be purified.

ID MODEL
AB Since 1993, the prospects of intraregional trade in West Africa have been the subject of much debate. On the one hand, Foroutan and Pritchett (1993) explain the low level of trade between sub-Saharan African countries by structural factors; on the other hand, Naudet (1993) shows that trade growth potential is important between West African countries. This debate is even more important because the seven countries that form the UEMOA have reasserted their willingness to strengthen their economic relationship in January 1994. This article tries through highlights of the different determinants of intraregional trade to show that effective regional cooperation is an important factor to promote trade between developing countries, and to determine why and how the UEMOA could be the cornerstone of sustainable development in West Africa.

AB Despite a crucial need of a sustainable natural resource management program in isolated rural areas of Saudi Arabia, current government approaches have not been successful to develop a level of local participation. This paper offers a detailed case study of Al-Alkhalaf; a village in the southwestern highlands of Asir, as an example of the difficulties planners face. Economic change and central-government policies of the last thirty years have transformed the traditional socio-economic structures of the village once, based on the reclamation of land for agriculture and the sustained development of local forests to meet subsistence needs, to the presently based on migration - in search for education and job opportunities and heavily dependent on government support. Today, Al-Alkhalaf is caught between the past and the present competing socio-economic hierarchies. To gain local cooperation in developing new patterns of sustainable resource use, innovative steps must be taken to facilitate local participation in development program design, implementation and evaluation and ways must be found to connect present mechanisms of central-government control of land to traditional local systems of land control.

AB The promotion of national integrity is an integral process in successfully implementing public sector reforms, especially those targeted at minimizing corruption. Efforts to promote sustainable and equitable development are undermined if levels of integrity are not enhanced and corruption reduced. While each country and region is unique in its history and culture, political system, and stage of economic and social development, similarities in national integrity systems exist and lessons learned are often transferable. Furthermore, the promotion of a national integrity system and the fight against corruption must be as politically inclusive and citizen-friendly as circumstances allow.

AB This paper introduces and applies a new testing strategy for assessing the sustainability of external debt for a sample of developping countries. Building on one country intertemporal budget constraint, we present alternative definitions of the sustainability property. Retaining a councept of effective net sustainability, we show how this property may be tested as a joint unit root restriction on the joint dynamics of external debt and the current account (or net exports). The gain of power allowed by this approach is illustrated through simulation, and the empirical applications on twelve developping countries result in optimistic conclusions, especially when gross exports are used as normalization variable.

TI Planning theory: Democracy or sustainable development? - Both (but don't
   bother about the bread, please)
SO SCANDINAVIAN HOUSING & PLANNING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article I raise the question of how various planning theories relate to the two normative conceptual systems of democracy and sustainable development. The issue under consideration is to what extent various normative planning theories on their own or in combination most satisfactorily can reconcile the requirements of a sustainable development with the implications of democracy. Such an assessment is based on the fact that democracy implies characteristic features such as participation, dialogue, communication, and consensus development. On the other hand, sustainable development demands protection of the interests of the world's poor, of future generations and of other species, as well as prompt and effective action.
   Through an analysis of synoptic planning, incremental planning, equity planning, and democratic planning, I shall argue that a combination of synoptic and equity planning is best suited to take democratic rules into account, as well as forming the basis for planning in a more sustainable direction.

SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

DT Article
AB In debates about green accounting it is sometimes argued that a positive value of aggregate investments indicates that an economy is developing sustainably. Asheim (1994) and Pezzey (1994) have shown that this is wrong, using a version of the well-known Dasgupta-Heal economy (with one capital and one non-renewable resource stock) as a counterexample. Asheim's proof referred to the unproved assumptions that in such an economy a higher rate of time preference induces higher initial consumption and vice versa, and that "optimal" consumption is initially rising and then falling. Here we show that these assumptions do hold true under certain circumstances, thereby also proving some of Dasgupta and Heal's other conjectures about sustainability.

ID TIMBER
AB In Sweden, the government regularly assesses the development of the state of the forest, for example the annual yield and the standing timber volume. One principle, maximum sustainable yield, is used for all owner categories, from government and the forest industry to the non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners. The purpose of this study was to present an alternative method of assessing the development of Swedish NIPF owners' timber inventory and growth during the next 20-30 yrs. The calculations were based on estimates of the NIPF owners' cutting intensities, defined as actual or planned cuttings relative to the sustainable yield. A distinction was made between farmers and non-farmers. The study relied on an extensive database comprising tens of thousands of stands on some 1400 private woodlots, and is unique in that it took its data from individual cases and considered different cutting intensities. The results showed that, everything else being equal, the harvesting level of the private forest owners was lower than the assessments made by the government would indicate. As a consequence, the timber inventory and growth developed differently.

AB Sustainability and robustness of genetic gain and diversity were analysed for breeding and production populations managed according to the Swedish breeding programme for Norway spruce. This strategy is based on double-pair mating and balanced, within-family selection with clonal testing within a number of reproductively isolated breeding populations. The importance of different characteristics was quantified by computer simulation, using a stochastic quantitative :infinitesimal genetic model.
   After ten generations, the linear increase in the additive genetic effect for the baseline scenario reached 11.0 sigma(A) and status effective number was reduced from 48 to 8.1 in a breeding population with 48 members. Six trees with status number 3.9 could be selected as seed orchard parents with a predicted inbreeding in the seed crop of less than 5% resulting in a total gain including inbreeding depression of 11.7 sigma(A). Meanwhile, available gain from a similar inbred clone mix of 6 genotypes was 13.1 sigma(A), mainly as a result of one more cycle of testing. Provided that populations had no fewer than 24 members, increases over ten generations in group coancestry, inbreeding and inbreeding depression were not substantial, and the drop in additive gain per generation was negligible. :Reduction of additive variance and increased inbreeding had no apparent effect on accumulation of gain per generation, even after ten breeding cycles. Thus, it is concluded that the current programme is sustainable.
   Clonal testing continued to be efficient throughout ten generations at population sizes down to 24, allowing a substructure of two sublines within a population of 48 members. Non-additive variance reduced the rate of increase of the additive mean. A continuous accumulation of additive effects was more important than exploitation of non-additive variation, even when cloned planting stock is deployed. Clonal testing was highly effective and robust, even at low numbers of ramets and weak heritability. Low stochastic variation among replicate runs indicated high precision, thus predictions of the breeding programme outcome are reliable within the limits of the model.

AB Some people argue that, by definition and common sense, cities can not be sustainable. Others say that the idea is utopian, but that we can learn from literary examples. Still others assert that cities will, must, and are becoming sustainable. This article explores each point of view, cites examples of steps toward sustainability currently being taken by various types of communities, notes common elements among them, and offers a resolution based on different definitions of sustainability.

LA English
DT Article
AB This essay concludes a special symposium on governance issues. All of the symposium articles raise serious questions about whether or not and how well governments in the United States are playing the several important roles they have in the governance process. This essay is about three changes that could lead to more effective, efficient, and equitable governance. Three interrelated ones are discussed: (1) Realizing a sustainable future, a new vision, and (2) initiating new decision making processes needed to deal with complex, inter-connected, conflict provoking issues, (3) requires new leadership.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY

DT Article
ID MYTILUS-CALIFORNIANUS; EXPLOITATION; UNCERTAINTY; DISTURBANCE; RESOURCE;
   HISTORY; GROWTH; CHILE; COAST
AB Both recreational and subsistence collectors utilise Pema pema in KwaZulu-Natal. The former collect 200-250 t of mussels annually from about 110 km of rocky shore and the latter 12-50 t from 3 km of rocky shore. Recreational collectors are subject to a daily bag limit of 50 mussels and so select larger mussels than subsistence collectors. In central KwaZulu-Natal, there were 700-800 mussels of the size range selected by recreational collectors per running metre of rocky shore and, at Kosi Bay, 1400-1500 mussels in the subsistence size range per running metre, This excludes stretches of rocky shore in both areas where mussels are virtually absent. Parametric bootstrapping was used to estimate variance in fishing mortality from variances in input, parameters (including catch). Fishing mortality at two recreational zones was 0.6 (95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.62) and 0.46 (0.45-0.47) and at two rocky points at Kosi Bay where subsistence collectors target mussels, 0.42 (0.41-0.44) and 0.27 (0.26-0.28), Decision tables are provided of target fishing mortalities for three levels of risk of exceeding fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield for each fishery vs three assumptions about the variability in catch estimates. One recreational zone requires a substantial reduction in effort to reduce fishing mortality to the target. No change in subsistence collecting at Kosi Bay is required, but the limited access policy should be maintained.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper focuses on the concept of a sustainable city and its theoretical implications for the Italian urban system. Urban sustainability is based on positive interactions among three different urban subsystems: social, economic and physical, where social wellbeing coexists with economic development and environmental quality. This utopian scenario does not appear in the existing cities. The aesthetic quality of natural and man-made environment is often associated with marginality and poverty, labor market variety and urban efficiency coexisting with pollution, criminality and high settlement costs. Moreover, since each city differs institutionally, historically, culturally and economically, few attempts have been implemented to build a comparative synthetic vision of the urban sustainability in different cities. The interactions among these selected systems are complex and unpredictable and present the opportunity for a new methodology of scientific investigation: the connectionistic approach. The dual aim of this study is to:
   investigate the underlying relationships among the three subsystems with a set of social, economic and physical attributes of the chief towns of a Province in Italy and
   verify if this underlying structure could reproduce the heterogeneity of urban realities, allowing one to distinguish groups of cities with different assets or drawbacks in their sustainability.
   The Data Base (DB), composed of 43 attributes for 95 cities, was processed by Self-Reflexive Neural Networks (SRNN) (Buscema, 1995). These Networks are a useful instrument of investigation and analogic questioning of the Data Base. Once the SRNN has learned the structure of the weights from the DB, by querying the network with the maximization or minimization of specific groups of attributes, it is possible to read the related properties and to rank the cities' urban profile.

AB Sustainable development in its full context requires minimizing the impact on the environment, conserving raw material resources, increasing recycling processes, avoiding waste and reducing emissions. Where economic growth is exclusively based on production and consumption of material goods, requirements for sustainability consequently lead to severe contradictions. For the consumer goods industry, in particular sustainable production and consumption is a big challenge. Examples will be presented which follow the various stages of a product's life cycle (i.e., design, manufacturing, storage, distribution, application and use, recycling and disposal) showing that the detergents industry is capable of making innovative contributions in line with the concept of sustainability.

AB US court decisions guaranteeing life-sustaining care to anencephalic infants have been viewed with disfavor, and sometimes disbelief, by some ethicists who do not believe in the necessity of life-sustaining support for those without cognitive abilities or an independently sustainable future. The distance between these two views - one legal and inclusive, the other medical and specific - seems unbridgeable. This paper reports on a program using multicriterion decision making to define and describe persons in a way which both acknowledges the differences perceived by many as well as those commonalities insisted on in U.S. court decisions. It does this through application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process to a hierarchy of "humanness" criteria, and secondarily through reference to that concept's subset, personhood.

AB Sustainable utilisation of environmental resources has become a necessity for survival of humankind. Tourism is an important way of using natural environments in order to generate income much needed for conservation efforts. Traditional tourism however has been notoriously insensitive towards the environment on which the industry depends for survival. Recent developments have shown ecotourism to be an effective alternative for traditional tourism based on three principles, i.e. (1) conservation of the resource base; (2) benefits to the local population; and (3) ensuring an enlightening experience for the tourist. A strategy for environmental management is proposed by which sustainability of the ecotourism product is ensured.

AB In the Netherlands, public transport planning plays an important role in strategic planning. The Dutch government is pursuing policy changes to ensure sustainable development. The objectives are to raise transit's share in the modal split and to improve operators' financial performance. Dordrecht Municipal Authority has taken an integrated approach to public transport planning to complement its urban development strategy. In June 1997 the three-bus system was introduced with the objectives to stimulate ridership and increase revenue: the express bus provides direct, speedy connections with high frequency to serve commuter journeys; the city bus uses liquefied petroleum gas vehicles with 3- to 10-min headways to connect the historical city center with the Central Station; and the service bus improves the connectivity of neighborhoods and enhances accessibility between the suburbs and the city center. The service net is also designed to serve the mobility needs of elderly and handicapped passengers in wheelchairs. The integrated network aims to provide quality service to meet passenger requirements. To finance the new system, an extra fare zone was introduced in January 1998. A research program in three phases has been implemented to monitor and evaluate the effects.

TI Planned road network developments in the Baltic Sea region
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB The political, social and economic upheavals in Eastern Europe and, to some extent, the recent accession of certain Scandinavian countries to full European Union (EU) membership have resulted in continuing dynamic changes in the features of trade and transport supply within the Baltic Sea region. In certain states in the region, transport infrastructure has proved inadequate for the emerging situation, having been developed under conditions of intensely centralized policy constraints. The most effective institutional catalyst for infrastructure development in the region is now the EU. A major priority within its policy for transport is the transfer of goods from road to more environmentally sustainable modes, especially short-sea shipping. Paradoxically, the EU's proposed development of a Trans-European motorway system simultaneously creates both opportunities and problems for the short-sea ship operator; while hinterland access to ports is improved, parallel coastal road connections are enhanced. Improvements to the motorway networks have been planned for a couple of decades, but have not been acted upon due to a lack of capital for investment. In many cases, even the adequate maintenance of existing infrastructure was beyond the means of certain states. With the opening up and increased market orientation of Central and East European economies, plans for major transport infrastructure developments have moved much closer to implementation. The emergence of novel and diverse sources of capital has also led to proposals for new projects. Although these projects, by their very nature, will take a number of years to be realized, the characteristics of road supply in the region will be very different a decade from now. As a preliminary element of a wider study into the competitive position of short-sea shipping in the Baltic Sea, the purpose of this paper is: firstly, to analyse the current level of major road supply in Poland, the Russian Federation and the Baltic States; secondly, to outline the major planned developments in the region and to evaluate the progress made towards their realization; and thirdly, to illustrate the diverse range of organizations, institutions and financial interest groups concerned with infrastructure developments in the area.

ID CHOICES
AB Electric cars may contribute significantly to a reduction in external costs of urban transport. This paper investigates, using a scenario analysis, the necessary conditions for their possible introduction in the city of Amsterdam. First, a background sketch of recent developments in Amsterdam is given, followed by an outline of the potential of, and the problems inherent in, the introduction of electric cars. Four scenarios are constructed by means of the so-called Spider-model. It is visualized in a picture that consists of quadrants and eight axes on which important future developments are sketched on a five point scale. The quadrants represent policy concerns about national and international flanking policies, local economic developments, local spatial policies and public transport policies, respectively. The scenarios used are: 'Prosperous Amsterdam', 'Sustainable Amsterdam', 'Pauperized Amsterdam' and 'Lonely Amsterdam', which largely differ in economic developments and in the spatial focus on sustainability issues. These scenarios act as frameworks for the policy development centered around the future adaption of electric cars in the city. Finally, the transport system and the potential role of the electric car in each scenario is investigated. It is concluded that flanking policies at all levels of spatial aggregation, as well as economic development are a sine qua non for a successful introduction of the electric car.

AB Tropical root crops are important staples for food security in the 21st century. The major production and consumption of the tropical root crops are concentrated in the regions of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Pacific. It is also in these regions where most of the growth in the world population will occur in the 21st century, placing great pressures on food security and environmental management. Tropical root crops have advantages over other staple foods such as grains, for ecologically sustainable production, They are less dependent on agricultural chemicals for production and post-harvest storage, require little irrigation, can be produced with minimum tillage practices, have high energy efficiency ratios, and generate large amounts of food for minimal effort. Tropical root crops provide important policy choices towards food security and poverty reduction through ecologically sustainable development.

AB The utilization of cassava in many regions of Tanzania is limited mainly to processing primary cassava products for flour and consumption of cooked fresh roots. During needs-assessment studies in the Lake Zone of Tanzania, women processors expressed their interest in increasing their range of cassava products, especially for income generation. A study was, therefore, implemented in three phases: a feasibility study, an acceptability study, and dissemination activities. Follow-up studies were undertaken to determine the level of uptake and refine the dissemination activities. The level of demand for the products warranted a dissemination phase during which training workshops were organized for over 30 women's groups from Mwanza and Mara regions. Various lessons were learnt during the study including, knowledge on the use of cassava hour was limited, information disseminated through groups was taken up on a sustainable basis, and certain products were preferred (cakes, doughnuts, and chinchin), so activities were focussed on these. Target groups for the dissemination of the technology were identified as cafe owners for doughnuts, market sellers for all products, and women's groups for products from which they could generate income. Future dissemination of the technology will focus on community development organizations to ensure cost effectiveness and sustainability.

AB An overview of current research on tare [Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott] and the prospects for tare improvement in Papua New Guinea are presented. Attempts are being made to address some of the major production constraints with a view to sustaining production. Major production constraints by biological agents include the Coleopteran insect pest Papuana spp. (taro beetle), and tare diseases, Phytophthora colocasiae and Alomae Bobone virus complex. The source of tare leaf blight and P. colocasiae resistance were identified from the national tare germplasm collection as well as from other countries and were assembled for targeted crosses. Selected genotypes with improved quality and resistance to diseases are being evaluated before distribution. A management strategy looking at the use of natural enemies, trap crops, barriers, seasonality, intercropping, and tolerant genotypes will be explored with a view to developing appropriate sustainable pest management practices. Research on the removal of other constraints to improved tare production such as soil nutrition, water management, and cropping systems (such as rotation, intercropping, plant spacing, and mixture of disease resistant and susceptible cultivars) is also reviewed.

AB The root crops consumed in Trinidad and Tobago that are of significant economic importance are cassava, sweetpotato, yams, and dasheen, The Ministry of Agriculture, Land and Marine Resources provides education and training courses for farmers and research programmes in agronomy, crop protection, and post-harvest handling. Two significant aspects of the Government's policy that have continued to provide a strong basis for the sustainable production of root crops are the ongoing maintenance of its plant genetic resource base and the training programmes both in-house and in the field. Root crops are generally manually harvested in quantities that are saleable within two days in the markets minimizing the need for storage. Processed products include frozen cassava, chips, and farine which are consumed locally. Export and processing operations have fluctuated because of inconsistent supplies. However, there is a marketing thrust to stimulate production via increased utilization locally through the school-feeding programme. Root crops, therefore, will continue to significantly contribute to sustainable food security in the next millennium.

TI Job linkages in inner-city Phoenix
SO URBAN GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
ID SPATIAL MISMATCH HYPOTHESIS; UNDERCLASS
AB Current urban policy stresses the creation of a sustainable economic base in the inner city. It is assumed that increasing the number and range of jobs in the inner city will result in employment opportunities for disadvantaged local residents. This paper explores the linkage between inner-city employment and inner-city residence in Phoenix, Arizona, using the 1995 Maricopa County Trip Reduction Survey. Results indicate that only 15% of the employees of large businesses in inner-city Phoenix were residents of nearby neighborhoods. Stronger workplace-residence linkages were found in personal services, agricultural activities, hotels, and restaurants. Extremely weak linkages occurred in transportation-related activities at the local airport, communications and public utilities, and financial institutions. Few inner-city residents were employed in inner-city governmental activities. Occupational profiles with the strongest ties to inner-city residents were those oriented toward manufacturing tasks and those employing women and young persons. Although there was, in fact. a mismatch between the professional nature of many inner-city jobs and the low educational and skill levels of inner-city residents,job linkages were weak even in areas that were dominated by low-and semi-skilled jobs. Ultimately, we question the assumption that job creation in the inner-city results in more jobs for local residents.

DT Article
AB Although there are a number of expert systems available which are designed to assist in resolving environmental problems, there is still a need for a system which would assist managers in determining waste management options for all types of wastes from one or more industrial plants, giving priority to sustainable use of resources, reuse and recycling. A prototype model was developed to determine the potentials for reuse and recycling of waste materials, to select the treatments needed to recycle waste materials or for treatment before disposal, and to determine potentials for co-treatment of wastes. A knowledge-based decision support system was then designed using this model. This paper describes the prototype model, the developed knowledge-based decision support system, the input and storage of data within the system and the inference engine developed for the system to determine the treatment options for the wastes. Options for sorting and selecting treatment trains are described, along with a discussion of the limitations of the approach and future developments needed for the system.

AB In separation toilets, human urine and faeces are separated at source in order to keep them away from the aquatic environment and to enable recycling. 24-hour urine samples of 19 individuals were analysed for several wastewater parameters. The daily loads and their mean variation are presented, and the contribution of human urine to the total daily load in municipal wastewater is calculated.
   The concentration of plant nutrients in human urine was compared with those of liquid cattle excretion as traditional organic fertilizer. Nearly all investigated chemical parameters showed great differences. Cations and anions could not be balanced. During storage, the urea in both human urine and cattle urine was quickly converted to ammonium. During 41 days, storage of human urine with passive gas transfer did not lead to significantly higher nitrogen losses than closed storage. Cattle urine reached highly significantly better results than human urine in a germination test with summer barley and in most of die cases highly significantly or significantly worse results in a germination test with cress. The results indicate that the effects of liquid cattle excretion on plant growth are not the same as those of human urine. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Current environmental policy guidelines are mainly based on cost-benefit analysis and concerned with the restriction of emissions. Sustainable development, on the other hand, is focusing on determining the optimal strategy for the overall performance of both the environment and the socio-economic system. This paper highlights some of the basic problems when developing strategies with the above aim in mind. The implications for decision making are investigated by means of a fictitious model of the economical and environmental interactions in a lake region. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

   hierarchy; waste management
AB Waste disposal practices were developed at a time before the implementation of waste regulation. When the first control came the industry found that it was its own waste regulator and so its own practices were not closely examined. Privatisation of the water industry overturned this situation and the disposal practices of the past came under the full spotlight of regulatory control. This was just at a time when waste disposal legislation itself was going through a process of revision to take account of European and Global environmental initiatives. North West Water's response to this was to instigate a thorough review of waste management practice across the Company. This has resulted in a totally new approach to waste management and the creation of a dedicated waste management organisation. The primary role of this organisation is to manage, to the best financial and environmental benefit of the Company, all its waste streams. This management must provide a high level of protection for the receiving environment, take account of cost, and strive to achieve the aims of sustainable development. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

AB This paper presents a perspective of wastewater management in the chemical industries as related to sustainable development. The scope of wastewater management must therefore further be expanded to include the concept of ecological integrity of receiving waters. Ecological integrity of receiving waters is compromised by contaminants which are not effectively removed by Best Conventional Technology (BCT). Biological treatment typically offers the most cost-effective conversion and/or stabilization of wastewaters; however, modifications must be employed in the design and operation to provide satisfactory effluent quality. Enhanced treatment techniques for wastewaters containing high organic concentrations, VOCs, elevated TDS levels, toxics and priority pollutants are discussed. The importance of design and operational procedures including pretreatment technologies, two stage vs. single stage activated sludge, selector design and maximum specific oxygen uptake rate determinations are also presented.

AB Sustainability, which attempts to balance environmental preservation and economic growth, includes puzzling problems such as better managing the world's water resources and enhancing the quality of life.
   Municipalities within the Nottawasaga Valley and Lake Simcoe Watersheds, north of Toronto, are now considered to have a high potential for significant growth. Both watersheds form part of the Georgian Bay ecosystem, within the Great Lakes Basin. Integrated watershed management planning by the Nottawasaga Valley and Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authorities is protecting water resources and ensuring the availability of water servicing for controlled development. This includes the maintenance of streamflows for the assimilation of treated sewage effluent from headwater basins and protection of unimpaired aquatic habitat at the same time.
   Monitoring the performance and success of the watershed plans is a vital component to sustain a healthy ecosystem pulse while accommodating growth. The comprehensive GIS based, multi-partnered monitoring program being used is unique. This low-cost, transferable approach for watershed monitoring includes a biological method known as BioMAP. The monitoring program has a proven track record for pre-design and post-construction stages of new development. Various case studies are presented. (C) 1998 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

   test; environmental compatibility; sample preparation; sludge ash bricks
AB Heavy metal release from bricks or blocks made of sewage sludge considerably decreases by sintering or cement consolidation. With such treatment, the enviromnental compatibility of recycled material can be ensured. In the framework of joint German-Japanese research, two types of leaching tests were introduced to develop a standardized test for construction material made of sewage sludge. One type is considered as a worst-case-test with low pH-values of 4-5 which describes the leaching availability under strong natural conditions (e.g. acid rain). The other type is a standardized test without pH-control. Both types of tests are investigated by using crushed samples of blocks.
   Generally, there are two different ways for a sustainable assessment of the enviromnental compatibility. One way is to use a test with a low pH-value like the worst-case-tests. The other way is to crush the sample in small particles to produce large surfaces when using a standardized test. The smaller the particle size is, the higher is the concentration of heavy metals in the eluate. From the Japanese point of view, blocks are usually utilized in original shape, small particles are not appropriate as samples. That is why medium-sized particles are used for the leaching tests. But using "bigger" particles, lower pH-values can be used. Therefore, a modified Swiss method is assumed to be suitable as a new standardized test for the effect of acid rain. This method is discussed from the point of view of sample diameter. From the German point of view, crushed samples with diameter <10 mm are used in combination with a standardized test. The heavy metal release from Japanese re-products is very low, and it has a close relationship with the release of the alkaline and alkaline earth metals. This effect can be shown on ash bricks from Germany also. Considering recommended limits in Germany, higher firing temperatures of >1100 degrees C should be used.

AB This paper discusses the concepts of sustainability and pollution prevention and their roles in environmental science and engineering education. It is argued that environmental engineering science and education must be re-oriented to focus primarily on pollution prevention technologies as a mechanism for attaining the goal of sustainability. While it is acknowledged that traditional pollution control will remain as an integral part of environmental science and engineering education, the paradigm shift (in favor of pollution prevention) must be completed in order for humanity to realize, albeit remotely, the goal of sustainability. The paper presents two case studies; at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (USA) and at the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Spain) where efforts are being made to re-orient environmental engineering education to promote the concept of sustainability as the primary goal of environmental management.

AB The rapid economic growth initiated by the Industrial Revolution has occurred within a paradigm of exploitation of nature for the benefit of humanity. However, a rising tide of ecological disasters has convinced society that human well-being is intimately linked with ecological well-being, and that society's long term future is dependent upon an ethic of sustainability. Sustainability requires more than end of pipe solutions, and environmental problems are invariably laden with social and ethical dimensions. The environmental engineer needs skills of integration, communication, and conceptualisation in addition to a traditional engineering background. Such a complex knowledge and skill mix is best promoted by a specially designed program An environmental engineering degree program must impart the required knowledge and skill base and promote the intellectual versatility to develop appropriate technical solutions to environmental problems within existing ethical, ecological and legal frameworks.

AB Environmental issues have to be discussed in the largest possible context. It is all too frequent that a miniature vision creates solutions with unanticipated detrimental effects in neighbouring fields of interest. It is noteworthy that the society has so few options, which may be identified by five verbs: no use, reuse, convert, contain and disperse. The future lies in analysis of the environmental issues in the context of total mass balance of important substances through society. Water is scarce only as long as it is lost by evaporation. The purpose of water usage is to pollute it, because the success of the past century has been to use water as a means of transport out of cities. It is a key issue that water usage can be diminished by demand control. There will still be polluted water to be purified. It is within the technological and economical range to purify water to a degree that would make it fit for urban reuse - to the point where the flow of water withdrawn from the environment can be diminished to a very small fraction of the present day withdrawal.

AB For us to have sufficient amounts of good quality fresh water available in the 21st century, it is necessary that we find a different way of dealing with water. Awareness of this fact represents a first step in the right direction. Interactive planning can substantially contribute to this awareness and therewith to the solution of both physical and cultural bottlenecks. Interactive plan processes are complex. The challenge lies in being actively involved in this complexity. The IPEA methodology has been developed to support adequate completion of interactive plan processes. This methodology has already been applied in a number of plan processes, 25 of which were recently evaluated. From this evaluation it appears that applying IPEA helps to increase the clarity and the suitability of both processes and plans. The methodology also makes a positive contribution to levels of communication and interaction between the people and organizations involved in a plan process. Furthermore, IPEA leads to an increased acceptance of the contents of plans. (C) 1998 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Various chemical and mechanical weed control treatments for kidney bean production were evaluated on irrigated, sandy loam sites from 1993 to 1995 near Staples, MN. Weed biomass can be controlled either mechanically or chemically, but a combination of the two gave the most effective and dependable weed control over years. Good weed control by either mechanical or chemical means reduced white mold infection of dry bean because of better aeration of dry bean plants and thus less favorable conditions for infection. Dry bean seed yields were inversely related to weed yields, and weed competition was similar from indigenous stands of either grass or broadleaf weeds. Row cultivation was more effective than rotary hoeing for controlling weeds, reducing white mold infection of dry bean, and increasing dry bean seed yields.

AB In studies of population dynamics and harvesting, differences in the demographic parameters of males and females are rarely dealt with explicitly. However, polygyny and sexual dimorphism, commonly observed in game animals, often result in sex differences in demographic parameters. A structurally simple deterministic two-sex model was used to study the equilibrium population size and adult sex-ratio under constant-quota harvesting. The model allowed varying harem and brood size, condition dependent sex allocation and sex differences in recruitment probability and adult survival. The results show that demographic sex differences may lead to a recommendation for female biased culling. Adult sex-ratio optimal for population growth is not evolutionarily stable. However, constant-quota harvesting can lead to the optimal adult sex-ratio for population growth in situations in which the mating system and female reproductive strategies would result in a radically different adult sex-ratio if the population were left unharvested.

ID TROPICAL AUSTRALIA; LIZARDS; SIZE; POPULATIONS; BIOLOGY
AB An important step towards evaluating ecological sustainability of resource use is to understand the characteristics of that resource. Indonesian populations of the Asian water monitor (Varanus salvator) have been heavily exploited over several decades for the reptile skin industry. We visited two cities in northern Sumatra (Rantauprapat and Cikampak) to gather information on the sizes, sexes, reproductive status and food habits of harvested specimens. Data on 399 lizards showed that monitors in northern Sumatra are similar in most respects to those studied previously in southern Sumatra (Palembang), despite the considerable distance between the two areas and the significant difference in climates. Male water monitors mature at a smaller size than females, but grow to larger body sizes. Harvesting is concentrated on adult males, and adult plus juvenile females. Reproduction occurs year-round, but at a lower intensity in drier months (March and June). Females produce multiple clutches of 6-17 eggs each year. These lizards eat a wide variety of prey, including commensal vertebrates (e.g. rats, chickens) as well as invertebrates (e.g. insects, crabs). The numbers of stomach parasites (spirurid nematodes, Tanqua tiara) were higher in juvenile lizards than in adults, and varied between our two sampling sites. Our results suggest that water monitors exhibit relatively little morphological or ecological divergence over broad areas within Sumatra, hence simplifying the task of developing appropriate management systems for the commercial harvest.

This move to a new, more holistic programme has necessitated a series of global studies which aim to provide an insight into the importance of livestock in differing agricultural systems across the world's major regions and agro-ecological zones (AEZs), in order to facilitate this reorientation and to guide decision-makers. The first such study, describing the major systems and containing relevant statistics, has been completed and published as an FAO Animal Production and Health Paper (Sere and Steinfeld in FAG, 1996a). A similar purpose was served by the article Livestock - a driving force for food security and sustainable development, which assessed the overall contribution of livestock to the agricultural economy (Sansoucy, 1995). Other studies are continuing on livestock geography using geographic information system (GIS) techniques to provide a georeferenced livestock distribution database. With specific reference to Asia, FAO invited a full account to be made of the region's livestock production systems, containing suggestions for development opportunities and highlighting those that could be best adopted by FAO (Devendra, 1996). Also, a number of location-specific case studies have been initiated to find indicators that are suitable for defining the productive state of a system, the pressures exerted on it and, finally, the existing opportunities for positive strategic technological or socio-economic interventions.

AB In the context of "sustainable development", we studied which attributes are important to people's quality of life (QoL) and which changes in QoL people would expect from future economic and environmental improvements or deteriorations. About 200 adult subjects evaluated the relative importance of 22 different QoL attributes. They subsequently indicated expected changes in those attributes, under three different scenarios in which economic and environmental conditions would either improve or deteriorate. On average, subjects judged the QoL attributes "health", "family", "environmental quality", "nature" and "safety" to be most important, while "recognition", "comfort", "status" and "spiritual life" were found least important. The most important QoL attributes as well as "security" were judged as more important by women than by men. Also observed were income and age effects on relative attribute importance. Our (Dutch) subjects expected significant and varied negative QoL changes from an environmental-deterioration scenario involving either an improved or a deteriorated economy. In contrast, they had mixed positive-negative QoL expectations about environmental improvement combined with economic deterioration. Subjects high in environmental concern assigned greater weight to "environmental" QoL attributes, and they expected environmental improvement versus deterioration to more strongly affect their QoL-attributes "environmental quality", "nature", "health" and "unity with nature", than did subjects low in environmental concern. We conclude that quality of life can be meaningfully conceived as a multi-attribute value concept, useful for assessing the expected effects of future economic and environmental conditions. Suggestions are given for methodological improvement and for further research.

AB Integration of endomycorrhizal fungus, Glomus deserticola with a bio-control agent Pasteuria penetrans, for the management of Meloidogyne incognita on tomato has significantly reduced the number of egg masses in root systems and increased the parasitization of females by bacterial bio-agent. Integration of these two eco-friendly components has significantly decreased the nematodes in roots. Bacterial bioagent has nor affected the root colonization by endomycorrhiza after transplanting. Results of this experiment revealed the possibility of successful use of these two components for the sustainable management of M. incognita on tomato.

AB The effect of integration of endomycorrhiza Glomus mosseae Nicolson and Gerdmann and oil cakes, viz., castor, karanj and margosa, was evaluated for the management of root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood infecting tomato Lycopersicon esculentum P. Mill, both in nursery and main field and compared with carbofuran. In nursery beds, integration of Glomus mosseae with margosa cake significantly reduced M. incognita population in soil, root galling, egg mass production, fecundity and produced vigorous tomato seedlings with increased root colonization by G. mosseae. These seedlings, when planted in the main field, also significantly reduced root galling and increased tomato fruit yield, root colonization with G, mosseae and chlamydospore population in soil. Increase in colonization with G. mosseae on roots of tomato indicated the desirable rhizospheric changes by soil amendment with margosa cake which brought about sustainable management of M. incognita on tomato.

AB Sustainability studies are increasingly needed to determine management systems that protect the environment and maintain production potentials. Whether these analyses are performed by field experiments or by computer modelling, defining the appropriate spatial and temporal scales is essential. For three management types within one soil series in The Netherlands, the land quality indicator "transpiration ratio", E-ratio (ratio between actual and potential transpiration), was determined using a simulation model of water flow in the unsaturated zone. Soils were characterised by eight profiles per management type in which measurements of the retention and hydraulic conductivity characteristics were made. Variation in weather data was described by 30 years of historical data. Soil hydraulic characteristics were used as individual data and as averaged data. Differences in E-ratio obtained by using individual soil data rather than averaged data were not significant, but E-ratio values for the three management types were significantly different (0.79, 0.81 and 0.83). The results of the 30 years were used to analyse the effect of the time over which an experiment is evaluated, on the E-ratio. The differential of variance indicated that the length of an experiment should be at least seven years in order to reduce the effect of the variable weather conditions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The agriculture of the Argentinean pampean region is undergoing a reconversion process as a result of a more intensive use of agrotechnologies. The ongoing changes are likely to overlap with the greenhouse warming-related climatic changes and atmospheric CO2 increase predicted for the next century. The goal of this study is to assess the potential impact of such changes on certain properties of soils of the Rolling Pampas, which support 10 to 15% of the national grain crop and oilseed production. Relation of wheat/soybean-maize crops in 45 agricultural soils was simulated using the EPIC model (Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator; US Dept of Agriculture), which was previously calibrated and validated for local conditions, for the 1996 to 2050 period under 2 scenarios: (1) no climate change, and (2) climate change conditions derived from regional climate parameters projected by the GISS general circulation model combined with a CO2 concentration of 550 ppm. The 1971 to 1995 period was simulated under neutral conditions with the purpose of defining soil conditions for 1996. It was found that in the event of a change in climate, physical properties would change to a lesser degree than chemical properties. The soil bulk density would decrease by 8% with respect to the baseline scenario in soils under risk of erosion. In contrast, since it was assumed that the erosive storm pattern would remain unchanged, there would be no variations in the erosion rate. A general decrease in potential soil fertility of 6 to 10% for total organic N and 7 to 20% for organic C would take place after a 55 yr period. The sustainability of certain soils of the Carcarana River basin, particularly the Villa Eloisa series, would be at a higher risk.

TI Lysophosphatidic acid induces threonine phosphorylation of Tiam1 in

AB The Rho family of GTPases plays an important role in the control of cell shape, adhesion, movement, and growth. Several guanine nucleotide exchange factors have been identified that activate Rho family GTPases by promoting the binding of GTP to these proteins. However, little is known concerning the regulation of these GDP/GTP exchange factors. In this study, we demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induces a rapid, sustainable phosphorylation of the Rac1-specific nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. LPA stimulated Tiam1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, and the protein was phosphorylated on threonine, but not tyrosine or serine, Tiam1 phosphorylation was also induced by platelet-derived growth factor, endothelin-1, bombesin, and bradykinin but not by epidermal growth factor. Significantly, pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with 1 mu M phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 h, or with the selective protein kinase C inhibitor Ro-31-8220, reduced LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of Tiam1 by approximately 75%. Moreover, acute stimulation with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was sufficient to induce Tiam1 phosphorylation in vivo, and protein kinase C could phosphorylate purified Tiam1 on threonine residues in vitro. These data indicate that agonist-induced phosphorylation of Tiam1 is a general mechanism and suggest that it is likely to be important in its regulation. Protein kinase C appears to play a key role in phosphorylation of Tiam1.

AB Erosion from cultivated lands continues to threaten the sustainability of commercial and subsistence agriculture around the world. Although most erosion is attributed to rainfall-induced runoff, other processes were observed which may account for a large portion of soil movement on sloping farm lands. Soil movement was measured on 15 parcels cultivated by subsistence farmers in the Venezuelan Andes as part of a broader study on adoption of soil conservation practices. Sediment traps were installed at the outlet of fields with slopes ranging from 33% to 78%. Based on the type of material found in the traps-clods, stones and some consolidated earth-soil movement was attributed to plowing, weeding, concentrated flows entering the field from above and, to a lesser extent, rainfall. Soil flux ranged from 1.5 to 58.7 kg m(-1) yr(-1) with an average of 31.1 kg m(-1) yr(-1). Three parcels underwent low flux, 1.5 to 5.7 kg m(-1) yr(-1) and 12 showed a higher flux, 16.7 to 58.7 kg m(-1) yr(-1). This study served to identify a number of soil erosion mechanisms not often considered when designing soil conservation programs targeted for areas with steep slopes. Tillage translocation and weeding within parcels contributed considerably more to soil and stone movement than did rainfall. The findings suggest that, when designing soil conservation programs for such areas, emphasis should be placed on methods devised to minimize soil disturbance. Among the practices that may be promoted are minimum or zero-tillage, the use of ground covers to control weeds and the installation of stone or grass barriers to retard the downward movement of soil.

AB The use of dissolved hydrogen as an early warning signal of digester failure and a control parameter to operate anaerobic digesters was investigated. A sensitive, on-line method was developed for measuring trace levels of dissolved hydrogen in a semi-permeable membrane, situated within the biomass of a 1 L laboratory anaerobic digester, using trace reduction gas analysis. At normal operating conditions, the dissolved hydrogen partial pressure (2 to 8 Pa) was found to be linearly correlated with the loading rate of the digester, and was a sensitive indicator of the effect of shockloads as well as gradual overloading. An increase in hydrogen partial pressure above a critical concentration of 6.5-7 Pa indicated the initial stage of digester overloading (i.e., volatile fatty acids accumulation). A H-2-based computer control system, using a critical hydrogen partial pressure of 6.5 Pa as the setpoint, was found to be effective for the safe operation of a laboratory digester close to its maximum sustainable loading rate. The existence of a relationship between hydrogen level and organic loading rate was also confirmed on a 600 m(3) industrial digester, with digester overloading occurring at hydrogen concentrations above 7 Pa. The results suggest that the dissolved hydrogen concentration is capable of being a sensitive on-line parameter for the automated management of anaerobic digesters near their maximum sustainable loading capacity.

AB Simulations were performed to quantify the effects of management options on nitrate leaching to the groundwater in grazed pastures. At the experimental farm for sustainable dairy farming 'De Marke', experimental data on soil water and nitrates were gathered for two fields during the years 1991-1995. These data were used for model validation. The simulations showed that a detailed type of precision agriculture, which can identify urine-affected areas in the field and then subsequently omit fertilizing such areas, resulted in considerable reductions of simulated nitrate concentrations in the soil water, especially on an intensively grazed and relatively dry site with groundwater levels between 0.5 and 2.5 m. On the wetter site, the maximum calculated reduction in nitrate concentrations was 11%, but for the relatively dry site the maximum calculated reduction was as high as 41%. The second simulated option involved the raising of groundwater levels, which usually also resulted in a decrease in simulated nitrate concentrations. Under wet conditions, the groundwater level increase may cause water excess and a deterioration in conditions for crop growth and thus, less N-uptake by the crop, which would ultimately lead to increased nitrate leaching. The combined effect of non-fertilization of urine patches and the raising of groundwater levels usually resulted in higher simulated reductions of nitrate concentrations than the single options. When the effect of within-field variability was also considered, the raising of groundwater levels was most effective in reducing nitrate concentrations on the wet site, while on the relatively dry and intensively used site, the non-fertilization of urine-affected areas had the dominant effect. The study shows how simulation modelling can assist in identifying promising management strategies. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Granulated excipients of lactose or dicalcium phosphate with ethylcellulose were examined for their ability to be used as matrix materials to produce a controlled release dosage form by direct compression for captopril. The physical characteristics of both granulated excipients and their resulting tablets were evaluated. It was found necessary to add hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) to improve the cohesion of granulated excipients. The hydrophobic nature of ethylcelullose possibly hindered the release of captopril from all these matrix formulations. However, controllability of the in vitro release of captopril in lactose formulations appeared to be much better than that in dicalcium phosphate formulations. Three lactose tablet formulations with distinguishable in vitro dissolution rates were selected and compared with Capoten(R) for their in vivo sustainability of captopril release. The results demonstrated that the bioavailability of each of these matrix formulations was less than that of the immediate release product of Capoten(R). The C-max was lower and T-max longer for the matrix formulations tested indicating the sustainability of captopril release from matrix tablets using granulated excipients as a directly-compressible matrix material.

AB Defining sustainable agricultural practices requires an understanding of both above- and below-ground consequences to management strategies. While alternatives to biocides are sought for the control of weeds, insects and pathogens, biocide use will continue with the goal of reducing quantities used in an integrated approach. The impact of three fungicides on plant growth, seed yield, seed nutrient composition, and on soil aggregation as mediated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi was studied in a silty-clay loam soil with a high extractable P concentration. Shoot dry mass, seed yield and seed nutrient (N, P, K) contents of pea (Pisum sativum L.) plants were enhanced by three AM fungi and a mixture of three fungi compared with nonAM plants. Each AM fungus produced a distinct pattern of shoot responses of plants, but the mixed inoculum treatment was as good or better than each single species for all of the above-ground measures of plant performance. Soil aggregation was improved by two of the three AM fungi as individual inocula, and was further increased in the mixed inoculum treatment. Two of the three fungicides reduced shoot dry mass and seed yield, but none of the fungicides affected soil aggregation. Fungicides inhibited mycorrhiza formation least in the mixed inoculum treatment which gave the best overall plant and soil responses. Since the three fungi together were more tolerant of fungicides than each fungus alone, it appeared that as a community, AM fungi modified and alleviated fungicide stress, resulting in high levels of plant performance and soil aggregation.

AB Development of an effective malaria vaccine poses a major scientific challenge both in the laboratory and in the field. Such a vaccine is necessary because of the massive disease burden of malaria in the developing world, the global spread of drug resistance, and the difficulty of sustainable control of the mosquito vector. Animal models have shown the immunological feasibility of vaccines targeted against different stages of parasite development, and studies in human volunteers have shown that a recombinant protein vaccine can protect against challenge with the homologous strain of parasite. However, both natural and vaccine-induced Immunity are hampered by the remarkable capacity of the parasites to vary critical antigenic structures; large field trials of a synthetic peptide vaccine gave equivocal results. In an attempt to overcome the dual difficulty of poor immunogenicity and parasite diversity, much experimental work is now focused on complex antigenic constructs, delivered as DNA vaccines or in live vectors such as vaccinia, with multiple targets at each stage of parasite development.

AB Agricultural soil on 12 farms converting to organic farming was sampled in 1989 and 1995 at the same sample points. Concentrations of plant-available (-AL) P, K, Ca and Mg, HNO3-soluble K, total-N, total-C and pH were measured in two layers. The average K-AL concentration and pH were reduced in both layers. The average P-AL concentration was reduced in the topsoil. K-AL and P-AL increased in samples with low concentrations and decreased in samples with high and very high concentrations in 1989. K-HNO3 increased in the topsoil and total-N increased in the subsoil. Total-N and total-C increased in top- and subsoil with a low organic matter content. The net import of P, calculated by farm-level nutrient balances, was negatively correlated to the change in kg P-AL ha(-1) in the topsoil. No such correlation was found for K.

AB Interactions were characterized for the first time between pea cultivars and the fungus Aphanomyces euteiches at Finnish trial sites on soils with and without common root rot caused by the fungus. Seed yield, protein content, growing time, duration of flowering and stalk length were all significantly influenced by the fungus. An average of 35% yield reduction was obtained in trial fields infected with Aphanomyces euteiches. On average, protein content was decreased by 1.4%, growing time was reduced by 9 days, duration of flowering was prolonged by 2 days and the stem length was reduced by 20%. Differences between cultivars were observed. The pea breeding line Jo 1085 showed the best tolerance.

AB Experiments on pollination were carried out in a border population of the terrestrial orchid Spiranthes spiralis (L.) Chevall. in the southern part of The Netherlands, one of the two remaining sites in the country. Experiments revealed that S. spiralis is a non-autogamous species. Visiting insects, mainly bumblebees, are needed for seed production, either by geitonogamy or cross-pollination. Insect-pollinated plants had 35% fruit set compared to 75% for flowers geitonogamously pollinated by hand. Removal of flowers of other species surrounding clumped flowering stalks of S. spiralis increased fruit set, indicating interspecific competition for pollinators. Fruit set was independent of the number of flowers per inflorescence. Since the number of seeds per fruit increased with the number of fruits per inflorescence, available resources do not limit the seed production. This is probably a result of the phenology of this species. Insect pollination does not appear to be a bottle-neck in the sustainability of this border population of the rare and endangered S. spiralis. Appropriate vegetation management of the site is probably essential if the population is to persist.

AB This study's objectives were to determine factors influencing smallholder farmers' adoption of a stall-feeding management system for improved dairy cattle in semiarid Tanzania and other related technology packages. Heckman's two-stage procedure was used to determine factors influencing participation in the project and the adoption of recommended management practices. Stall-feeding technology is particularly attractive to these households with fewer resources particularly those that are female headed. Wealthier farmers, as measured by area of land cultivated, are less likely to adopt the stall-feeding technology. Household labour is found to be important in determining the degree to which the technology and associated management practices were adopted. Age of the household head has a positive impact on the size of the intensive feed gardens. Different measures of extension-related contact are significant in influencing the potential for adopting stall-fed technology, the number of stair-fed cattle kept, the probability of growing water melons, and the size of intensive feed gardens. The implications are that research and extension messages with reference to the stall-feeding management system need to be targeted to specific types of households (e.g., female farmers, those with children to provide labor, and limited resource farms). This supports the notion that technology development and dissemination need to be sensitive not only to the characteristics of the biophysical environment but also to the socioeconomic environment, which is often neglected. The study also demonstrates that in the poorer parts of the world where land is very limited, a strategy for improving ecological sustainability can be linked closely to one for increasing agricultural productivity.

ID AGRO-ECOSYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS
AB A pragmatic framework for monitoring, modelling, analysing, and comparing the state and performance of integrated agroecosystems is proposed. Four smallholder rice farms (1.36-2.76 hectares) - including monoculture rice and diverse rice-based systems with livestock, aquaculture, tree, and vegetable components - are used to illustrate the approach. Data collection employs a range of techniques (bioresource flow diagramming, farm transects, direct observation, field measurements, farm records, and informal discussions). Weekly data gatherings are used to construct annual, mass-balance, nutrient (nitrogen) flow models of each farm system. The models form the basis for quantifying a series of agroecological system attributes (species richness, agricultural diversity, efficiency, harvest index, productivity, nutrient cycling, throughput, standing biomass, production/biomass, biomass/throughput, and agroecosystem nutrient balance) and economic properties (gross margin and returns to labour) for each farm. The comparative analysis suggests that what we perceive as ecologically sound farming, i.e. diverse and integrated natural resources management, can indeed be productive, profitable, and manageable, given access to labour and secure tenure. This type of analytical framework can help operationalise the sustainability concept. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Production risks are an important factor in agricultural land use decision making due to the relative uncertainty associated with climatic variability, enterprise performance, and market returns. Profitability and risks of wheat production on the Canterbury Plains are related to variability in climatic, production, and economic factors. A spreadsheet-based risk analysis program (@RISK) was used to integrate data sets within a risk framework for wheat production. This is shown to be an effective tool for evaluating alternative management practices in relation to profitability and risk. Autumn sowing and irrigation were found to improve predicted economic returns whilst reducing risk when compared to commonly practised spring sowing of wheat under dryland conditions. Spring sowing is reliant on irrigation to reduce risk. Predictions that autumn-sown wheat under dryland conditions will achieve similar yields to irrigated spring-sown wheat indicate that increasing the proportion of autumn-sown wheat would promote more efficient use of scarce water resources. A geographic information System was used to identify and represent visually the spatial distribution of variability in wheat yields and the risk to economic returns. The authors foresee future application of these techniques to sustainable resource management issues because the integration of climate, soils, water balance, and land use performance data sets within a quantitative framework that accounts for social, economic, and environmental effects through time and space is central to resource management decision making.

AB A conceptual framework for evaluating sustainable agroecosystems based on economic theory is presented. Agroecosystem sustainability embraces human socioeconomic and bioecological aspects. There are tradeoffs, complementarities, and interrelationships among alternative choices that have to be made in a world of resource scarcity in order to achieve a sustainable agroecosystem. Analyzing these choices in an integrated framework is a central component of modern economic analysis. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The increasing agricultural reuse of treated effluent serves goals such as promoting sustainable agriculture, preserving scarce water resources, and maintaining environmental quality. Also, irrigating with wastewater may reduce purification levels and fertilization costs, because soil and crops serve as bio-filters. and wastewater contain nutrients. Policy decisions regarding the level of purification and location of agriculture using wastewater, should consider multifarious aspects including costs, hazards and benefits of agricultural reuse of wastewater. The present paper demonstrates, in a simple way, how to tackle decision-making questions regarding the disposal of wastewater from an economic standpoint. It compares various wastewater reclamation and reuse options such as treatment levers and location of reuse, by computing the net national benefit as applied to a specific case study in central Israel. Several alternatives were compared including river disposal. local agricultural reuse of wastewater, and conveyance to the south. Estimated costs include those of treatment, storage and conveyance, while benefits comprise the value of agricultural output, the decrease in fertilization costs, and aquifer recharge. Hazard costs estimated in this analysis relate to seepage of nitrogen and health risks. According to this analysis, wastewater irrigation in the center of Israel saves US$0.50-0.60/m(3) compared with river disposal, and US$0.10-0.20/m(3) compared with conveyance to the south. Conveyance to the south of tertiary-treated effluent (as in the Dan Region Treatment Plant) instead of discard saves US$0.12/m(3), justifying a subsidy. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Understanding the spatial distribution pattern of soil properties is important to determine soil constraints to plant nutrition and appropriate management of soil resources in recently cultivated areas. This study addresses spatial variability of exchangeable potassium (K-e) and sum of bases (S-B) in Mato Grosso State, Brazil. Geostatistical methods described the spatial variability and predicted along four transects crossing different soil mapping units and land use types. Ordinary kriging appropriately estimates values in unsampled areas. It identifies places where more intensive sampling is required. This study shows that land use affected spatial variability of K-e and S-B in well-defined structural patterns. In particular, K-e exhibits a strong spatial dependence and anisotropy in two horizons. Traditional surveys of soil fertility, together with data from soil survey maps, can be used in combination with geostatistics by decision-makers to support management planning and to predict indicators related to soil quality as a measure of sustainability. As it turns out, K-e and S-B need to be sampled at different densities, and soil survey information can be used to advantage to reduce the sampling efforts of S-B by 96%.

AB Soils, freshwater sediments and marine sediments offer a new frontier of vast, poorly known ecosystems that are critical to life on earth, They are connected by similarities in biota, ecosystem processes, biogeochemistry, and, the types of processes carried out by the diversity of biota, We know a lot about the ecosystem processes in these domains through studies of: functional groups of organisms, but we know much less about keystone species, or biodiversity across habitats and thus we cannot, with certainty, answer questions such as, "will a change in diversity in an agricultural sail affect the flow of energy, water and chemicals across the interconnected domains?". Linkages of knowledge across the three domains would increase our understanding of how human-driven changes affect subsurface biodiversity and functioning, and, in turn, how these impacts influence aboveground ecosystem functioning. Approaches utilizing this knowledge will identify the long term strategies needed to attain sustainable soils, freshwaters and marine systems, Syntheses of available data far comparisons of biodiversity and processes across soils and sediments are priorities.

AB A broad review of mine land reclamation problems and challenges in arid lands is presented with special emphasis on work recently completed in India. The economics of mining in the Indian Desert is second only to agriculture in importance. Lands disturbed by mining, however, have only recently been the focus of reclamation attempts. Studies were made and results compiled of problems associated with germplasm selection, soil, plant and overburden characterization and manipulation, plant establishment methods utilized, soil amendment needs, use and conservation of available water and the evaluation of ecosystem sustainability. Emphasis is made of the need for multi-disciplinary approaches to mule land reclamation research and for the long-term monitoring of reclamation success.

DE pearl millet; clusterbean; intercropping
AB Intercropping helps to stabilize farmers' income under dryland conditions. Pearl millet and clusterbean intercropping proved advantageous because of difference ill their growth and feeding habits. However, the sustainability of the system depends on suitable variety of intercrop. In order to identify suitable variety of clusterbean for intercropping in pearl millet, a field experiment was conducted consecutively for eight years (1986 to 1994) with nine treatments involving five sole intercropping treatments at a row ratio of 2:2 in RBD having four replications on sandy loll soil (Typic Ustipsamments) of AICRP for Dryland Agriculture, Sardar Krushinagar. nle results revealed that intercropping of clusterbean variety Malosan (net profit, Rs. 2416 ha(-1)) or HG 75 (net profit, Rs. 2316 ha(-1)), with pearl millet was superior to rest of the treatments in respect of equivalent yield, net profit, CBR and LER.

AB The sustainability of budget deficits of the G-7 countries is examined in this paper. Following the approach taken by Hakkio and Rush it is found that in the case of Germany it appears for each dollar increase in expenditures, revenues increase by an equal amount. For France, Japan, and Italy (real per GDP measure) the budget deficits of these countries may not be sustainable due to the lack of cointegration. In the cases of Canada, Italy (real levels and real per capita measures), United Kingdom, and the United States (real levels and real per capita) cointegration is present between revenues and expenditures. However, the estimated coefficients on expenditures for these countries are significantly less than one which suggests that government spending is growing faster than government revenue.

ID REFUSE INCINERATION
AB MSW management can be defined as the discipline associated with the control of generation, storage, collection, transfer, processing and disposal of MSW, in a way which is governed by the best principles of Public health, economics, engineering, aesthetics and other environmental considerations. The disposal of MSW has been the focus of environmental policy for several industrialised countries since the mid-1970s, when attempts were made to identify and categorise, in a systematic way, the waste fractions involved. This categorisation provided the policy makers with the necessary information, to determine the most appropriate option for dealing with the waste in a more economic and environmentally-sustainable way. This paper reviews the main economic costs and the environmental impacts of the widely-accepted waste treatment and disposal methods. Examples of successful waste-management schemes are presented and prospective future trends are assessed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Freshwater management policies in New Zealand
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB 1. This paper examines the effectiveness of New Zealand's Resource Management Act in managing freshwater resources.
   2. A distinctive feature of the New Zealand situation is the extent to which Parliament has delegated the sustainable management of freshwater resources to catchment based regional councils. Regional councils exercise a pivotal role in water resource planning but without much guidance or technical assistance from central government.
   3. Contrary to New Zealand's 'clean green' image, water pollution is alarmingly high in relation to its small population size. The Act puts particular emphasis on improving water quality by empowering regional councils to address this concern in policy statements and plans.
   4. Water allocation policies in New Zealand are dominated by a supply-oriented biophysical perspective based on prescribing minimum flows and maximum extraction thresholds to safeguard the life-supporting capacity of ecosystems. Despite persistent attempts by central government to encourage regional councils to adopt competitive tendering and tradable permits for allocating water, most regional councils favour allocation procedures based on community consultation and political compromise.
   5. Water Conservation Orders are a special provision in the Act for protecting outstanding amenity or intrinsic values of waters in their natural state. However, no new applications have been made under the RMA since 1991.
   6. The RMA has brought about significant procedural improvements in water resource planning, by means of a cooperative, consultative approach. However, limited attention has been given to issues of water allocation to promote the sustainable use of increasingly scarce resources. The policies and rules in recently notified plans now regulate point source as well as non-point source discharges. Nevertheless, central government may need to reassess its role if it wishes to achieve a significant improvement in water quality and there needs to be greater coordination of water resource monitoring systems operated by regional councils to provide a national overview.

AB The big tasks of mankind are: Development, protection of the environment peace, and saving of resources on behalf of coming generations. Poverty exerts the greatest stress upon nature, development and protection of the environment are therefore not contradictory. Mankind has enough energy and mineral resources (sources), enough technology to limit detrimental effluents (taking care of sinks), and enough capital to bring about well-being for all mankind. Well-being decelerates population growth; in this way a stable coexistence of man and nature can be achieved. To this goal, nuclear energy can contribute significantly. Even at a considerably higher level of exploitation, it world last for several 100 000 years. Nuclear energy can supply every kind of energy required and, jointly with higher efficiency, it can do so at low cost; as to that, nuclear energy is superior to renewable energies in most cases. Also, nuclear energy can be deployed quickly enough. At the present safety level (including fuel cycle) the risks of deploying nuclear energy are smaller than the risks of non-deployment, by several orders of magnitude, both with respect to risk magnitude and probability. The material basis for a sustainable well-being of man and nature on this earth does exist. To-day's prime issue is to remove mental road blocks.

AB The soil crust community from a sub-tropical grassland in southwest Queensland was found to include 34 taxa with cyanobacteria, other algae, lichens, fungi, mosses and liverworts represented. Cyanobacteria and liverworts were the major components of the cryptogamic cover. This is a significant component of the biodiversity of the region. Changes in the structure of this community were significantly correlated with distance from a linear water supply (bore drain) and with dung density. IE was concluded that hoof impact by grazing stock had measurably affected the cryptogamic community even under a moderate stocking policy. This research suggests that management for sustainable use of low-nutrient rangelands should include consideration of soil crust condition.

AB Due to internal and external pressures, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is trying to renew itself by combining modem science with sustainability goals. At the same time, it faces rapid developments in biotechnology and in intellectual property rights (IPR) related issues. To retain its position in international agricultural research, it has to respond effectively to these changes. Therefore, the CGIAR commissioned an external review. During the CGIAR's 1997 International Centre's Week (ICW) in Washington, the External System Review Panel and its tasks were presented.

AB Both scholars and practitioners of environmental and land use planning in Western contexts have been slow to consider the links between planning and gender as they apply to land use reallocations in regions located beyond the city. The purpose of this paper is to spark discussion and inform future research efforts about the gendered implications of land use change. Drawing on research from environmental planning, gender/development planning, and rural resource communities, a conceptualization of feminist environmentalism is developed to interpret how environmental and land use planning represents women's lives and gives meaning to women's perspectives on economic transition in rural resource communities in Canada. Two planning documents are analyzed. First, a regional land use plan and transition strategy proposed by the Commission on Resources and Environment (CORE) for Vancouver Island in 1994 is examined it is revealed that this plan contained a narrow interpretation of social sustainability, which resulted in the omission and / or marginalization of important elements of women's fives. Second, a subsequent post-hoc assessment of the impact of the Vancouver island plan was reviewed. This report gave voice to women's material realities; however, a nuanced interpretation of the variation in the experiences of women remained elusive. Drawing on insights from both theory and practice, challenges for future research are presented.

ID DIFFERENTIATION
AB Several intensive wood production plantations and reafforestation programmes are being carried out in Europe using wild cherry (Prunus avium L.) as a valuable species. The study of the genetic structure of wild cherry managed and (or) unmanaged natural stands is important for resource management. Wild cherry stands are in fact frequently composed of single scattered trees or small dense groups, most of which are thought to have originated by suckering. Electrophoretic analysis of nine enzyme loci was carried out for five French managed stands and a unmanaged Italian stand. Phenological flowering phases were also assessed to confirm the presence of clonal sucker groups previously detected by electrophoresis within the Italian stand. Propagation by suckers was the most frequent propagation system; the number of genotypes detected within the examined populations varied from 6% to 49% of the total number of individuals. It particularly seems to occur within short distances and during the early successional stages. The following conclusions were thus drawn: the minimum distance between trees selected for improvement is 100 m; selective thinnings within wild cherry stands should take into account this minimum distance; mixtures of at least 5 to 10 clones, mostly from different origins, should be used in plantations, in order to improve heterogeneity and self-sustainability.

AB A carbon budget model of the Canadian forest sector (CBM-CFS2), was modified to investigate past and possible future impacts of management on C sequestration in forest biomass, soils, and harvested wood products, for a forest management unit in the western Canadian Boreal-Cordilleran ecoregions. The model showed that total suppression of natural disturbances, and their replacement by harvesting for maximum sustainable yield, could lead to significant increases in ecosystem C storage (mainly in soils and wood products) over a period of 100-200 years in this region. This is primarily because the historical interval between disturbance events (primarily wildfire) is short compared with the harvest interval. The net gains in C storage, and the period over which they are sustainable, are sensitive to several key variables, including planned harvesting levels and the intensity of natural disturbances. A warmer climate could reduce total C storage as a result of greater soil decomposition, but it should not reverse the benefits attributable to management if disturbances are controlled. Extended rotation lengths increase total C storage significantly and may justify additional investment in protection.

AB Changes in the environmental consciousness of wealthy western societies began to appear in the 1960s. These changes manifested themselves in three ways. First, in the mid-1960s the term "Technology Assessment" (TA) was coined in the USA. The TA discussion in Germany - as well as in other comparable countries - lead to growing TA activities and the opening of institutions connected with Technology Assessment. Secondly, in 1968, the Club of Rome was founded, which in 1972 brought out its first study "The Limits to Growth". Thirdly, the sustainability debate followed and intensified with the report in 1980 "Global 2000" and the Brundtland report in 1987 "Our Common Future", which formulated the concept of sustainable development. Debates intensified further in 1992 with the "Agenda 21", the closing document of the Rio Conference for Environment and Development. The following will show both that the diffuse idea of sustainability can be operationalised with the technology assessment concept; and - as has recently taken place at the TU Clausthal - that technology assessment should be established in research and teaching at the university level.

AB Data from agricultural experiments represent a valuable resource that can be used to construct decision support systems or to study such issues as sustainability, climate change or treatment by environment interactions. However, they are usable only if all the relevant details are recorded in a secure and readily accessible way, and this is best achieved using an information system. Details to be stored include the physical properties of the units, the underlying structure of the design, the treatments studied in the experiment and their relation to the underlying structure. This relationship can succinctly be described for many designs by storing the generator used to construct the design. Possibilities include design keys, design splits, alpha arrays and initial blocks of cyclic designs. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

AB The sustainability of the indigenous dugong (Dugong dugon) fishery in Torres Strait is evaluated on the basis of aerial survey estimates of the size of the regional dugong population in 1987 and 1991 and a survey of catches of dugongs taken by local communities between 1991 and 1993. The estimate of the dugong population in the Torres Strait region in November-December 1991 was 24,225 (+/- SE 3,276) compared with the corresponding estimate of 13,319 (+/- SE 2,136) for November 1987. The difference between the two estimates cannot be explained by natural increase of the population or variations in the sighting conditions encountered during the two aerial surveys. We believe this difference is due to a major redistribution of dugongs within the survey region or migration into Tot-res Strait, probably from Irian Jaya (Indonesia). Dugongs are a major component of the traditional fishery in Torres Strait. The biomass of dugongs landed between June 1991 and May 1993 was higher than the weight of any other component of the traditional catch. The estimated annual dugong catch of 1226 (+/- SE 204) was higher than previous catch estimates. It is impossible to verify the sustainability of this harvest without an understanding of the movements of the dugong population, better absolute estimates of dugong population size, dugong catch statistics for Papua New Guinea and adjacent regions in Australia, and current estimates of life history parameters for dugongs in Torres Strait, all of which will be difficult to obtain. The mean estimate of the annual dugong catch in Torres Strait for 1991-1993, however, is approximately 5% of the mean estimate of the dugong population size in 1991. This is too close to the estimated maximum rate of increase of the dugong population to be sustainable if the estimate of dugong numbers is close to an absolute estimate or if there is substantial emigration of dugongs from the area. Co-management arrangements must be developed between the government agencies responsible for the dugong fishery and the Torres Strait Islanders in order to develop management strategies that will provide for the Islander's traditional hunting expectations and maintain dugong numbers.

AB The gap between water supply and demand is widening in Jordan. Sound measures to overcome this gap are essential for sustainable water development. In this paper non-conventional energy technologies for water desalination are discussed. These include hydropower, solar, wind, and nuclear technologies. Using multi-criteria analysis, options were evaluated for best water uses considering water productivity and environmental sustainability criteria. It was concluded that hydropower and solar technologies are most effective for water desalination in Jordan. On the other hand, wind and nuclear technologies have low likelihood to be viable in the short term.

In the past decade, research has focused on developing multiple insect pest resistant cultivars as a cheap and sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides in the integrated management of the major pests by resource poor, small-scale farmers. Varying degrees of success have been achieved with respect to finding good levels of resistance to individual pests, but combining resistance to these pests in any one particular cultivar has met with little success as yet. One biophysical character which has shown great promise towards the development of multiple pest resistant cultivars is the trichome. The highly pubescent wild Vigna species have shown good levels of resistance to these pests. This has led to the suggestion that trichomes should be bred into cultivated cowpea using genes from wild relatives.

AB There is no agreement that diet matters for environmental sustainability in the agriculture sector. Much current agriculture is unsustainable and worsening; the environmental impact of agriculture degrades natural capital (e.g. loss of topsoil, waste and pollution of water, nutrient loss, extinction of species). Cattle raising is one of the most damaging components of agriculture. Livestock now eat about half of global grain production. There is limited scope for improving food supply and what scope there is will further damage the environment. All means to improve nutrition, especially for the poor, will be needed as population increases. One such means is to improve diets of the rich by eating lower down the food chain. While most people in the world thrive on mainly grain-based diets, carnivory is high in OECD and is increasing in LDCs. In order to reduce food wastage and to improve health and food availability, a food conversion efficiency tax is proposed. The least efficient converters (pork, beef) would be highly taxed; more efficient converters (poultry, eggs, dairy) would be moderately taxed. Most efficient converters (ocean fish) would be taxed lowest. Grain for human food would not be taxed, while coarse grains might be modestly subsidized. Non-food agriculture also would be taxed: highest on tobacco and on starches destined for alcoholic beverages produced from land suitable for food production. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Recreational users are one of the major causes of ecosystem damage in publicly owned parks. To ensure the sustainability of these ecosystems, the damage impact of recreational users must be managed. A constrained park management goal is proposed that allows recreational users to pursue welfare derived from park experiences, subject ro non-declining ecosystem health and equity of access. Four guiding principles (adaptable community control, quantity constraints, equity of access, and least cost policy mix) are used to provide a framework for recreational user management in three groups of park ecosystem. The funding of recreational user management is explored. Classifying park ecosystems into three groups, it was found that non-market mechanisms alone are suitable in Group 1 park ecosystems, with market mechanisms being of increasing importance in Group 2 and Group 3 park ecosystems.

AB Black bears on the 6000-ha Huntington Wildlife Forest, in the central Adirondack region of upper New York State, were modeled using the STELLA II Simulation software. The purposes were to (1) express black-bear biology as a population system inseparably derived from its ecosystem; (2) demonstrate how chaos, with origins in nonlinearity, and sustainability, related to linearity, can be incorporated into dynamical models, minimizing the use of mathematics that may not be well-chosen due to an inadequate rationale; and (3) demonstrate how qualitative biology, natural history, and ecology can be realistically built into a model despite many unknowns and initially limited data. A rationale is presented for synthesizing chaos and sustainability in ecological models. From this and the good behavioral properties observed in simulated baseline and sensitivity dynamics, it is concluded that a useful approach in ecological modelling may be to put nonlinear attributes into the parameter space and linear ones into the state space to conform the two opposed properties of well-behavedness and surprise. The role of linearity in modelling, and in formulating humanity's future ecological paradigm of existence, should not be overlooked. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Toronto's tentative approach to TDM
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Toronto, Canada has been able to achieve an enviable level of transit use as a result of historical success in maintaining an effective transit system and in integrating transit and transportation planning with land-use planning, However, although Travel Demand Management (TDM) has been adopted on paper as an integral element of the overall transportation strategy, planning and implementation of new TDM measures have been cautious,
   A large part of the reason for this tentative approach has to be the lack of a readily perceived problem, be it traffic congestion, poor air quality, or a shortage of fossil fuels, Combined with the knowledge that transit use is high already, the absence of an obvious problem dispels any urgency to implement TDM measures, Even in a period of fiscal belt-tightening, the possibility that TDM could help to make more efficient use of existing transportation infrastructure or, in fact, generate additional revenue to help keep that infrastructure in a state of good repair has been over-shadowed by political sensitivity to pushing changes in travel behaviour and lifestyle,
   For TDM to emerge as a meaningful strategy, senior levels of government need to take a more active leading role in support of their announced sustainability objectives, Enabling legislation needs to be provided so that local governments can develop meaningful TDM programs, The strident voices that have projected environmental disaster need to be supplanted with education programs that put the issues in the context of everyday living, TDM has to be recognized as an element of a broader strategy towards effective, sustainable transportation and not as a panacea for problems that are only hazily perceived and do not have imminent implications.

AB The author focuses on the problems inherent in environmentalist critiques of the Indian state, and the inability of their authors to provide a useful analytical approach for reforming state institutions engaged in environmental regulation and natural-resource management. After a review of the arguments made by leading spokespersons of Indian environmentalism, the author provides an alternative framework for understanding the different forms of state intervention in natural-resource management in colonial and postcolonial India. Three factors that have shaped dominant policy phases and strategies of state institutions engaged in resource management are highlighted: (1) major shifts in the political and economic processes that create pressures for state intervention; (2) competing demands on state institutions that shape the ways in which intervention occurs; and (3) conflicts, disputes, and negotiations that redefine the exercise of state control and the forms of resource management. In focusing on the interplay of these three factors, the author illustrates the continuities and major shifts in resource-management strategies adopted by state institutions in India. The inherent weaknesses (and reactionary populism) of Indian environmental debates are discussed, together with the inability of those involved to articulate strategies for moving towards sustainable urban and regional development within the recent policy phase of deregulation and market expansion in India.

   production in colonial and postcolonial Mozambique
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE

DT Article
ID AGRICULTURE; RESISTANCE
AB In this article, the very different cotton production schemes that the state introduced in colonial and post-colonial Mozambique are explored. Three distinct periods in the history of cotton production are examined. In the first, the focus is on the impact of cotton cultivation on the daily lives of peasants trapped in a highly coercive labor regime which Portugal imposed in 1938 and enforced for almost a quarter of a century. An outline of the abortive attempt of the newly independent FRELIMO government to revitalize cotton production from 1977 to 1985 as part of its broader socialist agenda to transform the countryside, is given next, and the study is concluded with a discussion of recent state efforts to promote joint cotton ventures under the guise of the IMF - World Bank structural adjustment program. An analysis of these changing cotton regimes offers a way of exploring a wide set of issues in the sustainability debate. The Mozambican cotton scheme demonstrates the extent to which state development planning often is not only about either social or ecological sustainability but also about control, power, and effectively silencing the rural poor by experts disconnected from the countryside. It is also stressed that the politics of memory is an important dimension of the sustainability debate and the broader ideological struggles which it reflects. Try as they might, neither the colonial state nor the postcolonial state could control how peasants constructed and interpreted the past. The official representations of cotton as a path to progress, whether on a capitalist or a social road, were simply dismissed by most growers who knew better.

AB Hydrogeologic data of 455 water wells comprising geologic logs, water qualities, and aquifer test results are analyzed to determine hydrogeological characteristics, water quality, and sustainable yield of the groundwater resources of Cheju volcanic island. The groundwater of the island occurs in unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits and clinkers interbedded in highly jointed basaltic and andesitic rocks as high-level, basal, and parabasal groundwater under unconfined conditions. The total storage of groundwater is estimated at about 44 billion m(3). The average transmissivity and specific yield of the aquifer are at about 0.34 m(2) s(-) (1)(29300 m(2) day(-1)) and 0.12, respectively. The average annual precipitation is about 3.39 billion m(3), of which 1.49 billion m(3) - equivalent to 44.0% of the total annual precipitation - is recharged into aquifers, with 0.638 billion m(3) year(-1) of runoff and 1.26 billion m(3) year(-1) of evapotranspiration. Based on a groundwater budget analysis, the sustainable yield is estimated at about 0.62 billion m(3) year(-1), equivalent to 41.6% of annual recharge. A low-permeability marine sedimentary formation (Sehwari formation), composed of loosely cemented sandy silt, was recently found to be situated at 120 +/- 68 m below mean sea level. If the said marine sediment is distributed as a basal formation of the freshwater zone of the island, most of its groundwater will be of parabasal type. So the marine sediment is one of the most important hydrogeological boundaries and groundwater occurrences in the area.

AB Environmental assessment and monitoring is not limited to measuring quantities of some substances that threaten our existence. At present the greatest challenge is not to gain another decimal point in assaying a certain noxious chemical. As far as technical aspects of monitoring are concerned, we witness a steady progress. Our conceptual development is less tangible. At the same time it is more urgent. We are directed to assess and monitor novel characteristics such as biodiversity and ecosystem health. They are considered to be the basis of modern, ecosystem management. Specialists in wildlife, fisheries, soil scientists, agronomists, and foresters are revising the established tenets of their disciplines to pursue maximum biodiversity. This could be done only if we know what biodiversity and ecosystem health are. This paper assesses the state of our knowledge of these concepts.

TI Application of design for environment concepts to the semiconductor

SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB Motorola has traditionally focused on cost, yield performance, and logistics as primary drivers for decision-making. In the semiconductor industry, environmental issues have resulted in major modifications of tools and process steps because they are not routinely considered when making process design and manufacturing choices, nor is their impact on cost, yield, and cycle time. Certain business driving forces, such as cost, sustainability of processes/tools, time to market, market access and market share, are lending Motorola to a cultural change in which environmental impacts must be considered during product and process design, how ever, design and process engineers have not been able to adequately address these impacts. Motorola's Advanced Process Research and Development Laboratory (APRDL) in the Semiconductor Product Sector (SPS) has recognized this and hers established its own environmental group (separate from the site environmental compliance group) to implement a Design for Environmental (DFE) strategy. This group works with several project teams to address environmental issues in process development. To empower engineers to consider the environmental impacts of their materials and processes at the earliest Possible stage the APRDL environmental group has also developed a DFE training course. This web-based course targets semiconductor design and process engineers and is available through Motorola University, the corporate training institution. In the broadest terms DFE is a systematic management approach for evaluating and mitigating environmental concerns at the earliest possible stages of process design or product life cycle. It includes ongoing evaluation during the product life cycle, while optimizing the balance between environmental priorities and factors such as cost, yield, cycle rime, performance etc. This optimization requires that Motorola make value judgments based on the best information available. The course is designed to provide semiconductor engineers with the neccesary back ground to understand the concepts of DFE and the tools to incorporate consideration for environmental impacts into their daily routine without adding a significant burden to their workload.

AB Limited data are available on which to base management decisions for Pristipomoides filamentosus around the periphery of the Mahe Plateau, Seychelles. Analyses of length frequency data, which generate results of uncertain accuracy, particularly for long lived slow growing species, were employed to derive biological parameters for management simulations based on yield per recruit analyses. These parameters were used to derive management targets for the fishery, and to assess its current state. The sensitivity of these outputs to uncertainty in the estimated parameters and unknowns such as the stock recruitment relationship was determined. The practicality and effect of effort and length controls were investigated. Effort targets that are slightly more conservative than (maximum sustainable yield) MSY can provide security against uncertainty at a relatively low cost. However, assessment of the current fishing mortality is far more sensitive to inaccuracies in parameter estimation, and should be supported by other methods where possible. It is concluded that current length at capture is appropriate but should not be allowed to decrease greatly. There appears to be excess capacity in the fishery, but it is recommended that any effort increases be implemented slowly and with due caution. If substantial increases are desirable, additional research should focus on alternative methods for estimating fishing mortality. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB We consider the optimal harvesting policy, that is maximizing the yield, under sustainable fisheries including the age of first capture and seasonal harvesting. To obtain this policy, we analyze mathematical and numerical methods using spawning per recruit (SPR) and yield per recruit (YPR) simultaneously. We use data on a chub mackerel population in the Pacific Ocean off eastern Japan. We consider three cases of seasonal fishing, fishing throughout the year, half year after the spawning season and variable fishing season, defined as the policy that varies the beginning and the end of fishing season. Under a variable fishing season, the optimal fishing season includes the fishing season of the two major types of chub mackerel Scomber japonicus fisheries, the dip-net and the purse-seine fisheries. We conclude that (1) the maximum sustainable yield is unlikely to be in pulse fishing, (2) The optimal yield under a fixed fishing season policy is close to that under a variable fishing season, (3) In any case, the fish should be preserved until the end of the first spawning season.
