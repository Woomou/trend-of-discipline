AB Field tests demonstrated that selected sustainable agricultural practices influence intensity of fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), infestations of late planted maize, Zea mays, in double cropping systems. Reduced FAW infestations of seedling maize were associated with no-tillage as compared with plow-tillage practice. Maize in no-tillage plots required one less chlorpyrifos [0.56 kg (AI/ha] spray than in plow-tillage based on a 50% action threshold. Surface debris of winter cover crops influenced lags of FAW infestation on no-tillage maize. Surface residues from previous cover crops may account for the reduced infestations in no-tillage areas. Infestations among plots became similar as plants grew from within the mulch cover. Use of poultry manure as a soil amendment had no effect on FAW damage, but a tendency for increased yields was observed in poultry manure plots. Chlorpyrifos significantly reduced FAW feeding resulting in increased whole plant dry weight yield in treated plots.

TI ECOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTALISM AND GREEN RELIGION
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB Forests offer diverse values to society, including timber, aesthetics, wildlife and biodiversity values, employment and wealth. Forests must be managed to provide the balance of values at the landscape level that the prevailing society deems to be consistent with the basic concept of sustainable development: to satisfy the needs and aspirations of present generations of humans without compromising the ability of future generations to satisfy their needs and aspirations.
   Management of forests to satisfy the requirements of sustainability will not be successful if based solely on the science of ecology, because this science cannot tell foresters what their goals should be. It will also fail if it is based solely on green religion, because this frequently ignores the ecological requirements of many of the living organisms in forest ecosystems, and the needs of the world's present human population, let alone the increase in human numbers that is expected within the next century.
   Broadly-defined environmentalism should be the basis for managing and conserving the world's forests. This management should be based on the ecology of these forests, should address the multiple values they provide, and should respect current ethical standards concerning the environment. The foresters performing this management should be dedicated environmentalists (in the broad sense). Unless the forestry profession becomes the leader in forest environmentalism, there is a significant risk that forestry in the future will be based largely on green religion.

TI THE THEORY OF ENERGY RETURN ON INVESTMENT - A CASE-STUDY OF WHOLE TREE
   CHIPPING FOR BIOMASS IN PRINCE-EDWARD-ISLAND
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB Industrial societies consume vast quantities of fossil fuel resources, the carbon dioxide released when these fuels are combusted is a major concern because of global warming. ''Energy Return On Investment'' (EROI) is the ratio of energy gain from a resource relative to the energy invested to achieve that gain. EROI analysis shows that the net energy available from fossil fuels decreases as resources are depleted, encouraging a transition to renewable resources which will not be depleted under sustainable management. Renewable resources can reduce net contributions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere; however, many sources of renewable energy require fossil fuel inputs into their production process. EROI analysis can also be used to determine renewable energy sources with the greatest energy gain, relative to the fossil fuel investment required to achieve that gain.
   One renewable source of energy with considerable potential for expansion in Canada is wood biomass. A case study of whole tree chipping (WTC) in Prince Edward Island revealed an EROI ratio of wood chip energy gained relative to fuel energy invested of 26.7:1. The major factor affecting the EROI for WTC was transport of the chips to the burning facilities: distance and load size were important components that should be considered when designing new burning facilities. There are some benefits and disadvantages of WTC not captured by EROI analysis that also need to be considered.

SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental degradation has accelerated in recent years because economic development activities have been inconsistent with a sustainable environment. In human ecology, the concept of 'carrying capacity' implies an optimum level of development and population size based on a complex of interacting factors - physical, institutional, social, and psychological. Development studies which have explicitly recognized carrying capacity have shown that this approach can be used to promote economic activities which are consistent with a sustainable social and physical environment. The concept of carrying capacity provides a framework for integrating physical, socioeconomic, and environmental systems into planning for a sustainable environment.

TI WHICH WAY TO SUSTAINABILITY - EXTERNAL SUPPORT TO HEALTH PROJECTS IN
   DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this paper is to analyse the process by which donors decide whether or not to support specific primary health care projects. First of all, there has to be an 'eligible situation': an inability to start without external support, coupled with an ability to sustain the project (without such support) once it has started. Secondly there must be an 'eligible project', that is, a project that requires support of a 'one-time-only' nature (for example, capital outlay); or recurrent support to temporary activities (such as salaries for a temporary campaign), or temporary support to recurrent activities (for the initial stages of innovative programmes). Proposals for really innovative programmes are seldom readily available, and the most appropriate form of support may then be to support an institution charged with the development of such innovative programmes.

TI FISHERIES AND THE EVOLUTION OF RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT ON THE LOWER AMAZON

LA English

DE RIBEIRINHO ECONOMY; COMMERCIAL FISHERIES; AMAZON FLOODPLAIN
AB Traditionally, the ribeirinho economy has been based on strategies of multiple resource use including agriculture, fishing, and small-scale stock raising. In the last two decades though, ribeirinho strategies of resource management have undergone major changes due to the decline of jute production (the principal cash crop), and the intensification of the commercial fisheries. As a result of these trends, there has been a shift of ribeirinho labor from agriculture to commercial fishing.  Today, the diversity which once characterized ribeirinho subsistence strategies is disappearing, and fishing has become the primary economic activity for the great majority of varzea families. As pressure on varzea fisheries has increased, ribeirinho communities have attempted to assert control over local varzea lakes and exclude fishermen from outside the community. In a number of cases, ribeirinho communities have closed lakes to outsiders and established informal lake reserves under local community management. These lake reserves are a promising strategy for managing lake fisheries on a sustainable basis.

DE PANAMA; THE STATE; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
ID CATTLE
AB This article examines changing political and social relationships at local, national, and international levels, over an 18-year period during and after the construction of a hydroelectric dam project in eastern Panama. A central point is that the state should not be viewed as a monolithic entity as it formulates and implements policy. Rather, conflicts of interest exist among different officials and agencies within the government, leading to vacillation in policy and outcome. In Panama, that conflict was influenced by international events and ties between the country and multilateral institutions. After the dam was built, Panama's Bayano region went from a frontier to a zone closely linked to the metropolis by economic and political ties, with disastrous consequences for the ecology and for the poor. This decline resulted despite efforts on the part of some state officials to protect its ecology through implementation of a sustainable development plan. The reasons why the sustainable development alternative failed and the consequences of this failure for indigenous people and poor small-holder colonists are also documented.

AB This paper attempts to identify optimal and sustainable exchange rate regimes in a world economy comprising two countries. By developing a Barro-Gordon two-country macroeconomic model, noncooperative equilibria are obtained under different assumptions of monetary policy commitments and different exchange rate regimes. Then, using a three-stage game approach to the strategic choice of monetary policy instruments, optimal and sustainable exchange rate regimes are identified. Determining such regimes depends fundamentally on the authorities' ability to make monetary policy commitments. The results indicate that international coordination of regime choice may be necessary to ensure optimal outcomes. [JEL F33, F41, F42]

TI FISCAL ADJUSTMENT IN PAKISTAN - SOME SIMULATION RESULTS
SO INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND STAFF PAPERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Pakistan has experienced high fiscal deficits for over two decades. The accumulation of debt over this period implies that a substantial adjustment will be required to attain a sustainable fiscal position over the medium term. By simulating an estimated macroeconomic model for Pakistan, this paper compares the likely macroeconomic consequences of achieving fiscal adjustment alternatively through reductions in public consumption or public investment or through increasing tax receipts. The most favorable medium-term growth and inflation outcomes are associated with reduced public consumption; the least favorable correspond to reduced public investment. Revenue increases occupy an intermediate position. [JEL E6, H3, 011, 053]

AB Low-input, sustainable agriculture (LISA) systems can include soil incorporation of residues of weeds and legume cover crop species. However, both seed germination and seedling growth of crops, including cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), are inhibited by volatile organic compounds emitted by these residues during decomposition. A cotton seedling-growth assay was used to demonstrate that C4 through C-9 ketones released by decomposing legume residues significantly inhibited root and shoot elongation, root and shoot fresh and dry weight gain, and cotyledon expansion. Seedling root and shoot water relationships were relatively insensitive to those components of plant residue volatile emissions. Concentration (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 muM/cm3 sterile greenhouse soil mix) and root-zone temperature (20 or 30-degrees-C) altered the activity of the more inhibitory ketones. Molecular weight (carbon chain length), carbon chain branching, and position of the carbonyl group also influenced ketone inhibitory activity.

TI HEADING FOR A POSTMODERN LANDSCAPE - PORTUGUESE TRENDS IN THE
   RECONCILIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY AND LANDSCAPE PLANNING WITH
   ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB The absence of ecological principles in traditional planning has theoretically been overcome by the adoption of the concept of sustainable development. However, this concept has been bypassed by the political mainstream. Policies designed to improve environmental quality appear to be largely ineffectual. Therefore, landscape planning integrating ecological and economic principles needs to be widely emphasized and practiced. The new landscape would then be the expression of a post-modern relationship of human beings with nature.
   In light of these ideas, an overview of Portuguese trends is presented, examining the reconciliation of environmental quality and landscape planning with economic development and exploring existing opportunities for the creation of post-modern landscapes. Through a case study in northern Portugal, one of the existing legal instruments for landscape planning is discussed.

TI ACHIEVING REAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS USING VALUE - IMPACT

SO LONG RANGE PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB How can industry play its part in contributing towards Sustainable Development? The framework of a systematic approach for achieving 'more from less' is discussed, i.e. more value and performance in products which use less resources and produce less waste. This framework-a value:impact assessment-requires the use of testing and consumer research to determine the value of a product. The impact is determined using lifecycle assessment, safety, as determined by risk assessment, is a pre-requisite. It is also suggested that a full range of marketing techniques needs to be used to ensure that the environmentally improved product sells in replacement of its poorer competitors. Without market place success, the environmental improvement achieves little. It is also demonstrated that, in general, the most important environmental benefits will come from the use phase of the product, further emphasizing the important role to be played by marketing.

TI ALLOWABLE SALE QUANTITY (ASQ) OF TIMBER AS A FOCAL POINT IN NATIONAL
   FOREST MANAGEMENT
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SERVICE
AB Various national forest stakeholders disagree as to the definition and interpretation of the term Allowable Sale Quantity (ASQ) in national forest planning and management. The ASQ has been widely interpreted as a 'target', 'goal', 'quota', or 'ceiling' by various groups and individuals, both inside and outside the United States Forest Service. This paper presents two differing perspectives on ASQ, as a 'ceiling' and as a 'duty'. In the absence of clear, decisive judicial interpretation, the task of reconciling the two viewpoints has fallen on the Forest Service, as the implementing agency, and on Congress through its Forest Service oversight and appropriation responsibilities. Congressional timber targets and forest plan ASQs are shown to be distinctly different concepts, but in practice the distinction is often unclear, even among Forest Service field employees. While the ASQ was intended to represent a harvest level based on the physical, biological, and environmental capacity of suitable timberland, forest planners' data and models are capable of providing only an imprecise estimate of ASQ. We suggest that the forest planning process should be flexible enough to expedite amendment of forest plans to adjust ASQ levels, with appropriate public input, to realistic and sustainable levels for land and resource management.

TI THE GENETIC MAPS OF WHEAT AND THEIR POTENTIAL IN PLANT-BREEDING
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID GROUP-7 CHROMOSOMES; RFLP
AB The further improvement of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties represents a particularly difficult challenge for UK breeders. As one of the world's primary food sources, a great deal of effort over the past 30 years by breeders has resulted in remarkable improvements in-yield. The doubling of UK wheat yields since 1970 has been due to the release of varieties with much improved yield potential which are also compatible with the increasingly intensive farming methods that we have witnessed over the same period. Of course in recent years the goal posts have moved once again. The EC grain mountains and the erosion of price support for the European wheat growers - likely to be further exacerbated by the result of the current GATT talks - indicate a move towards sustainability and lower labour, energy and chemical inputs in the future. The farmer of the 1990s and beyond will expect high yielding crops with lower variable costs and added value from stable industrial quality, targeted probably at higher cost speciality products. With some estimates of the cost of producing and releasing a new wheat variety as high as 14 million Pounds it is not surprising that breeders are now turning to molecular genetic studies to help them assemble optimum combinations of genes that will allow them to produce the ideal varietal phenotype for the farmer of the 21st century.

   HUNTING IMPACT; SUSTAINED YIELD
ID GRASSLAND
AB Despite the popularity of the greywing francolin Francolinus africanus as a gamebird, the effects of hunting on standing densities and long-term yields are not well documented. We recorded hunting effort, hunting efficiency and the impact of hunting on greywing francolin populations during 123 hunts conducted on various farms situated on the Stormberg Plateau from 1988-1991. Between-year variation in hunting effort and hunter skill was not significant. Hunter satisfaction was significantly positively correlated with the number of greywing seen, and significantly negatively correlated with hunter group size. Hunter skill was also significantly negatively correlated with hunter group size. There was no significant difference between removal levels with various hunting limits. However, populations from which more than 50% of the standing density was removed were significantly reduced in the year following the hunt. We conclude that, for sustainable, economically viable hunting, groups of between four and seven hunters should be offered between 50 and 65 greywing francolin flushed per hunt, and these populations should be hunted only once per season, with hunters removing no more than 50% of a covey.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Seed dispersal and forest regeneration were studied on a 30 x 150 m strip cleared by 'strip-cutting,' a system of forest management designed for sustained yield (Hartshorn 1989), in high terrace rain forest in the Department of Loreto, Peru. After one year the strip was dominated by seedlings of a few bat- and bird- dispersed pioneer tree species (Cecropia spp., Melastomataceae, and Alchornea triplinervia); stump sprouts from cut trees and saplings that survived the clearing were less numerous. The density of saplings (>2 m in height) surviving the clearing was 903 per hectare; 94% of these survived the subsequent 18 months. About 30% of 417 stumps (> 7.5 cm diameter at breast height) resprouted within 3 months, with an additional 10% sprouting in the subsequent 10 months. Sprouting frequency was greater for small stumps than large and varied greatly among plant families. Seed deposition over this year was much lower in the interior of the strip, both in species richness and numbers of seeds, than within the forest; strip edges were intermediate in richness and number. The decline in seed input from forest to edge to strip, both in species and in numbers of seeds, was most pronounced for bird-dispersed taxa (primarily Melastomataceae); bat- and wind- dispersed taxa were more evenly distributed. The similarity in bat species composition between the strip and nearby primary forest was higher than the similarity in bird species composition between these habitats, reflecting a failure of many forest bird species to venture into the strip. The predominance of Cecropia spp. and other pioneers of minimal commercial value in the regeneration question the sustainability of strip-cutting. Subsequent succession and future tree species composition on the cleared strip will depend not only on the survivorship and growth of sprouts, survivors, and seedlings, but also on responses of different seed-dispersing animal taxa to changes in the species composition and structure of the vegetation in the strip.

AB Farmers worldwide have come to expect, and rely almost exclusively on, broad-spectrum anthelmintics to effectively control nematode parasites amongst their livestock. However, the threats of resistance, residues and ecotoxicity are of increasing concern to the future of chemotherapy. It is imperative that sustainable parasite control schemes be developed and implemented which will integrate a range of techniques to minimise anthelmintic use and still maintain high levels of profitability of the farming enterprise. At present, these need to focus on the better use of existing drugs to maximise their effectiveness and minimise the selection for resistance and impact on the environment. New drugs should also be used according to these principles. In the future it is expected that other non-chemotherapeutic options will become available, e.g. helminth vaccines, resistant hosts, biological control, nematode growth regulators, which will revolutionise the current thinking on nematode parasite control of livestock.

DT Article
AB The Mekong River basin covers six Asian countries, with 50 million inhabitants. Its development would greatly improve their living standards, now at near-subsistence levels.
   Beginning in the 1950s, the United Nations proposed a collaborative study for comprehensive international development in its lower basin. Leading industrialized nations supported this proposal and launched various studies on hydropower, irrigation, navigation, fisheries, and flood control. These studies led to the completion of several domestic dam projects.
   The onset of the Viet Nam War suspended further surveys. The end of hostilities enabled development studies to resume. Meanwhile, China, located in the upper basin, started the development of dams on the mainstream and tributaries.
   This paper describes the necessity, history, and problems of the development and the status of the entire river basin. It also describes several prerequisites for its sustainable development, and the vision needed by the nations cooperating in the Mekong's development.

AB Soil erosion due to deforestation and heavy rains presents an extremely serious problem in many parts of Southeast Asia. particularly in the upland Philippines. The Mindanao Baptist Rural Life Center (MBRLC), a non-government organization based in the southern part, has developed and spread an agroforestry scheme called Sloping Agricultural Land Technology (SALT) to help control soil erosion and increase crop yields. Basically, SALT utilizes nitrogen-fixing trees as soil binder, fertilizer generator, and livestock feed source. The system also includes annual and perennial diversified food crops grown in the spaces between the hedgerows. The SALT model has been tested both in demonstration plots and farmers' fields, and has proven to be appropriate for use by typical hilly-land farmers. The system can reduce soil erosion and restore moderately degraded hilly lands to a profitable farming system.

AB An economy can be both efficient and sustainable, but efficiency does not guarantee sustainability. The safe minimum standard (SMS) for biological diversity illustrates the practical steps that could be taken to increase the likelihood that the economy is sustainable. Extinction threatens sustainability because it may affect the stability of economically important ecosystems and it may entail losses of plants, animals, and microorganisms that would otherwise have become important resources in the future. Wherever preservation is biologically feasible, extinction of species would be avoided unless the costs of avoidance are excessive or other social goals must receive a higher priority. The stated policies of the US and many other countries are consistent with the SMS. However, in the US at least, lack of funding has been a major impediment to implementation. A tax on natural resource use would be a possible source of funding for programs to improve prospects for economic sustainability.

AB Conserving biodiversity is regarded one of the major issues for enabling sustainable use of natural resources. This paper, focusing on the Baltic Sea and Sweden's fisheries, emphasizes the value of preserving biodiversity for the maintenance of diverse, resilient and functioning ecological life-support systems. These constitute a fundamental and necessary base for all human activities. The major features of diversity: species diversity, genetic diversity, functional diversity and spatial and temporal diversity and diversity changes in the Baltic Sea ecosystem are described and discussed together with the development of management approaches in Sweden's fisheries. The paper takes a systems perspective, focusing on the linkages between ecological and economic systems. Biodiversity is seen as an interdependent part of a cluster of diversities in the human society and in the ecological system. The need for broader integrated approaches enhancing diversity in resource-management systems are emphasized.

AB The paper adapts the ecological concept of sustainability that derives from the work of Holling to explain the evolution of institutions in rural sub-Saharan Africa, and to see why policies designed to alleviate the degradation of rangelands in Botswana and Kenya through institutional reform have not been as successful as hoped. We argue that the reason why these and other institutional initiatives have had limited success is that they took little account of the role of the institutions they were intended to replace in guaranteeing the social security of individual resource users, and failed to address that role. Using the term social sustainability to describe the ability of social institutions to continue functioning in the face of stress and shock, we show that the new policies were compromised precisely because they were not socially sustainable. The main policy implication of the paper is that institutional initiatives should address the needs satisfied by the structures they replace, if they are not to provoke conflicting evolutionary response on the part of those institutions.

TI MEETING ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC GOALS - MARINE PARKS IN THE CARIBBEAN
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Marine parks are increasingly being established to protect endangered marine ecosystems and the biological diversity that they support. Trade-offs exist between protection and use, however, and ways must be found to produce economic benefits from marine areas while still yielding protection benefits, a question of particular importance to poorer countries that can ill afford to forego development benefits by enforcing strict protection measures. This paper examines these issues in the context of Caribbean marine parks. A number of countries that have established marine protected areas also rely on ocean-based tourism as an important, sometimes central, component of their economy. Can protection and direct use be compatible? Bonaire Marine Park is examined in some detail and monetary estimates are presented. Initial results indicate that proper management can yield both protection and development benefits but questions of ecosystem carrying capacity and national retention of revenues raise important issues for longer term sustainability.

AB Reconciling and operationalizing the three main concepts of sustainable development-the economic, ecological, and sociocultural-poses formidable problems. Environmental economics and valuation can play a key role in helping to incorporate concerns about biodiversity loss into the traditional decision-making framework. A case study from Madagascar examines the impact of a new national park on tropical forests by using both conventional and newer techniques to economically value damage to forests and watersheds, timber and nontimber forest products, other impacts on local inhabitants, impacts on biodiversity, and ecotourism benefits. In the Sri Lanka case study, an integrated energy-environmental analysis was developed, which helps to eliminate projects with unacceptable impacts, and redesign others. Where economic valuation of environmental impacts was not possible, multiple attribute evaluation techniques were used. Improving the incomes and welfare of local communities, especially poor ones, while simultaneously preserving physical and biological systems, offers opportunities for developing countries to pursue all three goals of sustainable development in a complementary manner.

TI TIMBER PRODUCTION, TIMBER TRADE AND TROPICAL DEFORESTATION
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Concern about the state of tropical forests has led to increased interest in the role of timber production and the international timber trade in promoting forest depletion and degradation in the tropics. Although the direct and indirect environmental impacts of commercial logging may be significant, particularly for a few specific regions and countries, this is generally not thought to be the predominant cause of tropical deforestation. Other factors, in particular conversion of forest land for agricultural use and harvesting of trees for fuelwood, are considered to be much more important in the process of tropical deforestation. A review of statistical analyses of the causes of deforestation provides only limited evidence of the linkages between tropical timber production, trade and deforestation. However, the timber trade can lead to greater net returns for forestry investments and sustainable management of production forests, making this option more attractive than converting forest land to alternative uses. Therefore, an important factor in reducing timber-related tropical deforestation is ensuring proper economic incentives for efficient and sustainable management of tropical production forests. Appropriate forest management policies and regulations within producer countries ought to provide these incentives so that the long run income-generating potential of harvesting timber is maximized, and any significant external environmental costs associated with timber harvesting are internalized.

TI INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE FOR BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION
SO AMBIO

ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; AQUACULTURE; ECOLOGY
AB Indigenous peoples with a historical continuity of resource-use practices often possess a broad knowledge base of the behavior of complex ecological systems in their own localities. This knowledge has accumulated through a long series of observations transmitted from generation to generation. Such ''diachronic'' observations can be of great value and complement the ''synchronic''observations on which western science is based. Where indigenous peoples have depended, for long periods of time, on local environments for the provision of a variety of resources, they have developed a stake in conserving, and in some cases, enhancing, biodiversity. They are aware that biological diversity is a crucial factor in generating the ecological services and natural resources on which they depend. Some indigenous groups manipulate the local landscape to augment its heterogeneity, and some have been found to be motivated to restore biodiversity in degraded landscapes. Their practices for the conservation of biodiversity were grounded in a series of rules of thumb which are apparently arrived at through a trial and error process over a long historical time period. This implies that their knowledge base is indefinite and their implementation involves an intimate relationship with the belief system. Such knowledge is difficult for western science to understand. It is vital, however, that the value of the knowledge-practice-belief complex of indigenous peoples relating to conservation of biodiversity is fully recognized if ecosystems and biodiversity are to be managed sustainably. Conserving this knowledge would be most appropriately accomplished through promoting the community-based resource-management systems of indigenous peoples.

   BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Recognition is growing that the successful management of protected areas ultimately depends on the cooperation and support of local people. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in financial support for projects attempting to link the conservation of biodiversity in protected areas with local social and economic development. Drawing on our recent analysis of 23 integrated conservation-development projects (ICDPs) in 14 developing countries, this paper explores the challenges which have arisen in operationalizing two key concepts which lie at the heart of community-based conservation. First, buffer zones around park boundaries. Second, greater participation of local people in conservation and development. We describe important practical constraints which have so far limited the effective implementation of these two concepts. But-despite some critical constraints operating outside individual projects' sphere of influence-we conclude that innovative, well-designed projects at carefully selected protected area sites that constructively address local people-park relationships will be essential to the conservation of biodiversity, and thus to sustainable development.

AB Finally the important results of our CO2 balancing for the life cycle of a typical West German paper are summarized below: a distinction must be drawn between CO2 from fossil energy sources and CO2 from renewable biomass in the form of wood and starch CO2 emissions from the renewable biomass wood do not contribute to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect because they will be required for new wood growth.  However, this implies a sustainable forest economy also in pulp exporting countries of the greenhouse-active, energy-dependent CO2 emissions in the life cycle of paper in Germany pulp and paper production contributes about 85%.  Transport-dependent CO2 emissions constitute barely 15% recovered paper recycling provides a CO2 sink from renewable biomass, and with the present discussion of the sustainability of the forest economy in several countries in mind, should be further increased the thermal utilization for energy production of wastepaper no longer of value for papermaking, leads to a reduction of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.  This fact should be made clear to the public and to lawmakers

   STOCK REPLENISHMENT IN BERMUDA
SO BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID POPULATION-STRUCTURE
AB The source of recruits to Bermuda's spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) stock was examined through allozyme electrophoresis. A total of eight polymorphic loci were scored in adults, sub-adults and juveniles; Ldh-1, Pgm, Gpi, Pep-D, Pep-B1, Pep-B2, Sod and Mdh-1. Four polymorphic loci were scored in post-larval stages, the remaining loci being lost due to weak activity and ontogenetic changes at settlement. No convincing evidence for population substructure was found within the Bermuda stock when genetically tested by sex, spatial distribution and size-class. Tests for macrogeographic heterogeneity using Menzies' (1981) data-base for Caribbean stocks was complicated by uncertainty regarding electromorph compatibility and temporal stability of allele frequencies. Comparisons with contemporary samples obtained from south Florida demonstrated no significant heterogeneity. Monthly postlarval samples were in genetic equilibrium and indistinguishable from Bermuda and Florida adult samples. These results are consistent with a single western Atlantic/Florida stock. Increased co-operation between Bermuda, Florida State and United States Federal authorities is therefore recommended for effective resource management. However, as significant self-replenishment has not been excluded by this study, and in view of stable annual post-larval recruitment and the recent exploitation rates being sustainable, current fisheries regulations in Bermuda appear appropriate.

TI INDICATORS FOR A SUSTAINABLE SOCIETY
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
LA English
DT Article
AB This study presents a set of 20 indicators that could be suitable for monitoring the progress of our society on the path to sustainable development. Based on the concept of a sustainable society, which explicitly links the four aspects of health, social equity, economy and environment, these indicators are meant for large administrative areas, and use mostly already available data. The approach is global and symbolic in order to be able to facilitate the integration of the four aspects in the public's mind. It is information for action that could be used in a systematic way for presentation to the general public and to decision-makers, in the manner of everyday economic or weather indicators.

AB Application of plant life-history theory to strategies for breeding crop plants for sustainable agriculture remains relatively unexplored. We determined the relative tolerance of wild and domesticated tomatoes to simulated herbivory and evaluated plant characteristics that may contribute to tolerance. Wild and domesticated tomatoes were subjected to different levels of defoliation ranging from 0 to 70%. Single defoliation events at lower levels (15-30%) did not significantly affect total fruit mass produced in either wild or domesticated tomatoes. Increased defoliation resulted in significant reductions in total fruit mass per plant and mean mass per fruit. Reduction in fruit output by the cultivar was almost-equal-to 3 times greater than the wild tomato for the first 8 wk of fruit production, whereas the loss in seasonal fruit production by the cultivar was 1.7 times greater than the wild tomato. We concluded that domestication of tomatoes may have decreased their relative tolerance to herbivory. Possible mechanisms for decreased tolerance include differences in leaf area index, light capture curves, and the relative allocation pattern to vegetative growth vs. reproductive structures. Optimization of potential life-history trade-offs between tolerance to herbivory and maximum fruiting abilities are proposed for cultivars of sustainable agriculture.

TI ENERGY FOR SECONDARY CITIES - THE CASE OF NAKURU, KENYA
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE SECONDARY CITIES; ENERGY BALANCE; KENYA
AB Secondary cities are currently seen as an important focus for promoting a more spatially equitable pattern of economic infrastructure in developing countries, but their energy needs have not been given appropriate attention. This article presents research that was carried out in the East African secondary city of Nakuru, Kenya to determine patterns of energy demand and supply. Energy supplies used in Nakuru fall into two categories: industrial sources (electricity and petroleum) and traditional sources (wood, charcoal and agricultural residues). An overall energy balance is constructed for Nakuru, and it is then compared with those from other studies on rural Kenya and the primate city of Nairobi. Nakuru is shown to rely on biomass fuels (charcoal) to a significantly greater degree than Nairobi. It is further shown that an environmental danger exists, as Nakuru's present demand for charcoal exceeds the regional capacity to provide long-term sustainable supplies. A number of policy options are discussed that might contribute to solving the problem. The findings for Nakuru have wider policy ramifications: if secondary city development is promoted without an understanding of the differences in energy-use patterns they exhibit, the pending environmental problems may increase dramatically.

TI ETHICS AND SUSTAINABILITY - A PRELIMINARY PERSPECTIVE

LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS; NATURAL-RESOURCES; GEOGRAPHY; ECOLOGY; POLICY
AB Geographers or students of human-environment relations have an important role to play in addressing the questions and issues associated with environmental sustainability. It is the authors' thesis that a central weakness in geography's response to environmental problems and to issues of sustainability is the lack of engagement with questions of ethics. An overall ethic of care, respect, and responsibility is proposed. Within this overarching framework, it is suggested that the society-environment relation may be a scale-dependent problem set, with a separate expression of environmental ethics associated with each scale. For example, an ethic appropriate at the planetary scale may differ from  that which is pertinent at the local scale. This argument is advanced through examples from religious and secular interpretations of human-environment relations. In a preliminary way, both moral and technical issues associated with different ethical positions are raised and geographers are challenged to consider and debate their implications. It is concluded that without explicit environmental ethical premises, the sustainability debate is indeterminate.

AB Island nations consisting of small landmasses separated by large expanses of ocean face particularly severe challenges in their quest for economic and social development. In this paper, planning concerns in one such nation, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), are examined. The study opens with a description of each of the four separate states in the FSM, emphasizing their geographical, historical, and cultural characteristics. Regional aspects of FSM development are then examined by a statistical analysis of the geographical distribution of population in the individual states. Strategies are explored to incorporate rural outer islands found in three states, as outlined in the first two FSM national plans. The study concludes with an assessment of the regional challenge of developing the FSM into an economically and culturally sustainable nation.

TI INTEGRATED RESOURCE ASSESSMENT AND SUSTAINABLE LAND-USE

DE INTEGRATED LAND ASSESSMENT; SUSTAINABLE LAND USE; GOAL PROGRAMMING
AB Decision makers and planners in resource sectors recognize, at least in theory, the multiple uses of land, reflecting possible choices and options for society, and the need to evaluate the economic, social, and environmental implications of these choices. As such, the need for integrated resource management is now widely accepted in resource planning. This article contributes to the understanding of sustainable resource development through a specific case study. An integrated analytical system is developed and applied to the Peace River Region, British Columbia, Canada, to examine the impacts of a wide range of land-use options and policies upon the achievement of multiple resource use goals. The results indicate that an integrated approach in land resource analysis is not only possible but a necessary step in the move to develop procedures for assisting public decision makers in integrating the diverse functions of the land resource base and to revise demands or develop alternative strategies in order to move society closer to sustainable outcomes.

TI FERTILIZER EFFECTS ON SUSTAINABILITY IN THE WHEAT-BASED SMALL-HOLDER
   FARMING SYSTEMS OF SOUTHEASTERN ETHIOPIA
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID WINTER-WHEAT; NITROGEN
AB On-farm trials were conducted over three seasons throughout the highlands of Ethiopia to examine the sustainability of increased nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application on bread wheat in the peasant farming sector. Nitrogen fertiliser decreased soil pH by 0.2 to 0.3 units over one crop season. Nitrogen rates as low as 20.5 kg ha-1 significantly increased the density of wild oats in the wheat crop; the response to N was quadratic, attaining a maximum of 246 wild oat panicles      M-2   at 41 kg ha-1 relative to 191 panicles M-2   for the 0 N treatment. Broadleaf weed densities and the labour requirement for hand weeding the wheat crop were also significantly increased by fertiliser N. The incidence of stripe rust on wheat foliage was increased by 18% on a susceptible bread wheat cultivar with the application of 82 kg N ha-1. Phosphorus fertiliser increased the incidence of stripe rust by 14% with the application of 40 kg P ha-1. In contrast, P significantly decreased the density of wild oats and broadleaf weeds, presumably affecting both characters through an enhancement of crop biomass production. To have a sustainable impact on wheat grain yields in Ethiopia, increased fertiliser usage should be accompanied by the provision of other essential farm-level inputs such as herbicide and seed of rust-resistant cultivars.

TI ENHANCING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS VIA ELECTRONIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
   - WOOD PRODUCTS SELLERS AND HOMECENTER BUYERS
SO FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The homecenter market, driven by the repair and remodel demand sector, represents an important high-growth market for many primary wood products. The use of labels attached to each piece of lumber. plywood, and other forest products containing a universal product code (UPC) barcode to use with point-of-sale scanning devices represents a necessary requirement to serve an expanding homecenter customer base. Demand for UPC barcoded products and the proliferation of other electronic information technologies, including the use of electronic data interchange (EDI) to link wood products suppliers to homecenter customers, are being driven by large homecenter chains and are increasingly being used as a criteria in vendor selection. These technologies, representing a means by which products may be differentiated and business relationships enhanced, may serve as tools for a long-term and sustainable competitive advantage. This paper provides a current assessment of the state of the wood products and homecenter industries regarding UPC barcoding and EDI, examines the impact of these technologies on the formation of strategic alliances, and presents implications for the future of this important distribution system for wood products.

AB Wood production has increased rapidly in Southeast Asia in recent years. Harvesting intensity has also increased dramatically, to such an extent that the destruction of the tropical rainforest is of great concern to many people. This paper discusses the forest resources of three major wood-producing countries of Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and the utilization of these resources in world markets. Because Indonesia is now the largest timber producer in the region, special emphasis is placed on the development of its forest products industry. Concern for the tropical forest and the effect of sustainable forestry development on the growth of the forest products industry, the economy. and the social environment are discussed.

TI TAILORED LOGISTICS - THE NEXT ADVANTAGE
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB How many top executives have eve visited with managers who move mate rials from the factory to the store? Ho many still reduce the costs of logistics to the rent of warehouses and the fees charged by common carriers? To judge by hours of senior management attention, logistics problems do not rank high. But logistics have the potential to become the next governing element of strategy. Whether they know it or not, senior managers of every retail store and diversified manufacturing company compete in logistically distinct businesses. Customer needs vary, and companies can tailor their logistics systems to serve their customers better and more profitably.
   Companies do not create value for customers and sustainable advantage for themselves merely by offering varieties of goods. Rather, they offer goods in distinct ways. A particular can of Coca-Cola, for example, might be a can of Coca-Cola going to a vending machine, or a can of Coca-Cola that comes with billing services. There is a fortune buried in this distinction.
   The goal of logistics strategy is building distinct approaches to distinct groups of customers. The first step is organizing a cross-functional team to proceed through the following steps: segmenting customers according to purchase criteria, establishing different standards of service for different customer segments, tailoring logistics pipelines to support each segment, and creating economies of scale to determine which assets can be shared among various pipelines. The goal of establishing logistically distinct businesses is familiar: improved knowledge of customers and improved means of satisfying them.

TI THE SUSTAINABILITY OF CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITS - A TEST OF THE
   UNITED-STATES INTERTEMPORAL BUDGET CONSTRAINT
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS
AB This paper proposes a new method of determining whether a country is likely to be able to sustain its current account deficits without defaulting on its debt. It is based on the notion of the national intertemporal budget constraint (IBC) which is derived from a forward solution of the balance payments identity. Although the problem is formally similar to that considered in the literature on the government IBC, a more general solution is obtained by allowing the primary deficit to be endogenous instead of exogenous. It is shown that the existence of negative feedback from net indebtedness to the primary deficit - a wealth effect - is sufficient. This method supplants the ad hoc approach previously adopted in the current account literature. Whilst many of the same variables appear, a formal structure for analysing them is provided.

TI MONETARY CONTRACTING BETWEEN CENTRAL BANKS AND THE DESIGN OF SUSTAINABLE
   EXCHANGE-RATE ZONES

AB An exchange-rate system is a contract which commits central banks to intervene in the foreign-exchange market. The design features of the system include: the rules of intervention, the limits placed on exchange rates and the 'crisis scenario' describing possible transitions to new regimes. This paper considers the various trade-offs one faces in designing an exchange-rate system. One of these pertains to the amount of reserves which the central banks must have on hand in order to forestall a speculative attack and make the system sustainable. The amount of reserves needed depends crucially on the assumed crisis scenario.

AB In recent years, retailers have placed greater emphasis on developing long-term relationships to obtain sustainable benefits on issues such as product quality, price, and markdown allowances. The author examines the impact of situational factors such as the time orientation of a relationship and the importance of the issues to be resolved on the use of various negotiation strategies (problem solving, compromise, and aggressive) in channel relationships. He also investigates the impact of different strategies on channel member outcomes and satisfaction. The data used to test the model were obtained in a mail survey of 124 retail buyers in six regional department store chains. The study results indicate that when retailers are long-term oriented, problem-solving and passive aggressive strategies are used for resolving conflicts on major issues. The use of problem-solving strategy to resolve major conflicts resulted in higher outcomes and greater satisfaction than either compromise or aggressive strategies. The findings also provide insights on the use of various negotiation strategies by retailers to resolve conflicts on important and relatively unimportant issues.

AB The growing number of Japanese-Russian joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements concerning fishing and fishery products in the North-west Pacific is a welcome phenomenon to the extent that it indicates an increasing level of mutually beneficial cooperation. However, the bilateral arrangements, focused as they are on short-term benefits, reveal potentially damaging effects on resource management, the sustainable development of the Russian fishing industry, and long-term fishery relations between the two countries.

AB The traditional land-use system in the agricultural belt of the Venezuelan High Andes (3,000-4,000 m) includes extended fallows (from 7 to more than 20 years) alternating with short cultivation periods (1-4 years). This management produces a mosaic landscape where potato or cereal fields coexist with recuperating fallows of various ages and with land remaining uncultivated because of limitations of slope or stoniness. This land-use strategy maintains a high natural diversity in a way that allows an acceptable productivity without the use of mineral fertilizers. The ecological base underlying the functioning of the agricultural system is analyzed, mainly in relation to the recuperation of nutrients during the fallow periods. The ecological sustainability is discussed in light of the negligible erosion rates and the maintenance of high levels of soil organic matter. The massive introduction of chemical fertilizers in recent years induced important changes that are exemplified by the case study of the land-use strategy of a farmer.

AB Biological nitrogen fixation of leguminous crops is becoming increasingly important in attempts to develop sustainable agricultural production. However, these crops are quite variable in their effectiveness in fixing nitrogen. By the use of the N-15 isotope dilution method some species have been found to fix large proportions of their nitrogen, while others like common bean have been considered rather inefficient. Methods for increasing N2 fixation are therefore of great importance in any legume work. Attempts to enhance nitrogen fixation of grain legumes has been mainly the domain of microbiologists who have selected rhizobial strains with superior effectiveness or competitive ability. Few projects have focused on the plant symbiont with the objective of improving N2 fixation as done in the FAO/IAEA Co-ordinated Research Programme which is being reported in this volume. The objective of the present paper is to discuss some possibilities available for scientists interested in enhancing symbiotic nitrogen fixation in grain legumes. Examples will be presented on work performed using agronomic methods, as well as work on the plant and microbial symbionts. There are several methods available to scientists working on enhancement of N2 fixation. No one approach is better than the others; rather work on the legume/Rhizobium symbiosis combining experience from various disciplines in inter-disciplinary research programmes should be pursued.

TI POPULATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - DISTINGUISHING FACT AND
   PREFERENCE CONCERNING THE FUTURE HUMAN-POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The relation of population, environment and economic growth is controversial, with some considering that growth comes at an intolerable expense to the environment, others that the damage to the environment is slight and in any case so far in the future that it does not matter. Scientific evidence on the subject is not the only basis on which people choose sides; major factors are preference for present enjoyment and welfare as against the welfare of children and grandchildren, and the life of cities as against the countryside. The visibility of damage to the environment will sooner or later convince everyone that something must be done. For we can picture a declining marginal enjoyment of goods, and a rising marginal visible damage, two curves that are sure to meet sooner or later, and when they do the public will insist on drastic measures for repair being financed and undertaken. The greater the delay the more expensive the repairs. Beyond cost, the question is whether adequate measures of repair and prevention of further damage will be undertaken before it is too late.

TI INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE ERA OF ECONOMIC-POLICY REFORM -
   CONCERNS, CONTRADICTIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONS FROM MALAWI
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The article argues that the essence of economic policy reform programmes-both their substance and their pace-runs counter to the central notions of sound institutional development. Attention is first given to some fundamental concerns about the relationship between the two processes, in particular focusing on questions of culture, speed of change and the political environment. The article then provides some illustrations from Malawi, looking in tum at collateral institutional damage, the new generation of semiautonomous organizations, confusing incentives systems in the areas of salaries, housing and training, and lack of serious concern for the sustainability of the reforms. The conclusion calls for returning 'part-ownership' of the reform programme to the local officials, and trying to reduce some of the institutional unreality, which seems to adhere to the implementation of the reforms.

DT Article
ID INDUSTRY STRUCTURE; COMPETITION
AB The article is concerned with a spatial competition framework in perfect contestable markets. Two types of sustainability are distinguished. A weak form (with an invariant price strategy) and a strong form. The Baumol-Panzar-Willig results are not valid in a spatial context. Marginal production cost pricing is not a sufficient condition for a weak sustainability. It is socially inefficient Uniform delivered pricing is socially efficient and sustainable in a weak form. Additional conditions are necessary for a strong form. Generally, a spatial sustainable configuration implies price discrimination. The results are opposed to theorical fundations of deregulation policies.

AB Soil quality is the most important factor for sustaining the global biosphere. Soil quality may be defined in several different ways including productivity, sustainability, environmental quality, and effects on human nutrition. To quantify soil quality, specific soil indicators need to be measured spatially. These indicators are mainly soil properties whose values relate directly to soil quality but may also include policy, economic, or environmental considerations. Because assessing soil quality is complex, the individual soil quality indicators need to be integrated to form a soil quality index. This integration needs to be flexible enough to evaluate soil quality at spatial scales ranging from the farm to the regional level, be applicable to all types of agricultural land use, and be able to incorporate all types of soil quality information. We have developed a multiple-variable indicator ranging (MVIK) procedure that may provide a means to integrate soil quality parameters into an index to produce soil quality maps on a landscape basis. These maps would indicate the areas on a landscape that have a high probability of having good soil quality according to predetermined criteria. This procedure can provide probability maps based on any range of chosen criteria and thus is universally applicable. In addition, it allows the identification of the indicator parameter(s) responsible for zones of low soil quality, thus allowing specific management plans or land use policies to be developed.

TI UNSUSTAINABILITY OF A MEASLES IMMUNIZATION CAMPAIGN - RISE IN MEASLES
   INCIDENCE WITHIN 2 YEARS OF THE CAMPAIGN
SO SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID PERI-URBAN; VACCINATION
AB The 1990 national mass measles immunisation campaign resulted in a marked reduction in measles incidence in Natal/KwaZulu in the first 6 months after the campaign. Data from the measles ward admissions book at Clairwood Hospital were collated for the period 1 January 1989 to 31 May 1992 to assess the sustainability of the effects of the campaign. For the first 12 months after the campaign, measles admissions were consistently low. Thereafter, the number increased steadily, rising sharply to above pre-campaign levels 21 months after the campaign. The age distribution of measles patients indicated that the initial fall in the 10 - 12-month age group had been reversed in the second year after the campaign, suggesting that the high vaccination coverage achieved for this age group during the campaign had not been maintained. Measles admissions to Clairwood Hospital indicate that the effect of the measles immunisation campaign has not been sustained and that urgent action is required to avert a possible epidemic.

TI A MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING THE REAL EXCHANGE-RATE, WITH
   APPLICATIONS TO THE PHILIPPINES AND TANZANIA
SO WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID DEVALUATION
AB A competitive official real exchange rate is important to external balance and sustainable medium-term growth in developing countries. This article presents a methodology for estimating the appropriate real rate and provides a basis for evaluating the extent to which the prevailing rate is misaligned. In particular, the medium-term equilibrium real exchange rate is evaluated by estimating the effects of structural factors on the trend observed for a country's real rate compared with the rates of its major trading partners, taking into account the effects of macroeconomic policy. Structural factors include terms of trade, external capital flows, and trade policy, plus other factors relevant to the circumstances of individual countries. The implied change in the medium-term equilibrium real rate is compared with that of a historical reference period. The application of this methodology to two developing countries, the Philippines and Tanzania, illustrates how it can complement and improve upon other analytic approaches, such as those using purchasing power parity and analysis of parallel rates. This approach is complemented by an analysis of the relation between a country's real exchange rate and those of its major competitors.

TI A ONE-DIMENSIONAL THEORY FOR THE ELECTRODE SHEATHS OF ELECTRIC-ARCS
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
AB A non-equilibrium one-dimensional model is proposed for the plasma sheaths near the electrodes of electric arcs where the cathode is a thermionic emitter. Three coupled equations are solved: (a) the charge continuity equation, which accounts for ambipolar diffusion, recombination and ionization, (b) a form of Ohm's law relating the effective electrical conductivity with a local electric field and (c) the energy balance equation, accounting for thermal conduction, Ohmic heating, plasma radiation and the effects which occur at the electrode surface, i.e. thermionic cooling, ion heating, radiative heating from the plasma and radiative cooling by thermal emission. The three equations give distributions of temperature, electric field and charge density within the sheath. Results are given for the sheath at the thoriated-tungsten cathode and anode for a 200 A arc in argon. Calculations have also been made of sheath properties for various electrode materials to determine the critical current density sustainable by a cathode without cathode melting. Critical current densities for anode melting are less than for cathode melting because of the cooling effect at the cathode of thermionic emission. We find that the effect of ion heating tends to keep the cathode temperature near to the temperature for which the current density from thermionic emission equals the imposed current density.

TI HOW USEFUL ARE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY STANDARDS IN ECONOMICS - THE EXAMPLE
   OF SAFE MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR PROTECTION OF SPECIES
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY STANDARDS; CONSERVATION OF SPECIES; PROBABILITY OF
   SURVIVAL; SAFE MINIMUM STANDARDS; GAME THEORY; SOCIAL CHOICE
AB The use of environmental safety standards is being increasingly advocated, and economists are being increasingly required to adapt their policy models to take account of such standards, e.g. by the use of transferable environmental damage quotas. The use of these standards may be a consequence of a greater desire to achieve more sustainable development and preserve the natural wealth available to future generations. An important means to this goal is to preserve biodiversity and genetic variability. Safe minimum standards for conservation of wildlife have been suggested as a way to achieve this. Sometimes safe minimum standards for conservation of species are defined in terms of their minimum viable populations and their minimum habitat requirements. However, as a review of recent scientific literature indicates, these safe minimum standards are very uncertain.
   Environmental safety standards have been integrated into economics in a variety of ways, e.g. via constraints to ensure sustainability at the macro-level, via minimum safety standards necessary to ensure survival of species. Despite the commendable support which safe minimum standards appear to give for nature conservation, they involve conceptual problems and uncertainties as outlined in this paper. In fact. safe minimum standards for the conservation of species do not exist - no standard ensures the continued existence of any species. This is not to deny that an improvement in standards can up to a point increase the probability of survival of a species for a specified period of time. It implies that minimum standards need to be cast in terms of those required to achieve a particular probability of survival of the targeted species for a specified period. It may, however, be impossible to achieve the goal specified, e.g. the probability of survival of a species aimed for, may be greater than can be achieved for any attainable standard. In general, the paper makes it clear that standards suggested by natural scientists and others need to be subjected to careful scrutiny before they can be used as a reliable basis for economic policy.

LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCES
AB This paper presents a method to calculate the long-term effects of forest management decisions for an age-structured forest. The calculation of such effects is required to assess the sustainability and indeed the rationality of forest harvesting strategies. The primary focus of this paper is the issue of ''falldown'', i.e., the decrease in timber available for harvesting due to lack of large old trees. The largest net discounted economic returns are obtained by rapid harvesting (mining) of old growth. However, in the longer term the consequences of a decrease in harvest volume on local communities can be devastating. How can this conflict between short-term and long-term interests be reconciled? I consider a variety of strategies that vary in their sensitivity to the effects of falldown, and I present some pilot calculations that illustrate a method to weigh the consequences of following these strategies.

TI THE EFFECTS OF NITROGEN, ROW SPACING AND SEEDING RATE ON THE YIELD OF
   FLAX UNDER A ZERO-TILL PRODUCTION SYSTEM
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE PLANT ESTABLISHMENT; PLANT HEIGHT; ZERO TILL; YIELD
AB The long-term sustainability of agriculture requires that soil degradation be addressed and that crop production systems that incorporate the benefits of surface residues and standing stubble through conservation tillage practices be evaluated critically. The objective was to study the effects of nitrogen, row spacing and seeding rate on the yield of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) under zero-till production practices. Three row spacings, six seeding rates and two rates of nitrogen were investigated. The plots were directly seeded into barley stubble under a continuous cropping zero-till production system. When yield levels were > 1200 kg ha-1, yields were not significantly affected by row spacing, but when yield levels were < 1200 kg ha-1, the 20-cm row spacing was favored over the 10- or 30-cm spacings. Yields increased linearly with increase in seeding rate at all row spacings. There were no interactions observed between nitrogen, row spacing and seeding rate. The results of this study have important implications in terms of equipment design, cost for zero-till seeding equipment, and the opportunity to easily modify existing equipment for zero-till seeding.

AB The costs of N fertilizer and concern for sustainable agriculture have led to renewed interest in the use of legumes as a source of N for succeeding non-legume crops. In this regard, field experiments were conducted in 1987, 1988 and 1989 on a Riviere-du-Loup sandy gravelly loam (Ferro-Humic Podzol) at St-Anselme and on a Chaloupe silty loam (Orthic Humic Gleysol) at Deschambault in eastern Quebec, Canada, to determine the effects of 1 or 2 years of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) Outlook and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) Maple Amber on subsequent forage-corn (Zea mays L.) Pioneer 3979 dry matter yields (DMY) and N uptake, and the N-fertilizer replacement values (NFRV) of the different crop sequences. Com in monoculture or following a legume was fertilized with 0, 50, 100 or 150 kg N ha-1, and legumes received 20 kg N ha-1 as NH4NO3. In 1989, at both locations, the DMY and N uptake of forage com in monoculture or following 2 consecutive years of soybean, or subsequent to soybean and faba bean grown 2 years previously, increased linearly with N application. After 2 consecutive years of faba bean, the DMY were not affected by increasing fertilization, but the N uptake generally increased proportionally to N application. The estimated NFRV (on a DMY basis) after 2 consecutive years of faba bean varied from 60 to 125 kg N ha-1 at St-Anselme, and from 100 to 110 kg N ha-1 at Deschambault for the ears and stover, respectively. The NFRV estimated for the same cropping sequence varied from 122 to 129 kg N ha-1 at St-Anselme and from 104 to 131 kg N ha-1 at Deschambault, for the stover and ears, respectively, on the basis of N uptake. For 2 consecutive years of soybean, it averaged 14 kg N ha-1 at St-Anselme and 33 kg N ha-1 at Deschambault, on the basis of the DMY; when based on the N uptake, the NFRV of 2 consecutive years of soybean varied from 14 to 21 kg N ha-1 at St-Anselme and from 0 to 15 kg N ha-1 at Deschambault for the stover and ears, respectively. The average NFRV (based on the DMY) for faba bean grown 2 years previously were 17 kg N ha-1 at St-Anselme but NFRV varied from 0 to 16 kg N ha-1 at Deschambault for stover and ears, respectively; on the basis of N uptake, the NFRV for the same crop sequence averaged 24 kg N ha-1 at St-Anselme, but varied from 0 to 15 kg N ha-1 at Deschambault for the stover and ears, respectively.

ID SHIFTING CULTIVATION
AB This is a study of the role of Para rubber cultivation in a system of swidden agriculture in Indonesian Borneo. Such holdings produce most Of Indonesia's rubber, which is the country's largest agricultural generator of foreign exchange. Rubber integrates well into Bornean systems of swidden agriculture: the comparative ecology and economy of Para rubber and upland swidden rice result in minimal competition in the use of land and labor-and even in mutual enhancement-between the two systems. Rubber occupies a distinct niche in the farm economy: it meets the need for market goods, while the swiddens meet subsistence needs. The intensity of,production on these small-holdings is, as a result, characteristically low (and may even vary inversely with market prices). This reflects the independence of these small holders from external economic and political influences, which has been the key to their historical success. The special virtues of such ''composite systems '' merit greater attention by development planners.

LA English
DT Article
AB The residential sector accounts for most of energy-consumption in developing countries in the form of traditional energy. The use of commercial energy is nominal and confined mostly to urban areas where fuelwood is already monetized. A model, based on an end-use/process analysis approach, is developed on a spreadsheet, which is capable of simulating scenarios to address issues of increasing traditional energy-demand caused by population growth, sustainable supply capacity of the existing energy resources, potential for development of new and renewable energy resources, technology. This paper is divided into two parts: general energy issues and the modelling approach, and the application of this approach to Nepal in the context of fuelwood-supply sustainability.

TI Agricultural videotex in Europe: the Greek approach
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Videotex services in agriculture are operational in many countries of Europe. Experience has highlighted the wide-ranging fields of application involved and the different levels of technology adopted by the farming community. The main factors affecting agricultural videotex development are the investment and support policies applied, linkages with information sources, access compatibility both through networks and terminals, and integration with existing information systems in agriculture. This paper outlines the videotex policy applied by the European Community. Emphasis is given to the less telematically advanced member states. The main factors affecting the new developments and promotion of agricultural videotex services, as well as their strengths and weaknesses, are described and discussed. Particular attention is given to the Greek agricultural videotex system AGROTEL, which emerged from the videotex pilot project DIMITRA. The design aspects of the current information content and the end-user/computer interface are discussed. The main obstacles AGROTEL faces are analysed with the aim of providing appropriate recommendations, so as to move successfully to a self-sustainable service. The videotex pilot project DIMITRA is also described and the latest developments are reported. The study shows that although Greece faces particular problems, DIMITRA has achieved most of the stated objectives.

TI PLANT NEMATODES AND SUSTAINABILITY IN TROPICAL AGRICULTURE
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Although plant nematodes are ubiquitous and pathogenic to a wide range of crops, research into these pests in the tropics has been concentrated on commodity crops. While modern intensive tropical agriculture has become unsustainable and often relies on the use of toxic nematicides to control damaging populations of plant nematodes, many traditional subsistence farmers have been able to suppress nematodes by promoting crop diversity and selecting for tolerance and resistance. This paper gives examples of sustainable systems which suppress nematodes. Other examples of once sustainable systems in which nematode problems now occur are discussed and reasons for this instability suggested. The need for farmers to retain responsibility for the development of sustainable systems is stressed. Nematologists and other plant protectionists are encouraged to take a wider view of the complex issues that affect the sustainability of agriculture in the tropics.

DT Article
AB Most studies of organizational change in Third World manufacturing have been carried out in the newly industrializing economies of Latin America and East Asia.  This article focuses on an African economy, Zimbabwe.  Case studies of the application of Japanese production techniques in six firms show both the potential for change and the obstacles which firms face.  The impact of organizational change on use of capital equipment, production workers and management are discussed.  One of the major obstacles to successful innovation is shown to be the lack of commitment of middle and senior management.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the maximal power output at the neuromuscular fatigue threshold (EMG(FT)). as estimated from electromyographic (EMG) data from representative leg muscles during cycling.  The rate of rise in integrated EMG activity as a function of time (iEMG slope) was calculated at each of four constant-power-output ergometer bouts for 20 subjects. The iEMG slopes were plotted against work rates that were well described as linear functions (0.84 < R2 < 0.99). This iEMG slope vs. work rate relationship was extrapolated to zero slope to give an intercept on the power axis that was interpreted as the highest work rate sustainable without EMG evidence of neuromuscular fatigue (EMG(FT)). Each individual EMG(FT) was then expressed in terms of an O2 output (VO2) equivalent on the basis of the individual delta efficiency calculated during a linearly increasing maximal exercise test on the same bicycle ergometer. Results indicated a highly significant correlation (r = 0.92, P < 0.01) between EMG(FT) VO2 and anaerobic threshold VO2, as determined by conventional gas exchange criteria. The mean EMG(FT) VO2 (1.84 +/- 0.55 l/min) was, however, significantly greater (P < 0.01) than the anaerobic threshold VO2 (1.72 +/- 0.54 l/min). It was suggested that the EMG(FT) may provide an attractive alternative to the measurement of the highest work rate that can be sustained without evidence of neuromuscular fatigue.

TI HUMAN USE OF THE SAND DUNE ECOSYSTEM IN THE SEMIARID ZONE OF THE
   RAJASTHAN DESERT, INDIA

DE DESERT HUMAN AND LIVESTOCK POPULATION; MARGINAL CULTIVATION; STOCKING
   RATES; GRAZING PRESSURE; FUELWOOD DEMAND AND DEFICIT; FODDER PRODUCTION
   AND DEFICIT; LAND DEGRADATION
AB Sand dunes form one of the most fragile terrestrial ecosystems. In Rajasthan they have a diverse vegetation and are often utilized by considerable human and livestock populations. A thorough knowledge of the resource utilization by the human and animal populations is essential if the future potential of the ecosystem and its physical stability under changing environmental conditions are to be accurately assessed.  This study examines the socio-economic aspects of land degradation at four sites in Churu and Jhunjhunu districts, northwest Rajasthan. An attempt is made to assess the socio-economic factors leading to land degradation. Data on human use of the Rajasthan (Thar) Desert semiarid ecosystem were collected through individual interviews, group discussions and field measurements. The present exploitation of soil and vegetation resources, possible future biomass deficiency, its impact on sustainable development and role in land degradation are examined.
   The average number of people in each household in the study area, and the number of livestock each household maintains are too high to allow a satisfactory income to be sustained. The annual income of 50-90 per cent of households was less than 10 000 rupees ($US 1 = 17 rupees in 1987). Sale and consumption of milk, wool, surplus animals and wood provide livelihood, supplemented with income from wage labour. Rain-fed marginal land cultivation produces poor yields and the per capita production is too low to justify the huge soil erosion losses occurring. The number of goats, sheep and cattle owned by the inhabitants has increased tremendously in recent years. Stocking rates vary from 1.63 to 12.08 animals per hectare. The grazing pressure during the dry season, when forage availability decreases, reaches 34.9 animals per hectare. As a result of overgrazing, the land productivity has decreased considerably. The annual fodder deficit values in the study area are enormous. Demand for fuelwood at all the study sites is increasing, yet available forests have already largely been cut down. The distance travelled to collect fuelwood has been increasing, whereas the amount and quality of fuelwood is decreasing. Use of cattle dung to supplement fuelwood during the summer dry season and in drought periods has been decreasing due to low fodder availability and high livestock mortality. Human numbers are increasing, and livestock numbers are also multiplying (except in drought periods) and consequently the available resources are decreasing. Soil erosion and desertification will continue to increase during the next decade unless effective counter measures are undertaken.

ID AMAZONIA
AB As world population increases there will be a need for more food. If tropical countries are to meet this need, agricultural production must rise. There are large areas of tropical land formerly managed under traditional cropping systems and later abandoned to forest for reasons unrelated to their agricultural potential. This land should be identified and brought back into sustainable agricultural production, as it is: (a) unrecognized as former agricultural land; (b) on undegraded soils; (c) in wetter areas of higher potential for agriculture; (d) threatened with permanent inclusion in the expanding estate of forest and nature reserves.

AB The theory that tropical forest conservation poses a threat to the poor is put forward in David Wood's article, 'Forests to fields: restoring tropical lands to agriculture', published in this issue of Land Use Policy. Wood proposes to open to deforestation almost all of the tropical forests that are still standing. Conversion to non-forest uses would be promoted through increased flows of international funds with fewer provisions regarding sustainability and environmental protection than such projects currently have. These proposals are unwise and dangerous.

TI SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - CONCEPTUAL ISSUES, AN OPERATIONAL MODEL AND
   ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR AUSTRALIA
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes an operational model of sustainable development in an attempt to clarify some of the conceptual issues which surround the term. Despite the plethora of papers that make reference to sustainable development it is becoming increasingly clear that very few studies have progressed to the point where some of the ideas underpinning sustainable development can be put into an operational format. Yet, if the concept is to be useful for planning and managing landscapes in a sustainable way it is essential that operational models of the concept are produced. After discussing some of the conceptual issues that surround the term 'sustainable development', a description of a dynamic simulation model of sustainable development is proposed. Although the model is in its early stages of development it has been applied in several national case studies, including Australia. Some implications of further development of the model for its application to northern Australia are also suggested.

TI OCCURRENCE OF FLESHY FUNGI FROM AGRICULTURAL FIELDS

DT Article
DE AGRICULTURE; BIOCONTROL; RESIDUE; SAPROPHYTES
AB Thirteen species of fleshy fungi were identified from two agricultural fields during the 1989 and 1990 growing seasons at the Rural Development Center (RDC) and Horticulture Farm, Coastal Plain Experiment Station, Tifton, Georgia. The three most common fungi were Coprinus plicatilis, Cyathus olla, and Panaeolina foenisecii. At the former site, residue management practices were established for evaluating crop production and at the Horticulture Farm different crops were grown with conservation tillage employing a Low Input Sustainable Vegetable Production system. Tillage treatments at the RDC were no-till, row-till, ridge-plant, and moldboard-plowing. Residue management of triticale included burning or cutting the stubble at a height of 20 or 60 cm at harvest. At the Horticulture Farm, seven winter cover crops were compared to a fallow control. No significant differences were shown between observations of fungal species and individual treatments at the Horticulture Farm during 1989 and 1990. However, there were treatment differences for observed fungi at the RDC farm on specific dates for both years. Furthermore, no individual treatment(s) during the investigation increased observation rates of specific fungal species. Non-burned debris treatments showed consistently higher populations and diversity of fungi than burn debris plots.

TI SOIL PROPERTIES AND CROP YIELD AMONG 4 TILLAGE SYSTEMS IN A WHEAT PEA
   ROTATION
SO SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSERVATION TILLAGE; FALLOW SYSTEM; ROOT; NITROGEN; RESIDUE; GROWTH
AB Tillage systems that address soil conservation and sustainable crop yield need to be developed. Research was conducted on a Walla Walla silt loam (Typic Haploxeroll) to determine the long-term (19 years) effect of four tillage systems on soil properties and crop yield in a green pea (Pisum sativum L.)-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation that was started in 1968. The experimental design was a split plot with four replications. Wheat and peas were grown each season. The primary tillage systems were: (T1) fall moldboard plow after wheat and after peas (control); (T2) fall rototill after wheat and fall sweep after peas; (T3) spring moldboard plow after wheat and fall moldboard plow after peas; (T4) no tillage after wheat and fall sweep after peas. Soil measurements included bulk density, pH, organic carbon, penetration resistance, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Profiles of bulk density, penetration resistance and pH revealed unique differences among treatments. However, there were no consistent differences in yield among the four tillage systems, in either green peas or wheat. From a crop production viewpoint, changes in soil properties on these tillage plots were inconsequential. From a soil erosion viewpoint, spring plowing (T3) and conservation tillage (T4) have an advantage over T2 and T1 because surface cover is maintained during the first winter following wheat harvest. Results show the importance of testing tillage systems over long periods of time and that the traditional system of fall moldboard plowing after wheat and after peas can be replaced by conservation systems without yield loss.

AB The choices available to people deciding on family size are determined by cultural, economic an social considerations. Before any realistic and acceptable action can be advised, which might influence family size and population growth, it is necessary to understand the balance between resource availability and consumption, access to contraceptive technology, and the social and cultural influences under which people live. Any intervention should seek to increase the range of choices available to people and to create the conditions which enable them to afford those choices. It is in the poorer parts of the world that population growth is greatest and choices are most limited. Inequitable resource distribution globally is at the root of high population growth rates in poorer areas. Excessive consumption patterns in the industrialized countries pose as great a threat to the development of a sustainable global environment as do the high growth rates in the developing countries. There is no technological short cut to limiting population growth. For any service, including family spacing, to have a significant impact over a long period of time, it must be delivered through a secure, reliable and effective system to families who fully understand the benefits and the implications, and whose choice is informed and made freely.

TI THE TRAINEE PROGRAM FOR AGRICULTURAL GRADUATES FROM MOROCCO
SO TROPENLANDWIRT
LA German
DT Article
AB Since 1986 over 100 graduates from Agricultural Universities and Technical Schools of Morocco have received practical training directed by the German Institute for Tropical and Subtropical Agriculture (DITSL), Witzenhausen. The Programme has been launched by the Food and Agriculture Centre of the German Foundation for International Development with the aim of training practically skilled farm managers who are capable of being trainers of professional staff required in the agricultural production sector. Since 1990 the programme has been incorporated into a bilateral aid project of the German Agency for Technical Cooperation with the objective of establishing a dual system of education for the agricultural sector in Morocco.
   The 18-months programme comprises, after 4 months of language training, a period of 12 months active participation on a German family-type farm or horticultural enterprise. This phase is complemented by a series of intensive subject matter seminars along with the vegetation period.
   With respect to the project purpose achievements became visible in 1992 when the first group of agricultural students received their practical training on a commercial farm run by a group of returnees and more former participants were in the process of opening up their farms. The acquired skills and high motivation of the new farm managers will result in a lasting effect. However it is also apparent from the time span between the start of activities and first achievements that sustainability requires a maturing process which has to be considered in programme planning.

TI IMPERFECT MIMICRY - A PIGEONS PERSPECTIVE

DT Article
ID ABUNDANCE; SYRPHIDAE; PATTERNS
AB Despite the dearth of field-based evidence from natural model-mimic communities, theory suggests that Batesian mimicry should have limits placed upon the model:mimic ratio for mimics to benefit. Paradoxically, hoverflies that are apparently mimics are often superabundant, many times more abundant than their supposed models. One possible solution to this paradox is that perhaps they are not mimics at all. We use discriminative operant conditioning methods to measure the similarity perceived bv pigeons between wasps and various species of supposedlv mimetic hoverflies, and an image processing technique to measure objective similarity. We demonstrate that pigeons rank mimics according to their similarity to a wasp model, in an orderly broadly similar to our own intuitive rankings. Thus pigeons behave as if many hoverflies are indeed wasp mimics. However, they rank the two commonest hoverflies as very similar to wasps, despite these looking decidedly poor mimics to the human eye. In these species, 'poor' mimicry may have been sustainable because it exploits some constraint in birds' visual or learning mechanisms, or some key feature used in pattern recognition. Furthermore, the relation between similarity and mimicry is nonlinear: small changes in similarity can lead to dramatic increases in the degree of mimicry.

TI GREEN-REVOLUTION, DRYLAND AGRICULTURE AND SUSTAINABILITY - INSIGHTS FROM

SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Against the background of the green revolution and dryland agriculture, this paper analyses the growth experience of Indian agriculture and its implications for growth, equity and sustainability. It examines the association between growth and instability and factors behind yield instability, using cropwise and disaggregated time series data. It then analyses the cost economics of Indian agriculture covering several crops and regions. This is followed by an impact assessment of watershed development programmes on dryland development in India.
   The authors observe that while irrigated crops and those with access to modern farm technology have dominated the growth process, dry crops and drought-prone regions like Karnataka in south India too have shared the gains of agricultural growth. But this growth process has been accompanied by higher instability in yields and increasing costs of cultivation. After analysing the factors responsible for this, the paper then discusses the various strategies and interventions needed to accelerate and promote sustained agricultural growth under diverse environments and constraints.

   TEPHROSIA-CANDIDA; CASUARINA SPP
AB Cassava is recognized in the region as the second most important crop after paddy rice. In Vinh Phu province of Vietnam, it is usually grown on highly erodible slopes of the small hills surrounding paddy fields. Cassava crop land is generally in annual use until the yield is less than 3-4 t fresh tubers/ha. This constant cropping system rapidly depletes the soil as fertilizers are infrequently used and crop residues are usually removed from the fields. Erosion is a major problem as the soil is exposed through hand cultivation and regular weeding during a cropping season which coincides with the wet season. Sustainable and productive cropping systems are needed.
   In order to take a first step towards sustainability, this paper presents several possible agroforestry systems in which cassava could be intercropped with a number of nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs. Several theoretical combinations have been examined assuming a critical lower production limit of 3-4 t fresh tubers/ha. Those with sustained high potential yields are recommended for future field experimentation.

AB A climatic method is described for optimizing cropping patterns on the basis of mean length of the growing season as related to the distribution of annual rainfall. Application of the method for Bhuj region in the Kutch district reveals that, for optimized and sustainable production, about 32% of the total agricultural land should be covered by grasses or silvipastoral system compared to only 11% area under grasses at present. The method of optimizing the area allocation for the different crops that can provide sustainable production from a given farm area is also discussed.

LA English
DT Article
AB 1. In Europe, bait supply to anglers from the natural environment involves: (i) bait collection by anglers for own use, (ii) local semi-professional bait digging and (iii) professional bait digging contracted to distributors.
   2. The management of bait digging activity is particularly acute where there is a conflict with conservation interests.
   3. Two case studies are presented describing the population dynamics of: I Arenicola marina in the Lindisfarne nature reserve, and II Nereis virens in the Menai Strait; both in conservation areas.
   4. Case I. Populations of A. marina are subject to marked annual cycles in number and fresh weight. This case illustrates the response of the population to substantial overexploitation leading to a population crash. With the introduction of restrictive legislation the population was re-established by recruitment of adults from neighbouring unexploited populations.
   5. Case II illustrates the dynamics of a N. virens population dominated by large old individuals; it does not represent a sustainable resource in contrast with populations of the same species in other locations.
   6. The management of the exploitation of bait populations in conservation areas is discussed in relation to world patterns of utilization and supply.

SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB 1. This paper describes New Zealand's Resource Management Act in relation to freshwater management and conservation.
   2. The development of the Act is described with reference to the consolidation and integration of earlier legislation. The central concept of sustainable management is more limited than the related concept of sustainable development, and places constraints on activities which have environmental impacts.
   3. The specific provisions relating to fresh water are noted, and the resource consents required for taking water, damming or diverting watercourses, and discharging into water, or onto land where the discharge may reach water, are described. The relation of riparian management to the requirement for protection of fish habitat is noted, and water conservation orders are described. Attention is given to the likely implications for managers.
   4. An attempt is made to anticipate difficulties that may arise in implementing the Act; in particular, the possible balancing between socio-economic and ecological considerations. The specific features of the freshwater environment are considered from the viewpoint of management, and the problems involved in tradeability are noted. Attention is drawn to the scope of the Act in the attempted integration of most, but not all, environmental considerations, and a final evaluation suggests that economic growth is likely to present a substantial challenge to the purpose of the Act.

TI A HOLOSPHERE OF HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Public health practice is in a transitory state, expanding considerably beyond medical and behavioural models of health and disease to encompass physical and social environmental health determinants. A new public health practice is emerging, apparent in initiatives like the international healthy cities/communities projects. This new public health practice must integrate the challenge of sustainable development, as defined by the 1987 World Commission on Environment and Development. The holosphere framework locates health as its central metaphor, and defines six interacting environmental spheres: a viable natural environment, a sustainable economic environment, a sufficient economy, an equitable social environment, a convivial community, and a livable built environment. There are five functional roles for local government: policy, legislation, education, partnerships and advocacy. Representative actions from each of the six environmental spheres of the holosphere framework are identified and discussed, using the five functional roles of local government. There is a need for new intersectoral forums to act upon the knowledge generated by integrative models such as the holosphere. Canadian Round Tables on Environment and Economy are encouraging examples of such intersectoralism.

The purpose of this study was to determine the stability of estimations of estimates of theta(PA) and W', said to reflect maximal sustainable power and anaerobic capacity, respectively. Thirteen women and 13 men performed five bouts of cycling exercise to exhaustion. Individual theta(PA) and W' were calculated from the results of these five bouts (Trial 1). These procedures were repeated (Trial 2). For both sexes, Trial 2 estimates of theta(PA) were 5 to 6% higher than Trial 1 estimates, but they were highly correlated. Mean W' estimates were the same in Trials 1 and 2, with higher trial-to-trial correlations in the men than in the women.

SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Caring for the Earth represents current, middle-of-the-road thinking on the relationship between conservation and development. This IUCN/UNEP/WWF document has embraced a purely utilitarian perspective: it considers the conservation and development of natural resources to be the same process. In this analysis, I argue that the goal of creating the sustainable society, as defined in Caring for the Ear is an unattainable utopia, and that the mechanisms proposed to attain this goal will lead irrevocably to the loss of biological diversity. I consider the history of the concept of sustainable development, and then document the constraints on sustainable use of natural resources. Sustainable use only occurs when both human needs are met and the losses of biodiversity and environmental degradation are acceptable These conditions are not always met when natural resources are used, and I consider the fundamental contradictions between resource potential and human needs. I conclude by emphasizing that while sustainable use is a powerful approach to conservation, it is not the only one, and the conservation of many species and biological communities also requires a preservationist approach.

SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB We compare existing nontimber forest product extraction systems in Peten, Guatemala, and West Kalimantan, Indonesia, to identify key ecological, socioeconomic, and political factors in the design and implementation of extractive reserves. Ecological parameters include the spatial and temporal availability of harvested products and the sustainability of harvesting practices from both a population and an ecosystem perspective- Socioeconomic and political factors include the presence or absence of well-defined resource tenure rights, physical and social infrasutructure, markets, and alternative land uses. We conclude that although extractive reserves can play a significant role in preserving tropical forests as a part of a broader land-use spectrum, their effectiveness is highly dependent on prevailing local ecological, socioeconomic, and political conditions. Ultimately, extractive reserves should be regarded as one component of an overall approach to the problem of tropical deforestation extrapolation of habitat models over unsurveyed regions.  We conclude with recommendations from this case study regarding when to consider using GIS and the importance of pilot studies and sensitivity analysis.

AB Not all nitrogen (N) inputs have been accounted for in forested ecosystems. We sought to account for N2 fixation and dry deposition using a lysimeter mass-balance approach. Large sand-filled, field lysimeters were used to construct 5-yr nitrogen budgets for two N2-fixing trees, two pines, and a nonvegetated control soil. This approach is a promising and straightforward technique for quantifying otherwise difficult-to-measure fluxes. Accurate assessment of changes in N storage combined with direct measurement of N inputs in precipitation and losses from leaching allowed us to estimate fluxes. Gains of N in pine systems were greatest in vegetation and litter, overshadowing combined losses from mineral soil and leaching by about threefold. Rapid acetylene reduction in pine rhizospheres and in cultures from washed roots suggests that unexplained gains are due to associative N2 fixation. These results provide strong evidence for N2 fixation in pine systems of almost-equal-to 50 kg . ha-1 . yr-1 N. The symbiotic N2-fixing trees black locust and black alder fixed 2 and 5 times more N2, respectively, than did pines. In all systems, input in precipitation and dry deposition were relatively unimportant to the N budget. Unexplained losses of N from the nonvegetated control suggest that denitrification is an important flux. Mineral soil organic matter declined sharply and significantly in pines (20%) and even more so in the nonvegetated control (40%). Symbiotic N2-fixing trees caused a small, nonsignificant increase in mineral soil organic matter and large, significant increases in litter layer organic matter. Bulk density (0-20 cm) declined by 5% under symbiotic N2-fixing trees and increased by 5% in one pine sandbox. Correction for soil expansion or collapse did not greatly alter estimates of unexplained N or N2 fixation. Pines with rhizospheres that fix N2 at the rates we observed might be used to restore degraded land and to create silvicultural systems that are N self sufficient. We first need to better understand the microbiology, tree genetics, and soil conditions that lead to rapid N2 fixation in pine ecosystems.

AB Protective gillnets (shark nets) have been successful in reducing the frequency of shark attacks on the coast of Natal, South Africa. This is achieved primarily through a reduction in numbers of large sharks. The nets also take a by catch of dolphins, sea turtles, batoids and teleosts. Concern has been expressed over the direct effect of mortalities on the various stocks and also the broader, indirect effects on the inshore system. Catch rates of most shark species declined initially but have shown no trend since the mid-1970s. A first estimate of the reduction in total shark numbers is provided, and factors such as stock identity and net avoidance are discussed. Turtle and teleost stocks do not appear to be threatened by net mortalities but marine mammalogists are investigating the sustainability of catches of two dolphin species. Certain batoids may have declined despite a high release rate, but more data are needed. A published contention that shark netting has resulted in a proliferation of small sharks through reduced predation is re-examined and considered to be exaggerated. Reduced predation on dolphins, as a result of shark netting, is estimated.

TI INCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE FORESTRY - THE CASE OF THE REPUBLIC-OF-IRELAND
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT
AB Forest decline in the tropical zone of the world has provoked an enormous amount of concern but, so far, few if any panaceas. Leaving aside the pervasive impact of clearance for agriculture to focus for the time being exclusively on the role of timber extraction in the moist tropics, it appears that, in present circumstances at least, commercial logging is effectively incompatible with sustainable forest use. For this reason there is a developing interest in the potential which private-sector plantation forestry may have, in these areas, for significantly contributing to both local and export timber needs and so relieving pressure on the remaining area of natural forest. The peculiarly long-term character of investment in trees, and the capital-poor nature of the countries concerned mean, however, that financial incentives will almost certainly be necessary if plantations are to have real consequence.
   It is in this context that the recent history of the forest programme in Ireland, the country with the lowest overall proportion of forest cover and the highest percentage of state (as opposed to private) forestry in the EC, may be relevant. Forestry incentives introduced in 1980, and aimed at landowners in the agriculturally disadvantaged western region, were initially ineffective, despite the region's comparative advantages for timber-growing. However, major additions to the level and range of support in the second half of the 1980s, led to an exponential increase in grant-uptake.
   The very success of the above scheme in recent years has caused it to be critized for the loss of large areas of bogland which have considerable environmental value but low potential for timber production in any normal investment sense. In addition, plantations in all parts of the region are overwhelmingly coniferous. More generous, country-wide incentives for environmentally desirable broadleafed planting are too new for it to be known what effect they will have on the afforestation of the better land. It seems almost certain, however, that attempts to reconcile productive and environmental aims in private forestry programmes inevitably increase their complexity and cost: this has undesirable implications for the possible transfer of such schemes to developing countries in the tropics.

AB Even though ''sustainable development'' seems to have emerged as the development paradigm of the 1990s, a great deal of vagueness still surrounds the meaning, definition, and theoretical underpinnings of the concept. There is also a general lack of emphasis on the spatial dimension of sustainable development when developing relevant conceptual or environmental accounting frameworks. In clarifying the concept, this article proposes a definition that explicitly incorporates the temporal as well as the spatial dimension of sustainability. It also develops a logically consistent conceptual framework for the analysis and evaluation of sustainable development, following a spatial systems approach. Five interconnected aspatial subsystems or subsets of a spatial system are identified and their respective operational dimensions discussed. A proposed composite index called degree of stainable development (DSD) and its five component indicators are also outlined. The difficulties involved in operationalizing the DSD measure and the conceptual framework are noted, and the various tasks that need to be undertaken in this regard are specified. It is concluded that future research utilizing the proposed conceptual framework should not only foster the development of appropriate methodologies for the comparative evaluation of sustainable development at global, national, or regional scales, but also offer insights to appropriate decision makers at various levels regarding available options and alternative actions for the healthy development of their respective societies.

AB Sustainable development' is analysed as a product of the Modernist tradition, in which social criticism and understanding are legitimized against a background of evolutionary theory, scientific specialization, and rapid economic growth. Within this tradition, sustainable development emphasizes the need to live within ecological limits, but allows the retention of an essentially optimistic idea of progress. However, the inherent contradictions in the concept of sustainable development may lead to rejection of the Modernist view in favour of a new vision of the world in which the authority of science and technology is questioned and more emphasis is placed on cultural diversity.

AB From the early 1960s to 1977, fishing vessels from 13 nations fished heavily off the northeastern United States. Landings of principal groundfish species rose to 780,000 tonnes in 1965 and abundance declined rapidly. Most species of groundfish were being underfished by the United States. With the passage of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1976, fishing by foreign nationals stopped and fishing effort by the United States increased. The number of days fished by otter trawlers steadily increased into the mid-1980s before tapering off. Fishing technology improved and the effective fishing effort continued to go up even though the number of days at sea did not. Landings rose with effort until 1983 and then fell dramatically. Groundfish abundance declined steadily after 1978 for the next decade. By 1990-1992, fishing mortality rates for the three major groundfish species (cod, haddock, yellowtail flounder) were twice as great as the management targets. Overall groundfish landings were one-third the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Landings for haddock and yellowtail flounder were one-tenth the MSY. If the abundance of groundfish were rebuilt to provide the MSY the catch could increase by two to three times with one-half of the present effort.

TI THE FALLACY OF SINGLE-LEVEL CONTROL - LOCAL ECONOMIES IN A CHANGING
   GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB The increasing centralization of national economies has created crisis conditions for growing numbers of local economies. Efforts to deal with the problem have so far been largely unsuccessful. Now, unless the internationalization of economic activity is guided by the principles of democracy and economic efficiency, it will lead to even more centralization. In the EC, for example, this will worsen the difficulties of 'crisis regions'. A key cause of the problem is the assumption that macroeconomic control can be exercised at a single level only. The solution depends on developing a multilevel system of macroeconomic management, at subnational and supranational levels as well as the national level. A twin-track approach, localizing and internationalizing, is needed to make local economic well-being a goal of economic policy, and to help create a more environmentally sustainable world economy.

TI SUSTAINABLE USE OF WETLANDS - VALUING TROPICAL WETLAND BENEFITS -
   ECONOMIC METHODOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE INDONESIA; TROPICAL WETLANDS; ECONOMIC VALUATION; ECONOMIC BENEFITS;
   ENVIRONMENTAL FUNCTIONS; USES
AB Tropical wetlands are increasingly disappearing as the result of development decisions. Common examples are the conversion of mangrove swamps to fishponds, diverting water away from river floodplains, draining wetlands for agriculture and other land uses, and over-loading wetlands with pollution. Too often, such development decisions are taken without considering the loss in wetland benefits arising from damages and conversion; the underlying assumption is often that the net benefits to society of any development option must presumably be greater. However, there is much evidence to suggest that this assumption is not always correct, Many tropical wetlands are being directly exploited, often through non-market, 'informal' economic activity to support human livelihoods, e.g. through fishing, hunting, fuelwood extraction and water supply. Some of the ecological functions of wetlands. such as flood control, storm prevention and groundwater recharge, may provide even wider benefits through protection or support of economic activity and property. Finally, some wetlands comprise unique natural environments and habitats, which are of considerable value. The basic methodology for assessing and valuing the economic benefits of tropical wetlands is relatively straightforward, but difficult to apply because of data and resource constraints. Preliminary applications in Central America suggest the importance of ranking wetland characteristics and distinguishing between direct-use values, indirect-use values and non-use values. A further application in a Nigerian floodplain shows how calculation of a few direct-use values alone - for agriculture, fuelwood and fishing - demonstrates that wetland benefits are significant, particularly when contrasted with the benefits from irrigation projects that are diverting water away from the floodplain. The analysis shows that sustainable use of the floodplain can yield substantial economic returns to local inhabitants, and these benefits should not be excluded as an opportunity cost of any scheme that diverts water away from the wetland system. Finally, a case study of a mangrove system in Indonesia illustrates how the degree of environmental linkages' between the components of the system are critical in determining the extent to which the mangrove forest can be exploited for woodchip production.

TI INDIA AT THE CROSSROADS IN GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB The debate on environmental protection within India shows striking parallels to the larger debate between North and South. An ecologically based causal paradigm, stressing overpopulation and non-sustainable resource use, is in conflict with a moral paradigm that attributes environmental degradation to the consumption patterns of the rich. Adherents of both causal models agree that sustainable development is the answer to India's environmental problems, but they interpret the concept in different ways. This article examines the legal, political, and bureaucratic means through which Indian environmental policy is made and asks why competing views of environment and development have been more successfully negotiated with respect to some issues than others.

AB The author discusses factors likely to affect Indonesia's participation in global climate change mitigation negotiations. These include Indonesia's performance to date in the international arena and its track record for compliance with agreements; domestic challenges such as demographic pressures, economic growth, deforestation, and energy consumption; the institutional culture of the government; and the activities and limitations of the legal system, non-governmental organizations, and business. The author concludes that, while the Indonesian government may be a vocal advocate for 'sustainable development', it has little ability to follow through on large-scale commitments to international efforts because of issues It faces at home.

TI GROUNDWATER-FLOW DYNAMICS AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES AT THE ATOLL SCALE
SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
ID ISLAND; MODEL; LENS
AB One of the most difficult tasks in hydrogeology is to develop sustainable supplies of potable ground water from small atoll islands. Fresh ground-water systems within atolls, if they exist at all, are extremely fragile and sensitive to development stresses. In this study, the mathematical model SUTRA was used to examine development alternatives for a two-phase miscible ground-water system in a cross section through the Laura area of Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands. The geological framework modeled for Laura is a multilayered aquifer system in which the primary members are a sequence of moderately permeable Holocene carbonate sediments overlying highly permeable Pleistocene sediments and reef materials. Ground water in this system consists of a thin layer of fresh water separated from underlying sea water by a relatively thick, transitional layer of mixed saline and fresh water. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the modeled depth to the 50% salinity contour is most sensitive to permeability, and the transition-zone thickness is most sensitive to transverse dispersivity. Results from the development analysis verify that shallow, linear skimming wells, or galleries, are the most efficient means of extracting fresh ground water.

DT Article
AB The long-term safe withdrawal rate for a coastal aquifer in Mannar Island of Sri Lanka was assessed through the simulation of interface movement. A range of estimates of natural recharge sequence was first obtained from a water balance study considering the variations of factors affecting the soil moisture balance. The representative recharge sequence was then determined through the simulation of a field observed interface profile along a selected section. Following this, the sustainability of continuous water withdrawal in the future was assessed by limiting the extent of salt-water upconing. An increase in the withdrawal rate in the future would be possible through proper monitoring of the system response.

AB This article discusses the change among Yucatec Maya farmers from traditional shifting milpa agriculture to intensive horticultural production for the Mexican market. The process of agricultural intensification among this group of peasant farmers has involved movement toward an increasingly sedentary form of production which has heightened reliance on the use of chemicals with negative consequences for the environment. The research, which focuses on the pressure on producers to abandon more sustainable forms of cultural controls against crop loss in favor of modern chemical controls, raises the issue of the transferability of sustainable traditional technology to small commercial farmers in the tropics. More specifically, the article draws attention to the sometimes overlooked issue of economic, as well as environmental, sustainability in discussions on agricultural development and resource management.

AB It is widely acknowledged that education and training have an important role in meeting the challenges of global environmental change. This paper looks at the way global concerns have emerged and evolved in recent decades, how they are interrelated, especially the population-environment interrelationships, and at the need for sustainable development. Population and environmental education have been two distinct educational responses, both fostered by international organizations, but now they need to be linked. The paper looks at the way geography, especially population geography, may offer integrating opportunities, through its academic scope, a wide range of spatial and time scales, and a consciousness of the great diversity of cultures, economies, polities and environments.

TI TECHNOLOGY IN MARINE CONSTRUCTION FIRMS
SO JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the common characteristics of marine construction firms, identifies opportunities for and constraints to advanced technology in marine construction, forwards recommendations for advancing marine construction technology, and identifies implications regarding technology in other segments of the construction industry. Although marine construction firms innovate and apply new technologies to win and successfully construct specialized marine projects, many technologies are abandoned after meeting the challenges of the target project. A short-term view of technology in marine construction due to varying project demands, market forces, and the competitive-bidding and -contracting system is a major barrier to innovation and technological advancement. Marine construction firms can gain competitive advantages based on low cost or distinctive capabilities by developing sustainable technologies to meet the unique challenges inherent in the marine project. A managerial framework, defined as an organizational structure and procedures for developing new technologies, is forwarded to help marine construction firms develop sustainable technologies for competitive advantage. Reforms to the competitive-bidding and -contracting system are recommended for public owners to help facilitate innovation and new technology.

TI ROLE OF HEART MASS IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES OF
   VENTRICULAR-FIBRILLATION THRESHOLD AND SPONTANEOUS DEFIBRILLATION IN
   YOUNG-DOGS
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PUPPIES
AB In the course of studying developmental changes of induction and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation in canine pups, we have documented that at about the third-week of age, hearts reach a critical point where ventricular fibrillation may become both inducible and sustainable, thus forming the basis for cardiac arrhythmic death. Since age-related variations of cardiac mass may account for these findings, this study was conducted to systematically investigate the role of changing heart mass on the induction and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation in the canine heart, during the early postnatal development.
   Repetitive determinations of ventricular fibrillation threshold and individual incidence of spontaneous defibrillation were obtained in 87 puppies 1-6 weeks old, from litters of varied body size breeds, studied at weekly intervals. Overall, ventricular fibrillation threshold correlated positively with ventricular weight (VFTmA=3.30+1.27V(wtg), r=0.71). However the slopes were steeper and correlations were stronger for the first, second and sixth week and nonsignificant in the fourth and fifth weeks. The ventricular fibrillation to ventricular weight ratio also varied with age (P<0.01). Spontaneous defibrillation occurred at least once in 68 of the puppies (78%). In general, spontaneous defibrillation was more likely to occur in hearts weighing less than 9 grams (P<0.01), but the overall correlation of the decreasing defibrillation incidence to increasing weight was weak (SDF %=48.6-0.90 Vwtg, r=0.106). Spontaneous defibrillation was not observed at any age or weight in two litters, totaling 9 puppies.
   These findings suggest that ventricular mass influences the vulnerability of the neonatal dog heart to electrical induction, as well as maintenance of ventricular fibrillation. However, the ability for spontaneous defibrillation is only partially dependent on ventricular mass. Other developmental and genetic factors appear to play an equally important role and require further study.

DE GRAZING SYSTEM; NATIVE RANGE; BEEF CATTLE; STOCKERS; WEIGHT GAIN
ID SEASON
AB A 9-year grazing trial was conducted to compare shortgrass vegetation and steer responses under intensive-early stocking (IES) at 2 stocking rates to season-long stocking (SLS). The stocking rates were (1) equal to SLS, with twice as many steers used for the first half of the SLS grazing season (2X-IES), and (2) greater than SLS, with 3 times as many steers used for the same period (3X-IES). The hypothesis tested was that SLS and 2X-IES would be similar and sustainable in terms of productivity and vegetation composition, whereas 3X-IES would be different and not sustainable. The 3 treatments were assigned to 6 pastures in a randomized-complete block. Grazing was initiated on or near 1 May each year and continued until about 15 July for IES and about 1 October for SLS. Steers were weighted at initiation of grazing and in mid-July, and SLS steers were weighed in October. Vegetation data were collected in July and October in each pasture from 10 randomly located plots. Species composition of grasses was estimated, and grasses and forbs were clipped separately to determine biomass availability. Steer total gain and average daily gain (ADG) under SLS and 2X-IES were equal (P>0.10) during the early season, but 3X-IES gain and ADG were less (P<0.05). Total-season gain was greater under SLS (P<0.05) than either IES treatment, but total-season ADG was equal to that under 2X-IES. Steer production per ha was equal under SLS and 2X-IES, but greater under 3X-IES (P<0.05). Western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii(Rydb.) Love] and buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm.) composition did not change over time under SLS and 2X-IES, but decreased and increased, respectively, under 3X-IES (P<0.05). Blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis (HBK.) Lag. ex Steud.) and annual grasses displayed initial composition differences (P<0.10) among grazing treatments, but not differential composition shifts over time (P>0.10). Grass and total biomass availability were reduced (P<0.10) over time by 3X-IES. The hypothesis was supported: SLS and 2X-IES were equal in terms of both livestock performance and vegetation responses, but livestock performance and biomass availability were reduced and vegetation composition changed under 3X-IES. Thus, 3X-IES was not sustainable. While SLS and 2X-IES appear biologically equal, using them simultaneously on separate land areas may reduce market variability risk by marketing twice per year.

TI SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN MINERAL EXPORTING ECONOMIES
SO RESOURCES POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development requires that consumption by present generations should not be at the expense of future generations. For mineral economies this means substituting an alternative income source for the depleting mineral asset and curbing environmental degradation. But Dutch disease (the negative symbiosis between the mining and other tradable sectors which mutes both the rate and efficiency of economic growth) can subvert both sustainability goals. First, Dutch disease weakens the non-mining tradables sector so that it cannot propel the economy should mining be marginalized. Second, Dutch disease retards economic growth so that investment in environmental management and clean technology is slow and environmental damage is the greater. Sustainable development must therefore overcome Dutch disease and this requires a pragmatic orthodox macroeconomic policy. The latter mutes the damaging impact of fluctuating ore revenues and spurs competitive diversification and economic growth so that new investment and the rapid adoption of environmentally sensitive technology is facilitated.

TI POLICY PERSPECTIVES ON SOCIAL, AGRICULTURAL, AND RURAL SUSTAINABILITY
SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID NONMETROPOLITAN
AB Three types of' agricultural, or sustainability, policy are introduced. One deals with the interests of society, another with the agricultural sector, and the third with rural people and places. Each type serves different purposes, interest groups, and issues. Yet, they share some common ground. Because social, agricultural, and rural objectives are interdependent, we need all three policy types if any is to be effective in a highly specialized society. Agricultural policy often substitutes for rural policy, but this is inadequate. Factors shaping the rural policy context include regionality, the large rural population, the rural situation, lack of rural human resource development, technological displacement, and legislation. The environment, economic change, physical infrastructure, social services, jobs, and the role of land grant universities are issues to be considered in rural policy.

TI THE STRATEGIC ROLE OF QUALITY IN SMALL SIZE FIRMS
SO SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB It is often claimed that, especially in mature industries, European firms can compete against low-cost NICs firms only if they are able to implement quality based strategies. The emphasis on the strategic role of quality, however, often leads to underestimate the extent of organizational and economic efforts, needed to turn quality from a potential opportunity into a real advantage. The lack of a thorough comprehension of the requirements of a quality based strategy can question the effectiveness of the investments some firms plan to improve their quality level. These firms can in fact remain ''stuck in the middle'', if they do not have enough resources to tum quality into a source of sustainable competitive advantage.
   This paper is aimed at a better comprehension of both benefits and costs of a quality based strategy, with regard to a specific class of firms, Small Size Firms (SSFs), where a strategic use of quality is more difficult. The paper is articulated into two parts. Part one discusses the main obstacles facing the adoption of a quality based strategy by SSFs. A dynamic model for the adoption of this strategy over time, aimed at minimizing the risks for SSFs, is also presented.
   Part two describes the results of an empirical research, aimed at verifying the viability of quality based strategies in an industry composed only by SSFs, the shoe-machinery industry. The empirical research supports the viability of the model presented in the first part of the paper.

TI SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS - CHALLENGES FOR
   SOCIAL-WORK
SO SOCIAL WORK
LA English
DT Article
AB The environmental crisis is a major public policy issue influencing prospects for global peace and human development. This article discusses the social, economic, and political components of environmental issues and their foundation in modern economic and scientific values. Native American culture, religious traditions, ecofeminism, and the ecological model of science provide alternative worldviews that support the goal of ecologically sustainable human social structures. The article examines implications of environmental concerns for social work practice and research. Specific examples are included to illustrate the range of linkages. Expanded use of the ecological model of social work practice is proposed as a theoretical foundation from which to develop the social work profession's response to environmental issues.

TI CARRYING-CAPACITY AND THE DEATH OF A CULTURE - A TALE OF 2 AUTOPSIES
SO SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Issues associated with the phrase ''sustainable development'' are clarified by careful analysis of the meaning of carrying capacity. In their impressions of carrying capacity's effects, two explanations for the death of a memorable culture (Easter Island) differed fundamentally. One explanation was captive to a premature notion of a carrying capacity ceiling no population growth could ever penetrate. For the other, population was seen as having grown until it did exceed the maximum sustainable load, thus having inflicted environmental damage that reduced carrying capacity. The former view had to imagine a geological catastrophe to account for the culture's death. In the latter view, it was a case of excessive success proving fatal. A proponent of the latter view regarded Easter Island as a ''preview in microcosm'' of what may be happening globally. As such, the Easter Island experience would have important implications for industrial societies. Comparison of the two autopsies has implications for the social sciences.

AB We reconstruct case histories of siting hazardous manufacturing facilities in India and Thailand by three multinational corporations: Du Pont, Occidental Chemical, and Xerox. The analysis focuses on the interactions of the host country development agenda, corporate culture, and the nature of business arrangements between parent and joint venture partner to explain decisions and tradeoffs during the siting process. The cases provide the foundation for a four-stage model of key determinants of management and regulatory actions in four phases of the facility life cycle. Six themes emerge: parent company preservation of environmental and occupational health management responsibilities; forces leading to responsible corporate behavior; downstream consequences of upstream decisions; key determinants of corporate performance; ''functional equivalency'' in practice; and hidden tradeoffs over the life cycle of the facility.

TI DRAINAGE HISTORY AND LAND-USE PATTERN OF A SWEDISH RIVER SYSTEM - THEIR
   IMPORTANCE FOR UNDERSTANDING NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS LOAD

AB During the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, approximately 300 km2 of lakes and wetlands, representing 29% of the River Kavlingean catchment in Southern Sweden, were drained to make land available for agriculture. Published accounts of nutrient loads from the catchment indicated that until the mid 20th century, factories and urban point sources were the major contributors of both nitrogen and phosphorus. By the middle of the 20th century, the construction of sewage treatment plants had effectively reduced phosphorus pollution. Concurrently, the land drained in the previous century underwent a more intense cultivation, with productivity being maintained by commercial fertilizers. Subsequently, net nutrient loads from agriculture continued to increase, reaching an annual load of 2652 tons total-nitrogen and 70 tons total-phosphorus for the River Kavlingean. Whilst high nutrient leakage from agricultural watersheds may be a problem which is only recently recognized, it had its origins in nearly a hundred years of commonly accepted agricultural policy.
   To assess the importance of agriculture as the major source of nutrients to the River Kavlingean system, three tributary catchment areas, differing in terms of their land use patterns (high, medium and low intensity of agricultural use), were studied and compared with literature figures. Results indicated that agricultural nutrient loss areal coefficients were substantially higher than the literature figures, demonstrating the role of agriculture as source of nutrients to the River Kavlingean system. The agricultural land use policies of the last fifty years were revealed to be most important with regard to this role. Of such land use policies, the cultivation of the last 10-15% of land employed for agricultural use (primarily riparian ecotones) may be of most significance. The literature indicates that intense agricultural use of this final 10-15% may account for a ca. 50% increase in nitrogen loss. This suggests that one solution to the problem of agricultural diffuse pollution may lie in the restoration and sustainable management of riparian ecotones of agricultural streams.

AB Evidence suggests that the boundaries between rivers, floodplain wetlands, and adjacent upland communities are among the most important components of landscapes. In a landscape context, floodplain wetlands and their ecotones are important transition zones between uplands and aquatic ecosystems. Management of wetland patches and ecotones to achieve sustainable ecosystems requires action on a broad scale, giving consideration to all factors affecting wetlands and the drainage basins of which they are a part. In northeastern United States, a struggle to identify new sources of water has focussed attention on the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems.

ID ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOIL DISTURBANCE; CROP-ROTATION;
   INFECTIVITY
AB Spore populations of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi and formation of mycorrhizae in maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) were studied in three farming systems: a conventional maize-soybean rotation and two low-input systems. Spore populations were counted in soil samples obtained at planting and after harvest for two growing seasons. Maize and soybean root systems were sampled for mycorrhizae early in the growing season. Low-input plots tended to have higher populations of spores of VAM fungi than the conventionally farmed plots. Further, the readily identifiable species Gigaspora gigantea (Nicol. & Gerd.) Gerdemann & Trappe, was more numerous in low-input plots (up to 30 spores 50 cm-3 soil) than in conventional plots (0-0.3 spores 50 cm-3 soil), suggesting farming system affected species distribution as well. Colonization of plants in the field did not always reflect VAM fungus spore populations at planting. Greenhouse bioassays showed 2.5-10 fold greater colonization of plants growing in soil from low-input than conventional systems. The results indicate that conventional farming systems yield lower levels of VAM fungi whereas low-input sustainable agriculture, with cover crops planted between cash crops, has greater populations of VAM fungi and potential to utilize the benefits of VA mycorrhizae.

DT Article
DE EROSION CONTROL; SILVOPASTORAL LAND USE; GULLY EROSION; MASS MOVEMENT;
   EVALUATION
AB An investigation of the performance of biological erosion control measures applied to support pastoral land use in Soft rock hill country has yielded information which can be applied in the design of more sustainable, silvopastoral land uses. Vegetation-based treatments, centred particularly on use of fast-growing poplars and willows, have successfully controlled a range of gully erosion and earthflow mass movement problems. Treatments were found to be successful at 63% of earthflow sites, and 42% of gully erosion sites examined, using an evaluation technique known to be conservative. A total of 278 sites were included in the study. Relationships between performance and site and treatment attributes allowed minimum tree configurations to be specified in terms of tree spacing and coverage of erosion landforms. Although further data collection would allow refinement of these minimum specifications, the need for such data depends on the value of tree crop versus pastoral production.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT IN THE HIMALAYAS - AN ECOSYSTEM APPROACH
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The impact of human activities on the Himalayan biogeophysical, socioeconomic and cultural environments has been analyzed. The main man-induced activities which threaten the equilibrium of Himalayan Mountain ecosystems are unplanned land use, cultivation on steep slopes, overgrazing, major engineering activities, overexploitation of village or community forests, shifting cultivation, unplanned tourism and urbanization. Cold desert conditions prevail in 41 692 km2 of the northwestern Himalayas. The geomorphological conditions and arrested succession, checking the climax formation, are major causes of landslides. Sedimentation, changes in surface and groundwater hydrology and clearfelling of broadleaved plant species have caused eutrophication, drying up of natural springs and receding of glaciers. Wild fauna like Musk deer (Moschus mischiferus) and Snow leopard (Panthera uncia) are now under threat due to changes in their habitats. Population pressure, migration and settlements are major causes of poverty and agglomeration, and jeopardize the Himalayan environment. Based on detailed environmental impact assessment, an ecosystem approach has been proposed for resources con-servation and environmentally sustainable development of the Himalayas.

TI PRESERVATION OF SUSTAINABLE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PRESSURE AT INCREASED
   END-EXPIRATORY LUNG-VOLUME
SO AMERICAN REVIEW OF RESPIRATORY DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
ID HUMAN DIAPHRAGM; FATIGUE; LENGTH; CONTRACTION; ENDURANCE
AB Previous studies in isolated muscles have shown that decreases in muscle length reduce the loss of force resulting from fatigue in response to repeated maximal stimulations. However, increases in end-expiratory lung volume (EEV), which presumably decrease the length of the inspiratory muscles, appear to make the inspiratory muscles more susceptible to fatigue. To address this paradox, we studied the influence of changes in EEV on inspiratory muscle fatigue resulting from repeated maximal voluntary inspirations for 15 min in normal humans. Tidal volume and breath timing were constant between runs. Fatigue runs were compared with atmospheric, positive or negative pressures applied to the mouth, sufficient to change EEV by approximately +30% or -20% of inspiratory capacity. Although the maximal initial pressure-time product for the inspiratory muscles (PTmus) was reduced by increased EEV, sustainable PTmus was not significantly affected. In contrast, both initial and sustainable pressure-time products for the diaphragm were reduced at elevated EEV The rate at which the fatigue process developed was also reduced at increased EEV There were no significant effects of decreased EEV on any measured pressures. We conclude that when EEV is elevated, within a moderate range, sustainable inspiratory muscle pressure is preserved. However, the contribution of the diaphragm to inspiratory pressure development during fatigue may be uniquely compromised by increased EEV.

In particular, we find that (i) while primary surplus is stationary, public debt is not, (ii) permanent shocks explain about 90% of forecast error variance of public debt, while playing a minor role in primary surplus and (iii) debt is not sustainable even if stochastic discount rates are accounted for.

DT Article
AB If the functional reliability of raw materials cannot be guaranteed sustainably through maintenance and repair, and if a nuclear power plant is to be operated for its entire useful life, one possibility offering itself is the replacement of the whole steam generator.  Problems may be caused especially by Inconel-600, a material used since 1964.  In the Dampierre-1 nuclear generating unit, which is equipped with a pressurized water, reactor, steam generator replacement has been completed successfully. The reactor manufacturer had to use not only his technical know-how, but also introduce operations management systems, as the work had to be carried out in a radioactive environment.  The operator and the reactor manufacturer developed software programs for simulating potential radiation exposures and monitoring real ones.

AB New data shows that edible fruit and nut production in Amazonian forests is substantially lower than most conservationists assume. Direct measures of production in Amazonian Peru show that two terra firma forest types produced significantly less edible fruit than an alluvial soil forest. Swamp forest produced more edible fruit than any other forest type measured. Palms produce 60% of edible fruit productivity, averaged over three forest types, but the most preferred palm fruits are difficult to harvest because they are borne too high for easy access by collectors. Forest fruit collection in Amazonia is less productive in the short-term than all other food-producing activities except for hunting and cattle ranching. Technological, social and political changes are essential so that sustainable but intrinsically low-yielding extractive activities like fruit collecting become more attractive to Amazonians.

AB In parts of North America and Europe, present and future sedimentary deficits translate into major areal losses of coastal salt marsh. Physically based simulations of medium- to long-term adjustment to accelerated sea-level rise are few, partly due to the difficulty in extrapolating imperfectly understood sedimentation parameters. This paper outlines the implementation and application of a simple one-dimensional mass balance model designed to simulate the vertical adjustment of predominantly minerogenic marsh surfaces to various combinations of sediment supply, tidal levels and regional subsidence. Two aspects of marsh growth are examined, with reference to sites on the macro-tidal north Norfolk coast, U.K.: (i) historical marsh growth under a scenario of effective (long-term) eustatic stability but slow regional subsidence; and (ii) marsh response to various non-linear eustatic rise scenarios for the next century. In contrast to more organogenic North American marshes, sedimentation rates in Norfolk are strongly time-dependent. Where the overall sediment budget is so closely linked to marsh age and relative elevation, some form of numerical simulation offers a preferred means of predicting the impact of accelerated sea-level rise. Simulations performed here show that only the most dramatic eustatic scenarios result in ecological 'drowning' and reversion to tidal flat within the conventional 2100 prediction interval. Currently favoured scenarios give rise to accretionary deficits which are clearly sustainable in the short-term, albeit at the expense of increased inundation frequency and consequent changes in the distribution of marsh flora and fauna.

AB Compensatory plant growth may be a significant ecological process that minimizes the reduction of primary production in direct proportion to the severity of defoliation in some species and systems given the appropriate combination of environmental variables. However, the potential benefits of compensatory growth should not obscure the well-established ecological processes governing the sustainability of grazed systems in the face of large scale environmental degradation and a rapidly expanding human population. The sustainability of grazed systems is a more fundamental issue than grazing optimization.

AB There has been a tendency for ecologists to present results from ecological studies and then be critical of resource managers because the best available scientific information was not incorporated into decisions about natural resources. This unfortunate situation must be remedied by ecologists, who should explicitly consider the ways in which results can be applied to management issues. Ecologists and resource managers should collaborate to establish the topical framework in which concepts such as growth compensation/overcompensation should be considered. Finally, under presettlement conditions, the tallgrass prairie probably produced overcompensation under lightly to moderately grazed conditions.

AB Pesticide use in the United States is concentrated in the Com Belt, mainly in the form of herbicides on com (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max). If this chemical load to the environment is to be reduced, without appreciably affecting crop yields, an intimate understanding of weed ecology is necessary. For annual weeds in the U.S. Corn Belt, critical ecological information includes seedbank density, seed dormancy, seedling emergence, and environmental variables that regulate these factors. For three weeds (Setaria spp., Amaranthus retroflexus, and Chenopodium album) in Minnesota, this information is summarized, and its application to weed management is illustrated.
   If weed seedbank densities (0-10 cm depth) are < 1 00 seeds/m2 prior to spring tillage operations, subsequent seedling populations are too low (<40 seedlings/m2) to require control. Seedbanks ranging from 100-1000 seeds/m2 produce seedling populations (<400 Seedlings/m2) that can be controlled mechanically. In contrast, pre-tillage seedbanks > 1 000 seeds/m2 typically result in such high seedling populations that nonchemical control measures alone cannot prevent large crop yield losses. About one-half of all arable fields harbor seedbanks with densities > 1000 seeds/m2.
   The proportion of buried seeds giving rise to seedlings is controlled by seed dormancy, which in turn is governed partially by April temperatures (in Minnesota), whereas the timing of subsequent seedling emergence is determined by soil temperature and soil water. EMERG models simulate daily percentages of emerging weed seedlings for April through June, when most Com Belt crops are sown. If seedbeds of fields with potential seedling densities of 100 seedlings/m2 are prepared and sown when simulated emergence exceeds almost-equal-to 80% for C album, 85% for A. retroflexus, and 99% for Setaria spp., then mechanical weed control sufficiently reduces weed populations and crop yield losses are negligible. Accordingly, mechanical weed control may be substituted economically for chemical control, but only when accompanied by adequate understanding of the ecology of pertinent weed species.

TI VALUE STANDARDS IN SUB-SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - ON LIMITS OF ECOLOGICAL
   ECONOMICS
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development is hard to conceptualize as an economic problem, and ''an economic problem'' is also ambiguous. Thus, there is room for several kinds of ecological economics. This paper analyses different ways of relating ecological and economical thinking to each other, and how expertise in these fields relates to politics. Available methods are delimited in scope, where some are suitable for the analysis of sustainable development and others are not. It is concluded that the promotion of sustainable development as a basic value assumes an explicit value strategy. It is argued that neoclassical economics, for example cost benefit analysis, is suitable for analysis of sustainable development only as a special case, and alternatives are at hand for other cases. To illustrate a non-neoclassical analysis, an empirical investigation using the sustainable development records approach is briefly reported upon.

TI ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND PROJECT APPRAISAL IN
   DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This article examines how the concept of ecological sustainability may affect project appraisal for developing countries. It is argued that three criteria should be applied, viz. efficiency, equity and ecological sustainability. Operationalization of the sustainability criterion requires that policy-makers set targets for natural resource use. Moreover, they need to address new trade-offs, for instance between short-term income objectives (efficiency) and long-term environmental objectives (sustainability). The new issues raised by the sustainability criterion require a review of the applicability of project appraisal methods. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) has been used most frequently, but its usefulness in sustainability-oriented project appraisal is shown to be limited. Despite some methodological problems, multi-criteria analysis (MCA) should be regarded as an appropriate alternative or complementary appraisal tool. MCA does not require monetarization of effects, nor does it exclusively focus on efficiency measurement. These advantages apply particularly to developing countries where the data base is weak, economic activities are directly dependent on natural resources, and distribution concerns are strong. MCA may be applied to, inter alia, the estimation of scores on the sustainability criterion, and to the integrated evaluation of scores on the three key criteria.

AB It is well known that Chins has generated 100 million jobs/self-employments in the SSI sector, most of which are really at the lower level of the SSI (i.e., the Tiny Sector) and mostly in agriculture and other rural businesses. This paper analyses the classifications within SSI spectrum in India, the results in terms of employment generation and the policy implications. It ends by recommending six new strategies necessary for sustainable employment generation in India through very small-scale industry promotion.

TI AID DONOR POLICIES AND POWER SECTOR PERFORMANCE IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE ELECTRICITY; FINANCE; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB This paper reviews the literature on the policies of aid donors towards the performance of the electricity sector in developing countries. Much of the donor community is currently reassessing its policies in the light of shifting priorities and the difficulties of ensuring the sustainability of individual power sector investments within a difficult macroeconomic environment. Particular attention is given to examining the policies of the World Bank. In addition to being the major source of finance for power sector development in the Third World, the World Bank in effect sets the intellectual agenda for thinking about power sector development and is also the most sustained contributor to that agenda. The paper describes changes in donor policy from an emphasis on individual capital projects to a concern with the performance of the whole sector. It examines how the policy agenda is influenced by competing explanations for the current decline in the performance of many power utilities, and how the current emphasis on efficiency is influenced by  the current need to respond to acute capital shortages, and the growing concern with environmental issues. The paper concludes with a discussion of a new focus for aid policies that fully recognizes the role of the power sector in the wider economy, and which stresses the development of local human capabilities over the long term, rather than the short-term expedients of the project cycle which emphasizes the short term, the sale of hardware, and the use of expatriate staff.

TI OPERATIONAL PLANNING - THE DALL RIVER AND RESCUE OF ITS SPORT FISHERY
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Since 1985, the Division of Sport Fish, a unit of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, has had a policy of operational planning to improve the management of Alaska's recreational fisheries through the practice of better science. The purpose of this policy is not to identify the needs of fisheries management, but to insure that information gathered to meet those needs is obtained accurately and at minimal cost. Specific objectives of research are tailored to the perceived requirements of fisheries management, risks of error in judgment are calculated as functions of sample sizes, and sample sizes are expressed as functions of budgets. Operational planning is also used to recognize assumptions inherent in sampling and experimental designs and to avoid the consequences of their violation. In 1987, the sport fishery for northern pike, Esox lucius, on the Dall River, Alaska, was threatened with closure because of a lack of information on sustainable yield. Planning for the 2-year research project instigated in 1988 to obtain this information serves as an example of the implementation of our policy of operational planning.

TI INTEGRATED RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT IN BOREAL FOREST ECOSYSTEMS - IMPEDIMENTS

DT Article
AB The goals of integrated resource management in boreal forests are sustainable production of commercial forest products and conservation of biodiversity. An appropriate approach to achievement of both goals is through maintenance of ecosystem types at the landscape level. Conservation of wildlife (defined as all organisms) through holistic ecosystem management is a relatively new discipline in Canada. Ecosystem management causes certain problems for agencies attempting to pursue these goals resulting from: poor autecological knowledge, conflict of habitat requirements with timber harvesting goals, legacy of past forest management, lack of management regimes, and few techniques that are applicable at the ecosystem level. Steps toward a more integrated approach to forest resource management include: recognition of institutional short-comings, development of predictive models using a common language for foresters and wildlife managers, re-tooling with GIS technology and decision support systems, and development of habitat models to be used within landscape-scale management plans.

TI FEMINISTS IN THE RAIN-FOREST IN MEXICO
SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB Government policy in Mexico has borne heavily on rural areas, and particularly on women. This article examines the present plight of women in new land settlements in the Mexican rainforests, comparing the problems they themselves identify with those apparent in the world literature on land settlement; comparisons are also made with the Colombian experience. Four pioneer localities in Mexico are described, and from an assessment of one of them it is argued that options are as much constrained by skills as by access to capital. To the incomer, sustainability defines the attractive economic options; to the women, any source of increased income is welcome, however exploitative and insecure. To the incomer, it is apparent that the 'grass revolution' and government policy together require these women to rethink their lives. To the women, all this appears surmountable, while the real problems are those of domestic violence, marital rape and male alcoholism: one woman's voice is represented at length. Who, it is asked, defines a research agenda in the search for a solution to the problems of these localities? What coalition can there be between the centralised knowledge of the vast land settlement literature, the academic visiting these localities and those who are ''living this whole thing''?

AB Focusing on specific agricultural policies carried out under structural adjustment programs in sub-Saharan Africa, this paper examines, at the conceptual level, how such policies may exacerbate environmental, and specifically soil, deterioration. Drawing on theories of political economy, it is argued that there is sufficient evidence, first, to link increased stress on women farmers who have significant responsibility for management of the land and household reproduction with a tendency towards unsustainable exploitation of the resource base, and, second, to emphasize the urgency of locating the environment and gender centrally in an analysis of the impact of macro-economic policies. In essence, this paper suggests that the implementation of structural adjustment policies frequently increases the emerging contradiction between land use management for agricultural production to ensure survival and the long-term sustainability of the resource base.

But the term has quite different meanings to different audiences: The ''Southern'' tradition is committed to community transformation through empowering disenfranchised groups; the ''Northern'' tradition is concerned with reforming organizations through problem-solving. This paper describes a series of collective reflections that brought together leaders of development agencies from Southern and Northern settings to consider the roles of nongovernmental development organizations (NGOs) in promoting sustainable development. The results of these reflections, in terms of new knowledge and new action strategies, are illustrated. Critical processes for such collective reflection, including the management of value and ideological differences, the definition of participation, and the organization of joint inquiry are discussed. The paper also discusses the implications of such reflections for re-defining the social realities of key actors in the development drama, and so catalyzing major changes in development theory and action through relatively small interventions.

AB Using a system of phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol vesicles to model the vesicle phase of mammalian bile (1:1 molar ratio) we evaluated whether very small amounts of C. perfringens phospholipase C activity (0.5-6.5 nmol/min per ml) could lead to vesicle fusion, a precursor step for cholesterol precipitation in gallbladder bile. Quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy (QLS) was used to monitor vesicle growth and aggregation in model bile (0.89 mm total lipid) in the presence of phospholipase C. Vesicle growth over 2 h could be detected with phospholipase activity as little as 0.5 nmol/min per ml. Vesicle growth was sustainable over days in the absence of Ca2+ once as little as 3-7 mol% diacylglycerol had been generated as a result of the initial phospholipase C treatment. The presence of fusion intermediates was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy. In addition, kinetically slow vesicle fusion with intravesicle content mixing and minimal leakage was also confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy using two populations of vesicles containing 5 mm TbCl3 or 50 mm dipicolinic acid. Efficient fusion (40% maximum fluorescence) was obtained at 30 min at 25-degrees-C with phospholipase C activity. This level of enzyme activity approximates that found in human gallbladder bile (1.2 nmol/min per ml). We conclude that the hydrolysis products of phospholipase C activity can, in very small amounts (3-7 mol% diacylglycerol), lead to destabilization and fusion of cholesterol-saturated biliary vesicles. A reappraisal of the importance of phospholipase C hydrolysis products in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones is warranted based on these observations.

TI MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR OF POLYPROPYLENE PIPES AFTER THE MULTIPLE-PASS
   FLOW-FORMING PROCESS
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Flow-forming, which is known also as tube spinning or shear forming, is a cold forming, rotary-point extrusion process. Recent research publications on polypropylene have shown that the mechanical properties: yield strength, tensile strength, tensile modulus and sustainable hoop stress; are improved with increasing percentage of thickness reduction. The present research investigates the possibility to further upgrade the properties of the material by multiple-pass flow-forming instead of single-pass flow-forming. In the investigation, polypropylene pipes were flow-formed in a single pass, two passes, three passes or four passes on a conventional lathe using a twin-rollers system. To evaluate the mechanical properties of the material, the specimens were subjected to the hydrostatic pressure test, and to hardness and tensile tests.
   The hydrostatic pressure test shows that both hardness and hoop-stress data increase with the number of passes of flow-forming. Observation on the pipe rupture reveals that there are a few macroscopic layers radially across the pipe wall and the rupture gradually transforms from a ductile to brittle nature when the number of passes increases, which suggests that the internal and external surfaces of the polypropylene are more compressive and anisotropic when compared with the interior of the material.
   The tensile yield behaviour of the material was studied using a Shimadzu Universal Testing Machine. It was found that generally the yield stress and ultimate stress decrease with the number of passes of flow-forming. A reasonable explanation is that when the number of passes increases, the external pipe surface which was flow-formed, and so anisotropic, will offer greater resistance to successive flow-forming passes. This renders even greater nonuniformity in the material texture in that the outer layers are becoming more orientated, hence the yielding process occurs inhomogeneously and the material fails prematurely. Another factor that causes deterioration in the material property is chain polymer scission.

AB In this paper we characterize the Pareto-optimal set of non-linear pricing schedules when non-negative weights are assigned to each customer type. Our analysis first compares general non-linear tariff schedules and sets of self-selecting two-part tariffs, when there are two customer types and the cost function is linear. We then derive optimal sets of two-part tariffs for arbitrary numbers of customer types and general cost functions. We also consider the sustainability of non-linear pricing schedules under the threat of entry of rival firms.

TI DRY ETCHING OF SINGLE-CRYSTAL SILICON TRENCH IN HYDROGEN IODIDE

LA English
DT Article
ID CAPACITOR CELL; CHEMISTRY; CHLORINE; BROMINE; DAMAGE; DRAM; SI
AB Hydrogen iodide (HI) has been introduced for plasma etching of single-crystal silicon trench. For part I of this work, pure HI chemistry has been investigated. HI forms an intensive, easily ignitable, and sustainable plasma, characterized by a very low self-bias voltage, typically less than - 80 V. The etching of silicon is only successful in the pressure range below 12 Pa. A suitable RF power range is from 150 to 300 W with an HI flow from 10 to 70 sccm. In these parameter ranges etch rates up to 400 rim/min can be obtained. The selectivity to the mask SiO2 varies in the range from 30 to more than 150:1. The etch profile is tapered with a slope of 60 to 89-degrees. In practical use we did not encounter any problems with the handling of HI or with contamination of the chamber and the pumps.

AB Supplementation with forage legumes could be a sustainable way of improving the feeding value of poor quality crop residues especially to the resource poor African smallholders. Thus, the potential of Desmodium intortum, Macrotyloma axillare and Stylosanthes guianensis in improving the utilization of a basal diet of maize stover by sheep was assessed in a feeding trial. Maize stover used in this experiment was high in lignocellulosic cell-wall constituents and very low in CP. S. guianensis hay contained higher CP and lower NDF, ADF, and lignin contents than D. intortum and M. axillare hays.
   According to animal responses, under the conditions of this experiment, S. guianensis was superior to the other two legumes in improving the feeding value to sheep of maize stover based diets. M. axillare was found to be inferior. In general, 250 g of S. guianensis and 350 g of D. intortum hays per day per sheep (18.2 kg Lwt +/- 1.2) were found to be optimum levels of supplementation to maize stover. At these levels of supplementation modest levels of bodyweight gain were achieved. It is suggested that the two legumes are useful to bridge the gap in feed supply in areas where livestock depend on poor quality crop residues during the dry season.

TI THE UNSUSTAINABLE FLOW OF HIMALAYAN FIR TIMBER
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID NEPAL; CONSERVATION; VEGETATION; FORESTS
AB The sustainability of Himalayan fir (Abies spectabilis) timber production in Nepalese village forests was analyzed by focusing on the availability of fir timber at village level. The availability was determined by the natural processes of change and by current utilization and management practices. Analysis of the natural processes of change started with an assessment of the internal dynamics of the fir forest. It revealed that regeneration was inhibited by the fir litter and this resulted in even-aged patches. Furthermore, large-scale rare destructive events were shown to have an important role in synchronizing regeneration. A combination of these natural processes results in periodic changes whereby a phase dominated by mature forest without regeneration is followed by complete destruction and fir regeneration. Thus, under natural conditions the flow of fir timber is not sustainable during all phases of this cycle.
   This natural unsustainability is increased by several forest utilization practices: the oldest firs are selectively logged for shingle production; the young firs are harvested for pole production; fir regeneration is prevented by the accumulation of the litter layer, by grazing, and/or by the lopping of rhododendrons for fuelwood. All these practices, by their impact on fir regeneration, contribute to a decrease of the already naturally restricted possibilities for a sustainable flow of timber from the forest to the village society. To improve this sustainability alternative management options (based on ecological aspects only) have been proposed.

AB Grass fallow shifting cultivation is an important land use practice in the highlands of Bhutan. Part of the nutrient pool contained in soil organic matter is made available for the traditional buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) crop through a highly labor intensive system exposing 250-500 MT soil ha-1 to temperatures of 500-degrees-C and above. Dry topsoil is collected in mounds and burned using plant biomass or manure and soil organic matter as fuel. Labor input ranged from 150-401 days ha-1 with land preparation accounting for 65-85% of the total requirement. The burning increased soil pH from 6.0 to 6.9 and available K from 34 to 69 mg kg-1. Soil organic C and total N were reduced from 3.3 and 0. 17% to 0.8 and 0.08%, respectively. Release of P from soil organic matter and plant material and reduction in C/N ratio resulting in increased N availability are considered the most essential effects required for good crop yields. Through the burning about 16 MT of C and 470 kg N ha-1 are released into the atmosphere. Fallow periods of 15-20 years are required for the system to be sustainable.

AB Anthelmintics will continue to play a central role in nematode control programs of livestock for the foreseeable future. However, to prevent the emergence of resistance, anthelmintics need to be either so effective that there are no survivors following treatment or treatment should be so infrequent that those that survive make little or no contribution to subsequent generations of the parasite populations. In this regard, the record for the sheep, horse and particularly the goat industry is not good, whereas the second factor is almost certainly responsible for the lack of a significant resistance problem in the cattle industry.
   In Australia, where high levels of resistance prevail, control programs designed to limit the increase and spread of resistance have been promoted for some time. However, their development, and certainly their implementation, has tended to be reactive rather than proactive - attempting to deal with the problem when it threatens future productivity, rather than preventing it in the first instance. Regions and/or livestock industries with relatively less of a resistance problem should heed these developments and endeavour to establish a responsible ethos amongst users of anthelmintics.
   In concert with the general philosophy of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), parasite control schemes should focus on the planned integration of a range of techniques, rather than relying almost entirely on anthelmintics. By these means, sustainable control strategies to prevent resistance could be achieved.

AB The paper discusses problems of project appraisal for small island less-developed nations taking account of alternative approaches to assessment, knowledge problems, shortages of indigenous analytical skills in evaluation, and motivational issues. This raises the question of the value of natural environments of small island countries to the rest of the world. The view is rejected that the environments of small island countries are relatively unimportant to the rest of the world. Sustainability considerations have become important in project appraisal and development planning. Project appraisal is discussed with particular reference to small island economies taking account of alternative concepts of sustainable development and the method suggested by Pearce and others to integrate sustainability into cost-benefit analysis. Responses of aid organizations, such as AIDAB, to this new emphasis on sustainable development are discussed. Some projects of particular relevance to small island nations are examined from the point of view of their environmental sustainability. These include motorization of fishing boats in the Maldives, the mariculture of giant clams in the Pacific and tourist developments.

AB The paper discusses the concept of ''sustainability'' and puts forward the argument that conventional notions of what constitutes economic development cannot be applied mechanistically to the very small island economies of the Pacific. In practice, what matters is whether the entitlement of island communities to rent incomes remains sustainable. This in turn requires that labor access to the modern capitalist economics of the region continues or is opened up and that the major regional powers continue to subsidize consumption levels in the small island countries unless or until those countries achieve a satisfactory level of rent income. Both of these conditions hinge upon the long-run political commitment of aid-donor governments to the welfare of island communities and on the skills of island politicians and officials in negotiating and maneuvering for access to aid funds from competing donors.

TI SHIFTING CULTIVATION AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN EAST MALAYSIA - A
   LONGITUDINAL CASE-STUDY

LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the sustainability of shifting cultivation in Sarawak, East Malaysia, through a case study of the responses of two villages to demographic and economic forces during the period from 1979-80 to 1988-89. It is concluded that the farming system of which shifting cultivation is a part (which includes perennial cash crops) is sustainable in two senses: it is resilient to exogenous disturbances; it exhibits a non-negative trend in output. Shifting cultivation makes an important contribution to the overall stability and sustainability of the farming system and should be evaluated on this basis.

ID MODELS; GROWTH; UNCERTAINTY
AB There is a growing interest in cultivating cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) in the tropics to meet the protein requirements of small farmers, forage requirements of ruminants, and to attain more sustainable agricultural systems. A mechanistic crop growth model was used to estimate yields of partially irrigated and strictly rainfed crops of IT82D-889, an early maturing cowpea cultivar, and TVX1948-012F, a medium maturing cowpea cultivar. Average yield and yield stability of these cultivars were determined for fields with a shallow and a deep water table before and after the growth of rice (Oryza sativa) in various parts of the Philippines. Long-term simulation results indicated that the yield of TVX1948-012F varied from 100 to 2250 kg ha-1, and that of IT82D-889 varied from 50 to 1600 kg ha-1 for fields with a shallow water table and for partially irrigated conditions. Yields were greater for the post-rice than for the pre-rice season. Partial irrigation increased long-term biomass compared with those for strictly rainfed situations by 30% in the pre-rice season and by 104% in the post-rice season. Yields were more stable at Davao than at Los Banos or Iloilo. The two maturity classes of cowpea cultivars appear to have somewhat different extrapolation domains. The study demonstrates that mechanistic simulation modelling can be a useful tool to delineate the extrapolation domains of crops and cultivars.

AB This work deals with-the experimental management of secondary succession in a tropical forest region in Uxpanapa, Veracruz, Mexico. The goal is to establish a system of 'diversifield units', which will maintain production and biodiversity while obtaining valuable products, primarily for self-sufficiency, and secondarily as cash crops. Three different diversifield units of production have been identified: a) the traditional 'milpa', maize polyculture, b) the diversified home orchard and c) the enriched fallows. These units were established in three secondary forests areas, where once thinned or cleared, valuable annual and perennial species were introduced.
   Total biomass and product yields were analyzed, also labour invested on each production unit was recorded, units were compared on an efficiency basis. Maize yield of polyculture is low but total production is more than twice that of maize monoculture. Efficiency in the polyculture is also higher and its weeds were better controlled. After three years the 'milpa' has become an orchard with more than 150 individual fruit trees belonging to 10 different species. Enriched secondary forests show the highest biomass production in the open treatment, 68% transmittance, and the highest survivorship in the moderate shade treatment, 37%. Schizolobium parahybum and Cordia alliodora were the most successful forest species due to their fast growth.

AB Abundance and body size variations of the prawn Macrobrachium amazonicum (HELLER, 1862) have been studied in a Central Amazonian floodplain lake, on Careiro Island. The highest number of captures and smallest sizes have been observed beneath floating macrophyte meadows. This suggests that these meadows serve a nursery habitats. The densities registered in the Amazon river were three times lower than in the lake. Maximum densities were recorded during low-water periods, while minimum densities were found during high water periods. These results point to a relationship between current force and catchability. In the floodplain lake, prawn abundance seems to be related to macrophyte expansion during the periods of rising water; the lowest captures were registered at high water, which is probably due to the spatial dispersion as the water volume increases. River prawn populations are characterized by larger sizes than the ones in the lake. They show a well-marked pattern of seasonal variation in size, with larger sizes found during periods of rising water and smaller sizes predominating during high-water periods. On the contrary, lagoonal prawns show maximum sizes during high-water, and smallest sizes during low-water periods.
   Despite its good fishing potential (up to 200 g/trap), the native prawn is not exploited in the Amazonas, but imported from the State of Para. Artesanal prawn fishing in floodplain lakes, or extensive culture in ponds for carnivorous fish or human consumption, can be a commercially lucrative activity for sustainable regional economic development.

AB North American hylid frogs exhibit patterns of locomotor energetics that are generally similar to those found among most terrestrial vertebrates: steady-state rate of oxygen consumption (VO2ss) increases within a range of sustainable speeds, above which VO2ss becomes independent of speed and endurance decreases. Among hylid anurans, species differences in the capacity to sustain locomotion are related to the interaction of locomotor cost and the maximal capacity for aerobic energy production during exercise. Hence, analyses of metabolic correlates of behavioral activity should incorporate estimates of economy (C(min)) as well as capacity (VO2ex). Phylogenetic analyses using independent contrast algorithms indicate that resting and maximal rates of metabolism are positively correlated, even when the confounding effects of body size and phylogeny are removed. Inferred evolutionary changes in metabolic rate proceeded from low rates in neotropical ancestors to higher rates among descendant species in temperate habitats. Adaptation to facilitate activity at low temperatures may have been responsible for this evolutionary shift. These findings support the ''aerobic capacity'' hypothesis for the evolution of metabolic rate in which evolutionary increases in metabolic rate are brought about by natural selection favoring increased abilities for sustained activity.

AB Benthic marine invertebrates with planktonic larvae may exhibit Allee effects in reproduction or recruitment. Hydrodynamic considerations and experimental evidence suggest that species broadcasting gametes suffer greatly reduced fertilization efficiencies as densities decline. There is also evidence for some species, including the red sea urchin, that post-dispersal recruitment success declines at low densities of adults, if adults provide shelter from predators or other sources of mortality. Species displaying strong Allee effects may be susceptible to catastrophic population collapses with slight increases in mortality due to harvesting or natural causes. A simple two patch logistic model suggests that the establishment of a harvest refuge is necessary to prevent collapses and maintain sustainable catches at high levels of harvesting effort. A more detailed, age structured model based on the biology of the red sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus produces similar results. Effects of harvesting strategies are sensitive to Allee effects caused by both fertilization efficiency and the disruption of adult spine canopies. Theoretical requirements for the size and spacing of marine reserves depends upon the dispersal abilities of the target species. Multiple reserves, spaced more closely than the average larval dispersal distance, appear to be an effective and conservative strategy for maintaining healthy populations and sustainable levels of harvest.

AB In the absence of a positive agreement on the use of nuclear power mankind will not be able to live in peace. Viability is endangered by worldwide battles for energy. In the long term, the peaceful utilization of nuclear power must be given priority because the reserves of fossil energy resources will have been consumed in a few generations' time and renewable energy sources do not produce a yield high enough to meet the demand for energy of a continuously increasing world population. Creativity and captial must ensure sufficient and sustainable supplies of energy and goods for everybody. Environmental protection is facilitated by the use of nuclear power, for nuclear power is a source of energy whose waste can be removed from the biosphere completely and safely.

ID GROWTH
AB On a representative farm in southern Australia, the efficiency of beef production might be improved 1.8-fold through changes in management practices and adoption of new techniques to induce twinning and to regulate the sex of calves born. Twenty-six modelled production systems were examined. Two of the three most efficient systems (kg meat per unit feed energy) produced crossbred calves, used twinning to produce more calves and sold them at yearling (18 months) rather than weaner (7 months) age. The other most efficient system was a single-sex all-female production system.
   Profit was calculated for each production system using a gross margins analysis (that is, total income minus variable costs). This, with the pattern of feed supply, feed consumption and labour use for each production system, was used in a linear programming model of a 'representative farm' to determine the optimum (most profitable) beef production system. Two of the three most efficient production systems were also the most profitable, being more than twice as profitable as the simplest traditional systems. The high cost of producing single-sex calves in the all-female system made it, and other systems using sex-control, unprofitable.
   Cows in systems with high net returns were very productive, had a high efficiency of lean meat production, but also a high feed requirement which forced a reduction in the optimum (most profitable) number of cows for the representative farm. Good management and attention to feed supply will be essential for these more profitable systems to be sustainable.

AB Native pastures dominated by Heteropogon contortus (speargrass) were sown to Stylosanthes hamata cv. Verano in 1972, and herbage production and steer growth rates were compared with those of native pastures from 1973 to 1985. The native pastures also contained naturalised Stylosanthes humilis, but its contribution to pasture yield diminished rapidly, after infection by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (anthracnose) in 1973. The experiment was a factorial design of 2 pasture types (native, native plus Verano) x 2 stocking rates (0.6, 1.2 steers/ha) x 2 superphosphate treatments (nil, 300 kg/ba.year) x 2 replicates.
   Fertiliser application decreased the proportion of legume but had no significant effect on herbage or animal production on this comparatively fertile site (extractable P, 18 mg/kg). Annual liveweight gains at the high and low stocking rates, respectively, on the native pasture averaged 100 and 120 kg/steer. Sowing to Verano did not affect herbage yields but increased annual liveweight gains by 28 and 36 kg/steer at low and hi-h stocking rates.
   The high stocking rate of 1.2 steers/ha was sustainable for the first 9 years of the experiment, when above-average rainfall was received. However, in the following 3 below-average years, there was a shift to less-desirable species, and a decline in pasture productivity. Relative to the low stocking rate, herbage production on the native pasture in the final season was reduced by 60% and on the Verano pasture by 26%. The highest annual herbage utilisation rate that appeared sustainable in the long term was about 45%, which corresponded to a utilisation rate of 30% during the growing season (about November-May).
   When oversown with Verano, speargrass tended to decline in favour of annual grasses, weeds, and the introduced grass Urochloa mosambicensis, which had been sown on an adjacent experiment. Urochloa appeared to be a more suitable companion species than speargrass for Verano.

AB In situ mini-lysimeters with ion exchange resin traps were used to measure the effect of dung and urine return on pasture growth and pasture uptake and leaching losses of sulfur (S), nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) in hill pastures grazed by sheep.
   Single dung or urine events in winter boosted pasture production by 37% and pasture uptake of S, N and K by up to 35%, 55% and 57%, respectively, during the following year. Whereas the late summer single superphosphate application increased late spring and mid summer pasture growth of the following year only, dung or urine return increased pasture growth in every season of the following year. Despite the addition of 11.5, 4.7 and 376 kg of readily available S, N and K ha-1 in a single dung event and 14.5, 28.5 and 146 kg of S, N and K ha-1 in a urine event, accelerated leaching of S, N and K did not occur from dung or urine affected soil. Less than 3 kg S, 0.5 kg N and 2 kg K ha-1 were lost by leaching from dung or urine affected soil. The majority of S, N and K from excreta remained in the soil, either immobilized in soil organic matter and/or adsorbed on to soil sesquioxide surfaces and cation exchange sites with the equivalent of only 1.6% of S, 4.4% of N and 9.0% of K from dung and 29% of S, 18.7% of N and 31% of K from urine being recovered in increased pasture uptake over a period of one year. Under the climatic conditions that prevailed after the winter deposition of excreta, immediate loss of excreta-derived nutrients was negligible but urine deposition markedly accelerated the leaching losses of native soil calcium and magnesium (8 kg Ca and 2.9 kg Mg ha-1 from urine and 6.4 kg Ca and 2.4 kg Mg from dung, respectively). Quantitative information of this kind is important for determining the long-term sustainability of soil fertility in grazed pastures before a comprehensive understanding of pasture nutrient cycles is complete.

AB Shoulder, mid-, and foot-slope profiles from two representative soil toposequences developed on siliceous mudstone, on steep land under cut-over forest and scrub, were described morphologically and analysed for selected chemical, physical and mineralogical properties, principally to determine the constraints to long-term sustainable pastoral production. The soils are low in both available phosphorus and sulfur, but the chief constraint appears to be high subsoil acidity giving rise to toxic levels of exchangeable Al. This is presumed to restrict root growth and N-fixing ability of the mixed grass/clover pastures, thereby severely limiting production through frequent and prolonged summer droughts.
   According to the revised N.Z. Soil Classification System, five of the six profiles are Brown Soils, and one shoulder profile is a Recent Soil. Close associations with Pallic Soils were noted in down-profile changes in Ca/Mg ratios and relatively high exchangeable Na levels. Following Soil Taxonomy, five of the profiles were classified as Dystrochrepts and one as a Fragiochrept. These classifications indicate site stability for soil formation under the indigenous vegetation cover. Adjoining steep sites under pasture are prone to erosion, however. Soil analytical results indicate that extensive erosion is not necessarily a prerequisite for problems with pastoral production in the region.

AB The productivity of irrigated agriculture in Australia is low for most crops and one important factor is the physical and chemical constraints caused by sodicity in the rootzone. Over 80% of the irrigated soils are sodic and have degraded structure limiting water and gas transport and root growth. Irrigation, without appropriate drainage, leads to the buildup of salts in soil solutions with increased sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and can develop perched watertables due to a very low leaching fraction of the soil layers exacerbated by sodicity. Therefore, irrigation management in Australia is closely linked with the management of soil sodicity.
   The inevitable consequence of continued irrigation of crops and pastures with saline-sodic water without careful management is the further sodification of soil layers and concentration of salt in the rootzone. This will increase the possibility of dissolving toxic elements from soil minerals. The yields of crops can be far below the potential yields determined by climate. The cost of continued use of amendments and fertilizers to maintain normal yields will increase under saline-sodic irrigation.
   Most of the irrigated soils in Australia need reclamation of sodicity of soil layers at least in the rootzone. The management of these sodic soils involves the application of gypsum, suitable tillage and the maintenance of structure by the buildup of organic matter and biological activity aver time. Then artificial drainage, an essential component of the management of irrigated sodic soils, is possible. By following these soil management practices, irrigated agriculture in Australia will become sustainable with increased yields and high economic returns.

TI NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SODIC SOILS - SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Sodic soils cover over 28% of the total land area in Australia. It is clear from the papers delivered at the conference and workshop that sodic soils are beset with serious chemical, physical and nutritional problems. This report summarises these problems based on the discussions during the workshop sessions together with issues raised during group discussion on: (a) distribution, classification and mapping, (b) physical processes, (c) chemical processes, (d) nutrient constraints, (e) biology and organic matter, (f) environmental consequences and (g) management strategies for economically sustainable crop production on sodic soils. The most serious problems raised during the meeting concern inappropriate definition of sodic soils, soil water balance, nutritional requirements on sodic soils, chemical and mineralogical bases of structural instability in relation to amelioration strategies, farming systems to improve organic matter and biological activity, and information transfer. These issues are presented in detail.

   DENSITY; CARABIDAE; EXPERIMENTS
AB Experiments were carried out with Laboulbenia slackensis Cepede and Picard, an ectoparasitic fungus of Pogonus chalceus (Marsham) (Coleoptera, Carabidae). Infested beetles were kept at three population density levels. Thalli develop within three weeks. They have a life-span of at most ten weeks. Spore transmission is achieved mainly by direct contact between hosts. Auto-infection and probably substrate-infection are, under the studied conditions, of minor importance. The sustainability of the fungus population accounts on a minimal host population density. We assume that host population density and infection-size are directly proportional. Paired beetles with unequal initial infection-sizes show a different growth of their individual parasite population This differential growth is caused by cross-infection and reduces the relative difference in infection-size between cohabitants. A quantitative method was used to determine the infection-size of a Laboulbeniales population on its host.

AB Although nitrogen is considered to be the nutrient that most commonly limits production of natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems, I propose that phosphorus may regulate productivity in many continuously cultivated agroecosystems that do not receive applications of synthetic fertilizers. One way P may limit agroecosystem productivity is by controlling nitrogen fixation of legume crops, thus affecting nitrogen availability in the overall agroecosystem. I tested this hypothesis in two studies by examining the effect of phosphorus nutrition on nitrogen fixation of alfalfa in traditional Mexican agroecosystems. All farms used in the research relied on alfalfa as the primary nitrogen source for maize cultivation and other crops, and had minimal or no reliance on synthetic fertilizers.
   In one study, I used the natural abundance of N-15 to estimate nitrogen fixation in five alfalfa plots with soils representing a wide range of P fertility. I found a correlation of r = 0.85 between foliage P concentrations and nitrogen fixation in the alfalfa plots. Mean nitrogen fixation in alfalfa plots ranged between 232-555 kg ha-1 yr-1 as estimated by the N-15-natural abundance method.
   In a second study, I sampled soils from alfalfa plots on traditional farms located in 5 different physiographic regions of Mexico. Half of each soil sample was augmented with phosphorus in a greenhouse experiment. I grew alfalfa on the fertilized and unfertilized soils from each site and then determined nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction) of the Rhizobium on the plant roots. Nitrogenase activity increased in the alfalfa grown on all soils with added phosphorus, with two of the five differences being statistically significant at P < 0.01, and one at P < 0.05. Foliage P concentrations and nitrogenase activity were positively correlated (r = 0.81, P < 0.01).

TI CONVERSION TOWARDS ORGANIC AGRICULTURE IN RUSSIA - A PRELIMINARY-STUDY
SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Because of political and other reasons the structural problems of agriculture in the former Soviet Union were never solved. Ineffective agricultural policies and practices have not only led to an insufficient production volume but also to environmental problems (e.g. by pesticides and their metabolites) and to agro-ecological problems (erosion and decrease of soil humus content). The former Academy of Agricultural Science (VASKHNIL) supported a project to convert sections of state and collective farms towards the more sustainable systems of organic agriculture. Preliminary experiences gained on two of these farms during the first year (1991) are described and discussed. Furthermore it is discussed, within the context of recent political/economic developments, what prospects there are for organic agriculture on different types of farms. On the national level it is important whether organic farms will be able to achieve the same or better crop yields per hectare than conventional farms to fulfil the national demand for agricultural products. As an example, it has been calculated what yield level of potatoes could be feasible in organic production systems. Finally, it is briefly considered what is needed at this moment for the sustainable development of agriculture in Russia.

DT Article
AB Two soils of an experimental station in the Rhine valley near Bonn, cultivated according to IFOAM guidelines, were analyzed for several soil microbiological parameters during a period of 3 years. Analyses included biomass, dehydrogenase, catalase and the four exo-enzymes protease, alkaline phosphatase, sucrase, and beta-glucosidase. Microbial biomass proved to be a useful parameter to observe status and developments of sustainable soil productivity, as well as dehydrogenase and catalase. Exo-enzymes were not well correlated to biomass but they were useful in monitoring specific nutrient cycles.

AB Some aspects of the reproductive biology and conservation of leatherback turtles Dermochelys coriacea on an important nesting beach near Piguwa, Papua New Guinea, were studied in December 1989. Leatherbacks had an average overcurvature standard carapace length of 161.35 cm and laid a mean of 88.2 eggs. The eggs had a mean diameter and weight of, respectively, 52.20 mm and 81.05 g. Statistically significant positive relationships were found between the carapace lengths of nesters and the sizes and weights of their clutches. Nesters spent an average of 74 min at the nest site. The nests were about equally distributed on the front and rear halves of the beach and only a few nests were constructed below the beach scarp. Leatherback eggs, an important source of protein and currency for local inhabitants, are heavily harvested in December and January. A high-density nesting section of the beach was recommended for Wildlife Management Area (WMA) status. This means that the traditional beach owners, with the support of the federal government, would regulate the sustainable harvesting of leatherback eggs on the WMA. Ecotourism, centered on the nesting leatherbacks, is a distinct possibility.

DT Article
AB The species composition and woody standing crop was determined for two adjacent sites of contrasting management history in the eastern Transvaal Lowveld-a communal land that has been subject to wood harvesting for several decades and an adjacent unharvested site. Results indicated a significant loss of species richness in the harvested site. Total woody standing crop was little altered despite the long history of harvesting pressure. However, the amount of dead wood was significantly reduced in the harvested site. No adverse effects of such biomass removal were detected. Harvesters actively selected or avoided particular species and size classes.

AB This study aims at understanding, the need for decentralized power generation systems and to explore the potential, feasibility and environmental implications of biomass gasifier-based electricity generation systems for village electrification. Electricity needs of villages are in the range of 5-20 kW depending on the size of the village. Decentralized power generation systems are desirable for low load village situations as the cost of power transmission lines is reduced and transmission and distribution losses are minimised.
   A biomass gasifier-based electricity generation system is one of the feasible options; the technology is readily available and has already been field tested. To meet the lighting and stationary power needs of 500,000 villages in India the land required is only 16 Mha compared to over 100 Mha of degraded land available for tree planting. In fact all the 95 Mt of woody biomass required for gasification could be obtained through biomass conservation programmes such as biogas and improved cook stoves. Thus dedication of land for energy plantations may not be required. A shift to a biomass gasifier-based power generation system leads to local benefits such as village self reliance, local employment and skill generation and promotion of in situ plant diversity plus global benefits like no net CO2 emission (as sustainable biomass harvests are possible) and a reduction in CO2 emissions (when used to substitute thermal power and diesel in irrigation pump sets).

AB Biomass contributes around 10-14% to global primary-energy input, but it is an inefficiently utilised resource, often exploited unsustainably. Close to source, the cost of useful energy in the form of lignocellulose is often competitive with fossil fuels. Wider commercial exploitation on a sustainable basis awaits the development of modern technology to enable biomass to compete with conventional energy carriers. This paper argues that electricity is the most logical initial target market for biomass energy and that emerging technologies offer good prospects for high-efficiency power plants with moderate investment costs. Successful development of such technology could make available substantial quantities of biomass power at a cost comparable with that of some fossil-based options and make a useful contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
   The Global Environment Facility of the World Bank is funding a commercial demonstration of a Biomass Integrated Gasification-Gas Turbine power plant in Brazil. Funding has being allocated in two tranches: a two-year development grant of US$ 7.7 million followed by an implementation grant of US$ 23 million. The organisation of the development phase is reviewed in this paper.

AB The achievement of significantly increased biomass yield per unit area through genetic improvement of trees is a primary goal of short-rotation intensive-culture (SRIC) of Eucalyptus and other tropical hardwoods in Hawaii. Twelve entries of Eucalyptus selected for arid environments in Hawaii were assessed for genetic variation using four isozyme systems involving six loci (Pgi-2, Pgm-1, Pgm-2, Mdh-2, 6Pgd-1, and 6Pgd-2). They included five open-pollinated (OP) progenies of E. globulus; three OP progenies of Eucalyptus hybrids (two E. grandis X E. urophylla hybrids and one E. grandis X E. camaldulensis hybrid); and four provenances (two E. grandis provenances and one provenance each of E. camaldulensis and E. saligna). As indicated by mean number of alleles per locus and observed and expected levels of heterozygosity, the three OP progenies of hybrids were the most variable, followed by the four provenances and the three OP progenies of E. globulus. The importance of managing genetic variation to avoid deleterious impacts of inbreeding in these elite Eucalyptus selections in a long-term tree improvement program for sustainable commercial SRIC plantations is discussed.

TI SCHISTOSOMIASIS-MANSONI IN BURUNDI - PROGRESS IN ITS CONTROL SINCE 1985
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

DT Article
ID PERIPORTAL FIBROSIS; INFECTION; CHEMOTHERAPY; PRAZIQUANTEL; MORBIDITY
AB Described is the evolution of the schistosomiasis control programme in Burundi since 1985. A single round of selective population chemotherapy was carried out in the Rusizi Plain and the Bugesera focus from 1985 to 1990. The prevalences and intensities of infection as well as the number of symptomatic cases detected in general health services decreased considerably. Annual sample surveys in the treated areas showed, however, that these improvements were rapidly reversed by reinfection of the demographically changing population. Since repeated selective population chemotherapy was not sustainable in the long term, a primary health care approach was adopted. In areas with good access to basic health services, approximately 10% of all schistosomiasis cases now receive treatment annually through this approach. Yearly selective chemotherapy in primary schools in suburban Bujumbura reduced the prevalence of schistosomal infection among pupils from 23% to 9% over the period 1984-90, and this programme has now been extended to highly endemic areas in Imbo-Sud. Focal snail control produced disappointing results, and emphasis has therefore shifted towards health education and environmental control of transmission.

AB Biological production estimates of 100 fish populations from 38 lakes worldwide were gathered from the literature. The relationship between the annual production of fish populations (P, kilograms per hectare per year), annual mean standing biomass (B, kilograms per hectare), and maximum individual body mass (W, grams) was approximately log10P = 0.32 + 0.94 log10B - 0.17 log10W (R2 = 0.84). This relationship is similar to one observed for lotic invertebrate populations and shows that P declines with W. Major axis regression indicated that the P/B:W relationship had an exponent similar to that predicted by allometric theory. The residuals from this multivariate equation suggest that fish production is positively correlated with temperature, lake phosphorus concentration, chlorophyll a concentration, primary production, and with pH. The results suggest a general bottom-up control of lake ecosystem components. The morphoedaphic index is not a good predictor of the production of fish populations. Assuming that sustainable yield is about 10% of production, sustainable yield would be less than 15% of the standing biomass for the majority of fish populations analyzed. Exploited populations were found to be about 70% more productive, on average, than unexploited populations of the same standing biomass and body-mass.

AB The long-term viability of Canadian prairie agriculture depends on the ability to arrest soil degradation caused by wind and water erosion and excessive tillage. The challenge is to develop crop-production systems that are economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The objective of this study was to quantify the short-term economic performance of field pea (Pisum sativium L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) and spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown under three tillage-management systems. The economic analysis was based on a tillage x crop rotation experiment started in 1986 and involving zero tillage (ZT), minimum tillage (MT) and conventional tillage (CT) and three 4-yr crop rotations. The economic analysis considered only costs associated with purchased inputs and machinery. The effects of method of tillage management on herbicide and fuel use were also determined for each crop. Costs of production were similar for all tillage systems and crop types. Net returns were higher for field pea, flax and spring wheat grown on stubble using ZT and MT than when CT was used, because of higher grain yields. Net returns were similar for winter wheat grown on stubble and for spring wheat grown on fallow for all tillage-management systems. Fuel consumption was highest for CT, intermediate for MT and lowest for ZT for all crops except winter wheat. In contrast, herbicide use was greater for ZT and MT than for CT for al crops except winter wheat; no differences were observed among tillage systems for this crop because it was always seeded directly into standing stubble. The shift from CT to ZT or MT systems did not increase costs of production or reduce short-term economic returns. ZT and MT had higher production potential than CT because increased soil-moisture conservation generally provided higher net returns. ZT used less fuel but more herbicides than MT and CT.

AB Should we set any limits on patenting? More specifically, must we set any limits on patenting in the field of biotechnology? There should be general agreement on the exclusion of humans from patentability. The European Parliament voted unanimously on an amendment to the Community Directive regarding patenting stating that the human body and its parts are not patentable as such. Patenting of humans indeed would be against fundamental human rights; against the shared principles of freedom, autonomy, and dignity of each single human being. The same reasons apply to requests to reject the ''commercialization of the human body.'' However, much more difficult is reaching a consensus on what are the parts of humans that should not be marketed-organs, tissues, cells, genes, smaller DNA fragments? Probably there is no consensus on where to draw the line when we deal with parts of the human body. Nevertheless, an ethical component is very strong in raising opposition to patenting human DNA. Whatever our personal view on the issue, we cannot deny that ethical aspects must be considered in granting patents on human DNA. With reference to animals, the fears raised are that the patenting of transgenic animals could amplify the instrumental use (reification) and the neglect of their sentient nonobjectual nature: patenting could motivate, instead, the tendency to consider animals as the standard of things invented and as new consumer products. Moreover, animal patenting increases production and thus brings about the great suffering of animals.
   In regard to plants, the ethical implications of patenting have more to do with their socioeconomic effects, in particular on Third World countries, than for the organisms involved.
   Can denying the ethical and social implications of patenting in biotechnology be considered a responsible position? Economic interests are absolutely important, but they must be balanced with ethical and social considerations. This is an important ethical aspect of patenting in biotechnology: take this as the opportunity to integrate scientific, industrial, ethical, and social needs. This could be the initial step toward the objective of responsible and sustainable development as prescribed by the United Nations.

TI THE ECOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF FOOD-PRODUCTION
SO CIBA FOUNDATION SYMPOSIA

DT Article
AB In the industrialized countries dramatic decreases in the number of people employed in agriculture have been made possible by a rise in soil and labour productivity. There is scope for these to improve further, particularly in developing countries. Potential yields are determined by the characteristics of the crop, local temperature and sunlight. Because the availability of nutrients and that of water are limiting for at least part of the growing season in most agricultural lands, attainable yields are lower than potential yields. Proper management of nutrient inputs, such that optimum use is made of each, can reduce this gap without causing negative environmental side-effects. Actual yields are lower than attainable yields because of growth-reducing factors, such as pests, diseases and weeds. For sustainable agriculture these should be controlled mainly by biological measures. There are many possibilities for this, thus biocides may be used as a last resort not as preventive insurance. Potential yields of rice and sugarcane can reach 30 000 kg ha-1 per year of consumable organic matter, sufficient to feed 120 people. Such yields cannot be achieved on all agricultural land, but it is estimated that world food production could support a population of 80 thousand million, if they were all vegetarian and required only 1500 m2 for non-food-related purposes. The green revolutions that occurred in the Western industrialized countries in the late 1940s and early 1950s and in Asia in the late 1960s and early 1970s need to be followed by a similar increase in agricultural productivity in Africa and West Asia to feed their rapidly growing populations. Better use of fertilizers and good water management require well-educated farmers with the financial means to implement long-term strategies. If these developments are managed properly, food production for the ever-increasing human population can be guaranteed and the burden on the environment and natural habitats reduced, enabling the development of sustainable agricultural systems.

TI SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE - AN EXPLANATION OF A CONCEPT
SO CIBA FOUNDATION SYMPOSIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Close relationships between agriculture and many areas of human activity determine countless interlinkages with global issues of natural environment protection, human population increase, food supply, industry and world trade. This broad context promotes different perceptions of sustainable agriculture by different interest groups. Profitable diversification away from overproduction of basic commodities and satisfaction of environmental pressure groups are major preoccupations in developed countries. Elsewhere the main concern is to maintain a trend of increasing production: food security with a future dimension. Achieving this depends essentially on protecting the agricultural resource base. Inputs and input substitution are important co-related issues but the core of sustainability is the avoidance of any attrition of the potential for future production; this demands that we guard soil, water sources, grazing lands and gene pools against loss and degradation. Though superficially biophysical or technical in nature, most problems of resource degradation and eroding potential are rooted in economic, social and political issues; few such problems will be solved unless the primacy of these issues is recognized and addressed. Sustainable agriculture will likely remain elusive until governments and other agencies accept it as arising only as the outcome of a synthesis of strategies on population, employment, economic planning, technical research and national investment.

TI CROP PROTECTION - WHY AND HOW
SO CIBA FOUNDATION SYMPOSIA
LA English
DT Article
AB The answer to the question 'why' has proximate and ultimate roots. The proximate answer, 'pests take our harvest', compels one to act. Crops and their pests are products of domestication, the ancestors of the pests still exist in nature. Eradication is impossible and undesirable. What action should be taken? The ultimate answer, how organisms became pests, may tell us how to act. Old cropping systems had man-made ecological sustainability but do not have economic sustainability in modern times. To achieve both we must prevent rather than control pest outbreaks, using old and new ecological tricks, with application of pesticides in emergency cases only. The action will require a move from chemistry to ecology. Optimism on regaining some ecological sustainability is mixed with doubts on economic sustainability. Can farmers be asked to invest in the future at the expense of today's family income? Crop protection faces new technical and moral problems.

TI THE ECONOMICS OF FOOD-PRODUCTION
SO CIBA FOUNDATION SYMPOSIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Although world average food production per person is increasing there are many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where production has fallen in recent decades. The economic analysis.of the world food problem concerns the dynamics of production, income, growth, demand and trade. The 'law of diminishing returns' suggests that labour incomes fall as population density increases. Capital investment and technological change, particularly with a land-saving bias, can overcome this effect. Such land-saving innovations are less appropriate where population densities are lower, as in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Innovations which reduce risk, such as stress- and disease-resistant crop varieties, may be more attractive to farmers. Communal or government action is required to ensure sustainability of food production; to reduce risk, through price stabilization, possibly crop insurance and contingency plans for famine relief; to promote equity and to ensure competitive market conditions. Public funding of agricultural research is necessary to promote growth in food supplies. If increases in supply do not keep pace with growth in demand, food prices rise, attracting resources into food production. If supply grows faster, food prices and farm incomes fall, driving resources out of agriculture. Resources may not move fast enough to correct imbalances. Primary producers are likely to face deteriorating terms of trade. Linkages between food production and other sectors are weak, so primary exports are not a good basis for economic development. Import substitution strategies may damage agriculture. Structural adjustment regimes have been adopted in some countries to correct imbalances and provide an incentive for farmers to increase production. Associated reductions in public expenditure may have a contrary impact.

AB Historical profiles can be used to portray past pathways of agricultural development, the factors that affected pest status and the responses made by farmers in the form of pest management. Understanding the key factors affecting these historical developments is thought to be crucial for identifying likely future scenarios and associated opportunities and constraints for improving pest management. Evidence for this view is provided by four case studies: brassica pests in the United Kingdom; tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis management in The Gambia; rice pest management in the Lop-Buri area of Thailand; and pest management in dryland cotton in north-east Australia.

AB Viral diseases of plants cause enormous economic losses particularly in the tropics and semitropics which provide ideal conditions for the perpetuation of viruses and their vectors. Intensive agricultural practices necessitated by the ever-increasing demands of the rapidly growing population and the introduction of new genotypes, cropping patterns and crops have further aggravated the problem of viral diseases. Many diverse approaches have been tried to minimize the losses caused by these diseases. The approaches are mainly based on avoidance of sources of infection; avoidance or control of vectors; modification of cultural practices; use of resistant varieties obtained though conventional breeding procedures; cross protection; systemic acquired resistance; and use of transgenic plants containing alien genes that impart resistance to viruses. Although the use of resistant varieties has been found to be the most economical and practical, for effective management of viral diseases an integrated approach is essential in sustainable agriculture. Development of integrated management practices also requires correct identification of the causative viruses, because symptoms can be misleading, and adequate understanding of the ecology of viruses and their vectors.

AB A farming system has been developed on the Gloria Land farm at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram that uses purely organic materials and achieves yields comparable with or better than those on conventional farms under similar agroclimatic conditions. The stimulus for the conversion to organic farming came from observations of the toxicity of chemical pesticides and their apparent ineffectiveness in reducing the impact of pests and diseases. On the Gloria Land farm, a carefully integrated mixture of activities includes crop growing, animal husbandry, fish rearing and sericulture. Sufficient organic waste is produced to fulfill all the needs of the farm's crops. Energy is partially supplied by biogas produced on the farm. This system is economically viable and ecologically sustainable.

TI THE LOCAL VIEW ON THE ROLE OF PLANT-PROTECTION IN SUSTAINABLE
   AGRICULTURE IN INDIA
SO CIBA FOUNDATION SYMPOSIA
LA English
DT Article
AB Indiscriminate use of chemical insecticides has affected humans and their environment and contributed significantly to reduced productivity of crops. With the increasing realization of the importance of sustainable agriculture, the concept of integrated pest management (IPM) for sustainable agriculture has emerged. In the recent past entomologists and the farmers have identified methods of pest management that are ecologically non-disruptive and stable. Concurrently indigenous crop varieties with resistance to pests and diseases have been developed and cultivated. According to the principle of 'organic farming', several non-chemical methods have become popular among the local farmers. Simple cultural practices like increasing the seed rate to compensate for pest damage, adjusting the time of sowing to avoid pest damage, mulching, intercropping, trap cropping and crop rotation have been found to provide adequate protection from pest damage with no additional cost and without harmful effects on the environment. The age-old method of catch and kill is still being practised by farmers, particularly for cotton. Mechanical methods like the bow trap for control of rats and provision of tin sheets around coconut tree trunks to prevent rats damaging the nuts are still being adopted. The use of botanical materials such as the neem products for pest management has been well received almost all over the world. Biological control using the natural enemies of insect pests has become very popular among the farmers in the 1980s. The farmers who clamoured for chemical pesticides in the 1960s and 1970s are now disillusioned with these poisonous eco-destabilizing substances; they want sensible, biologically rational methods of IPM. Pest surveillance and monitoring play an important role in IPM for sustainable agriculture.

TI PLANT-DISEASES IN INDIA AND THEIR CONTROL
SO CIBA FOUNDATION SYMPOSIA
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of development is reviewed in terms of sustainability. Food production in India driven by pressure from an increasing human population uses 90 000 t per year of technical-grade pesticide: 12% of this is fungicide and a good part is insecticide for the control of vectors of plant viruses. A change in the cropping pattern and irrigation have provided a summer 'green bridge' along Tamil Nadu/Andhra Pradesh border areas for the tungro virus that affects rice and its vector. Epidemics occur along the coramandal coast, if the weather is suitable. Red rot disease of sugarcane is promoted by poor drainage, river widening, ratooning, contaminated planting material and variation in the pathogen throughout the Indo-Gangetic plain. Apple production uses large amounts of fungicide. For every 1000 t of apples produced 1t of fungicide is sprayed 8-10 times seqentially. Systemic application of fungicides has led to pesticide resistance and resurgence of other diseases. 70-80% of the Nagpur Mandrin produce reaches the market by trucks that have to traverse 1000 km. 10.6% of fruits are lost to post-harvest diseases; culling, sunburn and injuries account for another 11.6%. In the control of leaf rust of wheat in North India, the use of varietal mosaics, resistance genes and extra-late wheat sowings that do not coincide with favourable weather have all collectively contributed to loss reduction. The drop in the production of exportable crops such as peppers and coconuts because of diseases needs attention. The traditional wisdom on crop mixtures, organic manuring, shifting sowings, etc, needs scientific re-evaluation.

TI SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND INTEGRATED PEST-MANAGEMENT IN CHINA
SO CIBA FOUNDATION SYMPOSIA
LA English
DT Article
AB In developed countries, emphasis is being switched from high productivity through the use of high inputs to ecologically sustainable agriculture. In developing countries such as China priority must be given to increasing food production while simultaneously trying to optimize sustainability. Achievements in plant protection are being countered by continued evolution of the pest ecosystem, in part driven by application of pesticides or the introduction of new crop varieties. Future management of the agricultural ecosystem requires the development of a method of 'super-long-term' prediction to evaluate possible consequences of different strategies of plant protection. Crop plants with durable resistance to pests must be derived by conventional breeding or by using biotechnology and genetic engineering. Genetic vulnerability can also be reduced by techniques such as gene rotation and mixed cropping. Biological control of plant pests shows promise but requires ecological study of the relationships among crop, pest and natural enemy. Implementation of sustainable pest management will need training and education of farmers, extension workers and policy makers to deliver new information in the developing countries.

   ASSOCIATION; COMPONENTS
AB The challenge facing agriculture, particularly in developing countries, is to increase productivity without causing ecological damage. An important aspect of sustainable agriculture is the substitution of chemicals and capital with locally grown biological inputs and knowledge. Production of food grains in India has risen steadily since the 1960s, partly through the introduction of high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat together with appropriate agronomic and plant protection practices. Plant breeding programmes have improved cultivated rice by the transfer, from wild species, of genes conferring resistance to viral diseases. Diversification of resistance is sought, to render the hybrids less vulnerable to sudden outbreaks of diseases and insect pests. For wheat, resistance to rusts involves the additive interaction of several gene-encoded traits. Linkage of resistance genes with morphological markers enables the inheritance of the former to be followed easily. It is important that recent advances in molecular genetics are incorporated into integrated pest management programmes. This will require appropriate social organization. Research centres that develop and exploit genetic sources of resistance and varietal diversification should be established.

AB Water is the key issue in a number of declarations made by several eminent international commissions in recent years. The availability of clean and unpolluted water is crucial to sustainable development. The River Rhine was turned by pollution into the sewer of Western Europe; environmental protection measures, changes in industrial production and consumers' behaviour and remedial measures have drastically improved the quality of Rhine water, which, besides being the main water-way in Europe, also serves as a source of drinking water for a large population and is used for recreational purposes. Small occasional accidents, major spills, very remote accidents, war activities, etc. threaten the full recovery of what is the socially and economically most important watercourse in Europe. The organizational and technological measures taken to protect the Rhine from pollution can serve as an example of how other major freshwater sources could be protected from contamination or how existing pollution could be remedied.

TI BUCKLING OF EDGE-DAMAGED COMPOSITE CYLINDRICAL-SHELLS SUBJECTED TO

SO COMPOSITES ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The stability of filament-wound composite cylindrical shells subjected to radial pressure is examined, for the case in which edge-damage is present. The displacement equilibrium equations, based on Flugge's quasi-linear theory, are solved using a finite complex Fourier transform together with the introduction of a displacement function. The zero of a determinantal equation, arising from the nontrivial fulfillment of the boundary conditions, furnishes the value of the critical radial pressure. The edge-damage is modeled by nonuniform boundary conditions.
   From computed results it is concluded that isotropic shells are capable of withstanding edge-damage up to 50% of their circumference before a reduction in the critical pressure occurs. Anisotropy tends to weaken this sturdiness with all single and bilayered shells considered suffering a fairly sharp drop in the critical pressure sustainable after only up to 20% of the edge is ''loosened''. This represents a reversal of the roles of isotropy and anisotropy found by the authors for the case when the shells were subjected to axial compression.

TI FEEDBACK-CONTROL OF BIRTH AND DEATH RATES FOR OPTIMAL-POPULATION DENSITY
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
AB The logistic equation of Verhulst, N = r[(K - N)/K]N, leads to a solution in which the maximum potential rate of increase r is effectively reduced as N approaches the maximum sustainable density K. Here, we begin with N = RN for a single population, and let R be subject to feedback from N relative to some optimal density K such that R = m[(K -N)/K]R, resulting in a solution similar to that of Verhulst. Subsequently, R is partitioned into birth rate b and death rate d, each subject to feedback control in terms of N and K. The solution is periodic. Finally, birth and death rates in predator-prey systems are treated accordingly. If optimal densities are near the equilibrium values at steady-state, behavior of a one prey-one predator system is virtually unchanged; however, if not near equilibrium solutions are radically different. Efficiency of prey use by predators in modified Lotka-Volterra systems must meet stringent conditions for neutral stability of three or more populations. Adding feedback relaxes these conditions.

AB This paper examines the situation where the public's inflationary expectation varies smoothly with current and past inflation realizations. We construct a stationary Markov perfect public equilibrium with a continuous expectations mechanism, in which government reputation plays an important role. The sustainable steady-state inflations are multiple and the degrees of persistence are indeterminate. This makes our equilibria explain not only high and persistent inflations but also equally abundant episodes of successful disinflations. Interestingly enough, the analysis here and the recent contributions to the dynamic seigniorage literature potentially may generate some observationally equivalent economic phenomena despite their marked contrasts in causes and effects.

DE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH; MODEL; COMPONENT ANALYSIS
AB A new sustainable growth model is developed which enables the evaluations of the interdependence of financial objectives, operational performance and sustainable growth in the energy industry. This new model includes both the effect of inflation and growth produced from equity issues. Component analysis is shown to be an extremely useful tool in determining the effect of operational and financial variables on the sustainable growth rate. This new model is statistically compared with both actual growth rates and Higgins' model. Implications of this research include a more accurate financial planning tool for evaluating sustainable growth and a more effective tool for directing policies to stimulate growth in specific industries.

AB One main reason for the slow improvement of durum wheat in water-limited environments is the lack of clear understanding of the interrelationships among yield components and their compensatory changes under low and erratic moisture availability. Five cultivars, varying in many physiological attributes, were tested under different drought-stress conditions in field and greenhouse experiments. The cause-effect relationships of duration of vegetative period, duration of grain-filling period, number of spikes per m(2), kernels per spike, kernel weight and grain yield per m(2) were assessed. Furthermore, yield stability was evaluated. Yield reduction was largest under mid-season stress (58%), followed by terminal stress (30%) and early stress (22%). Cultivar Po was very sensitive to terminal stress.
   Path-coefficient analysis revealed a complex pattern of relationships among the six variables. An increase in vegetative period reduced the grain-filling period under all conditions. It increased number of kernels per spike under non-stress conditions. The direct effect of spikes per m(2) on grain yield was significantly positive. However, more spikes per m(2) resulted in fewer kernels per spike and a low kernel weight and, as a result, a negative relationship with grain yield under early stress. Grain-filling period had a strong influence on grain yield via kernel weight. Kernels per spike had the largest direct effect on grain yield. However, it was negatively correlated with kernel weight, especially under terminal stress. Grain yield heavily depended on kernels per spike under early stress and grain-filling period and kernels per spike under terminal stress.
   Variation in drought susceptibility index among cultivars was significant under early and terminal stress conditions, but not under mid-stress conditions. Yield potential and stability were not correlated for the different drought-stress conditions.
   Longer grain-filling period, increased number of kernels per spike and limited spike number per m(2) can be used as selection criteria for sustainable yield in water-limited environments.

AB Many attempts have been made to develop a method for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) that is minimally invasive, efficacious, and low cost. The transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) device has recently been developed to treat BPH by selectively ablating hyperplastic prostatic tissue. A special cathter incorporates needles that deliver low-level radiofrequency power directly to a very localized area of the prostate. The needles have adjustable shields to protect the urethra if desired or necessary. It is positioned via transrectal ultrasound or direct vision. A pilot study was performed in patients to evaluate TUNA feasibility via histopathological measurement of thermal lesion size and TUNA safety by: (1) monitoring urethral and rectal temperatures; (2) assessing the ability to localize lesions, and (3) determining patient tolerance of the procedure without anesthesia. Twenty patients were treated using TUNA prior to scheduled retropubic prostatectomy. The surgical prostatic specimens were recovered from 1 day to 1 month after TUNA, were step-sectioned, and examined histologically. Patients were 68 years old on average with prostate weight varying from 14 to 88 g. The TUNA procedure averaged 27 min, 4 lesion treatments per prostate, and 4-15 W of power applied for 3 min. Proximal lesion temperature was about 40-50-degrees-C with central lesion temperatures of about 80-100-degrees-C. Urethral temperature averaged 37-42-degrees-C and rectal temperature remained unchanged. Macroscopic examination of the specimens demonstrated localized lesions averaging 12 x 7 mm. Microscopic examination showed larger lesions of extensive coagulative necrosis averaging 30 x 15 mm. Specific immunohistochemical staining showed destruction of all tissue components. Preservation of the urethra and capsule integrity were noted. Magnetic resonance imaging performed in vivo showed lesions in the prostate corresponding to the recovered surgical specimen. Seventeen patients were treated without anesthesia and tolerated the procedure well. This study demonstrates TUNA safety through no rectal temperature change and lesion localization; feasibility shown by the creation and sustainability of adequately sized lesions, and good tolerance for outpatient treatment. Clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of the procedure.

AB The cassava green mite Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar), accidentally introduced from South America into Africa, has spread across the cassava belt and is causing severe yield losses to cassava. Biological control was recognized as the most promising and sustainable strategy against this pest. Among the different stages of a biological control program, mass rearing of beneficials is often a major bottleneck. The different rearing systems used by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture are described. A mother culture system maintains pure and high quality colonies and provides inoculum to start mass production. Twenty biotypes are maintained separately and no contamination has been found in the cultures. Oligophagous species are reared in the insectary on artificial substrate, using alternative prey as a food source. For phytoseiid species specific to M. tanajoa , an ''on plant'' system is used in a greenhouse. Advantages and disadvantages of the two different systems are discussed as well as general requirements and constraints in rearing phytoseiids.

   PHOSPHORUS; POTASSIUM; CALCIUM; MAGNESIUM; ACIDIFICATION; SUSTAINABILITY
AB The degree of soil mining by agricultural production in Southern Mali is assessed by calculating nutrient balances: differences between the amount of plant nutrients exported from the cultivated fields, and those added to the fields. Export processes include extraction by crops, losses due to leaching, to erosion, and to volatilization and denitrification. Inputs include applications of fertilizer and manure, restitution of crop residues, nitrogen fixation, atmospheric deposition of nutrients in rain and dust, and enrichment by weathering of soil minerals. Nutrient balances are calculated for N, P, K, Ca, and Mg. Both pessimistic and optimistic estimates are given.
   The resulting figures indicate, even when the most optimistic estimates are used, large deficits for nitrogen, potassium and magnesium. For the region as a whole, the calculated deficits are -25 kg N/ha, -20 kg K/ha, and -5 kg Mg/ha. Further, acidification is to be expected, in particular in areas where cotton is grown. The deficits are caused by traditional cereal crops, but also by cotton and especially by groundnut. The latter two crops are fertilized, but insufficiently. It is important to note, that the negative figures are not automatic recommendations for application of a specific amount of additional fertilizer. For phosphorus and calcium the balance of the region as a whole appears to be about in equilibrium, but locally large variations may occur.
   Erosion and denitrification are important causes of nutrient loss, accounting respectively for 17 and 22% of total nitrogen exports. Atmospheric deposition and weathering of minerals in the soil are still important nutrient inputs that contribute as much as nutrients as organic and mineral fertilizer combined. Nutrient depletion is very large in comparison to the amount of fertilizer applied. Drastic options, such as doubling the application of fertilizer or manure, or halving erosion losses, even if feasible, would still not be enough to make up for the calculated deficits.
   The annual value of withdrawn nutrients, if related to prices of fertilizers, varies between 10,000 and 15,000 FCFA/ha (40-60 US $/ha). Since the estimated average gross margin from farming in this area is 34,000 FCFA/ha (123 US $/ha), soil mining appears to provide an amount equal to 40% of farmers' total income from agricultural activities.

AB An interactive multiple goal linear programming model has been developed for analysis of agricultural development options in a semiarid region in Mali. Natural and human resources have been quantified, constraints identified and the relations between agricultural activities described explicitly at both regional level and the level of agro-ecological zones.
   Animal husbandry and cropping system have been defined in a target-oriented way taking into account quantified aspects of sustainability. For crops this implies the requirement that the amounts of the macronutrients N, P and K in the rootable layer of the soil are safeguarded in the long run by nutrient applications. External inputs to realize predetermined target yields have been specified to compile quantitative input-output tables.
   Goals and goal-variables to be optimized in the model have been defined after consultations with various stakeholders in the region. Goal restrictions have been established through the interactive approach of the model.

AB A multiple goal linear programming model has been used to explore the impact of inorganic fertilizer availability on land use, crop and livestock production in the Fifth Region of Mali. Three scenarios have been examined with restricted, intermediate and unrestricted inorganic fertilizer availability. Marketable crop production was maximized under various restrictions and limiting values of other goals, such as a minimum regional gross revenue, and on the basis of sustainable agricultural activities. Results are discussed at both regional and subregional levels.
   Unrestricted inorganic fertilizer availability allows a substantial increase in crop production. In normal years, the food needs in 8 of the 11 agro-ecological zones distinguished in the region are met, whereas this holds for 7 out of 11 in the other two scenarios. In dry years, food needs can only be met if, in addition to unrestricted inorganic fertilizer availability and emigration, some sacrifices (e.g. lower regional gross revenue) are accepted.
   In all three scenarios, available animal manure has to be utilized completely and supplemented by substantial amounts of imported inorganic fertilizer, largely exceeding current total national imports.
   In a post-model analysis aspects are examined that could not be incorporated in the model. To stimulate the use of inorganic fertilizer, a reduction in its farmgate price is recommended. Income generated outside the agricultural sector is required to pay for subsidies on fertilizers and reduce risks in animal marketing.

ID AMAZON; AREA
AB Intercrops are often considered more productive than sole crops in the tropics, but the validity of this hypothesis has been poorly tested in humid-tropical regions where the growing season is infinite.
   The 332-day, four-component intercropping systems, modeled after the traditional planting scheme of the local farmers, and five sole-crops systems of near-equal duration were studied under four N regimes (0, 80, 160 and 240 kg ha-1 on nonlegumes) on a Typic Paleudult in the upper Amazon basin (Yurimaguas, Peru) to test the above hypothesis. Test species were com (Zea mays L.), upland rice (Oryza sativa L.), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz). Each intercropped system included one production cycle of the four test species. One sole-cropped system was cassava; the others were three production cycles of sequentially-planted, short-cycle food crops (corn, rice or peanut). Production rates by the seven cropping systems were evaluated on the basis of gross product yield, total biomass and revenue generation. No intercropping system was more productive than sole crops of its intercrop components. As generators of disposable income, furthermore, each four-component intercropping system was substantially less productive than any sole-cropped system except cassava. When the intercrop data were evaluated as two-component systems, it was determined that the low productivity of the two four-crop systems tested was due to cassava-rice (LER = 0.82) or cassava-peanut (LER = 0.90) portion. The cassava intercrops did not provide any direct benefit for the com-peanut portion (LER = 1.25). This suggested that a two-crop system consisting of a legume-nonlegume intercrop of short-cycle food crops, would be worthy of commercial exploitation in a humid tropical environment. However, to ensure the sustainability of the system, it would be necessary to prevent disease build up. Response to N by com was maximal between 80 and 160 kg ha-1 in all systems. The N response pattern for sole-cropped cassava was positive and linear, but it was virtually flat in the intercrops. The effect of N on rice grain yields was either nil or negative in both sole crop and intercrop. There was no measurable effect of N regime on intercrop efficiency.

AB The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development alerted the world to the hazards presumptive if the planet's natural resources of land, water, air, energy and biological organisms are not protected and utilised more conservatively. UNCED declared two urgent research priorities: global climate change and genetic diversity. Excessive use of fossil fuels and a resultant atmospheric pollution forebodes higher temperatures at the earth's surface. The consequences for agriculture are unpredictable. Alternative sources of energy are described: electric motors with high-capacity batteries and high energy fly-wheels; solar-thermal and photovoltaic systems of power generation. Global population will rise to at least 8 billion (1 billion = 10(9)) by 2025, a rate of growth demanding an annual increase of 3% in agricultural production. The principles of sustainable production in relation to land and water management, genetic diversity among crop species, and food science and technology are discussed. Among the many thousand crop genotypes in the international germ plasm banks, more is known about agronomic characters than about functional properties relevant to food processing. Transgenic modifications broaden the spectrum of pest resistance in crops, but too little is known of the nutritional implications. Biotechnological advances, demands for non-polluting waste disposal, consumer concerns for food safety, the need to provide food security for a global population changing in age and income distribution, offer exciting challenges to all food scientists and technologists.

AB ''Sustainable agriculture'' has been defined as a farming system with a low external input of agrochemicals, particularly fertilizer nitrogen. The impact of such farming systems on the quality of three arable crops was considered. Rape seed, wheat, and potato were selected, because they represent arable crops with simple to complex quality criteria. Rape seed (= simple quality criteria): The oil quality is determined primarily by the genotype and is only slightly affected by environmental conditions and cultural practices such as low nitrogen supplies. Within three decades, conventional breeding has changed rape seed into a new crop providing oil for human consumption instead for technical purposes. Wheat (= more complex quality criteria): Wheat is an excellent source of highly digestible energy for human consumption, but its most important quality criterion is the content of protein, which is positively correlated with baking quality and with contents of essential amino acids such as lysine and methionine. Since nitrogen is a constituent of protein, farming systems with little or no fertilizer nitrogen necessarily produce wheat less suited for bread making and of lower nutritional value. At low nitrogen supply, high-protein wheat can be produced only if the grain yield is kept low. Nitrogen fertilization has only a small impact on the contents of vitamins and minerals. Reductions in phosphorus fertilization decrease the grain phosphorus content but may increase grain zinc content. Potato (= complex quality criteria): As compared to wheat, quality traits of potato are less affected by cultural practices. High potassium levels are essential for tubers of high quality. In contrast, high nitrogen inputs can have adverse effects on several quality traits. The use of pesticides and growth regulators most often has no direct effects on the quality of seeds and tubers. Generally, customers should be willing to pay more for food which is of a high ecological quality but may be inferior in technological and nutritional quality.

TI AVAILABILITY AND USE OF TREES IN MUTANDA RESETTLEMENT AREA, ZIMBABWE
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT

DT Article
AB This study quantifies current wood supply and consumption, and investigates the effect of wood use on wood supply and the current uses of wood. More than one-third of the study area was miombo woodland, supporting about 20 t ha-1 of woody biomass, and 10% of the area was mopane, supporting over 60 t ha-1. The remaining area, cultivated lands and wooded grasslands, supported little woody biomass. Cultivation has been the chief source of deforestation, with dramatic reductions in overall woody cover since 1981 when the area was first resettled. Wood harvesting has a much more local effect on woodland structure, its impact being limited to within 300 m of a village. The dominant species of the woodland are used for fuel wood, but householders are more selective of species for wood for construction and other household requirements. The majority of farmers leave indigenous trees, predominantly fruit-bearing species, in cultivated lands. Tree-planting activities are directed towards exotic fruit trees. Total fuel wood consumption is estimated at nearly 7 t per household per year. The average household contains over 15 t of wood in building structures, which require approximately 2 t year-1 to maintain. These are high values compared with other studies of the small-scale farming sector and reflect the abundance of the wood resource. Simple calculations of wood supply and consumption indicate that these high levels are within the sustainable yields of the remaining woodland, if legal limits to the size of arable lands are enforced. This study adds to the growing literature which indicates that the 'wood crisis' has been overstated.

DE ELECTRICITY GENERATION; GLOBAL WARMING
AB Owing to a very rapid growth in electricity generation in developing countries (DCs), the environmental impacts associated with it are likely to increase strikingly. Whereas in the past DCs have not given these environmental issues high priority, this may change in the future because of both internal and external political pressures. It may perhaps also change through a growing recognition of the dangers of not pursuing development pathways that are sustainable over the long-term. There are significant differences between DCs and industrialised countries (ICs) in their attitudes towards appropriate, affordable policy responses to the threat of global warming. The paper begins by examining how and why the environmental issues associated with DC electricity generation are becoming increasingly pressing, both for DCs and for ICs. The issues are classified into categories. There is then a detailed discussion of greenhouse gas scenarios and the possible roles that may be played by DCs in the growth and limitation of carbon dioxide emissions. The paper notes the difficulties of reaching workable agreements on global greenhouse gas limitations that include the DCs.

AB The effect of fluorine incorporation on PtSi/Si structure is studied systematically. It is observed that the fluorine incorporation from ion implantation improves the high-temperature stability of the PtSi/Si structure. The optimum implantation energy is determined to be the energy at which the maximum percentage of the as-implanted fluorine ion locates at the PtSi/Si interface region. The SIMS analysis shows that the fluorine atom piles up at the PtSi/Si interface. The XPS analysis indicates that the fluorine atoms at the PtSi/Si interface are bonded to the silicon atoms in a form of SiF2 or SiF3. A fluorine-buffer (FB) model is proposed to explain the effect of fluorine incorporation. It is postulated that the Si-F layer acts as a buffer layer to change the PtSi/Si interface energy and preserve the integrity of the silicide layer at high temperature. Fluorinated Schottky junctions are fabricated and the electrical characteristics show that the sustainable process temperature can be improved from 650-degrees-C for the unfluorinated Schottky junctions to higher than 800-degrees-C for the fluorinated Schottky junctions.

AB The UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio agreed to the creation of a new organ within the UN to coordinate the implementation of sustainable development policies. The Sustainable Development Commission represents a surprising achievement in view of the generally critical attitudes of some among the Group of Seven to creating new organs within the UN system. The UN Environmental Programme, cited for an expansion of its role has, over the 20 years of its existence, established a good reputation for pioneering small-scale catalytic programmes. It has also been unfairly burdened with nominal obligations to coordinate other UN activities in the field. However, the post-Rio future raises both problems and opportunities for UNEP. An expansion of UNEP may raise asset-stripping possibilities as well as strain donor confidence as the programme enlarges.

Gives attention to the role of technology in this process. Expresses sustainability criteria in the magnitudes time preference, depletion of natural stocks, population growth, and technical progress. It appears that technical progress must offset the other magnitudes mentioned.

TI THE ROLE OF GEOLOGY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAPUTALAND, SOUTH-AFRICA
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Maputaland, the coastal plain on the eastern sea-board of South Africa, is underlain by late Mesozoic to Quaternary sequences. It lacks any major mineral wealth, apart from heavy minerals in the Holocene coastal dunes. Mining of these dunes is a controversial environmental issue whilst the whole area is not suitable for industrialization. Development options for Maputaland therefore are largely limited to the rational and sustainable utilization of its renewable natural resources. The development and improvement of the region's agricultural output and eco-tourism industry are the best options to pursue in order to provide much needed employment for a rapidly growing and already impoverished rural community. The region has a high biodiversity due to its being a tropical-subtropical transition zone and to east-west variations in geology and climate. These have been the reasons for the establishment of various conservation areas. Future improvements to the agriculture and the reserves depend upon important geological input both on the environmental side, in order not to interfere with natural long-term changes, as well as on the applied side, particularly concerning the development of an infrastructure for the eco-tourism industry.

TI BASIC PRINCIPLES OF AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS

DT Article
DE AGROECOSYSTEMS; AGRICULTURE; ECOLOGY; SUSTAINABILITY; BIODIVERSITY;
   COMPETITION; SUCCESSION; CULTURE
AB In the final analysis, sustainable agriculture must derive from applied ecology, especially the principle of the regulation of the abundance and distribution of species (and, secondarily, their activities) in space and time. Interspecific competition in natural ecosystems has its counterparts in agriculture, designed to divert greater amounts of energy, nutrients, and water into crops. Whereas natural ecosystems select for a diversity of species in communities, recent agriculture has minimized diversity in favour of vulnerable monocultures. Such systems show intrinsically less stability and resilience to perturbations. Some kinds of crop rotation resemble ecological succession in that one crop prepares the land for successive crop production. Such rotations enhance soil organic processes such as decomposition and material cycling, build a nutrient capital to sustain later crop growth, and reduce the intensity of pest build-up. Species in natural communities occur at discrete points along the r-K continuum of reproductive maturity. Clearing forested land for agriculture, rotational burning practices, and replacing perennial grassland communities by cereal monocultures moves the agricultural community towards the r extreme. Plant breeders select for varieties which yield at an earlier age and lower plant biomass, effectively moving a variety towards the r type. Features of more natural landscapes, such as hedgerows, may act as physical and biological adjuncts to agricultural production. They should exist as networks in agricultural lands to be most effective. Soil is of major importance in agroecosystems, and maintaining, deliberately, its vitality and resilience to agricultural perturbation is the very basis of sustainable land use.

AB Strategies to involve agribusiness in the development of sustainable agricultural systems have been limited by the lack of a comprehensive conceptual framework for identifying the most critical supportive policies, programs and regulations. In this paper, we propose an efficiency/substitution/redesign framework to categorize strategies for modifying agribusiness practices. This framework is then used to identify a diverse range of short, medium, and long-term strategies to be pursued by governments, community groups, academics and agribusiness to support the transition. Strategies discussed include corporate greening, ethical investment, changing the legal status of the corporation, new business forms and the development of ecological economics.

TI SUSTAINABILITY IN CATTLE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS

DT Article
DE CATTLE SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY; ORGANIC FARMING
AB Cattle production has the potential of being an important component of sustainable agriculture globally. The ability to transform feed not suitable for humans into high-quality food will be of great importance in the long-term for feeding a growing population. Other aspects such as preservation of landscape values and maintenance of rural communities are highly appreciated values, especially in the industrialized part of the world.
   To exploit the sustainable potential of cattle production systems, problems of pollution (such as ozone destruction, acid rain, and nitrate leaching) and of health and welfare, which are associated with cattle production, are critically reviewed. The possibilities of integrating cattle production with other types of production are evaluated. Cattle can be used for single purposes such as dairy, beef, and draught, but dairy cows can also be used for restricted suckling combining dairy and beef production. In addition a mixture of species makes grazing more efficient, and a combination of cattle and mixed cropping can increase resource efficiency.
   The possibilities of using organic cattle production systems as prototypes of sustainable cattle production systems are explored. The effects of production constraints which are applied in organic farming systems are studied. The redirection of values and activities in agriculture is a challenge to cattle production research and to traditional research methodologies.

SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB It is the contention of this paper that some progress in alleviating the social and environmental problems which are beginning to face Papua New Guinea can be achieved by supporting traditional Melanesian values through maintaining the customary system of communal land tenure. In accordance with this aim, I will proceed to contrast certain Western attitudes towards ''individual freedom'', ''self-interested behaviour'', ''individual and communal interests'' and ''private ownership'' with attitudes and values expressed in the traditional Melanesian approach. In order to demonstrate the latter, I will briefly touch upon the phenomenon of ''wantokism'' and indicate how the Melanesian values associated with this concept find their locus in the system of ''customary communal ownership''. Subsequently, I will describe how the emergence of a cash economy and the attachment to Western gadgetry and products have effected injury to the environment and undermined values which have previously maintained Melanesian social cohesion. While admitting that little can be done to eradicate the desire for cash and the products it can buy, I suggest that Melanesian communities and the environment itself would receive more protection if future development in Papua New Guinea embraced a system which incorporated certain of the traditional Melanesian values through the preservation of the communal form of land tenure. Ultimately, I suggest a way in which customary communal land tenure can be integrated into the established Anglo-Australian legal system.

DE LAND DEGRADATION; ONTARIO FARMERS; ATTITUDES; ENVIRONMENTALISM;

AB This paper provides an analysis of a 1991 survey of the views of a stratified random sample of 1,105 Ontario farmers. Factor analysis, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA, chi-square and correlations were used to identify differences in farmers' attitudes toward rural environmental issues as a function of their demographic and farm characteristics. Younger, well-educated farmers, especially if female, were most concerned about the seriousness of rural environmental degradation. The largest operators expressed the greatest support for the use of agricultural chemicals, were most opposed to government conservation regulations and were least environmentally oriented. Such differences between Australian and Ontario farmers as the former's greater cautiousness about governmental regulation and receptivity to the Green Movement are a function of differing demographic and farm characteristics between Australia and Ontario.

TI NEW STOCHASTIC-THEORY FOR BRIDGE STABILITY IN TURBULENT-FLOW
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Theoretical explanation is provided on why turbulence in the wind flow can sometimes stabilize an essentially single-degree-of-freedom motion of a flexible bridge. The theory is based on a new turbulence model, which has a finite mean-square value and a versatile spectral shape, and is capable of matching closely a target spectrum. It is shown that, without turbulence, the onset of flutter instability is associated with a critical wind velocity and an eigenvector describing a combined critical structure-fluid mode. This particular composition strikes a balance between the energy inflow from fluid to structure, and the energy outflow from structure to fluid, so that an undamped structural motion becomes sustainable. At the introduction of turbulence, the combined structure-fluid mode is changed continuously and randomly, and the new energy flow balance, in the sense of statistical average, renders the stabilizing or destabilizing effect of turbulence possible. Numerical results are presented for the boundary of asymptotic sample stability for a bridge model undergoing a single-degree-of-freedom torsional motion.

AB Accelerated soil erosion is both a severe environmental problem in many parts of the world and a classic problem of physical geography. This article reviews some central issues of soil erosion and soil loss tolerance and presents an exercise on the geography of soil erosion. The goal of the review section is to update and recast the questions of soil erosion in light of current physical geography and environmental awareness. We review environmental problems of accelerated erosion, the essential processes of soil loss, why soil loss prediction is necessary, and tolerance values and land sustainability. The main goals of the exercise are to teach students about the physical and cultural components of soil erosion and sustainable land use. In this exercise students 1) estimate soil losses based on included tables for three regions across the United States, and 2) answer questions about the factors of soil loss, soil conservation, and sustainability. The exercise also integrates the geography of soil erosion with five broader conceptual questions from physical geography.

TI CHANGES IN SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE WATER SALINITY AND BORON CONCENTRATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB The electrical conductivity (salinity) and boron concentrations of subsurface agricultural drainage effluent are analyzed. The effluent is from drainage systems ranging from 0 to 40 years of age, located on irrigated saline soils in the San Joaquin Valley, California. Data collected from 1962 to 1990 verifies that the equation developed between 1959 and 1962 is valid for use in predicting the quality of effluent that will be discharged from artificial subsurface drainage systems installed in irrigated agricultural soils of the San Joaquin Valley, California. The work is useful in that it demonstrates the predictability of the quality of subsurface drainage effluent from drains installed in irrigated land. Such relationships are important in arid areas of the world where reclamation of irrigated land is required, particularly when there is growing concern about the sustainability of irrigated agriculture on saline soils and the environmental impact of saline drainage effluent.

TI SUSTAINABILITY OF PACIFIC-NORTHWEST HORTICULTURAL PRODUCERS
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The sustainability of agriculture is of great concern and controversy, but there is little information on operational measurements and definitions of sustainability. This article examines the implications of defining and measuring agricultural sustainability. Two sets of variables were used to indicate sustainability: (i) changes in agricultural chemical use, and (ii) use of alternative production practices. Factor analysis revealed that it would be inappropriate to construct a single sustainability scale that included both sets of variables. Two separate scales were constructed. The types of producers viewed as ''sustainable'' on each scale had very different characteristics. On the scale that examined changes in agricultural chemical use, producers in the sample reporting zero or declining use tended to have smaller farms, lower investments in machinery, and lower gross and net incomes than producers at the other end of this scale. The use of alternative practices, reflected in the second scale, showed that producers using a greater number of alternative management practices had larger farms, more investment in machinery, and larger gross and net incomes than producers at the other end of this scale. Producers classified as sustainable on either of the two scales differed little from other producers with regard to economic impacts on the community, organizational involvement, or attitudes about farming. In general, more useful comparisons were made among producers classified by structural variables such as farm size and principal occupation of operator. These findings suggest that policies should take into account the structural factors that influence the adoption of sustainable practices.

AB Biodiversity is a multifaceted phenomenon involving the variety of organisms present, the genetic differences among them, and the communities, ecosystems, and landscape patterns in which they occur. Society will increasingly value biodiversity and influence the passage of laws and writing of regulations involving biodiversity which rangeland managers will have to abide by over the coming decades. Even private and developing world rangelands will be affected.
   While taxonomic knowledge of vertebrates and vascular plants and their abundance, rarity, and distribution, in the developed nations is generally adequate, the same cannot be said of the developing world. Furthermore, adequate knowledge of invertebrates, nonvascular plants, and microbes is deficient everywhere.
   Although the basis of variation at all higher levels, genetic variation within rangeland species, even the major ones, has barely been assessed. Obtaining statistically adequate data on populations of rare species that are small and secretive is well nigh impossible.
   We have many means of measuring community diversity, but all of them are value laden. That is, choice of variables to measure and how they are indexed betrays what we consider are important. We should be more forthright in stating to the users the biases of these methods. There are many other, more useful ways to describe community-level diversity besides the traditional focus on species.
   Ungulate grazing is an important process in many ecosystems. Thus, removal of grazing destabilizes some systems. Livestock grazing will actually increase the chances of survival of some species. Moderate livestock grazing can also enhance community and landscape-level diversity in many instances.
   Attention is now shifting from ''charismatic'' species to defensively managing larger tracts of land with habitat or ecosystems holding suites of sensitive species. Since some accelerated extinction of isolated populations and species is inevitable, we need to know which species and ecotypes are most valuable. Understanding of modular, guild, and functional group structure would also help us identify keystone or critical link species and better focus our attention on truly important tracts of land where they live.
   It is probably more important to sustain soils and ecosystem processes than any randomly selected species, especially if functionally redundant species can be identified. Similarly, not all introduced, alien, or exotic species are equal threats; it depends on how they fit into ecosystems. Sustainable development will depend on finding balance between use and protection, from range sites to landscapes, and even on a global basis.

AB Ephemeral channels may be greater contributors to nonpoint sediment loads than perennial channels because of their abundance and lower vegetative cover. This study examines above- and belowground standing crop responses of selected vegetation classes and density of shrubs to grazing use and yearly weather variation along an ephemeral stream in northcentral Wyoming.
   Aboveground biomass standing crop was determined yearly in channel, floodplain, and upland habitats in ungrazed and grazed pastures during the 4-year study. Belowground biomass and shrub densities were determined yearly in the channel habitat only.
   Perennial grass standing crop in channels did not respond to grazing but decreased up to 73% with decreases in frequency and amount of precipitation. In floodplains, perennial grasses were not responsive to grazing; annual grasses were twice as abundant in grazed pastures. Vegetation standing crop in uplands was not influenced by grazing. Over the study period in all pastures, standing crop of blue grams (Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag. ex Griffiths) declined 4 fold while cool-season grasses increased 5 fold. Shrub density did not increase as much in grazed as in ungrazed pastures. Root biomass of the channel decreased 23% in years with less precipitation but was greater by 24% on concave than convex bank types. Location on channels influenced root biomass but grazing did not. Lack of general negative grazing influences on vegetation suggest short periods (10 days) of grazing as used in this study represent a sustainable management alternative for grazing in the cold desert.

TI AGRONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY OF DIFFERENT FARMING SYSTEMS ON ALFISOLS IN
   SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB A longterm experiment was conducted on Alfisols at Ibadan, Nigeria, to assess agricultural productivity and sustainability of different farming systems. The experiment, conducted for a 10 year period from 1979 to 1988, was implemented in two phases. The effects of methods of land clearing on crop growth-yield were evaluated during Phase I from 1979 to 1982. Effects of different farming systems on agronomic productivity were evaluated in Phase II from 1983 to 1988. Six land clearing-cum-tillage treatments evaluated in Phase I were: (i) manual clearing with no-till, (ii) manual clearing with plow-till, (iii) shearblade clearing with no-till, (iv) treepusher/rootrake clearing with no-till, (v) treepusher/rootrake clearing with plow-till, and (vi) traditional farming. Similarly, six farming systems evaluated in Phase II were: (i) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala, (ii) Mucuna fallowing on severely degraded soils (iii) Mucuna fallowing on moderately degraded soil, (iv) ley farming on severely degraded soil, (v) ley farming on moderately degraded soil, and (vi) natural fallow control. In Phase I, yields of maize (Zea mays), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and cassava (Manihoc esculenta) were higher on manually cleared with no-till and shearblade cleared with no-fill treatments than on other treatments. In Phase II, maize growth was higher on plots with Mucuna fallowing than in alley cropping or ley farming treatments. In contrast, cowpea growth was higher on alley cropped plots. Regardless of the farming system, maize grain yield declined with the cultivation duration. The relative decline in cowpea grain yield with cultivation duration was less than that of maize.

TI FARMING IN 2031 - A SCENARIO OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN CANADA
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper explores the implications of a large-scale transition to sustainable agriculture in Canada. As one component of a broader sustainable society scenario, the study reaches conclusions about the ability of an alternative food production system to meet the food needs of Canadians. The results suggest that Canada can be self-sufficient in grains, oilseeds and pulse production. There is also sufficient land for forage and hay production. Apparent shortages in feed crops could be subsidized with grains currently allocated for food. Canada will continue to depend on imports of fruits and vegetables, although urban production of these crops can significantly increase domestic supplies. With careful planning and management of land resources, the country could maintain a comfortable level of self-reliance for most foods under a sustainable agricultural system.

TI CONSERVATION FARMING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SHIFTING CULTIVATION IN
   SRI-LANKA - AN ECONOMIC-EVALUATION
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB To evaluate the conservation farming system as an alternative to the traditional shifting cultivation system in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, benefit-cost analysis was used. The major environmental impacts have also been taken into consideration in this analysis. It is found that the 'chena' (shifting) cultivation system is profitable in the short run and becomes un-productive after three years. A conservation farming system is profitable and sustainable in the long run but it is not as profitable as the 'chena' system in the short rum Thus, some interventions as well as new break-throughs in conservation farming technology may be needed to economically motivate farmers to take it up as an alternative to the 'chena' system.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Using print media about the food situation in the Commonwealth of Independent States (C.I.S.), students in an under-graduate survey course studied their unfolding food situation from January to May, 1992. Optional student participation was summarized by the number of articles submitted according to student major. Sources and titles of media articles were listed. The content of the 53 media articles was summarized in chronological order for the semester. Students' concerns and comments were emphasized throughout the discussion. Their informal class discussions frequently included concepts of sustainable agriculture. Much of the information in the news media coincided with class lectures about the global food situation, i.e., sustainable agriculture and chemicals in the food supply. Conclusions were made about how students reacted to the unfolding events, from projections of famine made in January 1992 to statements of severe ecological damage, in April 1992. They observed disastrous societal effects because sustainable agriculture was not observed.

TI POULTRY LITTER AS A FERTILIZER FOR BERMUDAGRASS - EFFECTS ON YIELD AND
   QUALITY
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Utilizing poultry litter as a fertilizer for bermudagrass (Cyndon dactylon (L.) Pers.) hay production may be an environmentally desirable disposal method, especially if yield and quality of the hay is maintained. A study was conducted on a Wynnville fine sandy loam (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Glossic Fragiudult), near Snead, AL, to determine the impact of poultry litter on bermudagrass yield and quality. Treatments included three rates of poultry litter (5.6, 11.2, and 22.4 Mg ha-1), three rates of ammonium-nitrate (112, 224, or 336 kg ha-1 in a split application), and a control. Hay was harvested in six cuttings over a two-year period. At the highest rates, no significant difference between poultry litter and ammonium-nitrate was observed with respect to average forage quality (mean of six cuttings) and two-year total yield. When examined by cutting, forage yield and quality were equal or greater with poultry litter than ammonium-nitrate at the first cutting each year, but were less at the second cutting. Apparent residual effects of poultry litter application resulted in increased yields and crude protein content in the second year of the study. It appears that fertilizing bermudagrass hay fields with poultry litter is an excellent sustainable agricultural practice.

DT Article
AB Live fence posts are widely used in Costa Rica and other Central American countries as a sustainable agricultural practice. The Costa Rican farmers' empirical knowledge was compiled through a questionnaire, field measurements and literature review. Ninety two species used for live fences were recorded and tabulated. The management practices (preparation of stakes, planting, attaching wire, pruning regimes) and the various uses are discussed. The biomass production of a kilometer of one live fence was measured. It is concluded that this is indeed a very promising sustainable practice which deserves more research and dissemination.

ID REFORM
AB The early 1990s has witnessed the publication of numerous multi-country studies of the effectiveness of economic policY reform in developing countries. The evidence on experience with structural adjustment lending (SALs) is especially relevant; as SALs tended to involve extensive reforms they yield important lessons for the political and economic environments most conducive to sustainable economic policy reform. In the context of the literature on the sequencing of reform, this paper reviews the evidence of a range of studies and draws out the lessons and implications for developing economies contemplating economic policy reform. Three questions form the core of this assessment. First, are there theoretical grounds to underpin some 'optimal' sequencing of economic reforms, and is it necessary that macroeconomic reforms take precedence? Second, are reforms that are introduced gradually more enduring than a 'big bang' approach? Finally, is political stability a prerequisite to sustainable reform? The answers offered are all, to a greater or lesser degree, affirmative.

TI FORESTRY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS FOR FUELWOOD SUPPLY IN NORTHERN NIGERIA
SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Fuelwood consumption in Northern Nigeria greatly exceeds the sustainable supply in the region and the deficit is partly made up by relatively low-cost, long-distance transport of wood from the southern part of the country. Natural woodlands provide most of the off-take of wood in the northern region; relatively little comes from plantations, village woodlots and shelterbelts. This article describes current forestry, agriculture and land use policies and programmes of the federal government and the seven northern states that affect fuelwood supply in the region. Policy recommendations are made for changes in funding support for forestry; pricing of wood from reserve forests; administrative responsibilities of state and local governments; and management of natural woodlands, plantation programmes and farm forestry. The findings are compared to other studies elsewhere, and related research needs in Northern Nigeria are specified.

ID EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE
AB At present, due to the low level of marine science and technology coupled with a lack of an adequate administrative and organizational framework, the natural resources of the African seas are hardly exploited. However, the growing population, threat of disasters, energy shortages, and insufficiency of protein from land-based sources are among the reasons for an increasing interest from African States in developing their capability to understand and exploit their ocean spaces in accordance with the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention. The article examines this interest in ocean affairs in six sections dealing with: maritime spaces within the national jurisdiction of African States; marine environment and the sustainable development of African States; marine fisheries; mineral resources; maritime transport and communications; and marine science and technical assistance.

AB The Maya Biosphere Reserve, established in 1990, protects 1.6 million ha of subtropical forest in the Peten region of Guatemala, an area rich in natural and cultural resources.  Four national parks and three protected biotopes form the Reserve's core.  A multiple use zone of roughly equal size surrounds the core zones.  The Reserve is under pressure from over-exploitation of certain forest resources and from the agricultural practices of immigrant populations.  A master plan is now being prepared to define the Reserve's administrative structure and programmes.  Co-operative agreements are being developed with a range of governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and research institutions to carry out elements of the programme.

   MIGRATORY PESTS; TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
AB Plant protection has many international aspects; it is also quickly changing, especially in relation to sustainability. FAO's activities in plant protection are grouped in four major thrusts: plant quarantine, pesticide management, integrated pest management and migratory pest control. The International Plant Protection Convention defines the FAO's activities in plant quarantine, while, in response to the GATT Uruguay Round, harmonization of plant quarantine is also being undertaken. Pesticide management activities address the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides and standard setting on pesticide residues. Integrated Pest Management is the core of the plant protection programme, together with international coordination of migratory pest control. All these activities are complemented by technical assistance programmes, including assistance with the establishment of plant protection services.
   FAO's activities remain a compromise between what member countries see as desirable and what is affordable. Long term commitment is required to achieve result. New functions in quarantine and pesticide management have been taken up, but the international assessment of pesticides needs urgent attention. The paradigm change away from pesticide use will require further international cooperation. Substantial research and a new control system is needed for locust control.

LA English
DT Article
DE NEW-ZEALAND; MODELING; ABUNDANCE; DIADROMY; INDIGENOUS FISH
AB Development of models to describe the distribution and abundance of salmonid fishes depends on understanding the suitability of local, small-scale, critical habitat parameters such as water depth, flow velocity, and substrate characteristics. The success of such models in predicting trout abundance depends on the populations not being limited by additional constraints on abundance by wider, large-scale parameters, such as recruitment and migratory access. Extension of these models for use in evaluating the impacts of flow modifications to New Zealand rivers on indigenous fish populations would significantly advance biologically sustainable management of rivers. Many of New Zealand's native fish species are diadromous, requiring access to and from the sea to complete their life cycles. For this reason, abundance of native fishes is likely to be constrained by a combination of large-scale variables such as: elevation, slope, distance from the sea, the presence or absence of explicit barriers to upstream migration, and individual species' ''urge'' to migrate upstream. Successful predictive models for describing abundance of diadromous native fish will need to incorporate factors that account for these variables. Although models for estimating areas of available habitat can be based on habitat suitability criteria, when models are used for predicting abundance, they must take into account factors relating to accessibility.

TI MULTISPECIES CONTROL BY AERIAL BAITING - A REALISTIC GOAL
SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY

DT Article
AB Two advantages could be gained by developing multi-species control by aerial baiting. It should assist pest managers to achieve sustainable resource management by improving the efficiency of operations; and it should reduce the likelihood of unwanted ecological side-effects (such as prey-switching) that sometimes follow when pest species are controlled individually. The technology to achieve efficient multi-species control is already well advanced, aided particularly by the refinement of aerial control of possums and by the development of baits for individual species. More effort will, however, be required to develop predictive models for planning the integration of multi-species control with conventional single-species control, and for predicting the ecological effects of such intervention.

AB Agenda 21, the 40-chapter action plan, agreed to by all nations participating in the 1992 Earth Summit represents an ambitious effort to provide policy guidance across the entire spectrum of environment, development, and social issues confronting mankind. In the area of oceans and coasts (Chapter 17 of Agenda 21), the Earth Summit underscored that the management of oceans and coasts should be 'integrated in content and anticipatory in ambit.' To assist those responsible for implementing the Earth Summit guidelines on ocean and coastal management, this article first reviews the fundamental shift in paradigm reflected in the Earth Summit agreements as well as the specific recommendations contained in Chapter 17. Next, the article examines the central concept of 'integrated management,' noting both its importance and its limits. A general or 'synthesis' model of 'integrated coastal management' is then presented, addressing such questions as management goals, what is being managed, where, how, and by whom.
   In a concluding section, methods are proposed whereby the general or 'synthesis model' can be tailored to diverse national contexts, involving varying physical, socio-economic, and political conditions.

AB Venezuela is located in central northern South America, with some 4 000 km of coastline and near 700 000 km2 of marine and submarine areas. The Venezuelan coastal zone is characterized by serious problems of land use and utilisation of its  natural resources, caused by a generally anarchical spatial occupation  and lack of sufficient legal and administrative means for control. In this paper, a synthesis of the Venezuelan approach to attaining a sustainable development of its marine and coastal zones is presented.  This means the accomplishment of the social and economic development of the Venezuelan population in general, and specifically the coastal inhabitants, taking into account the legal and administrative patterns that govern land use planning and the utilisation of natural resources, particularly in marine and coastal areas. The paper is organised in three parts: (1) the diagnosis of the current situation; (2) the presentation of a hypothesis based on present trends (trend scenario); and (3) the statement and application of a sound and adequate solution (desirable and possible scenario).

AB There are two principal threats to sustainable coastal fisheries. The concern which has been evident in most parts of the world for many years is the existence of open access to fisheries which has led to over-capitalization, over-fishing of the resource and, often, conflict. Increasingly in recent years, however, a second threat has become apparent. This is the loss of fish habitat and deterioration of water quality brought about by environmental changes generated in other sectors. Integrated coastal fisheries management addresses these issues through a strategy in which the removal of open access plays the key role, supported by elements such as creation of awareness, local participation in management, training and research, and improved sectoral coordination and planning. It is noted that, very often, the amelioration of the second of the two principal threats may be dependent on the fishery sector resolving the first.

There is a growing need for coastal management practitioners and organizations with expertise in planning and implementation for ICM. The application of strategies for institutional development and building human capacity in coastal management and other fields shows that short-term intensive training efforts and long-term institutional strengthening programs are appropriate to address the issues and needs of ICM.

TI THE RISE OF COASTAL AND MARINE TOURISM
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Marine tourism has surfaced as a pressing topic in the field of ocean and coastal management. Neither necessarily good, nor bad, this tourism is inherently controversial. Today, demand for travel exhibits greater variation and magnitude than ever in history. In response, the tourism industry has become the largest business on earth. This, coupled with the respect people profess for marine environments and local peoples, creates feelings of ambivalence for the tourist. Sociologically, the activity of tourism may be studied as a symbolic interaction fostering social solidarity. Ecotourism, a recent phenomenon attuned to the ideal of sustainable development, is suggested to emerge through the social construction processes of restoration and enhancement. The papers in this theme volume add fuel to the proposition that the resolution of tourism problems in the coastal zone will require the scientific study of environmental and social conditions, policy analyses, planning, and public education.

DT Article
AB This paper presents an argument in favor of utilizing marine conservation regimes for managing and controlling tourism in coastal and marine areas. Tourism is identified as having both positive and negative effects on natural environments. One of the primary benefits of using marine conservation regimes as management tools is that the typology of conservation regimes enables governments to choose a combination of preservation and development principles that reflects an area's capacity for tourism and the preferences of the nearby communities. Emphasis on community participation in the planning process is regarded as an advantage to ensuring successful management of the marine convervation area.

TI ACCOMMODATING ECOTOURISM IN MULTIPLE-USE PLANNING OF COASTAL AND MARINE
   PROTECTED AREAS
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Coastal and marine areas the world over provide food, transportation, recreation, and energy resources to increasing numbers of people each year. As demands for these resources rise, the potential for user conflicts is radically heightened This situation can be avoided or counteracted by instigating proactive multiple use planning. Multiple use zoning plans can only exist in a concrete management framework: marine and coastal protected areas provide just such a foundation. Nature-based or ecotourism can be encouraged in coastal protected areas aimed at achieving sustainability. Well-planned tourism provides economic and political incentives for management and for conservation, and may bring additional benefits to local communities and regional economies. Examples where nature-based tourism has been or is becoming successfully integrated into multiple use planning can be found in Quintana Roo, Mexico; the Lesser Antilles; and Australia, among other areas.

AB Bisphosphonates are widely used in disorders associated with increased resorption of bone, particularly in Paget's disease of bone and in the hypercalcemia of malignancy. Because of their undoubted efficacy and relatively low toxicity, bisphosphonates are attractive candidates for the management of osteoporosis. Clodronate, one of the many bisphosphonates being tested in osteoporosis, may be given intravenously or by mouth. In contrast to etidronate, even high doses of clodronate do not impair the mineralization of bone, making it suitable for long-term use in osteoporosis. As do all the bisphosphonates tested thus far, clodronate appears to delay the rate of bone loss in osteoporosis. Long-term studies are relatively few, so that its steady-state effects on bone mass are not yet known. Most data suggest clodronate is capable at least of delaying the rate of bone loss, but several pilot studies with this agent suggest that increments of bone mass might be sustainable for several years. Clodronate is likely to decrease the frequency of osteoporotic fractures, but there is no evidence for this at present. Well-controlled, long-term prospective studies are needed.

AB In the Freetown area of Sierra Leone, the proportion of children under five years of age dying from diarrhoea-associated conditions has decreased since the 1970s from 4% to 3%. This reduction relates to children between 12 months and 5 years; deaths associated with diarrhoeal disease in infancy do not appear to have decreased significantly. Currently, 2% of children die in infancy and a further 1% before their fifth birthday from diarrhoeal diseases. Thirty-one percent of short-term growth-faltering in children under five years of age is attributed to diarrhoeal disease. Reasons for improvement in mortality may include the implementation of a National Diarrhoeal Diseases Control Programme and improved case management; some 55% of cases of acute diarrhoea in Freetown now receive oral rehydration therapy. Morbidity and mortality are influenced by the seasons. This is likely to be related to the fact that the nutritional status of children shows a significant deterioration in the early rainy season. At this time incidence of severe diarrhoea warranting hospital admission and diarrhoea mortality rates in hospital and at a Rehydration Center increased significantly. On the other hand, the presentation of dehydrating diarrhoea is greatest in the driest months of the year. Progress in the rural areas of Sierra Leone may not have been so evident although 60% of the population now have access to primary health units within 4 miles and efforts to increase host resistance have included the measles immunization programme which currently protects 60% of under-fives nation-wide. Efforts to reduce the transmission of pathogens have meant increasing access to safe water to 22% and to improved sanitation to 35% in rural areas of Sierra Leone. The sustainable prevention and control of diarrhoeal diseases in developing countries depends also upon increasing levels of adult literacy especially of women.

AB The recent transformations of society demand new aptitudes from agriculture related professionals. Their occupational socialization uses to have the ''green revolution'' as a reference for training need identification, emphasizing the application of scientific knowledge to agriculture under a predominantly immediatist, productivist viewpoint. It gives top priority to the producers' interest, confines interdisciplinary to the helm of such an interest and adopts a fractional view of scientific problems. Identification of serious environmental problems, be they new or aggravated by the ''green revolution'' practices, have been generating a growing consciousness that new appropriate technologies to maintain and expand the production advances should be arrived at, though under condition that production remains viable for unlimited time. The new professional, for sustainable agriculture will still focus on applying scientific knowledge to agriculture. However, the training content needs to be reviewed on crucial aspects such as the conception of science and that of agricultural problems as well as adopting an eco-regional perspective. The role of the University is discussed in this context and fundamental aspects of the needed change in occupational socialization are identified.

AB High concentrations of boron (B) and selenium (Se) naturally found in the environment are detrimental to sustainable agriculture in the western USA. Greenhouse pot experiments were conducted to study B and Se uptake in three different plant species; Brassica juncea (L.) Czern (wild brown mustard), Festuca arundinacea Schreb. L. (tall fescue), and Brassica napus (canola) were grown in soil containing naturally occurring concentrations of 3.00 mg extractable B kg-1 and 1.17 mg total Se kg-1 soil. During the growing season, four intermediate harvests were performed on wild mustard and tall fescue. Final harvest I consisted of harvesting wild mustard, canola, and clipping tall fescue. Final harvest II consisted of harvesting wild mustard, which had been planted in soil in which wild mustard was previously grown, and harvesting previously clipped tall fescue. The greatest total amount of above ground biomass and below surface biomass was produced by tall fescue. Plants were separated into shoots and roots, weighed, and plant tissues were analyzed for total B and Se. The highest concentrations of tissue B were recovered in shoots of wild mustard and canola at final harvest I, while roots from tall fescue contained the highest concentrations of B irrespective of the harvest. Tissue Se concentrations were similar in all plants species. Soils were analyzed for residual B and Se. Extractable soil B concentrations at harvest times were lowered no less than 32% and total Se no less than 24% for all three species. The planting of wild mustard, canola, or tall fescue can reduce water-extractable B and total Se in the soil.

TI RATIONAL CHOICE THEORY, PUBLIC-POLICY AND THE LIBERAL STATE
SO POLICY SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Liberalism requires a high order of responsible behaviour from its citizens in order to be sustainable. Yet when the modern liberal state makes policy, it is the stereotyped 'economic man', driven by self-interest and influenced only by carrots and sticks, who occupies center stage. This regulatory approach to public policy can be shown theoretically to give rise to a paradox - the greater the need for regulation, the less likely, because of compliance problems, it is to succeed. It is contended that an alternative approach which explicitly focuses on a broader behavioral understanding of citizens' attitudes and motivations provides a rationale for the use of a much wider range of policy instruments than does the regulatory framework, and is also more in keeping with those values necessary to the sustainability of the liberal state.

AB Happiness and psychological well-being can be conceptualized as a sustainable surplus of pleasure over discomfort. Such a surplus is reliably measurable and associated with other measures of psychological well-being and physical health. Addiction and dependence can be viewed as flawed strategies for achieving pleasure while attempting to circumvent the costs imposed by the laws of biology and psychology. A number of strategies to promote a long-term surplus of hedonic benefits over inevitable and unavoidable costs have been described and empirically vertified.

AB Club theory is extended to the case of multiproduct clubs. Multiproduct club structure varies depending on whether members are restricted to consume all of the club's products, and whether the club is sustainable against other clubs providing the entire package of products or a subset. Membership of the multiproduct club is contrasted to that of alternative clubs serving a subset of products. Necessary conditions for sustainability are related to cost subadditivity and membership restrictions. The integer problem and the instability that it entails for club memberships are more troublesome for multiproduct clubs, because the population must be partitioned by both products and clubs.

AB The article which follows is based on the work of three individuals who have received awards from the Right Livelihood Foundation. The Foundation, which receives no government or institution finding, was set up in 1980 by Jakob von Uexkull, a translator, journalist and stamp-dealer, to recognise outstanding contributions in the fields of peace sustainable development, environmental integrity, social justice and human rights. Since the inception of the Foundation, its awards - sometimes known as 'alternative Nobel' prizes have been given to over forty individuals and groups, out of 250 submissions from more than fifty countries.
   The work of Cary Fowler and Pat Mooney, who together won the award in 1985, has been largely concerned with the world food crisis and the erosion of the world's genetic resources. Fowler and Mooney have worked together since 1975. One of their proposals was the establishment of international seedbanks, which was adopted by the UN in 1985. Their book Shattering: the diversity of life in the age of biotechnology was published in 1989 by the University of Arizona Press. Since 1978, they have worked for the Rural Advancement Fund International (RAFI), a small, non-profit organisation which focuses on the socio-economic impact of new technologies on rural societies. RAFI played a major role in stimulating the creation of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Commission and Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources and the International Fund of Plant Genetic Resources.  Since the 1988 publication by RAFI of The Laws of Life: another development and the new biotechnologies, RAFI has been developing a study/action programme dealing with the impact of biotechnology on agriculture, food processing, basic community health, and the threat of biological warfare.

As a benchmark we consider Ramsey equilibria in which the government can precommit to its policies at the beginning of time, but in which private agents can default. We then consider sustainable equilibria in which both government and private agent decision rules are required to be sequentially rational. We adapt Abreu's (1988) optimal trigger strategies to completely characterize the entire set of sustainable equilibria. In particular, we show that when there is sufficiently little discounting and government consumption fluctuates enough, the Ramsey allocations and policies (in which the government never defaults) can be supported by a sustainable equilibrium. By way of an example we show that the larger the variance of government consumption the easier it is to support good outcomes. We also show for moderate discount factors that in the best sustainable equilibrium, tax rates are more volatile and debt is smaller than in the Ramsey equilibrium.

AB The strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles was assessed in 14 patients with severe mitral valve stenosis uncomplicated by other diseases. Strength was evaluated measuring the maximal static inspiratory pressure (MIP). Endurance was measured using a two minute weight incremental test, to obtain the maximal sustainable pressure (SIP), which is the highest pressure that a subject can generate to mobilize air with incremental weight during inspiration. MIP was similar to that of 8 normal subjects (110 +/- 21 and 128 +/- 27 cm H2O respectively p = NS). SIP, maximal sustainable weight and SIP as percentage of MIP were 47 +/- 10cm H2O, 261 +/- 81 g and 43 +/- 6% respectively. all lower than in normal subjects (89 +/- 25 cm H2O, 525 +/- 167 g and 71 +/- 15% respectively) We conclude that patients with severe mitral valve stenosis have decreased inspiratory muscle endurance compared to normal subjects and this feature may be related to their decreased exercise tolerance.

AB The concept of sustainability and sustainable development has challenged many individuals and jurisdictions with respect to its implementation. Although attractive in conceptual terms, its operational implementation has been problematic. The paper reports on two contexts in Indonesia where the design of a sustainable development program was undertaken: Bali and Sulawesi. In each case, the unique economic, cultural and environmental contexts demanded an appropriate adaptation of the sustainable development model The resource endowment proved to be the main focus of the approach taken in Sulawesi while the cultural environment was of particular importance in the context of Bali. In both cases it was possible to identify a planning and development process and product for sustainable development which reflected these unique cultural and resource contexts.

AB Conventional comparisons between aquaculture systems are based on single criteria such as productivity. Such comparisons suggest that semi-intensive systems perform better than traditional ones. This paper uses a multi-criterion research method to compare traditional and semi-intensive systems in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The method compares the performance and sustainability of the two systems against a range of criteria, both socioeconomic and biophysical. The findings suggest that performance and sustainability vary with the perspectives of different farmers, different resource conditions, and geographic boundaries.

AB The traditional approach to modelling the effects of trade union power on wages and employment has paid very little attention to how the form of union power affects the outcome. In this paper, wage and employment determination is considered in a dynamic model where some workers, eg. non-union members, continue to work in the event of a dispute to see whether this practice can be justified. The predictions of the model are very different from the standard one, for example both wages and employment may be a non-monotonic function of union density. The model can also explain situations in which unions are sustainable in the long run.

TI CONSEQUENCES OF THE SWEDISH FOREST POLICY - SOME EXAMPLES BASED ON
   DIFFERENT FOREST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE POLICY ANALYSIS SIMULATION MODEL; FOREST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES;
   SUSTAINABLE YIELD
AB This article demonstrates that the opportunity cost (return forgone) of cutting principles imposed by the Swedish forest policy is economically significant. The Swedish Forestry Act of 1979 recommends a management strategy for sustaining high yields of valuable timber referred to here as the Balance Strategy. However, the Forestry Act allows for a range of different forest management strategies. The Act establishes both a minimum cutting volume for a ten-year-period and a maximum final cut area referred to here as the Minimum and Maximum Strategies, respectively. These strategies were compared to a management plan, referred to as the Economic Strategy, for minimizing the opportunity cost for the forest owner. Based on data from a recent forest management plan, a simulation model was used to predict yields and economic returns for a period of one hundred years. The results show that at a 4% interest rate the Economic Strategy produces a gain of approximately 8200 SEK ha-1. The Economic Strategy, however, emphasizes volume and its implementation results in a forest far different from that developed under the Balance Strategy, in which quality timber is also produced. The Economic Strategy may also have less favourable effects on biodiversity, conservation of the natural environment and the recreational value of the forest.

AB A transition matrix model of an uneven-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand is presented. The transition probabilities are based on material from 48 study plots in eastern Finland. The ingrowth of the transition matrix is based on material from 8 study plots and on previous studies. In the model runs the sustainable harvest proportion for 5 years varied between 7 and 20% of the stocking depending on the stand basal area. The shape of the stand diameter distribution had no notable effect on the sustainable harvest proportion. The extension of the thinning interval from 5 to 10 years slightly reduced the total removal during the simulation time.

AB Eucalyptus spp. are among the most promising exotic tropical hardwoods under field testing for biomass crop production in Hawaii. A first step in establishing a genetically based tree improvement program aimed at increasing biomass yield, coppice regrowth, and other desirable traits for short rotation intensive culture of Eucalyptus spp. on potential biomass plantations is to determine the extent of genetic variability in the locally available stock of germplasm. This study presents an evaluation of allozyme variability revealed through gel electrophoresis in fourteen provenances involving five species of Eucalyptus introduced previously in Hawaii. The high levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity observed in our sample indicate that this initial stock of germplasm represents a suitable base for further genetic improvement. This information is critically important for developing and maintaining environmentally and economically sustainable biomass plantations for long-term success featuring stands which are not genetically vulnerable.

AB This article examines some of the characteristics of biological diversity and the appropriateness of the standard economic model in developing policies to protect genetic resources. It is argued that the assumptions of the standard model of perfect competition, including perfect information, reversibility, the emphasis on marginal analysis, and the appropriateness of discounting the future, place severe limitations on the usefulness of this approach in formulating reasonable policies to protect biodiversity. I discuss how biological resources are treated in a market economy, the importance of context in valuing species, and the problem of within-species genetic variability. I argue that the sustainability of biological resources should be a binding constraint overriding traditional market considerations.

AB The evolution of an indigenous agroforestry system currently practiced by the Garo community of Bangladesh is described. Changes in land tenure and market economics have been responsible for changes in Garo land use systems. The Garo agroforestry system incorporates tree crops for shade, weed growth suppression, and ecological sustainability, while incorporating agricultural crops and pineapple for economic return. The present system is socially desirable and economically profitable, but unresolved land tenure issues leave long-term sustainability in question.

TI COLLECTIVE RESISTANCE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL GREECE - THE
   CASE OF GEOTHERMAL-ENERGY ON THE ISLAND OF MILOS
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses issues surrounding sustainable development policies and local environmental movements in non-developed rural regions. Using primary and secondary data sources, it documents that local mobilization against geothermal energy development on the Island of Milos (Greece) in the late 1980s can only be viewed as a clash stemming from supralocal decisions to allocate or restrict access to ecosystems by groups. This evidence supports Schnaiberg's political economy perspective on environmental conflict. Theories which view the state as facilitator of economic growth and social legitimator of its citizenry can adequately explain the roles of both the national and local state in this case study. The Milians mobilized against a 'sustainable development' project in order to protect the local environment and thus sustain their resource base. The role reversal, therefore, between developers and the indigenous population indicates the need to reassess the sustainability potential of geothermal and other renewable sources of energy

AB The wide range of social, political and environmental problems in contemporary agriculture is a challenge to develop a new research agenda for agrarian sciences, including rural sociology. It is argued that the heterogeneity in contemporary agriculture contains a wide range. of potential responses to the 'new agrarian question'. To explore and use these potential responses, economic and/or technological determinism should be avoided. Markets and technology provide farmers room for manoeuvre-in which different styles of farming are possible. Therefore, agriculture must be conceptualized as social practice. Rural sociology has a crucial role in describing and explaining farmers' differential responses to technical, economic and environmental problems, in order to use them as practical principles for designing sustainable agriculture.

TI AGRICULTURAL KNOWLEDGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION IN THE NETHERLANDS -

AB Environmental regulations oblige the Agricultural Knowledge System in the Netherlands to adjust to the concept of sustainability after a long period of serving productivity. This paper examines how agricultural research, extension and education reacted to the introduction of the Crop Protection Plan (sharp reduction of chemical inputs). Research in a horticultural region provided the data for an appraisal of a variety of reactions in the knowledge system and among growers. The development of scientific knowledge is based on linear models and focuses on ready-made recipes for adoption. Extension workers often seem to know little about integrated agriculture, cannot step out of their customary 'expert' role, and seem unwilling and unable to work as facilitators with farmers in a joint search for alternatives. Farmers are seen as adopters or users of science-based rules.  The case study suggests that growers are willing and able to search for more sustainable methods of production, but so far this resource has not been sufficiently tapped to develop a knowledge system supporting more sustainable forms of agriculture.

AB We build on an emerging strategy literature that views the firm as a bundle of resources and capabilities, and examine conditions that contribute to the realization of sustainable economic rents. Because of (1) resource-market imperfections and (2) discretionary managerial decisions about resource development and deployment, we expect firms to differ (in and out of equilibrium) in the resources and capabilities they control. This asymmetry in turn can be a source of sustainable economic rent. The paper focuses on the linkages between the industry analysis framework, the resource-based view of the firm, behavioral decision biases and organizational implementation issues. It connects the concept of Strategic Industry Factors at the market level with the notion of Strategic Assets at the firm level. Organizational rent is shown to stem from imperfect and discretionary decisions to develop and deploy selected resources and capabilities, made by boundedly rational managers facing high uncertainty, complexity, and intrafirm conflict.

TI AGRICULTURAL-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN EASTERN-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES -

SO TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB All the countries in Eastern Europe are in a state of transition towards a market-oriented economy. Although these countries differ in many respects, they have in common some four decades of central and administrative planning. The transformation of these countries has to take place. The course of future agricultural development will depend on the policies regarding ownership of land and of other basic resources (livestock, management and organization of feed, breeding, health of animals, marketing, agroprocessing services), prices, and incentives. Maintaining good environmental quality will have to play an important role in agricultural development, taking into consideration health and welfare of humans, plants, and animals for a sustainable social and economic development. Agricultural research, development, and extension are the cornerstones on which market-oriented agricultural systems in Eastern European countries are to be rebuilt in order to meet domestic demand and increase export opportunities. The greatest emphasis should be on appropriate applied programs adopted to the new orientation and structure. This paper was presented at the Symposium, Science, Technology and Economic Growth: The Case of Eastern Europe, Washington, DC, November 13-14,1991.

DE TILLAGE; SOIL CONSERVATION
ID SOIL PROPERTIES; CLAY SOILS; SYSTEMS
AB Conservation tillage on vertisols has not been well accepted, yet residue management techniques are needed to control water erosion on these highly-erodible soils. Surface soil properties were determined on a Houston black clay (Udic Pellusterts) one crop season after chisel plow-disk tillage, and after 6 and 10 years in a continuous controlled-traffic, no-till management system. Bulk density and penetrometer resistance below 50 mm increased with increasing time since primary tillage. Soil penetrometer resistance values were not in the root restricting range at the soil water contents at time of sampling. Stratification of soil nutrients, total nitrogen and phosphorus, and soil organic carbon increased with time since primary tillage. Conservation tillage appears to be sustainable on these vertisols for an extended period of time with the controlled-traffic, no-till practices used in this study.

TI FRAGILE LANDS, FRAGILE ORGANIZATIONS - INDIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND THE

AB Recent discussions of resource management suggest that one of the most important factors in sustaining use systems on fragile lands is the strength of local representative institutions: rural resource management and the consolidation of rural civil society must both therefore be central concerns in any viable land use strategy in these areas. Pursuing this relationship between local organizations and resource management, the paper discusses the experiences of several Indian federations in Ecuador that occupy fragile environments under increasing pressure from processes of national and local development. These federations have sought to identify resource management strategies to resist these destabilizing forces and so allow continued Indian occupance of these lands. These strategies have represented a constant search to protect local land rights, to assert a specifically Indian cultural identity, and to identify an ecologically and economically viable resource management strategy for Indian families. The most successful strategies to date have been those that combine traditional and modem practices in a way that responds to Indians' increasing consumption requirements and to grassroots management capacities. In doing so they have also helped strengthen the federations themselves. This empirical analysis is related to a discussion of points of contact between the debates on rural democratization and on traditional resource management, and specifically between the geographic traditions of cultural and political ecology, and the literature on agrarian movements. A dialogue between these perspectives could lead to analyses that are at once more reflective of local realities and more able to contribute to the development of viable local resource use strategies.

TI SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY APPROPRIATE URBAN FUTURES FOR THE MOTOR CAR
SO TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
DE AUTOMOBILE; PRICING; SUSTAINABLE FUTURE; ENVIRONMENT; PUBLIC TRANSPORT
AB In its relatively short life, the automobile has provided a level of mobility unlikely to have been feasible with a reliance on conventional forms of land based public transport. It has contributed in both a positive and negative way to the quality of life, transforming our cities, our way of life, and giving us a greater command over time and space. Concern over the undesirable social and environmental impacts has increased over time, with calls for governments to take action to reduce the automobile's dominant role. New investment in fixed-track public transport and bus priority systems together with strategies to discourage travel have been proposed to improve accessibility and to aid in cleaning up the physical environment. This paper reviews some of the issues facing society as it works to identify policies to achieve an economically and environmentally sustainable future. There is a need for a broader set of policies to facilitate alternative land use-transport lifestyles while facing appropriate pricing signals. Some of the key issues are adjustments in the relative prices of location and transport, spatial incentives to make public transport economically viable (i.e. changing urban densities, zoning/incentive changes to allow more infill), road pricing (i.e. charging cars the economic cost of using the roads), new information technology systems (e.g. IVHS) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of transport infrastructure, major improvements in the fuel efficiency of fossil fuelled vehicles, and alternative-fuelled vehicles (''clean-air vehicles'').

   PRINCIPLES
AB Emissions, resulting from human activity, are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. This, in tum, is causing an additional average warming of the Earth's surface. This article presents an overview of recent developments in the international discussion on climate change. taking into account the work of other organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
   The long term and global character of the climate change problem requires an international long term strategy based on internationally agreed principles such as sustainable development and the precautionary principle. Research is needed to further develop risk assessment and environmental quality standards, from which emission targets can be derived.
   As a first step, governments of many industrialized countries have already set provisional national CO2 emission targets, aimed at stabilization at present levels by the year 2000 and, in some cases, reductions thereafter.
   Under the auspices of United Nations, negotiations have begun on an international framework climate convention and associated agreements, on, for example, greenhouse gas emissions, forestry and funding mechanisms. Obligations imposed on individual nations may be expected to reflect their responsibility for greenhouse warming; this paper presents some views on the equity of burden sharing.

AB The growth characteristics of Aspergillus sp. when grown on spent sulphite liquors (SSL), were determined. Maximum sustainable growth occurs at temperatures < 50-degrees-C with near optimum growth at temperatures < 45-degrees-C. No growth occurs at pH < 4,5 with an optimum pH between 5,5 and 6. The biodegradable fraction of SSL with a monoculture of Aspergillus sp. was 33,6%. The growth kinetic constants of Aspergillus sp. when grown on diluted SSL at 45-degrees-C were: mu(max) = 0,318 h-1; K(s) = 260 mg COD.l-1; b = 0,016 h-1 and Y = 0,7 g biomass.(g COD)-1.
   The crude protein contents and amino acid profile of Aspergillus sp. are given.

AB The nature and significance of nonpoint sources of surface and groundwater pollution are examined in this review. Examples are given from across the globe illustrating extensive economic, environmental, and human health damage from these diffuse sources. Agricultural sources, both subsistence farming and irrigated cropland, were found to cause the most widespread water quality problems worldwide. In the least developed nations, areawide releases of human sewage - especially near rural groundwater welts and in burgeoning urban areas - cause the most serious damage with an estimated one billion people suffering from waterborne diseases at any one time. In Europe, the former Soviet Union, and North America, leaking hazardous waste sites, contaminated sediments, and atmospheric deposition of acidifying and toxic substances pose complex challenges in addition to the agricultural pollution sources; and transboundary pollution abatement to restore large waterbodies is becoming a priority for foreign aid assistance. Institutional and cultural barriers to pollution abatement can be overcome by including interventions as integral parts of sustainable economic development initiatives. Through a comprehensive, ecosystem-based approach to water resources management, progress in controlling nonpoint source pollution can be made.

AB Diffuse (nonpoint) pollution from the river basin is responsible for a substantial part of Czech reservoirs' deterioration caused by eutrophication and water pollution. The research results of two model drinking water supply reservoirs (different area and depth) m the Morava river basin showed that the main nutrient sources in the period 1960-1991 were: agricultural land use (overland and subsurface transport of nutrients, effects of drainage and erosion), point sources (urban activities, agricultural farms) and atmospheric depositions of N and P compounds. The accelerated eutrophication was manifested by the increasing development of N phytoplankton. The main problems entail occurrence of toxic species of Cyanophyta/Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa and some other species (e.g. Pseudanabaena limnetica). In the small and shallow drinking water reservoir of Ludkovice the living algae penetrated drinking water. In the deep reservoir of Vir the situation was more favourable. The increase of nutrient input (NP) during the period 1969-1992 was highly significant Various measures have been proposed to slow the reservoir eutrophication (sustainable use of land, best management practices - soil retention, buffer strips, constructed wetlands etc.).

AB Current agricultural practices are thought to contribute to nonpoint source pollution because of large inputs of pesticides and fertilizers and intensive cultivation and crop production. Trends towards sustainable practices which involve crop rotations, alternative weed and pest control measures, use of manure as fertilizer and crop residues can lead to improved resource management. Sustainable agricultural systems should be viewed not as a reversion to past systems but as adoption of systems which promote efficient resource management and improved efficiency in the use of natural resources. Many of the aspects currently considered to be sustainable agricultural practices will lead to decreased nonpoint source pollution on both the field and landscape scale. There are large changes in the physical, chemical, and biological factors which promote these reductions. The net result of adoption of these practices will be improved environmental quality; however, to realize this benefit will require both educational efforts and improved decision making tools to aid in the management decisions required in agriculture.

AB In December, 1987, the states in the Chesapeake Bay region, along with the federal government, signed an agreement which called for a 40% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus loadings to the Bay by the year 2000. To accomplish this goal major reductions in nutrient loadings associated with agricultural management practices were deemed necessary.  The objective of this study was to determine if reducing fertilizer inputs to the NT system would result in a reduction in nitrogen contamination of groundwater. In this only, groundwater, soil, and percolate samples were collected from two cropping systems. The first system was a conventional no-till (NT) grain production system with a two-year rotation of corn/winter wheat/double crop soybean. The second system, denoted low-input sustainable agriculture (LISA), produced the same crops using a winter legume and relay-cropped soybeans into standing wheat to reduce nitrogen and herbicide inputs. Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in groundwater were significantly lower under the LISA system. Over 80% of the NT groundwater samples had NO3-N concentrations greater than 10 mgl-1, compared to only 4% for the LISA cropping system. Significantly lower soil mineral N to a depth of 180 cm was also observed. The NT soil had nearly twice as much mineral N present in the 90-180 an portion than the LISA cropping system.

AB Life, health and hygiene all depend on access to a plentiful supply of safe drinking water. Piped water supplies in rural Egypt are insufficient to meet the demands of the existing population. This situation is worsening due to the rapid population growth and failure of existing water supply systems.
   There are already areas of the country with severe piped water shortages. If corrective action is not taken soon densely populated villages will become vulnerable to outbreaks of waterborne diseases. Immediate action is needed to reverse the deterioration of water supply systems and to improve the benefits gained from capital works investments in the sector.
   This paper promotes the concept that sustainable water systems in rural Egypt depends on a central government and local unit partnership. Also needed are consumer bodies to determine user needs; local units to be given powers to manage    the revenue and expenditure accounts; and the central government to concentrate on setting policies and guidelines, and assisting with the implementation of major capital works.

AB Recent changes in legislation governing water quality management of receiving water bodies have led to a reappraisal of wastewater land disposal techniques. However, more stringent regulations have also necessitated the development of a multi-disciplinary planning approach, to ensure that land based wastewater disposal is functionally and environmentally sustainable in the long-term. Of principal concern are the long term impact of nutrients, salt and other potential contaminants on the soils of the receiving site and on downstream water quality. Assessment of hydrological, soil physical and geological characteristics, together with civil construction and service considerations, assist in the determination of receiving site selection, application area and balance storage volume, irrigation method, environmental monitoring system specification etc. Analysis and interpretation of wastewater and soil chemical characteristics determines the pre-application water treatment required, and allows long-term monitoring of the effect of wastewater disposal on the receiving-site soils. Two case-studies are presented. One describes the planning and design of a recently commissioned land-disposal system using industrial wastewater from a chemical process plant to irrigate a Eucalypt plantation in western metropolitan Melbourne. The other reports on the on-going assessment and planning of a large-scale land-disposal system proposed to accommodate the treated sewage effluent from a large north-west Victorian regional city.

AB The Bolivar Sewage Treatment Works (STW) processes the urban and industrial sewage from the northern and eastern suburbs of Adelaide. The treatment capacity is equivalent to the sewage production of 1.1 million people. The disposal of more than 40 000 ML of reclaimed water into the sea has caused a progressive degradation of about 950 ha of seagrass beds which threatens the sustainability of the fisheries and marine ecosystems of Gulf St. Vincent. The current practice will no longer be viable to achieve compliance with the SA Marine Environment Protection Act, 1990.
   A Inter-Departmental Working Party recommended that the Bolivar reclaimed water be disposed by irrigation of suitable land on the coastal plains north of Adelaide. They proposed the construction of two pipelines: a 12 km long pipeline to extend the distribution of reclaimed water in the most intense portion of the 3 500 hectares of irrigated horticulture on the Northern Adelaide Plains, and a second, 18 km long pipeline to deliver the remainder to a more northerly site for irrigation of an estimated 4 000 hectares of hardwood plantations.
   The paper summarizes the findings as they relate to public health, environmental, technical and financial aspects of land based disposal. Land based disposal would completely eliminate the marine degradation and also arrest the over-use of the NAP underground water resources for horticulture. The total net costs over thirty years for land bared disposal are about $ 21.8 million. The 'horticultural' pipeline of the land based disposal scheme is expected to be commercially viable. A shortfall in revenue from the afforestation component is expected and may need to be considered as an environmental cost of ceasing marine disposal.

ID JAMUNA FLOODPLAIN; EROSION HAZARD; FLOODS; ADJUSTMENTS
AB Since the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the country experienced four abnormally high floods. This study examines causes and impacts of the 1988 flood and evaluates the range of possible human adjustments in mitigating such hazards. Although deforestation and other human modifications of the natural environment, through implementation of flood-related engineering schemes along the upstream reaches of the rivers, may partially cause abnormal floods in the downstream zones, the physical and geographical characteristics of the region provide much of the explanation. It is argued that physical prevention of floods, through means of ''technological fix,'' is likely to pose serious threats to long-term sustainability of floodplain ecology and sociocultural resources of Bangladesh.

AB This paper documents the decline in investment rates observed in developing countries after 1982, and explores analytically and empirically the factors contributing to explain it. The paper focuses on the impact of macroeconomic adjustment and reform measures on private investment, particularly in Latin America and East Asia, and underscores the importance of macroeconomic uncertainty, policy credibility, and potential coordination failures in shaping the response of investment to the changes in economic incentives brought about by structural reforms. The analysis concludes with some policy recommendations to improve the design of sustainable, growth-oriented adjustment programs.

TI INBREEDING AND FITNESS IN CAPTIVE POPULATIONS - LESSONS FROM DROSOPHILA
SO ZOO BIOLOGY

DE CAPTIVE BREEDING; GENETIC VARIATION; MALE-MATING ABILITY; REINTRODUCTION
AB The avoidance of inbreeding is a primary goal of endangered species population management. In order to fully understand the effects of inbreeding on the fitness of natural and captive populations, it is necessary to consider fitness components which span the entire life cycle of the organism. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for conservation genetics studies, we constructed 18 experimental lines derived from wild-type stocks which were homozygous for chromosome 2 (this chromosome constitutes 38% of the genome or is equivalent to F = 0.38). For six of these lines which exhibited a reduced homozygous fitness, we estimated the relative values of fitness components operating at both the juvenile stage (pre-adult viability) and adult stage (female fecundity and male-mating ability) of the life cycle. Males in these lines showed a markedly reduced mating ability, while viability and female fecundity were much less affected. Equilibrium values of the wild-type chromosomes in these lines were accurately predicted using a model that incorporated into it these independently estimated fitness components. These results emphasize the importance of studying all fitness components directly to determine overall fitness. A reduced mating ability among inbred males of a captive population can have serious consequences for its future sustainability, and can further jeopardize reintroduction efforts; consequently, a program to carefully monitor the reproductive success of individual males, as well as other fitness components, is recommended.

AB Adventure travel is one of the fastest growing but least understood forms of international tourism. Its role in the economic development of remote world places and its impact on local society, economy, and the environment are not fully comprehended, even though adventure tourism has been adopted enthusiastically by many Third World nations. The paper analyzes adventure travel in Nepal and places it within the theoretical frameworks of tourism models and sustainable development. Building on core-periphery tourism theory, an adventure travel spatial-linkage model is proposed that connects Nepal's remote frontiers with the global tourism economy. Within this model, adventure tourists move through a hierarchy of travel gateways before reaching adventure destinations located among isolated, subsistence populations. This movement produces a unique structure of tourism space that in tum contributes to the formation in Nepal of regional developments such as hilltown gateways, hinterland tourism destinations, and multi-use parklands. An adventure tourism impact model relates tourism problems associated with exceeding social and environmental carrying capacities. It also includes more positive impacts linked to converging the interests of Nepal's national economy, indigenous populations, tourists, and conservation development. With its steady growth, adventure tourism in Nepal will play an increasingly important role for national and local development in the frontier areas.

TI THE ROLE OF THE INDUSTRY COMMISSION IN RELATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND
   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The Industry Commission is the Australian government's independent advisory body on industry and industry matters. The Commission's role is to make recommendations on ways to improve the nation's overall economic performance. It performs this task by holding public inquiries and producing reports that are presented to the parliament.
   While the Commission's perspective is economic efficiency, it is required to report on the environmental consequences of its findings. One of the commissioners is required to have expertise in such matters.
   The extent to which it has met this challenge is illustrated by reference to a number of inquiry reports. The Commission has found that both economic efficiency gains and better environmental outcomes can go hand in hand, but it has recognised that the intergenerational equity prescription underpinning the concept of sustainable development is an ethical issue beyond the limits of economics.

TI MARKET INTERVENTION OR REGULATIONS - THE EXAMPLE OF THE NETHERLAND
   FERTILIZER POLICY
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB The Netherlands strives for a comprehensive solution to the management of mineral and organic fertilizers. Its Fertilizer Act established a manure bank and an animal wastes concentration system with the purpose to redistribute excess manure to areas in need of fertilizers. Farmers are required to maintain records on manure generated and used. SurPlus manure has to be offered to manure concentration plants. This pollution control policy is mainly based on regulation and heavy subsidies for concentration plant investments.
   Within the paper this regulatory at are approach is compared with market based incentives as levy on mineral fertilizer, levy on purchased feed, levy on mineral and organic nutrients and EC-price reform. To this purpose a partial equilibrium model in a multioutput-multiinput framework for twelve provinces of the Netherlands has been developed. Effects of the different market interactions are examined on output supplies, input demands, shadow prices for milk and sugar, value added and nutrient surplus.
   The results document that nutrient surplus reduction will be most pronounced if a generell levy on mineral and organic nutrients will be imposed. Nutrient surplus remains almost unchanged if the EC-price reform will be undertaken. If levies will be reimbursed value added will increase in the case of implementation of a levy on mineral fertilizers. This is caused by a substantial substitution of mineral by still unused organic fertilizers. A levy on purchased feed and a general levy on all fertilizers cause a minor decline in value added even if these levies will be reimbursed.
   The levy on mineral fertilizers induces the lowest adjustment cost. If the Dutch Government decides to implement the regulatory fertilizer programme the adjustment cost will be higher too compared with the general nutrient levy and the levy on purchased feed. But with these market based incentives nutrient surplus problems will not be solved in most of the provinces of the Netherlands. Therefore a general levy on all fertilizers will be required and restrictions or quotas on livestock have to be imposed to reduce the nutrient surplus and to allow for sustainable development.

TI PROGRESS AND THE BIOSPHERE - THE DIALECTICS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SO CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN
LA English
DT Article
AB Progress has become synonymous with economic growth and development. At the same time geographers and others have noted dramatic changes to the quantity and quality of the earth's resources, and evidence of increasing inequality in human welfare globally. New prescriptions for economic development have become commonplace. This paper explores the necessity for change in the relations between economic and environmental systems. Some of the major environmental deficiencies in the operation of our economic systems are analyzed to provide the basis for a fuller understanding of the logistics of growth and development. The genesis and evolution of the concept of sustainable development are then discussed. The core of the paper considers the dialectical relations between forms of economic development and changes to natural capital. An attempt is made to reconcile some of the more pronounced differences in the interpretations of and prescriptions for sustainable development. It is argued that the context of development, defined in spatial and temporal terms, ultimately influences the type and range of growth options available to societies. Improvements in general welfare can, however, be achieved through a convergence of new growth strategies for regions and countries across the development spectrum. It is through this new approach to growth that progress is redefined.

AB Sustainable development requires that resources are used as conservationally and as optimally as possible in order to maintain an adequate resource-base for future generations. It is not an easily-defined concept, nor is there any single way of achieving it. It does, however, focus on the environment, as this provides the resource-base that supports all society. Among the recently-evolved scientific developments, biotechnology has many applications that can improve resource-use. It involves the manipulation of organisms to undertake specific processes and includes genetic manipulation or 'engineering'.
   In an environmental context, biotechnology has its greatest contribution to make in agriculture - especially by improving crop-yields. It offers opportunities to design crops for specific environments and to make crops more efficient producers of food-energy than otherwise. Biotechnology can thus manipulate primary energy-flows; it can also reduce fossil-fuel energy inputs into agricultural systems. It could also contribute to the mitigation of environmental problems such as deforestation and soil erosion. Both food- and fuel-energy resources are key components of sustainability. Sources produced biotechnologically, e.g. SCPs and biomass fuels, can supplement those produced conventionally.
   Resource recovery and recycling, and hazardous-waste disposal, are other environmentally-beneficial facets of biotechnology. These are equally pertinent to sustainable development because they extend the resource-base. In this context, biotechnology constitutes a vehicle for the improved manipulation of biogeochemical cycles.
   There are, however, potentially significant drawbacks in the use of biotechnology. These focus on technology transfer between the Developed and Developing World; this is economic and political, and relates to intellectual property rights, etc. Environmentally, the disadvantages concern the potential creation of 'ecological ogres' which could generate ecological disasters. Moreover, biotechnology relies heavily on the availability of a sustainable gene-pool, i.e. on biodiversity; indeed the two are interdependent. The high rates of extinction of plant and animal species that are currently occurring are thus limiting biotechnological opportunities for the future.

   LANDSCAPE
AB Large-scale forest conversion in Brazil, primarily to cattle pasture, contributes significantly to the global anthropogenic emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. An alternative land-use, namely extractive reserves for forest residents, may serve as one means of using Amazonian forests sustainably and of maintaining carbon in living matter rather than adding it to that in the atmosphere.
   In the Seringal (former rubber estate) Porongaba (6,800 ha) of the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, Acre, Brazil, primary forest still covers more than 90% of the area. Total biomass in primary forest is estimated at 426 tons per ha, equivalent to 213 t C per ha. Rubber tappers effectively maintain about 60,000 tons of carbon per household (family unit) in forest biomass and thus out of the atmosphere. Deforestation of primary forest was less than 0.6% per yr - much less than rates of natural disturbances for other neotropical forests.
   Slash-and-burn agriculture in the Seringal Porongaba releases carbon at a gross rate of some 200 t C per yr per household. Net releases are much less, as regrowth forests absorb carbon at rates of about 9 t C per ha per yr. The net areal flux of carbon to the atmosphere from land-use in Seringal is much less than one ton of carbon per ha per yr, which is equivalent to less than 0.3% per yr of the carbon stock in forest biomass. If Seringal Porongaba is typical of the three million hectares in extractive reserves in Brazilian Amazonia, then these reserves are calculated to retain 0.6 Gigatons of carbon in the terrestrial biota.
   Adverse changes in income patterns for rubber tappers could lead to abandonment of extractive reserves or increased deforestation within them. Diversification and improvement of income from non-timber forest products are needed to maintain rubber tappers in extractive reserves. Most beneficiaries of carbon storage in these and other reserves live outside Brazil; devising means of recompensation for these benefits is a challenge for the global society.

AB Genuine or American mahogany is obtained from trees of the genus Swietenia (S. mahagoni, S. macrophylla, and S. humilis), and is one of the premier timbers of international commerce. The trade in mahogany commenced almost five centuries ago with S. mahagoni from the Caribbean; but following 'commercial' extinction of this resource, trade became centred on mahogany populations in South and Central America (S. macrophylla). The trade in mahogany is predominantly from primary forests, and has led to population and genetic resource declines - particularly in the Caribbean and Central America. More recently, there have been an increasing number of 'commercial' extinctions in South America. As the resource declines, pressures mount to accelerate the illegal extraction of mahogany from National Parks and lands reserved for indigenous ('Indian') peoples. Inability to control this trade threatens mahogany populations and genetic resources throughout its range, at the same time adversely affecting the livelihoods of indigenous peoples in the process.
   Mahogany often regenerates poorly following logging operations that are conducted using current management practices, and further research is required to determine the optimum biological and economic conditions for in situ silviculture. Attempts to cultivate mahogany in plantations have met with little success in the Americas, due mainly to effects of the shoot-borer (Hypsipyla grandella), a moth larva that damages terminal shoots, so leading to excessive branching and reduced timber value (Figs 3 and 4). The success of mahogany plantations in the neotropics will require the development of an integrated pest-management system, perhaps involving the incorporation of pest-resistant genotypes within agro-forestry or mixed plantation systems.
   It is vital that appropriate silvicultural and trade practices are adopted to ensure sustainable mahogany extraction, while at the same time conserving an adequate population and genetic resource-base. To this end, effective trade monitoring and resource-regulation measures must be introduced to assist in controlling illegal trade and to encourage a scientifically managed, sustainable, utilization of mahogany. Two of the three mahogany species, S. humilis and S. mahagoni, have been listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The third and only other recognized species of Swietenia, S. macrophylla, should also be considered for listing in CITES Appendix II, thereby benefiting from the international trade-monitoring and resource regulation requirements consequent upon such listing.

AB The design of structures for fish passage in rivers and streams provides an opportunity to apply expert system concepts to a design problem. Fishways contribute to the sustainable development of water resources projects by providing a path that allows fish migrations to be maintained. A prototype expert system (FDES) has been developed to recommend the most suitable fishway type for given design conditions. A recommendation is provided on the basis of fishway hydraulics, fish passage performance, and cost requirements. Fishway design demands expertise in various scientific disciplines such as hydrology, hydraulics, and fish biology. Expert system technology may be used to reduce design time requirements and to serve as a teaching aid to inexperienced engineers by organizing and accessing the cumulative knowledge of the most experienced designers. The rule-based expert system development tool, VP-Expert, supplies the backward chaining control structure for accessing the knowledge within the prototype.

AB The 20th anniversary of the filing of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) affords an opportunity to assess retrospectively the environmental impacts of the resultant North Slope oil fields, now the largest single source of U.S. domestic oil production. As the oil field expanded, particularly to near-shore areas such as the Endicott Development, additional EIS documents were prepared to assess impacts not included in the original TAPS EIS. In the ensuing years, numerous agency-monitored and industry-sponsored environmental monitoring studies, estimated to average $4 million per year, have been conducted in and around the oil field, making the Alaskan North Slope one of the most studied environments in North America.
   In this paper, the EIS requirement of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is examined as a predictive environmental risk assessment. A tabulated summary of the predicted environmental impacts from the original TAPS and offshore Endicott Development EIS documents is compared with the extensive amount of resultant monitoring data. These data confirm localized impacts to air and water quality; however, regulated discharges remain well below criteria established for the protection of human health and the environment. As predicted, some unavoidable habitat losses to resident and migratory wildlife have occurred within the oil field and pipeline corridors. Approximately 2% of the land surface in developed portions of the oil field was actually altered. However, careful monitoring of wildlife populations demonstrates that no species has experienced a measurable decline, and most continue to utilize oil field habitat for breeding, nesting, and summer forage. As habitat does not appear to be limiting the growth of North Slope caribou herds, the Central Arctic Herd has been able to accommodate the incremental habitat loss due to the oil field and has shown a sevenfold increase in numbers since the oil field development began in the early 1970s. Offshore monitoring data for the gravel causeways verify the predicted small, localized effects on water circulation and show the possibility is low that fish are experiencing resulting significant negative effects.
   The challenge faced in the EIS process is not how to ensure zero impact, as this is not a realistic goal, but instead it is how to predict impacts and describe mitigation measures accurately to ensure that the resultant ecological responses remain within a normal range of ecosystem oscillations that can be used to describe sustainable development. This review demonstrates that in the EIS process, a well-designed program using the best available field data can indeed provide a relatively accurate prediction of subsequent impacts.

ID EASTERN AMAZONIA; ABANDONED PASTURES
AB The Brazilian wood industry is highly mobile. Over the past 20 years the eastern Amazon developed from a logging backwater to the principal hardwood processing center in Brazil. This occurred because of a decline in hardwood stocks in the south of Brazil coupled with the development of good transport. energy, and communications systems in eastern Amazonia.
   We studied the structure and economy of the wood industry along a 340 km stretch of the Belem-Brasilia Highway in eastern Amazonia. Of the 238 sawmills present in this study region in late 1989. 79% were installed in the 1980s. Ninety-seven percent of the mill owners came from outside Amazonia. Most (63%) of the mill establishments were vertically integrated, engaging in both forest mill processing and forest logging.
   Logging establishments realize substantial profits. A typical sawmill with one band saw produces. on average, 4300 m3 of sawnwood year-1 from 9200 m3 of roundwood. The value of this sawn production is estimated at $670 800 or $156 m-3. Production costs are $116 m-3 giving an annual mill profit of $170 000. For firms engaged in both logging and processing activities, annual profits were estimated at $217 000 (profit margin, 32%) or $900 ha-1 logged.
   An average of six trees were harvested per hectare in logging operations (n = 3 study areas) and the volume yield averaged 38 m3 ha-1. Damages to the forest during logging are significant. Twenty-seven trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh are severely damaged for each tree harvested. This damage occurs in the opening of approximately 40 m of logging road and 600 m2 of canopy per tree harvested. Vines are favored by these open conditions and forest fires are possible.
   Forest management is technically feasible but economically unattractive. Natural regeneration is abundant on logged sites: 4300 seedlings and saplings of economic species were registered per hectare. Stocking of larger trees of economic species with good form is also adequate: 16 trees ha-1 greater than or equal to 30 cm dbh. This residual stock could be favored by vine cutting and refinement thinnings at an estimated cost of $180 ha-1. Although these treatments result in increased growth rates. the projected return on management investments is low, Nonetheless, given the robust profits in the wood sector, profit margins would remain well above 20% if management were mandated by law.
   At present the biggest impediment to forest management in the eastern Amazon is the undervaluing of the timber resource. Ranchers, who own most forest land. sell harvest rights to loggers at low prices - %50-%150 ha-1. After the logging teams extract the timber, these same ranchers are left with badly damaged forest tracts. With careful extraction and management procedures, harvests could be accomplished on a 30- to 40-year rotation and forest integrity could be maintained. Ranchers, insofar as they control the forest resource, have the power to guarantee its wise use. They could do this by supervising harvest operations on their lands to reduce damage and by raising the price of their timber and using this additional revenue to finance simple silvicultural operations.

A number ot disciplines and intellectual traditions, including systems thinking, risk and ecology, are surveyed briefly as sources to inform an approach to this challenge. Approaches to managing risk and uncertainty are discussed, a typology of resilience constructed, and an approach to sustainability defined.  The discussion is based on the three imperatives of constant change, ever-present uncertainty and ignorance, and an increasingly stressed interdependency between humans and the biosphere.

AB Cut-flower production in Bolivia is a growing economic activity with sales increasing > 10-fold in the past 6 years. In spite of this growth, Bolivian producers face considerable financial difficulties. Two distinct patterns emerged from this study. Small and medium growers experienced lower costs than larger producers, but the prices they received were also lower. Large operators received twice the small producer price for their flowers, but this gain was offset by the higher costs they had incurred. In the long term, neither selling too low nor operating at costs too high is a sustainable practice.

TI SUSTAINABILITY OF CROPPING SYSTEMS UNDER DRYLAND CONDITIONS OF VERTISOL
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
LA English
DT Article
AB An experiment was conducted during 1983-90 on Vertisol to study the sustainability of cropping systems under rainfed condition. Gram (Cicer arietinum L.) crop was - sustainable than sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.). Inclusion of gram in system was more beneficial than continuously growing sorghum or safflower. Grain yield of winter sorghum was improved by 34%, stover by 45%, monetary returns by Rs 2,066/ha and that of safflower wed by 14% and monetary returns by Rs 628/ha owing to inclusion of gram crop in the system compared with continuously growing either sorghum or safflower. Sustainability-yield index was also higher when gram crop was included in the system. Half the recommended. level of fertilizer was found adequate compared with the recommended level of fertilizer application to sorghum and safflower under dry-farming conditions. However, additional monetary returns (Rs 560/ha) were obtained with recommended level of fertilizer to gram crop. Previous year cropping of gram with recommended level of fertilizer showed the advantage over current year's cropping of sorghum at 50 kg N/ha. Continuous growing of safflower increased the incidence of Rhizoctonia bataticola.

TI THE LATE STAGES OF TRANSITION TO TURBULENCE IN CHANNEL FLOW
SO JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS
LA English
DT Article
ID BOUNDARY-LAYER; SHEAR FLOWS; MOTIONS
AB The late stages of transition, from the LAMBDA-vortex stage up to turbulence, are investigated by postprocessing data from a direct numerical simulation of the complete K-type transition process in plane channel flow at a Reynolds number of 5000 (based on channel half-width and laminar centreline velocity). The deterministic roll-up of the high-shear layer that forms around the LAMBDA-vortices is examined in detail. The new vortices arising from this process are visualized by plotting three-dimensional surfaces of constant pressure. Five vortices are observed, with one of these developing into a strong hairpin-shaped vortex. Interactions between the different vortices, and between the two channel halves, are found to be important. In the very last stage of transition second-generation shear layers are observed to form and roll up into new vortices. It is postulated that at this stage a sustainable mechanism of wall-bounded turbulence exists in an elementary form. The features which are locally present include high wall shear, sublayer streaks, ejections and sweeps. Large-scale energetic vortices are found to be an important part of the mechanism by which the turbulence spreads to other spanwise positions. The generality of the findings are discussed with reference to data from simulations of H-type and mixed-type transition.

TI FROM EXPERIENCE - AVOIDING MARKETINGS BEST-OF-THE-BEST SPECIFICATION
   TRAP
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCT INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Too often companies fall into a trap when developing a list of performance specifications for a new product. Milton Rosenau calls this the best-of-the-best specification trap. The problem arises whenever a company bases a specification on the combination of the best single features observed in available competitive products. When this happens, the new product's design is driven by competition and is not derived from a unique market insight. This may not provide the basis for a sustainable advantage. Sometimes, rumors of competitive improvements may even lead to sudden changes in the specification, creating delays in the development process. A far better goal is to develop a specification that responds to an unrecognized and unfilled user need, one that adds high value to users. His points are illustrated with several examples.

DE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; ORGANIC FERTILIZER; CROP ROTATION
AB Mordern agriculture, based on the monoculture of cash crop varieties that require high inputs, depends on heavy applications of inorganic fertilizers and on chemical pestisides for pest control. Although this kind of farm practice has contributed greatly to the agricultural productivity in the past years, however, monoculture often leads to excess production of a crop which causes a drop of farm price and eventually to decrease farm income. Rice production in Taiwan is a good example. On the other hand, this chemically oriented intensive farming system will cause soil erosion and polution of underground water. The sustainability of modern agriculture has become a subject of great concern to policy makers, researchers and farmers in Taiwan. Research into sustainable agriculture systems has been conducted by various research institutes in Taiwan. The problem encountered in implementing sustainable agriculture in Taiwan are discussed based on the results of experimental data, with regard to the following factors : (1)soil nurient management, (2) applications of organic matter to soil, (3)crop rotation and interplanting, (4)minimum tillage, (5)integrated pest management, (6)non-chemical pesticides and (7)weed management. Current government policies are discussed. The dissemination of sustainable agriculture technology to farmers through govermental organizations, and methods of organic farming practiced by farmers in Taiwan are also described.

AB The objective of this study was to compare the physical properties of soils between sustainable and conventional farming systems. Two experimental fields were located at Chishan and Lutsao in the southern part of Taiwan. Three treatments ( i. e. sustainable, conventional and intermediate farming) were conducted. Each treatment had two rotation sequences with six crops (Sesbania roxburgii, cabbage, sweet corn, vegetable soybean, rice and radish), and a cycle of a rotation took two years. During the four years' farming activites, soil samples were taken after the harvest of each rice crop for the determination of moisture content, bulk density, total porosity and aggregate stability of the surface soils.
   The moisture contents and aggregate stabilities of the surface soils taken from sustainable farms of two expermental fields were higher than those from conventional farms in the first rotation, and significantly higher than those from conventional farm in the second rotation.The bulk densities of the surface soils of sustainable farms were lower than those of conventional farms. Whether the differences in both treatment reached the statistically significant level, they depend on the experimental locations and rotation sequences. During the second rotation, the total porosities of surface soils of sustainable farms were higher than those of conventional farms. However, the differences were not statistically significant.

AB Direct effects of a red tide (Ptychodiscus brevis) outbreak on bay scallops Argopecten irradians concentricus in North Carolina, USA, from October 1987 to February 1988 were necessarily limited to the 2 generations then present (adults of the year-class fished in winter 1987-88 and their progeny harvested in 1988-89), yet the 3 subsequent year-classes of bay scallops (those fished in the 1989-90, 1990-91, and 1991-92 winter seasons) also have been extremely depressed. The fishery crashed to about 10 to 15 % of the recent (25 yr) historical average harvest: no recovery has yet begun. This inability to recover quickly along with evidence of a previous gradual (5 to 12 yr) though erratic recovery from low population size in the early 1970's implies that this scallop population may be recruitment-limited at low density. Sampling of adults in August just before spawning and of new recruits surviving until early December in both 1988 and 1989 revealed that recruitment was positively related to adult abundance. This relationship was assessed across 9 bay scallop grounds in North Carolina. Settlement onto spat collector bags deployed at these sites during early autumn also tended to follow the same patterns of adult and recruit abundance among sites in 1988 but not in 1989. Patterns of adult and recruit abundance were broadly coherent across water bodies, with densities in Core Sound high, Back Sound relatively low, and Bogue Sound extremely low. Compared to identical sampling conducted during 3 years just preceeding the red tide outbreak, average autumn recruitment rates of bay scallops for 1988 and 1989 were normal in Core Sound, about 29 % of normal in Back Sound, and about 5 % of normal in Bogue Sound. This pattern continues to conform to the documented pattern of immediate direct effects of the red tide. Changes in area of its seagrass habitat appear incapable of explaining the sound-specific pattern of bay scallop declines following the red tide. This coherence of population dynamics on a basin scale implies that the bay scallop may be recruitment-limited at low density by mesoscale or sound-wide abundance of spawning adults, creating lasting effects of the red tide propagated through basin-scale population inertia. Recruitment limitation for an exploited species would have important consequences for sustainability of harvest, if based on an effective stock-recruitment relationship, and may imply need for management intervention to enhance spawning stock within depleted basins.

AB Arid and semiarid areas face increasing demands on their limited water supplies. In many regions agriculture utilizes the bulk of the available fresh water, often exceeding the sustainable water yield and relying on utilization of subsurface reserves. Increased water demands by urban users will require greater water use efficiency by the agricultural sector as well as use of urban waste waters and under-utilized brackish waters. To date advances have been made in irrigation management, but genetic research has not altered the basic water requirements of plants.

TI SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN NEW-CALEDONIA
SO PACIFIC AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses the issue of sustainable development in New Caledonia and the consequences of this for the future self-determination of the territory.  Specifically, it asks whether New Caledonia will benefit from the development program known as the Matignon accords or whether it will be adversely affected by it.  Will the Matignon accords lead to the ecologically sustainable growth which is necessary for long-term economic independence?
   The author argues that the current development policies in New Caledonia should not be limited to the economic level alone.  For development to be truly sustainable, native wisdom and knowledge need to be incorporated into the development paradigm being used to implement socioeconomic change in the territory - not only at the grassroots level but at the national policy level as well.

ID AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION; WORLD
AB Improving the effectiveness of public sector organizations in developing countries has become a major focus for national governments and foreign aid agencies. This study reviews the experience of a major organizational reform strategy, the training and visit system of extension, that has operated for more than 20 years. Several lessons drawn from this experience are that aid donors must: (i) eschew their preference for organizational blueprints and recognize the contingent nature of reforms; (ii) recognize that many public sector organizations have only a small 'controlled' decision-making space and thus pay more attention to 'influenceable' decision-making opportunities; (iii) acknowledge that machine model approaches are likely to reinforce the negative aspects of hierarchical control in bureaucracies, and; (iv) pay much more attention to organizational sustainability in terms of finance and strategic management capacity.

ID FARMER EDUCATION; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY
AB Studies of business organizations reveal the importance of combining two elements for mobilizing and aligning action in large organizations: informed decision making and contingent incentives. A national development programme in Indonesia tested both elements under exceptionally demanding conditions. The Government of Indonesia ended its subsidy of agricultural pesticides in the late 1980s, and it sought to prepare its large but poorly educated farming population in the use of ecologically based integrated pest management (IPM) methods. With a staff of 2,000 trainers by the early 1990s and a curriculum emphasizing information analysis and management decisions, the Indonesian national IPM programme created a capacity to train as many as 50,000 farmers per growing season. Field studies, trainee surveys and other evidence reveal that, consistent with national programme objectives, (1) pesticide applications were reduced by more than 60 per cent; (2) pesticide use depended more on field decisions, less on prescriptions; (3) small landholders were as likely as large holders to master IPM techniques; (4) IPM-trained farmers experienced no loss in rice yield and significant savings in pesticide expense; (5) IPM-trained farmers sought to share the new information and skills with other farmers. Together, informed decision making and contingent incentives provided the organizational foundation for a sustainable national change in agricultural methods.

AB A decade after its inception, the International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) adopted a social science component. Health social science concepts were added to a physician training curriculum encompassing epidemiology, biostatistics and clinical economics, and a position was created for qualified social scientists at 26 clinical epidemiology units in developing country medical schools. This paper describes the INCLEN model for strengthening partnerships among clinical epidemiologists and social scientists. The rationale for interdisciplinary training is presented along with the difficulties inherent in attracting social scientists to a new career path. These include problems of recruitment, training curricula, re-entry, and career sustainability. The need is identified for collaborative international efforts to promote an infrastructure for professional growth and sustainable careers in health social science.

TI INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND DEMOCRACY - ASSESSING EFFORTS TO ASSIST
   POSTCOMMUNIST DEVELOPMENT
SO STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article surveys political development frameworks for analyzing the post-Communist transition to political democracy. Parallels with postcolonial events in Third World countries should caution against overoptimism about the prospects for mutually reinforcing economic and political development. In general, the study of Third World political development suggests that rapid regime transition with low mass participation is unlikely to result in sustainable democratic politics, especially where severe economic dislocations are present. High rates of participation during regime change may lead to rapid disillusionment with the performance of postrevolutionary government.
   It is thus argued that states wishing, for various reasons, to assist in smoothing the transition from communism should pay heed to the cautionary experience of Third World development assistance and monitor the political dimensions of the transformation, such as the stability of coalition governments, electoral turnout, ethnonationalism, as well as the orthodox economic indicators like inflation and rates of domestic investment. With respect to international assistance to the former Communist countries of Eastern and Central Europe, the article shows that the capacity of the Group of Twenty Four (G-24) donors to aid economic recovery is well below what is requested, or needed. Despite hosting a donor summit, the United States is taking a far less prominent role in the post-Cold War donor community than was the case in the analogous program for post-World War II recovery. This is having an impact on both volume and coordination of assistance. Finally, a strong, possibly ideological, preference among donors for finding private sector recipients for the bulk of assistance may erode the capacity of the post-Communist states to provide both infrastructure and political stability needed for investor confidence.
   Those making decisions about levels and modes of Western assistance should look beyond economic indicators of privatization as criteria for continued support and retain, where possible, political development objectives in both financial and project assistance. While we must not assume that the record of supporting democracy in Central and Eastern Europe will prove to be any better than in many Third World regimes, the greater security salience of Eastern Europe's stability adds urgency to the task of applying political development lessons to the post-Communist experience.

TI TECHNOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS OF INTERNATIONAL-COOPERATION AND SUSTAINABLE
   DEVELOPMENT
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB Just when planners in the South started to accept technological development as being central to their economic growth, the North came to realize that inappropriate use of technology threatens the future development of mankind. Clearly, both development and utilization of technology need to be managed properly. Therefore, with general environmental awareness high on the global agenda, socioeconomic planning emphasis nowadays is rightly on sustainable development. However, most suggested prescriptions for sustainable development appear as if the presently technology-controlling North is imposing its rules and restrictions upon the late-starter South, though inadvertently, without due consideration of the essential need for technological leapfrogging. It is also clear that in an increasingly technologically interdependent world, globally sustainable development certainly calls for still further advancement of technology and the promotion of international technology transactions that are economically efficient, commercially attractive, environmentally sound, and, at the same time, will lead to the realization of the principle of self-reliance for all. This paper attempts to draw attention to the current concerns regarding technology cooperation and sustainable development (both positive and negative) being expressed in the international arena; it also presents a general framework for measures necessary for developing countries' own implementation before they would be able to join the early-starter North in achieving international sustainable development.

AB The Hodgkin-Huxley equation for electrogenesis in the voltage clamped squid giant axon was used to predict the effect of altering maximal Na+ conductance (g(Na)max+) on the repetitive firing process. The main finding was that increasing g(Na)max+, without changing any other membrane parameter, reduced the threshold current required to evoke repetitive firing. That is, it rendered the membrane hyperexcitable. Threshold for evoking single action potentials was also affected, but much less so. Other consequences of increasing g(Na)max+ were a decrease in the minimum sustainable rhythmic firing frequency (mRFF), a monotonic increase in firing frequency at any given suprathreshold stimulus intensity, an increase in the current value at which intense depolarizing stimuli block rhythmogenesis, an increase in the maximal sustainable firing frequency using intense currents (MRFF), and the consequent expansion of the dynamic range for stimulus encoding. Thus, the control of g(Na)max+ through the regulation of Na+ channel synthesis and membrane incorporation at sites of rhythmogenesis (e.g. axon hillock-initial segment region, or peripheral sensory endings) is a potential regulatory mechanism for neuronal excitability and stimulus encoding.

AB Mangroves form a unique ecosystem of limited extent covering an area of about 53 000 ha along the Kenyan coast which need protection from overexploitation. Background information on the areal extent and status of these mangroves is limited and makes their protection and management difficult.
   A model study has been carried out on the Mida Creek mangroves based on a double sampling approach starting with SPOT multispectral satellite imagery followed by ground checks to provide information on species composition, density and distribution of mangroves. The utilization of mangroves and uses around and within the mangroves were determined.
   During this study, seven mangrove species were identified in Mida Creek, namely: Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia alba, Xylocarpus granatum and Lumnitzera racemosa. This report briefly outlines the present utilisation of mangrove species. It is recommended that a multidisciplinary management plan be developed in order to conserve and manage the mangroves of Kenya on a sustainable yield basis.

AB The purpose of this review is to examine the current knowledge of the role of trees in providing shelter for pastures, crops, and livestock, for controlling erosion of soils and improving productivity and sustainability of agricultural production in Australia - and the extent to which this knowledge has been applied. Land degradation - tree loss and associated soil salinity, water and wind erosion, soil acidification, soil structural decline arid nutrient degradation - is evidence that our primary production systems are not sustainable. We have sought increased production without proper consideration of the ecological context of that system. About half of Victoria's crop and pasture lands are affected or at risk, and in Western Australia about 25% of the cleared agricultural land is wind-eroded and 60% is potentially susceptible, salinity affects 0.43 m ha and half of the divertible surface water is affected by salinity. Similar problems occur in other States. At least 43 m ha or 13% of our rangelands are seriously degraded by wind erosion caused by overgrazing, often coinciding with drought or a run of drier years. 'Minimum tillage' and stubble management for erosion control in cropping has been a major extension and research activity in Australian agriculture. Severe weather, combined with imperfect adoption of appropriate grazing and crop management systems, shows the weakness of complete reliance on these methods of erosion control. An effective system must accommodate the impact of extreme events, which are the most damaging. However, the complementary use of windbreaks to reduce soil erosion is rare, and their establishment has not been promoted, despite the wide-spread adoption of this technology by other countries.
   In the cropping and higher rainfall grazing areas, the systematic planting of 10% of the land in a net of shelterbelts/timberbelts/clusters could achieve a 50% windspeed reduction; this would substantially improve livestock and pasture production in the short and long-term. Wind erosion could be dramatically reduced and crop production probably increased by the use of windbreaks. Wheat and oat yield at Rutherglen (Victoria), and lupin yield at Esperance (Western Australia), were increased in the sheltered zone by 22% and 47%, and 30%. respectively.
   In semi-arid and dry temperate areas, planting of 5% of the land to shelter could reduce windspeed by 30-50% and soil loss by up to 80%. This planting would also contribute substantially to achieving other objectives of sustainable agriculture. Agroforestry -particularly timberbelts applications - will be important in the long-term strategy for achieving revegetation. If some of the trees yield a marketable product then the adoption of the system will be more readily achieved.
   In the arid (pastoral) areas there is an urgent need to promote the ethic that preservation and improvement of the perennial grass and shrub vegetation is critical for die protection of the soil and maintenance of land capability. Control of animal grazing remains die sole means of preventing erosion in much of this zone. While satellite imagery allows us to assess the condition of leasehold lands, we have failed to achieve stocking policies that will halt the degradation of our rangelands.

AB Agroforestry in the Australian environment has potentials to rehabilitate land from further degradation; improve agricultural productivity; produce timber; and contribute to diversification and increase in farm income. These benefits are examined using available information from research. The level of adoption of agroforestry by Australian farmers for these purposes is also determined. Summaries of research results provide the basis for advice that scientists can offer to farmer and decision makers.

AB About 21% of agricultural land in Australia is seriously degraded by salination and wind erosion. Trees can contribute to overcoming these problems. There is potential for trees to also produce wood, thereby diversifying farmers' incomes. reducing Australia's bill for importing wood and increasing exports of wood products. Even though mann of these multiple purpose plantings would be widely scattered and growth rates low in some regions, Australian farmers should have a comparative advantage in wood production because trees also provide substantial landcare and agricultural productivity benefits. The establishment of new industries based on wood from farmland requires leadership from Government, planning at national, regional and local levels, and innovative techniques to finance planting. Removal of taxation disincentives for wood producers and the introduction of legislation to allow profit a prendre contracts would provide more favourable conditions for investment.

AB The soil as a resouce in potato production must be maintained if potato production is to be sustained into the 21st century. Increased pest resistance, resource scarcity, and increased input costs will all be important in determining the availability of technology in the future. As demands to maintain and improve environmental quality increase. our ability to overcome poor soil management by increased inputs may be restricted.
   To sustain soil as a resource more attention must be given to soil organic matter, structure, and water holding capacity. Cropping systems that increase crop residue returned to the soil and reduce tillage can increase soil organic matter levels and improve soil physical properties. Green-manure crops may also help reduce pathogen populations.
   Soil compaction, soil erosion, and salinization represent the most significant threats to maintaining the soil resource. Compaction can significantly limit the soil's ability to supply water and nutrients to the plant by limiting water holding capacity and root growth. Limiting rooting depth increases the potential for nitrates to be leached below the rooting zone. Erosion, through the removal of the most productive topsoil, has the potential to destroy soil productivity. The actual impact of erosion over time is very difficult to measure and has been compensated for by increased inputs. Salinization throughout history has decreased productivity of irrigated soils.
   The sustainability of the soil resource depends upon the development and use of Best Management Practices that maintain or improve soil physical properties, while minimizing soil compaction and erosion. These practices will have to be developed within the parameters established by changing human needs and expectations.

AB The production of potatoes has become important in Europe, especially since the 19th century. Since 1850 the yield of ware potatoes increased in The Netherlands from approximately 10 t ha-1 to the present level of 45 t ha-1. This was achieved by various improvements in production techniques. Several breakthroughs were accomplished in breeding for host resistance against pathogens. The current use of pesticides (nematicides, herbicides, fungicides, etc.) is high in potato production, at least in The Netherlands, particularly due to the use of fumigants to control nematodes in the starch potato growing areas. The Dutch government adopted objectives with respect to general reductions in the use of pesticides and the leaching of nutrients (nitrate). Adaptations in cultural measures are required to meet these objectives and to arrive at more sustainable systems of production in the future.
   In this paper special attention is given to past and present problems and possibilities with respect to cyst nematodes, late blight, wart, Colorado potato beetle, nitrogen nutrition, weed control, haulm destruction and sprout suppression.

AB A study was made in the rough fescue grasslands of southwestern Alberta to determine the growth response of rough fescue (Festuca scabrella var. campestris Rydb.) to five cutting frequencies and three cutting heights after 3 years of repeated treatments. The same plants were cut either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 times over a 16-week period beginning in mid-May, at 16-, 8-, 4-, 2-, or 1-week intervals, respectively, and at heights of either 5, 10, or 15 cm above ground level. After 3 years of repeated treatment, dry matter yields, etiolated growth, tiller height, tiller number, and growth rate decreased with increased cutting frequency and decreased cutting height. A single harvest at the end of August, cut at a height of 15 cm, produced yields that were similar to previously undisturbed plants. This treatment also produced the maximum sustainable forage yields. The study confirms the high susceptibility of rough fescue to grazing during the growing season and indicates that optimum management should include dormant-season grazing.

TI ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY - THE POLICY MODELS OF DEVELOPMENT
SO ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID ATTITUDES; QUALITY
AB Public interest in environmental policy formulation is analyzed from a development policy perspective. The objective is to assess the extent to which environmental issues are considered integral to decisions on the economy. Three policy models are considered: neo-classical economic development, socioeconomic development, and ecologically sustainable development. The study is based on data gathered from a content analysis of written testimony to a national public inquiry on development prospects (n = 1,119). Of this testimony, neo-classical and socioeconomic development models are explicitly supported by 26% and 63% of intervenors, respectively. Only 6% of the testimony supports the ecologically sustainable development model. The findings indicate that environmental issues are rarely considered integral to decisions on the economy and that support for genuine integration lies outside the institutional arrangements and decision-making centers of economic and social development.

DE ECOTOURISM; PARK INTERPRETATION; CONSERVATION EDUCATION; SUSTAINABLE

AB A tour guide training program was develop for rural communities near Costa Rica's Tortuguero National Park to respond to the impacts of the 24-fold increase in park visitation in the past decade, to involve local communities in resource management, and to provide regional environmental education. The development of the training course involved a survey of scientists and park managers to ascertain resource management needs, priorities for information to be disseminated, and impacts of tourism on the resource base. Current and potential tour guides were surveyed to identify their information needs, solicit their input in the training program, and to determine their knowledge and skills. Written questionnaires were developed and given to 400 tourists to determine their activities and environmental information needs, and hotel owners were censused to examine the economic feasibility of a local guide program. A pilot training course and guide program involving 12 Tortuguero residents demonstrated that a tour guide program: (1) helped mitigate negative tourism impacts on Tortuguero National Park's natural resources, particularly by regulating tourists on the park's 35-km beach used for nesting by endangered sea turtles; (2) provided environmental education to an important segment of the local community not traditionally reached through school or government development projects; (3) provided environmental information to tourists, thus enhancing their visit; and (4) provided local economic benefits through lucrative part-time employment, thereby allowing local people to participate more fully in the tourism system. An extended training course is being planned to provide further environmental education programming and to increase year-round employment opportunities for the tour guides.

DT Article
DE DRAINAGE; LEACHING; NUTRIENT BALANCE; SUSTAINABILITY; OXISOL; WEST
   AFRICA
AB In tropical regions, crop yields generally decrease with time, partly due to a decline in the levels of exchangeable bases linked to acidification of the upper layers of the soil. Nitrogen, calcium and magnesium balances were studied on an oxisol in southern Togo under continuous maize cropping with mineral fertilization and crop residue return, by measuring inputs and outputs.
   The balance was near equilibrium for nitrogen (urea dressing, 120 kg N ha-1 y-1) and negative for calcium and magnesium. Leaching represented between 29% and 85% of the total output for nitrogen and accounted for practically all the calcium and magnesium outputs.
   In the upper horizons, nitrate, calcium and magnesium contents in the soil solution were correlated. This was interpreted as an exchange between the calcium and magnesium ions adsorbed on the soil and the protons released by the transformation of ammonium into nitrate. The nutrient content of the soil solution increased in the case of no potassium fertilization, probably because of a lower nitrogen immobilization by microorganisms, the crop residue yield being reduced by the induced deficiency. An insufficient potassium fertilization increases leaching losses of calcium, magnesium and nitrogen.
   In the deeper horizons, the nitrate content of the soil solution was not correlated with the calcium and magnesium contents. Nitrogen was probably taken up by roots and some calcium and magnesium ions exchanged during their transport through the soil.

AB This article is concerned with three areas of park conservation management in the eastern Himalayas in the context of the social and cultural effects on local peoples. Conservation areas can be protected only when local people benefit from the scheme or are no longer dependent on the protected resources. Buddhist cultural principles should be embraced in the system of park management in the eastern Himalayas to provide the basis for a people-oriented development process. Material welfare and spirituality are not mutually exclusive but can serve as principles for development based on Buddhist values in this region.

AB This paper discusses the concept and some results of applied research for sustainable resource development on the northwest slopes of Mt. Kenya. Studies are being carried out on three scales (regional, local, and site level) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and modeling techniques are being applied. Two examples are described. The regional study of the Naro Moru Basin indicates that the forest belt between 2,400 and 3,500 m is important for the supply of perennial water to streams and recharge of the groundwater table on the semi-arid plateau below. A site-level study of water conservation in the semi-arid footzone demonstrates that simple techniques, such as an agroforestry system combined with mulching and minimum tillage, can improve dramatically water use and production. Both examples show the importance of land use to the resource management, the need for long-term commitment, and the challenge for applied research.

AB In this paper, it is proposed that water resources should be managed as an integral part of a nation's social and economic development. Water resources managers should broaden their scope of work to include an integrated management approach.  Instead of the traditional 'supply oriented approach' in which they act in response to ever-increasing demands for water from different sectors of the economy, water resources management agencies should play a more active role in guiding and stimulating socioeconomic development through more efficient water use. Demand management should be an important tool which should go beyond the improvement of technical efficiencies. Most important is to develop economic and institutional approaches that accept charging for the.full costs of the utilization and management of water resources. Implementation of such an approach will require more sectoral integration than is currently the case and will have considerable implications for organizations, staffing, institutional arrangements and corresponding capacity building.

AB Based on long-term experiments, an assessment was made of different cropping systems including groundnut at various levels of intensification. The inadequacy of mineral fertilization alone was revealed. Introducing fallow periods of varying lengths did not always prevent a drop in plot productivity, but in the Sudanese-Sahelian zone fallow quality seemed to be a possible reason for this. Organic matter applications kept production at a satisfactory level, but parasite constraints increased as the rotations became intensified and fallow disappeared. The beneficial effect of introducing groundnut in cereal-based cropping sequences is borne out.

ID ENVIRONMENT
AB A simple theoretical model describing the interaction between humans and their environment in terms of energy flows is Proposed to check the compatibility between th, density of energy throughput in human society and the density of energy throughput in the ecosystem. This model is then applied to analyze three different scenarios of energy interaction between human society and the ecosystem: (i) societal activity is supported exclusively by biophysical processes for energy input and conversion; (ii) society is fueled by 'biofuels' (biogas and alcohol) but power is generated by exosomatic technological devices (engines, etc.); (iii) society has ample access to a high-density energy input and exosomatic technological devices. For each scenario limits to human development are discussed, and estimates of a sustainable population size provided on the basis of compatibility between energy throughput in society and the environment.

DT Article
AB How have development administrators handled the need for institutional change over the past four decades? Institutions are regarded as central to the success of Third World development efforts, and over the years four different approaches have been used to deal with that need. As Arthur S. Goldsmith shows, early efforts at specific institution building were followed by a broader strategy of institution development. More recently, attention bas turned to the new institutionalist approach. It stresses (1) the need to work on providing individuals with appropriate incentives, and (2) strategies based on the need to create sustainable institutions that link development programs and their constituents over the long term,

AB This survey examined the processes by which programs feeding hungry children in Canada are initiated, implemented and sustained. The responses of 32 operators of these programs were obtained by semi-structured telephone interviews and were analysed using qualitative research methods.
   Concerned citizens within the community and teachers were the major proponents for programs; their primary indicators of need were children's hunger-related behaviours. Programs generally provided the breakfast or lunch meal, were overseen by a board, and were operated by a mix of paid and volunteer staff. A lack of resources, problems with parents and the community, and managerial stresses were the main perceived barriers to program continuance. Programs run by communities generally had more need for resources, expressed lower confidence in their sustainability, and were less likely to cooperate with other groups than school-run programs. While some programs deliberately tried to avoid stigmatization, program operators did hold some prejudicial views about the communities they served and few programs could be considered empowering to users.

AB Land use greatly affects soil and hydrological processes, which have major implications for environmental quality and agricultural sustainability. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of four land use systems - continuous alfalfa, forest, ridge-till corn (Zea mays L.) and conventional-till corn - on runoff, soil loss, and nutrient transport in runoff and sediment. Eight field plots (18.5 by 21 m), equipped with 0.3-m H-flumes and FW-1 water-level recorders, were established on Miamian silty clay loam soil (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) at the Ohio State University Agronomy Farm, Columbus, OH. Runoff samples, collected after erosive storms during the growing season in 1990, were analyzed for sediment concentration, NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, and dissolved organic C. Sediment collected from the flume base was analyzed for total Kjeldahl N and available P. A critical period was identified as the early stages of crop growth during which the soil was particularly vulnerable to erosion due to excessive runoff. Soil and nutrient losses were typically higher during the critical than during the noncritical period. Both N and P losses in runoff and sediment were higher for cropped treatments than for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and forest. Losses observed for conventional tillage were, however, several orders of magnitude larger than uncropped treatments.

AB Soil erosion is a serious problem threatening sustainability of agriculture globally and contaminating surface waters. The objective of this study was to determine whether low concentrations of anionic polymers in irrigation water would appreciably reduce irrigation furrow erosion on Portneuf silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Durixerollic Calciorthid), a highly erodible soil. Furrow slope was 1.6%, furrow length was 175 m, and irrigation rates ranged from 15 to 23 L min-1. Inflow during the first 1 to 2 h of the first 8-h irrigation was treated. Subsequent irrigations were untreated. Polyacrylamide (PAM) or starch copolymer solutions were injected into irrigation water entering furrows at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, and 20 g m-3. Sediment loss from polymer-treated furrows was significantly less than that of control furrows in the first (treated) and second (untreated) irrigations, but not in the fourth (untreated). The PAM provided better erosion control than the starch copolymer. Efficacy of PAM treatments varied depending on its concentration, duration of furrow exposure, and water flow rate. In the initial (treated) irrigation and at low flow rates, 10 g m-3 PAM reduced mean sediment load by 97% compared with untreated furrows. Residual erosion abatement in a subsequent irrigation, without further addition of PAM, was approximately 50%. The PAM increased net infiltration and promoted greater lateral infiltration. Effective erosion control was achievable for a material cost below $3 ha-1 irrigation-1.

TI SOIL-MANAGEMENT OPTIONS TO REDUCE RUNOFF AND EROSION ON A HARDSETTING
   ALFISOL IN THE SEMIARID TROPICS
SO SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH

AB Improved farming systems are needed to enhance productivity and reduce degradation on hardsetting Alfisols in the semi-arid tropics. A long-term experiment was started in July 1988 at ICRISAT, Hyderabad, India, to evaluate practices to improve infiltration and reduce erosion by stimulating biological activity and protecting soil in the rainy season. This paper outlines the rationale for the experiment, describes it, and summarises early results. Fifteen treatments in a randomised block design were applied to plots 28.5 m long by 5 m wide on a 2% slope. Nine annual treatments made up a factorial sub-set: tillage by tined implement to three depths (0, 10 and 20 cm) combined with three mulch treatments (no mulch, farmyard manure (FYM) at 15 t ha-1, and rice straw at 5 t ha-1). Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) was sown in the factorial sub-set in July 1988. Six perennial species ley treatments (combinations of perennial pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan), verano stylo (Stylosanthes hamata), and buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris)) completed the randomised block design. All treatments were replicated three times making 45 plots in total. Plots were instrumented to measure runoff and soil loss.
   Millet straw yield was reduced by tillage to 20 cm and grain yield was significantly reduced by tillage to both 10 and 20 cm. Mulches had no effect on millet straw yield but FYM significantly increased millet grain yield. The proportion of rainfall running off plots ranged from 15.8 to 39. 1%. Perennial species treatments tended to have higher runoff than treatments under millet, but this was not consistent as zero tillage without mulch, and tillage to 10 cm either with mulch or with FYM mulch, also had relatively high runoff. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced runoff by comparison with FYM and no mulch. Soil was lost mainly as suspended load, indicating that raindrop detachment was the main erosion process. Effects of perennial species were variable and probably reflected the degree of surface protection provided in this establishment phase. Tillage significantly increased suspended load concentration in the first major runoff event but not in an event later in the season. Rice straw mulch significantly reduced bed load concentration in the first event and reduced suspended load in the later event. The ability of straw mulch to reduce runoff volume and sediment concentration suggests mulch-based systems may be able to contribute to sustainability of farming systems in the semiarid tropics. The lack of beneficial effects from tillage suggests a limited role for tillage-based systems. Results from subsequent years are needed to form definite conclusions and to show effects of slower biologically-induced changes in the soil.

TI THE URBAN BIOREGION AS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PARADIGM
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyses the implications of the 'bioregional paradigm' for urban regions in the Third World. Bioregionalism has emerged from the ecocentric' wing of the environmental movement, contending that the 'environmental crisis' cannot be solved by technical and administrative measures alone, but requires a more thoroughgoing reappraisal of attitudes, lifestyles and social structures.   Following discussion of conventional analytical approaches to the city and its region, the paper assesses the degree to which new approaches to Third World development, and especially new ideas concerning regional development, already prefigure the bioregional paradigm. Whilst many quasi-bioregional ideas are already entering into the debate on appropriate development approaches, as yet the fully stated bioregional paradigm has not come under consideration, The second half of the paper therefore considers salient issues that will need to be researched if bioregionalism is to become a serious option for Third World urban regions. Finally, the paper discusses possible routes to implementation.

LA English
DT Article
AB Multilateral aid agencies aim to fund projects which will contribute to sustained development in the Third World. The pastoral areas of China present major challenges in relation to sustainable development. A major multilateral aid project designed to meet these challenges, the IFAD North China Pasture and Animal Development project, is described and evaluated using new survey data. A number of problems with this project which are common to many multilateral aid projects are discussed. In particular, the analysis supports the argument that multilateral aid agencies should place more emphasis on projects which facilitate the development of new institutions and policy reforms than on projects which concentrate on investment in new technology. The case study also illustrates the point. that financial arrangements adopted by agencies such as IFAD can impose potentially serious unintended burdens on the recipient country.

ID ECONOMICS
AB A vigorous effort will be required to negotiate and implement international commodity agreements which would stabilize and maximize the earnings of developing countries from the export of primary products. Success will enable them to evolve and develop from a more balanced base and to manage their natural resources in a sustainable manner. This article examines ways developing countries are interlocked with wealthy nations in terms of agriculture practices, how that affects biodiversity and habitat conditions in developing countries, and how developing countries could develop agricultural policies and strategies that would address and correct the loss of biological diversity. Agricultural trade policies, agricultural assistance policies, and potentials within these for changes are examined in terms of achieving sustainable approaches to agriculture. Some general principles are apparent, and the combined effects from certain policies are clear. Protectionism depletes the resources of the developing world; it accelerates the loss of biological diversity and reduces the ability of poorer nations to create a context in which future development could occur. Developing countries become forced to respond to foreign rather than local conditions. The success of agricultural development will depend on linkages with natural areas important for biological diversity. Therefore, agricultural development projects supported by agencies of developed nations must consider the larger ecosystem, the parts in context with the whole. Since current models of economic and ecological systems are disconnected, a monitoring and research program should be established to determine the effectiveness of alternative policies and organizational structures. Nonetheless, economic restructuring offers opportunities to direct efforts towards conservation of biological resources, sustainable agriculture, and training in principles of conservation. Opportunities for innovative initiatives exist through debt reduction or exchanging debt for biological conservation. This could lead to sound agricultural systems, reduce government deficits, and protect biological diversity. The global climate debt, incurred by wealthy nations, could be managed to the benefit of developing countries. It is suggested that nations develop a "Foreign Policy on Agriculture and the Environment" stating national objectives in both trade and aid, in relation to agriculture.

TI COORDINATING DISCIPLINARY AND ORGANIZATIONAL WAYS OF KNOWING
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article examines how the difficulties in finding sustainable environmental interactions may be rooted in the institutionalized thinking and organizing from which these attempts emerge. A major question addressed is why do agencies and organizations support special interests better than collective ones. There is a long-standing set of political/economic explanations that attribute the structure of agriculture to the political power of established economic interests. The diverse explanations share one conclusion in common: agricultural policy and the structure of agriculture itself in the United States favors the production of commercial food outputs through the use of commercially available inputs instead of promoting the maintenance and enhancement of viable biological, community and food systems. The emphasis on commercial inputs and outputs is compatible with decision-making by individual farmers. Epistemological explanations for why United States agriculture has developed along a path based on individual and commercial inputs and outputs rather than biological and community systems are complementary with political/economic explanations. Current agricultural models and policies are limited in that they are based on mechanical Newtonian assumptions. Discipline boundaries have impeded true implementation of interdisciplinary methodologies and the development of generalized models because the assumptions, cultures, and paradigms within the disciplines have not been overcome. In addition, different organizations have not overcome the differences in the way they transform data into information. This is true of agencies, organizations, and academic disciplines. Can large organizations or agencies handle diversity, given such barriers? For agriculture to play a role in protecting biodiversity, the heterogeneity of agrosystems will have to increase. Recommendations on the structure of organizations to maintain biological diversity in agricultural systems point to resiliency, checks and balances, redundancy, and a substantial research and extension effort to overcome barriers to effectiveness.

TI INTEGRATING CONSERVATION BIOLOGY AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION -
   CONCLUSIONS
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Cooperation between agricultural and conservation biologists is imperative to ensure continued production of high quality food and fiber for all the earth's peoples, and to protect biological diversity. This article outlines ideas and needs expressed by participants in the workshops on conservation biology and agriculture. In the areas of general biology, there is an enormous need for research in basic and applied genetics and related technologies. In the area of exploited lands, research is needed on a wide variety of topics relative to biodiversity and the management for biological diversity on rangelands, forested lands, and wetlands. Habitat requirements of native species need to be better understood as do the interrelationships of native communities and species with adjacent agricultural activities or urban centers. A series of questions on park design and management need to be researched and modeled. Research is needed on the effects of grazing systems on natural plant and animal diversity and changes in grazing practices as well as on natural grazing patterns by indigenous fauna and livestock grazing patterns in relation to biodiversity. Other areas where research is needed include restoration techniques and their effectiveness, the role of climatic change in plant/animal interactions and its relationship to agriculture, design of forest management systems, harvesting techniques, and mixed agroforestry systems. In the area of wetland biology and management, research is needed on the improvement of degraded wetlands and on longterm monitoring of regenerated wetlands.
   Government policies need to be examined with respect to biological, environmental and economic impacts. Traditional agricultural systems and the importance of traditional knowledge systems need to be linked to agricultural development programs. Research is needed in the design, implementation, monitoring, and effects of agricultural policies. Research priorities and longterm goals for sustainability need to be determined. Policy research is needed on how principles of conservation biology can contribute to sustainable agriculture.

AB Muscle activity patterns appear to vary regionally in the human masseter. However, studies of motor-unit (MU) behaviour in the masseter have been hampered by the absence of a reliable technique for locating needle-electrode recording sites. Here, voluntary MU behaviour patterns were examined in verified regions of the muscle. Activity was recorded from 50 stereotactically mapped masseter MUs. Initially, the task specificity of each MU was determined. Then for each task, the lowest sustainable firing frequency (LSFF) was reached by slow increases and decreases in voluntary firing rate, followed by sustained firing at the lowest possible rate. Pulse-discrimination and digital sampling of consecutive interspike intervals were used to measure the LSFF for each task to which the MU contributed. All MUs fired continuously during the performance of 2 6 separate tooth-contact and postural tasks. There were significant differences between LSFFs for the tasks performed by 47 units. Masseter MU task profiles appear to vary regionally, and are dependent on jaw position, the bite point along the tooth row, and the direction of effort. Descending neural drive to masseter MUs thus seems to be highly task dependent, even when the unit firing rate is controlled voluntarily at its LSFF.

AB Low commodity prices and a desire by producers on the Canadian Prairies to reduce fertilizer-N inputs have resulted in a marked increase in grain lentil (Lens culinaris medikus) production. Many producers grow lentil in rotation with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A 12-yr study carried out at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, on an Orthic Brown Chernozemic silt loam was used to compare the N economy of four monoculture wheat rotations, of various rotation lengths and levels of N fertilization, with that of a wheat-lentil (W-Len) rotation. Except for continuous wheat (Cont W) receiving mainly P fertilizer, all systems received N and P on the basis of soil tests. Neither grain nor straw yield of the associated wheat crop was influenced by lentil in the rotation; but grain- and straw-N concentrations of the wheat in W-Len were increased compared with those of monoculture wheat. Average N content of straw was greatest for grain lentil and for wheat grown on fallow (F) (14.2 kg ha-1 yr-1), followed by wheat in W-Len (11.8 kg ha-1 yr-1) and by stubble-wheat of well-fertilized monoculture systems (F-W-W and Cont W (9.5 kg ha-1 yr-1), and lowest for Cont W receiving mainly P (5.7 kg ha-1 yr-1). Nitrate N in the root zone (0-90 cm) in spring and at harvest was greatest under F-W, followed by W-Len and then by F-W-W and Cont W receiving N and P, and lowest for Cont W receiving mainly P. In the last 5 or 6 yr of study, there was a marked increase in the amount of soil-NO3 N found in the root zone under the W-Len rotation. This was accompanied by a similar increase in the apparent net N mineralized (estimated by N balance) during the growing season. Concomitantly, there was a gradual reduction in the fertilizer-N requirement for W-Len, indicating a cumulative enhancement of the N-supplying power of the soil, although estimates of the initial potential rate of N mineralization on samples taken in 1990 did not confirm this trend. We concluded that soil-testing laboratories may need to adjust fertilizer-N recommendations downward for producers that regularly use a 2-yr W-Len rotation. There was less NO3 N leached below the root zone of W-Len, probably because there was greater synchrony of N uptake in W-Len than in Cont W (N + P); this augurs well for the use of the W-Len rotation for sustainability.

TI PROJECT EVALUATION AND RESOURCE SUSTAINABILITY
SO CONTEMPORARY POLICY ISSUES
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper outlines a procedure for embodying the principle of resource sustainability in evaluating projects that use significant amounts of natural resources. In this analysis, sustainability requires maintaining the productivity of the resource used over time, either by renewing the resource or by investing its depletion in other capital assets. The basis of a project's evaluation is its net present social value (NPSV), including resource depletion as a social cost. The social cost of depletion is the amount that must be saved and reinvested annually to accumulate a fund that will yield a perpetual annual income equal to the net output lost by resource depletion. By treating resource depletion as a social cost in calculating NPSV, projects causing a high rate of resource depletion receive a relatively low valuation compared with projects causing less resource depletion. Resource depletion includes environmental damage caused by constructing and operating a project, as well as the direct consumption of natural resources.
   Several problems arise in reinvesting depletion to preserve the value of a resource base. One major problem relates to the substitutability of man-made capital for natural resources. The conclusion of the analysis here is that society must invest a substantial amount of resource depletion in: (i) replenishing renewable resources, (ii) increasing product output per unit of resource used, or (iii) increasing the end-use efficiency of resource-intensive products.

TI ECOENERGETIC ANALYSIS OF ANIMAL HUSBANDRY IN TRADITIONAL SOCIETIES OF

SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID AGRICULTURE
AB The energy and economic efficiencies of different animal-husbandry systems, such as poultry, swine, goat, cattle, and mithun of the Nishis, Karbis, Kacharis, and Chakmas of Arunachal Pradesh in north-eastern India have been compared. Swine husbandry is practiced by all except the Karbis. Cattle reared by the Karbis and Chakmas is for milk production, whereas the others raise them for meat. The energy and economic efficiencies of the mithun(dagger) and the cattle raised for meat are reasonably high. Poultry and swine husbandry are largely detritus-based and are relatively less dependent upon forest, unlike cattle and mithun that are sustainable only when the forest-resource base is high. The differences in animal husbandry are partly due to cultural differences of the communities. The Nishis have better developed animal husbandry and consume more food energy than others through this sub-system although, on a per capita basis, the export earning of the Chakmas were higher. There is room for tighter recycling of resources within this subsystem, e.g. through utilization of dung that is otherwise wasted. The implications of results for development of the village ecosystem are discussed.

SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE ENERGY POLICIES; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; PRIVATIZATION
AB In spite of vast local energy resources, economic development in Latin America and Africa is not supported by reliable energy supplies, although increasing energy use is inevitable. Oil and electricity are currently delivered through inefficient regulated systems, consuming large shares of scarce capital and foreign exchange. Furthermore, fuelwood is being burned beyond sustainable levels, threatening the environment. Projects to develop adequate energy supplies call for capital which these economies are not generating internally. Lending from external commercial banks, affected by the debt crisis, together with credits from bilateral and multilateral agencies, remains limited. There is a need for a policy reformulation to enhance direct equity financing of energy sector activities. To reduce governments' involvement and to increase the role of private companies, new institutional frameworks together with market based energy price systems must be established. In this context, multilateral agencies could encourage direct investment by making known the results of successful cases of privatization and by introducing innovative guarantee mechanisms.

LA English
DT Article
ID HIGHLAND REGION; GROWTH; SOIL; LEGUMES; WHEAT
AB Sustainable crop production on Rwandan oxisols is limited by widespread soil acidity caused by high levels of exchangeable aluminium. This study was designed to test the effectiveness of an indigenous lime material in counteracting the acidity and enhancing crop yields. Lime application significantly raised pH, exchangeable calcium and effective cation exchange capacity, and reduced exchangeable aluminium and total acidity. Calcium was directly proportional to effective cation exchange capacity (r = 0.962**) and was inversely related to aluminium (r = -0.955**). Consequently, yields of wheat, beans and potatoes, which served as test crops, were significantly increased by liming. Lime at high rates (4-8 t ha-1) had a longer residual effect than at low rates (less than 2 t ha-1), suggesting frequent applications are needed when low lime rates are used. Simple regression analysis showed an increase in pH of 0.154 units and a decrease in exchangeable aluminium of 0.385 meq 100 g-1 for a tonne of lime applied.

AB The shortcomings and contradictions of the present understanding of sustainable development as a concept and a strategy suggest that the very idea of sustainable development must be subjected to the most thorough-going reevaluation. In rejecting simplistic versions of sustainable development strategy, this paper offers the strategy of sustainable cities both as an alternative strategy and as a catalyst to long-term global sustainability. In so doing, it seeks not to replace all components of the strategy of sustainable development but instead to place them within a restructured strategic framework locating the design and building of sustainable cities at its centre.

AB The strategic potential of information systems (IS) is now well accepted. This paper examines some key characteristics of strategic IS applications and investigates their relationship with contextual factors representing the industry environment, the organization structure, and the IS function. Empirical analysis of 81 strategic IS applications in large companies shows that these applications contribute mainly to functions involving customers or competitors, primarily to reduce cost or provide some differentiation. They have limited effect on suppliers. However, the effect on suppliers is greater in decentralized organizations and in heterogeneous environments. Moreover, a heterogeneous environment and a mature IS function enhance the role of information storage. The implications for future research and for IS practice are examined.

TI CREATING ECONOMIC INCENTIVES FOR CONSERVATION
SO JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB US water suppliers are increasingly incorporating conservation into their management strategies as a way to enhance supply capacities and shift consumer demand toward sustainable-use patterns. Incentives to the utility for following this management strategy, aside from the conserving of water, include reduced investment and operating costs and preservation of environmental assets. Disincentives include revenue shortfalls, more frequent rate adjustments, and difficulty predicting future demand. Recent experience by the electric utility industry indicates innovative program-financing mechanisms may be required if conservation is to be a worthwhile and economically safe venture, particularly for investor-owned, regulated water utilities. For example, an important assumption associated with incentive strategies is that increased water efficiency is an equal substitute for water supply capacity and has equivalent value in the marketplace. Utilities need to quantify the economic and environmental assets of a conservation program so those elements may be justly incorporated into the financial considerations of alternative supply- and demand-side planning options.

TI FRACTIONATION OF PHOSPHORUS IN THE SEDIMENT OF A WETLAND AFTER A DECADE
   OF RECEIVING SEWAGE EFFLUENT
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
LA English
DT Article
ID LAKE-SEDIMENTS; CAPACITY; WATER; SOIL
AB Sediment deposited in traps positioned along a pollution gradient in a wetland receiving sewage effluent was fractionated with respect to phosphorus (P) to understand the processes of P removal. Significant differences in P fractions were found between sites. Close to the point of effluent discharge, virtually all of the P deposited was in organic form; whereas downstream of a confluence with a wetland not impacted by the sewage, inorganic P constituted 50 to 80% of the total P. More than 80% of the inorganic P occurred in forms extractable by 0.1 M NaOH. This form of P was highly correlated (r2 almost-equal-to 0.5-0.8) with oxalate-extractable Fe. Natural wetlands unimpacted by sewage effluent were shown to be the main source of the Fe. Hydrologic conditions regulating the delivery of Fe to the sewage-impacted wetland were implicated as the main factors determining the relative concentrations of inorganic P within the impacted wetland system. While it is not clear whether adsorption or precipitation reactions were responsible for the P deposition, we conclude that the present rate of P removal is sustainable. Our results may explain why, in some cases, the P removal achieved in wastewater wetland systems is much greater than can be predicted solely from soil adsorption maxima.

TI PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL PROCESSES IN A WETLAND AFTER A DECADE OF RECEIVING A
   SEWAGE EFFLUENT
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
LA English
DT Article
ID VEGETATION; NUTRIENTS; RETENTION; NITROGEN; CAPACITY; WATER
AB A study was made of the processes leading to phosphorus (P) removal in a wetland that received a high load of sewage-P for over a decade. The amounts of P accounted for by sediment deposition, sorption to detrital material, and uptake by above ground biomass were compared with the mass of P entering and leaving the wetland system. Phosphorus deposition was shown to be the most important sink for P with rates of up to 30 g P m-2 d-1 being recorded. The pronounced spatial distribution of deposition as well as laboratory experiments indicated that P deposition occurred predominantly by reaction between sewage-wetland waters (high in P, alkaline pH) and natural wetland waters (high in Fe and Al, acid pH) at or immediately below confluences joining their flow streams. Studies on P mass transport showed that the P removal rate (28-70%) was considerably greater than published values suggest could be predicted for this highly loaded (almost-equal-to 34 g P m-2 yr-1) system. It is suggested that the wetland configuration, whereby the flow from a relatively small area of sewage-impacted wetland, is joined by waters from much larger unimpacted wetlands, is the reason for the relatively large P removal in this system. The relative magnitudes of P sinks in this study are different enough from other studies to suggest that the present level of P removal in this wetland is sustainable.

AB The maximum sustainable yield of an age-structured, density dependent, sex-differentiated population is investigated. The model is based on the nonlinear version of the McKendrick [11] model introduced by Gurtin and MacCamy [8], modified to include sex-differentiated dynamics. It is determined that the maximum sustainable yield is attainable by an age specific harvesting policy in which the number of harvesting ages for males and the harvesting ages for females total at most five.

TI BELIEFS AND PRACTICES OF SUSTAINABLE FARMERS IN SOUTH-DAKOTA
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB A small, but unquantified minority of South Dakota farmers follow practices intended to be not only productive and profitable, but also explicitly benign to environment and human health. For purpose of discussion, such farmers are termed as "sustainable." This article documents experiences and points of view of 32 farmers who have followed sustainable practices commercially for an average of 14 yr each and reactions of some "conventional" farmers to the beliefs and practices of their sustainable counterparts. The findings reported in the article are based on a four-part series of on-farm investigations involving (i) a broadly-based mail survey, (ii) personal interviews with a subset of mail survey respondents concerning the nature and rationale for certain key practices identified through the mail survey, (iii) a further intensified case study analysis of a subset of the personally interviewed farmers, and (iv) reactions from panels of sustainable and conventional farmers to preliminary findings from the research. Compared with conventional farmers, sustainable farmers in South Dakota (i) follow more diversified crop rotations, including more nonprogram small grains and forages; (ii) sometimes plant green manure cover crops on otherwise tilled summer fallow/set-aside land; (iii) substitute more harvested legumes, green manures, crop residues, and livestock manure for purchased synthetic chemical fertilizers; and (iv) substitute more crop rotations, mechanical tillage, and other cultural practices for chemical methods of weed control. Perceptions on the technical and economic feasibility of such practices differ much between sustainable and conventional farmers. To provide a basis for the narrowing of such differences of perception over time, the authors provide a list of eight questions for investigation in future research.

   LAND USE ASSESSMENT; SOIL DEGRADATION; LANDSCAPE TYPES; EASTERN POLAND
AB Agricultural land use in much of Poland is based on traditional methods in which innovation plays a small part. The recent economic changes which have swept through Poland will result in many new opportunities for farmers as new crops, new marketing techniques and new markets become available. Intensification of agricultural land (and forestry) land use can be achieved to meet the growing demand for indigenously produced foodstuffs and timber and, at the same time, allow an increase in income generation (in raw and value-added products) especially from the export market. Intensification of output must be based on sustainable and environmentally friendly methods with minimal reliance on imported fertilizers and pesticides. This paper explains how a database consisting of soil, topography, land use and vegetation data has been used to generate a series of potential land use maps for a small area (25 km2) of Eastern Poland in which different levels of management inputs have been applied. A prime objective of this work has been the development of a sustainable agroforestry system based on the assessment of the landscape's natural conditions. The system, when fully developed, should allow effective economic management of the area with depletion of the environmental resource base reduced to a minimum. The results of this study rely on the use of computer-generated maps prepared with a widely available geographical information system.

TI A THEORETICAL-STUDY ON RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT BY STOCKING, WITH SPECIAL

ID POPULATION
AB In recent years, stocking of natural populations with fish fry, which are produced artificially or transferred from other populations, are performed in order to enhance fishing productivity. Two kinds of resource enhancement effects are expected to result from such artificial stockings: the direct (intragenerational) effect from the recruitment of stocked individuals themselves and the indirect (intergenerational or reproductive) effect from the increase in the recruitment caused by the reproduction of stocked individuals. In this paper, we obtain the enhancement effect, defined as an increase in the sustainable production, as a function of stocking intensity and fishing mortality, and study its dependency on various biological and economical factors by using simple mathematical models. We also obtain the condition for the profitability of stocking operation and the optimal fishing mortality as a function of stocking intensity.

TI BLEACHING OF KRAFT PULPS - A RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE
SO PAPIER
LA German
DT Article
ID ALKALINE HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; LIGNIN
AB The bleaching process for the manufacture of chemical pulps is undergoing a dynamic development. In a few years, molecular chlorine will almost completely be replaced by a combination of oxygen and chlorine dioxide. The standard sequence in Scandinavia for market softwood kraft pulp is already today O D(EPO)DD. The resulting effluent is probably better characterized than any other bleaching effluent. Strict environmental demands can be best met by using chlorine dioxide, oxygen and peroxide.
   There are today two strong trends in the process development of bleaching. One is totally chlorine free (TCF) bleaching. The second is the closed cycle mill concept.
   A lot of effort is made today in the development of TCF-bleaching. The alternatives are hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, ozone, enzymes, reducing agents, and maybe most important, modified extended kraft cooking. There is a great potential for improvements in TCF-bleaching. Ozone is probably the most interesting chlorine free bleaching chemical because of its very good bleaching effect. Unfortunately the attacks on carbohydrates are severe because the complex radical chemistry is not fully understood.
   The closed cycle mill concept is still far away but is nevertheless more realistic than it was a few years ago. From a broader perspective, such a mill can fit well into the idea of sustainable development. The kraft process has a number of natural bleeds for many elements that enter the mill with the wood and raw water One of the major challenges in the closed cycle mill is the handling of manganese.

TI LOCAL-MANAGEMENT OF AID-FUNDED PROJECTS
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Local management means giving responsibility for the implementation and management of development projects to people and institutions in the recipient country. The main arguments for local management are that it offers the potential to increase the responsibility and accountability of national institutions and should help to build a cadre of experienced local project managers. These are all important contributions to sustainable development. There are, however, some constraints on the effectiveness of local management, including the limited supply of good managers and the difficulty of ensuring adherence by those implementing projects to donors' procedures and regulations. The role of donor agencies under local management is yet to be clearly defined. Donor agencies will face difficult professional judgments on whether, when and how to intervene where projects are not being competently managed by national institutions.

AB To minimize or at least substantially reduce damage to the natural resource sustenance-base we urgently need institutional reform within modem society. Environmental sociologists have different views as to which institutional traits can be held primarily responsible for the environmental crisis. Examples include its capitalistic or industrial character as well as the complex, highly administrated technological system of modern society. We discuss these matters in the context of the theory of ''ecological modernization as developed by the German sociologist Joseph Huber, among others. To analyze the institutional reforms required for bringing human interaction with the sustenance-base under rational ecological control, however, the theory needs to be substantially modified and complemented in several respects. However, restructuring the processes of production and consumption is only half the story. The change to ecologically sound patterns of production and consumption is limited by the dimension of the environmental crisis that has to do with nature as sustenance-base and does not provide a solution to problems related to what we call the second dimension of the environmental crisis: the changing role of nature as ''intuited nature'' and the way people ''deal with'' these aspects of the environmental crisis within everyday life. In this respect we propose that theories of modern society as a risk-society should be given greater attention within environmental sociology.

TI THE SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURAL FOOD COMMODITY PRODUCTION IN THE
   HUMID TROPICS OF CENTRAL AND WESTERN AFRICA
SO TROPENLANDWIRT
LA German
DT Article
AB The African humid-tropical rainforest is converted into agricultural land far more rapidly than Latinamerican or Asian rainforest. In Africa this process is primarily propelled by smallholder subsistence agriculture. The sustainability of the methods conventionally utilized in this process (shifting, slash-and bum, swidden cultivation) ist threatened by the shortening of fallow periods due to increasing rural population pressure. Similarly, continous, monoculture-based field crop production on humid-tropical soils with massive external input use is linked with considerable ecological risks and constraints. Since humid-tropical soils are strongly weathered and therefore present low inherent fertility, low nutrient and water retention capacity, and unbalanced ion load in the exchange complex, and since continously high ambient temperatures, high rainfall amounts and high rainfall intensities accelerate the processes of soil deterioration and soil loss, these soils require maximum biological protection for their sustainable utilization. In analogy to the conditions prevailing within the rainforest which can provide such soil protection, the sustainability of the soil resource in field crop production is intimately linked with its association with tree vegetation. It appears that only genetically diverse, complex, integrated tree-, crop- and animal-based land use with low-external, but normally high internal input use in the sense of integrated agro-sylvo-pastoral systems are in a position to sustainably satisfy the high requirements of the humid-tropical ecology. Experiences gathered in the Central and Western African region with the Alley Farming concept which systematically combines nutrient pumping and soil stabilizing legume shrubs and trees with field crops and small ruminants indicate that the sustainability of smallholder field crop based land use in the humid tropics can be assured under conditions of low external input.

The results of simulation models of current trends suggest widespread ecological degradation associated with existing land use. A more sustainable development path, however, is ecologically and technologically possible. Its implementation will require active and continue environmental policies, integrated within new social and economic ones, strongly supported by science and technology. Finally, suggestions are made regarding potential directions and applications for science and technology in Latin America which would have an environmentally positive impact and thereby contribute to the necessary shift to a more sustainable development path.

AB This paper reviews and critically evaluates the exchange rate policy followed in Turkey in the post-1980 period during which a far-reaching program of liberalization has been launched. We conclude that the new exchange rate policy has been essential for Turkey's regaining its creditworthiness. Furthermore, it has positively contributed to growth of output and exports, and to expansion of tradables production relative to nontradables. Persistence of inflation and weakness of private investment in tradables overshadow the successes recorded in other areas, and cast doubt over the sustainability of Turkey's outward orientation. We argue that the root cause of these problems has been inconsistencies between overall economic policies, rather than the exchange rate policy itself. We compare the period of real appreciations since late 1988 with the earlier period of real depreciations, and draw policy implications.

TI FARMING SYSTEM RESEARCH AND THE QUEST FOR A SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper brings together information from four sites in sub-Saharan Africa where FSR&D projects are located (Mali, Benin, Zambia and Tanzania), supported by the Royal Tropical Institute of The Netherlands. Common environmental constraints to agricultural productivity are analyzed, with an emphasis on aspects of soil fertility maintenance. It is shown that when plant nutrients are valued against market prices, annual crop production systems are inefficient due to considerable losses of nutrient resources (e.g., soil erosion) and economically unviable because of unfavourable input and producer price ratios. Technically solutions are available that make agriculture sustainable, but its output is likely to be reduced when accepting the need for environmental protection at various levels of integration (cropping system, field/farm, village territory, etc), since marginal land must be left under natural vegetation, and various forms of buffering elements must be installed on farms.  The costs of protective measures (space, labour, energy in community organization) cannot be raised based upon local resources currently available. Making small farmer agriculture in the tropics sustainable and environmentally sound begins by improving economic conditions for farmers, raising producer income and lowering prices for inputs.

AB Mycorrhizae, a mutualistic association between fungi of the family Endogonaceae and higher plants, have been studied extensively in the greenhouse, but much less is known about the natural ecology of these fungal-plant associations in field soils. A better understanding of the mycorrhizae of agronomic crops is needed because of their potential involvement in systems of sustainable agriculture. This study reports on the extent of root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi, the distribution of mycorrhizal fungal spores in the rhizosphere, and the mycorrhizal fungal genera associated with soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] in 15 Iowa soils. Results indicated that soybean roots from most soils, in spite of some soils having very high soil-test P levels, were extensively colonized (60-100%) by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi. Colonization was determined by evaluating the percentage of root segments with VAM fungi. The average colonization of plant roots from all soils was 89%, and the average Bray P1 soil-test value was 60.3 mg kg-1 (values greater than 30.5 are considered by the Iowa State Soil Testing Laboratory to be very high). Abundant colonization was unexpected in these high-P fertility soils because most authors report extensive colonization to occur mainly in plants growing in soils of low fertility. The VAM fungal spores were quite common in all rhizosphere soils sampled and ranged from 66 to 998 spores 100 g-1 soil. Total spore counts were significantly different among soil series (P < 0.001) and within soil series (P < 0.01). A negative correlation (P < 0.05) was found between soil organic matter, P, and VAM fungal colonization. For VAM fungal genera (Glomus, Gigaspora, Acaulospora, and Scutellospora) were found associated with soybean rhizosphere soil. Among these, Glomus was the most abundant.

TI FARM AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY (VILLAGE AFFORESTATION) PROGRAM IN TANZANIA

LA English
DT Article
AB Until the late 1960s, when the Village Afforestation Programme (VAP) was initiated in the form of a pedagogical top-down extension service, professional forestry in Tanzania was developed in isolation from rural development. The VAP emanated from studies which predicted forest resources depletion and the ensuing energy crisis and environmental degradation. The identified strategy of village forestry on a large scale was established. For various reasons, these early efforts have not been very effective. People's participation in VAP appears to be binding. Concepts like participatory rural appraisal and participatory technology development are essential and are based on the conviction that people's participation works by focusing on their own perspectives. Although this approach is still in its early stages of application in Tanzania, the initial results are encouraging. VAPs are proceeding beyond lipservice in some localities. Further refinement is needed of the approach and its sustainability and replicability through research and development.

AB In any voluntary cooperative agreement, the potential gain from deviation should determine the minimum influence required over common decision-making. This paper begins by observing that a highly asymmetrical distribution of power between two partners is not sustainable if the choice variables are strategic substitutes. It then studies a simple general-equilibrium model of a monetary union and shows that a small economy will not take part in the agreement unless it can secure influence that is more than proportional to its size and a transfer of seigniorage revenues in its favor.

TI NARROWING THE GAP IN HEALTH-STATUS OF MINORITY POPULATIONS - A COMMUNITY
   ACADEMIC MEDICAL-CENTER PARTNERSHIP
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB A major challenge in the United States is to narrow the gap in the excess morbidity and mortality rates of minority populations. This article presents a synthesis of the 15-year results of a collaborative program between the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and an African-American community with the highest rates of premature disease and death in Maryland. The program began with an efficacious disease prevention clinical trial with patients and ended with effective population approaches. We transferred key components to community ownership and formally trained community health workers who provided health promotion counseling, monitoring, linkage, and referral services. Results indicated significant decreases in morbidity and mortality as a result of improved control of hypertension. This program has begun to decrease the health status gap in an African-American population and has demonstrated long-term sustainability. Current joint activities are directed at several major causes of excess morbidity and mortality, including smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, and at plans for programs to control diabetes, substance abuse, and breast and cervical cancer.

AB We studied five men with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (mean age, 65 +/- SEM 2 yr; FEV1, 0.68 +/- 0.08 L; and FEV1/FVC, 38 +/- 2%) to determine the relationship between ventilatory muscle endurance (VME) and ventilatory muscle rest (VMR) elicited by negative-pressure ventilation (NPV). VME was measured as the maximal sustainable ventilation (MSVC) that the subjects could maintain for 12 min. Prior to therapy, MSVC for the subjects was 25.0 +/- 3.6 L/min. During the therapy phase, subjects received 4 wk of daily "in-hospital-supervised" NPV therapy (4 h/day). While subjects received therapy, we quantified VMR by (1) the percentage of breaths that were "in synchrony" and by (2) the percentage of breaths showing "turn-off" of the diaphragmatic EMG signal (EMGdi). During the therapy sessions, 93 +/- 2% of breathes were in synchrony, whereas 66 +/- 11% showed EMGdi turn-off. During post-therapy testing, an increase in MSVC was noted in each of the subjects the mean increase was 4.0 +/- 1.3 L/min (p < 0.05), which represented an increase of 16 +/- 4% over pretherapy values. Increases in MSVC were highly correlated with both the age of in-synchrony breaths (r = 0.96, p < 0.01) and the percentage of breaths showing EMGdi turn-off (r = 0.92, p < 0.02). However, NPV therapy elicited no other improvements in either clinical or laboratory measurements. Moreover, patients exhibited marked dyspnea with initiation and termination of dally NPV therapy. We conclude that, despite laboratory evidence of an improvement in VME, dally NPV therapy (under the specified circumstances of our study), does not appear to be efficacious in the therapy of severe COPD.

TI A CRITICAL-LOOK AT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE CANADIAN NORTH
SO ARCTIC
LA English
DT Article
DE SUSTAINABLE; DEVELOPMENT; ENERGY; HARVESTING; INDIGENOUS; RESOURCE
AB The notion of sustainable development has considerable appeal in northern Canada, a reflection of traditional practices of indigenous populations and the region's experiences with the encroachment of industrial society. The lexicon of "sustainable development" has made the identification of appropriate economic activities a central issue. There is no standard approach to this problem although Weeden (1989) produced a useful framework for evaluation. Analysis of the evolution of the economic geography of the North provides some insights into both the current emphasis on the role of communities in sustainable development strategies and the origin of candidate activities. Review of possible candidate activities suggests that there is perhaps a tendency to confuse renewal with sustainability and that the appropriateness of activities may be called into doubt when viewed from the standpoint of relative energy consumption and global context. Sustenance harvesting is seen as perhaps the most viable sustainable activity, although some assessments of its value may be overstated. Non-renewable resource exploitation is a particular problem, yet the extraction of some non-renewable resources may contribute to a global goal of sustainability. A prerequisite for the development of a rational approach to sustainability lies in establishing the nature of the reciprocal relationship between urban centres and the northern periphery.

TI CARDIAC ASSISTANCE FROM SKELETAL-MUSCLE - A CRITICAL-APPRAISAL OF THE
   VARIOUS APPROACHES
SO BRITISH HEART JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID COUNTERPULSATION; CARDIOMYOPLASTY; DEVICE
AB We review here various ways in which cardiac assistance might be derived from a patient's own skeletal muscle. Calculations based on experimental data and optimistic estimates of the efficiency of the energy conversions involved suggest that the continuous assist available would be limited to about 2 litres a minute if a muscle were used to energise an electromechanical device. It would be more efficient to couple the energy mechanically or hydraulically, but these approaches still pose problems of anatomical placement, muscle attachment, fluid leakage, and cost. Unless these issues can be addressed, the use of skeletal muscle as an internal power source for mechanical circulatory assist devices will remain an unworkable concept. Configurations that couple skeletal muscle contraction directly to the circulation would be more efficient and less costly. In terms of the energy available, a skeletal muscle ventricle could be designed to provide a continuous partial assist of 1-2 1/min, with flows of up to 8 1/min sustainable for limited periods. Such an approach offers new possibilities for the surgical treatment of chronic cardiac failure.

TI AN ETHICAL APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL-PROTECTION - A CODE OF CONDUCT AND

SO CANADIAN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION-ADMINISTRATION PUBLIQUE DU CANADA
LA English
DT Article
AB The World Commission on Environment and Development felt that it was desirable to build a common framework and action plan to communicate across the divides of world cultures, religions, and regions. Towards this, the commission recommended a set of ethical principles concerning environmental protection and sustainable development for states to follow. Canada, among several nations, conceded the need for developing such a code of environmental stewardship through its Green Plan. The purpose of this paper is to discuss: our attitudes towards nature which have resulted in the present state of environmental crisis; the extent the world cultures and religions could assist humanity to change its perspectives towards nature; the need for an environmental code of conduct, its basic principles and tenets; suggested guiding principles for environmental management so that governmental commitment to environmental stewardship is on firmer ground; and the role of the media, non-governmental organizations, and individual citizens in raising the consciousness about the environment through the use of the proposed code. In the end, the arguments presented in support of the suggested code and guiding principles are summarized. Further, an outline of the proposed code and guiding principles is appended.

AB The modification of capital markets to incorporate environmental costs and benefits will promote longer-term investment and sustainable development. Rada and Trisoglio argue that the short-term investment perspective of many of the world's capital markets is the greatest single barrier to sustainability as a legitimate economic goal. Traditional methods of valuation must be changed to account more fully for the economic costs and benefits of environmental goods and services, recognizing the often distant nature of the return. The authors present a conceptual framework from which to explore change in valuation methods - change that will affect behavior all the way to the shop floor.

AB As the Environmental Commissioner for the EC, Carlo Ripa di Meana was on of the main proponents of the adoption of a European Community tax on energy and carbon emissions. Since stepping down to assume the responsibilities of the Minister of the Environment in Italy, he has not softened his opinions. He sees such a tax as not only a benefit to the environment, but equally as important as a means to ensure that industry strives for ever increasing efficiency.

His ideas about solving the world's energy problems, reducing carbon emissions and pulling developing countries out of poverty without harming the environment run contrary to popular belief With conviction and irony, he substantiates the detrimental effects of the hailed carbon tax, and champions a temporary increase in carbon emissions over the next few decades to allow developing countries time to install needed technology.

AB Few seem to recognize the enormity of the challenge of limiting world carbon emissions. Carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels will go up, not down, in the years following the Rio conference. This will not be because the industrial economies are energy wastrels; they have reined in their emissions. Rather, the increase in carbon emissions will be the consequence of continued economic development of the non-industrial economies whose populations are rapidly increasing. Businesses, and energy businesses in particular, will be the key instruments in making this development catch-up process sustainable.

AB As economic adjustments shock the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, energy and environmental problems have emerged as a huge impediment to the industrial restructuring and the development of their modern and sustainable free-market economies. The massive capital costs associated with simply maintaining energy production and the heavy environmental burdens associated with energy supply systems are forcing governments to rethink their industrial strategies. Drawing upon recent experiences, Foell describes the scope of these problems and the nature of commercially exploitable solutions which, if implemented, could bring about major energy and cost savings and significant export market opportunities.

World class manufacturers in particular have woven environmenta concerns into their corporate culture, their marketing strategies and their operations, to great effect. What they are finding is that waste reduction techniques, life cycle analysis and cradle-to-grave concern in the design process yield unexpected rewards.

TI TECHNOARROGANCE AND HALFWAY TECHNOLOGIES - SALMON HATCHERIES ON THE
   PACIFIC COAST OF NORTH-AMERICA
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Humankind bas adopted an arrogant and ultimately self-defeating attitude toward nature that places technological mastery over nature at the forefront of our approach to many environmental problems. This "techno-arrogance" fails to recognize limitations on, and ramifications of, attempted control of nature An example of techno-arrogance is the flawed attempt to recover Pacific salmonid fisheries through technological application in the form of hatcheries. Countless salmon stocks have declined precipitously over the last century as a result of over fishing and widespread habitat destruction A central feature of recovery efforts has been to build many hatcheries to produce large quantities of fish to restock streams. This approach addresses the symptoms but not the causes of the declines (an example of a halfway technology), because the habitats remain largely unsuitable for salmon. There are at least six reasons why the hatchery approach will ultimately fail: (1) data demonstrate that hatcheries are not solving the problem-salmon continue to decline despite decades of hatchery production; (2) hatcheries are costly to run, and divert resources from other efforts; such as habitat restoration; (3) hatcheries are not sustainable in the long term requiring continual input of money and energy; (4) hatcheries are a genetically unsound approach to management that can adversely affect wild populations; (5) hatchery production leads to increased harvest of declining wild populations of salmon; and (6) hatcheries conceal from the public the truth of real salmon decline. I recommend that salmonid management turn from the symptoms to the causes of decline. Over harvest and habitat destruction must be directly addressed in a major, landscape-level effort, on a scale comparable to the hatchery program, if salmonid fisheries are to remain a part of the ecological, recreational, commercial, and asthetic arenas in the long term.

TI THE ECOLOGY OF RAWA AOPA, A PEAT-SWAMP IN SULAWESI, INDONESIA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Rawa Aopa is a large swamp in South-East Sulawesi, Indonesia - the only major peat-swamp in this mainly mountainous island. Its vegetation and fauna are still quite poorly known. The existing information is summarized here. With the creation of new villages as part of Indonesia's transmigration programme, the human population in this area has increased very rapidly. Pressure on natural resources - especially soils and forests - is increasing, and primary forests are dwindling rapidly. This in tum increases the threats to Rawa Aopa, as erosion in its catchment area inevitably leads to a rapid silting up of the swamp. The swamp has a potential as a source of food (fish and sago) and income (rattan and other products), and it might to some degree become a tourist attraction.
   From a scientific point of view, the gaps in the knowledge about water-regime, vegetation, and fauna, ought to be remedied. In order to attain sustainable utilization of this area, a thorough plan ought to be made for the whole catchment of Rawa Aopa. The most important measure to take is the protection of the forests covering the hills and the surroundings of the swamp. Also important very widely is the protection of soils. Furthermore, it is recommended to include the northern part of the swamp in the already-existing Rawa Aopa-Watumohai National Park.

   WETLAND OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE - LAKE KERKINI, MACEDONIA, GREECE
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
ID METABOLISM
AB Kerkini Lake in Greece, a reservoir maintained principally for agricultural irrigation purposes on the Strymon River, has been classified as a 'Wetland of International Importance' according to the Ramsar Convention. Hydrological conditions favoured the formation of a shallow, very productive lake, rich in species diversity and biotic abundance. The importance of the wetland lay in its complex zonation of various habitats which mainly consisted of: shallow open water with sand-strips, beaches, and mud-flats; shallow-water areas with communities of emergent vegetation; a lowland hardwood riparian forest mainly of Salix and Tamarix species; a shrub-swamp; and extensive wet meadows. The diversity of habitats supported a rich waterbird fauna for breeding, stationing during migration, and wintering.
   Nevertheless, in 1982 a new high-dam was constructed, higher embankments along the banks of the Lake were established, and other works were carried out (to increase the water capacity of the reservoir), in response to irrigation demands. No consideration was given to the wetland resources. Operation of the new dam resulted in changes in the flooding etc. regime, with severe impact on the biotic resources of the wetland, especially by water-level increases of more than 5 m in less than 4 months during spring - the critical growing- and breeding-season. Wetland heterogeneity and the mosaic structure of water-land-vegetation were thereby lost.
   Now the riparian forest is diminishing in area and declining in productivity, the reed-swamp with emergent macrophytes has been lost, and wet meadows have also disappeared. Deep flooding and the loss of these habitats is reflected in marked decline in the densities of migratory waterbird populations and, most important, in drastic shrinkage in the populations of breeding species. Similar impact is observed in the dramatic decline of fish species diversity and abundance. In general, nowadays, Kerkini presents an alarming example of loss of biodiversity and accelerating impoverishment of its former biotic resources.
   In view of the projected plans to increase further the water-storage capacity of the Lake by raising its water-level, measures are urgently needed: (a) for preventing such actions; (b) for restoring and maintaining marsh conditions, and (c) for ecologically sound management and sustainable use of the wetland resources.

AB Islands have many problems in common with certain continental areas. Yet, at the same time they provide a special case in development, largely owing to specific characteristics of their natural resources, their economies, and their culture. The rational management of small island ecosystems (less than 10,000 sq km, population 50,000 or less) is one of the main aspects of the multidisciplinary research project promoted by the "Man and the Biosphere" Program (MAB) of UNESCO. This article aims to shed light on some important methodological and conceptual issues confronted during almost two decades of fieldwork.

TI DEMOGRAPHIC-FACTORS AND LAND-USE PLANNING IN THE SMALL ISLANDS OF
   SOUTHERN EUROPE
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE SMALL GREEK ISLANDS; SMALL ITALIAN ISLANDS; DEMOGRAPHY; LAND-USE
   PLANNING; LABOR MARKET
AB Since the end of the 1970s, the southern European countries have shown an exceptional reduction in fertility rate. From the highest levels among the developed nations, these countries dropped beneath the substitution rate level: in Greece there is an average of about 1.5 children per woman, and Italy (starting three to four years ago), with 1.3 children per woman, is now the country with the lowest fecundity rate in the world. Land-use planning in southern European small islands therefore requires substantial revision. In the areas where western civilization began, which are highly populated and have a long history, cultural and ethnic aspects of tradition are fundamental to environmental management and to the defense of historical heritage. They also place a strong value on sustaining tourism, the most relevant economic activity, that allows them to survive and maintain a high welfare level. For some decades they have had populations with a marked presence of young people and high emigration rates, but now they are fast becoming dominated by the elderly and must prepare for a period of fast reduction in youth of the workforce, while the peripheral areas of Asia and Africa are entering a sudden demographic growth phase.
   The demographic structure has also been deeply altered both by previous migrations and by random variations, as usually happens in all small communities. Social services for younger and older people have had to be adapted rapidly, reorganizing high-school management, hospital and health-care structures, in-house assistance, and so on. There is a need to rethink the job market and favor the immigration of highly specialized workers, which is a necessity for technical evolution. Sustainable development is constrained nowadays not only by the scarcity of natural resources, but also by the quality and quantity of human resources. Proper policies for population and land-use planning are highly correlated factors; they have to be considered with respect of these new, rapid demographic changes.

DT Article
DE CARIBBEAN; SMALL ISLANDS; TOURISM, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB This article focuses on developing a sustainable tourism in small Caribbean islands, defined here as those that have populations of fewer than 500,000. Such islands share a very fragile ecology and a high dependence on tourism. They differ in their degree of tourist penetration and visitor density and the related degree of environmental degradation.
   To explain the link between tourism intensity and ecological vulnerability, the so-called "destination life-cycle model" is presented. This suggests that islands pass through three primary stages of tourist development: low-density exploration, rapid growth and consolidation, and high-density maturation involving the substitution of man-made for natural attractions.
   A broad empirical test of the model is performed through a quantitative examination of the tourism characteristics and visitor densities of a cross section of 23 small Caribbean islands. The three basic stages or tourism styles are identified: low-impact emerging areas, high-density mass-market mature destinations, and rapidly growing intermediate islands in between. Some broad strategies consistent with the systems framework for a sustainable tourism with moderate densities are briefly explored.

DE MULTICRITERIA ANALYSIS; EVALUATION TECHNIQUES; DECISION MAKING; SMALL
   ISLANDS; AEOLIAN ARCHIPELAGO
AB Several multicriteria evaluation techniques have been developed since the 1970s. The need to compare different territorial policies has justified their introduction into environmental research. These methods are based on the numerical manipulation of heterogeneous information, which varies in terms of reference scale and type of measure (continuous, ordinal, qualitative, binary, etc.).
   During recent years, diverse investigations have focused on general conditions on Salina, the "green island" of the Aeolian archipelago. Such studies, within an interdisciplinary project, aimed to explore the possibility of implementing conservation strategies that are compatible with human needs, landscape preservation, and sustainable economic development.
   Three different evaluation techniques are applied, namely multicriteria weighted concordance and discordance analysis and a qualitative procedure. They are used to compare four alternative plans for the socioeconomic development of Salina Island. These plans lie between extreme alternatives: total protection of natural resources and maximizing economic development based on tourism. The plans are compared to each other on the basis of 14 criteria that reflect the socioenvironmental perception of Salina's inhabitants.
   The approach used in this research seems particularly fruitful because of its flexibility: it offers decision makers the chance to manage heterogeneous data and information that is not easily quantifiable. Such "soft" information helps to evaluate environmental conditions more precisely, and to make a less damaging choice among alternative development plans.

DE AGRICULTURE; COMPLEXITY; INFORMATION THEORY; SMALL ISLANDS; SUSTAINABLE
   DEVELOPMENT; THERMODYNAMICS
AB In order to develop small islands, not only must a vital agricultural system be maintained, but the range of opportunities for tourism must be increased with respect to both the seaside and the environmental features of the rural landscape. As an alternative to the traditional and economically declining ones, many innovative production processes can be identified, but their success depends on their interaction with the physical, biological, economic and social environment. In order to identify the main nodes and the most critical interactions, so as to increase the probability of success of a new productive process, a methodological approach based on the science of complexity is proposed for the cultivation of capers (Capparis spinosa L.) on the island of Pantelleria. The methodology encompasses the identification of actors and factors involved, the quantitative evaluation of their interactions with the different stages of the productive process, and a quasiquantitative evaluation of the probability that the particular action will be performed successfully.
   The study of "traditional," "modernized," and "modernized sustainable" processes, shows that the modernized-sustainable process offers mutually reinforcing opportunities in terms of an integrated development of high-quality agricultural products and the enhancement of environmental features, in conjunction with high-efficiency production techniques, in a way that suits the development of Pantelleria. There is a high probability of failure, however, as a result of the large number of critical factors. Nevertheless, the present study indicates which activities will enhance the probability of successful innovation in the production process.

AB The emergence of a new problematique-transitional economies-that cannot be handled within traditional paradigms and models is linked to the difficult transformation of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to a Western-style market economy. The case of the former East Germany stands out, for here the transformation is occurring at unprecedented speed and in the most condensed form. Several phases of such transformation can be envisaged: introduction of basic principles of the market economy, building of infrastructural, financial, administrative and legal preconditions for the efficient running of scale economies, and bringing about the shift to socially oriented and ecologically sustainable economic performance. The transformation needs help from the West. Coordinated and strategically directed assistance to self-help is required that may take the form of a recovery programme for Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (a new version of the Marshall Plan).

AB Following the public discussion about consequences of management activities also economists, scientists as well as practitioners, are concerned with questions of business ethics. The article focusses on three fundamental ethical positions, which may guide the discussion about environmental responsibility in horticulture.
   Position 1 - Free Market Economy - defines the efficient use of resources as the sole ethical objective of management activities which are totally determined by the given framework (laws, institutions, availability and prices of factors). Changes of this framework in view of protection of environment are political issues but not under the responsibility of management activities.
   Position 2 - Cultivation and Conservation - insists on the value of nature independent of utility considerations. In order to protect nature and thus to secure the basis for sustainable horticulture the manager renounces part of his profit. Individual responsibility (instead of laws) is an effective guideline for management activities.
   In opposite of the preceding positions position 3 - Legitimation by Consensus - focusses the procedure of a public dialogue as the cornerstone of ethics. People effected by management activities should be involved in discussions aiming to develop acceptable solutions. By following this procedure ethical standards will be based on the best arguments. In the long run conflicts between profit oriented management and ethics will be abandoned.

AB A major low-angle ductile shear zone containing S-C mylonites involves metamorphosed granitic rocks at the southeastern edge of the Nyainqentanglha mountain range, southern Tibet. Prominent triangular facet geomorphology is developed by valley erosion of the detachment surface, defined by the top of the southeast-dipping mylonitic shear zone. Kinematic criteria consistently indicate a top-to-southeast sense of shear. The ductile shearing deformation is inferred, from isotopic cooling ages, to have occurred during the interval 11-5 Ma (late Miocene). We interpret the shear zone as a regional extensional detachment; its development indicates when the extensional tectonics in this area started, which in turn may mark the time when the maximum sustainable surface elevation, and perhaps crustal thickness, was reached in southern Tibet.

TI THE USE AND PERFORMANCE OF COLLECTOR WELLS WITHIN THE REGOLITH AQUIFER
   OF SRI-LANKA
SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB Thirty-two collector wells were constructed from existing large-diameter wells dug in weathered hard rock (regolith) areas of the northern Dry Zone of Sri Lanka. A collector well is constructed by drilling 30 m long horizontal adits from the base of the dug well so as to exploit the permeable layer of the regolith, which lies just above the zone of slightly weathered rock. Across the North-Central Province of the island, the water table commonly lies within the regolith for most of the year enabling dug wells to yield water. The generally poor yield of these wells and the occasional dry well has resulted in this aquifer being largely neglected by developers with most recent efforts going into the construction of many slim boreholes.
   The objectives of this work were: (1) to enhance the yields from suitable dug wells, (2) to observe the variation in yield improvement for wells with different constructions and in varying geologic and hydrogeologic environments, and (3) to monitor the performance of the converted wells throughout the dry season.
   The project has demonstrated that, on average, the conversion of a dug well to a collector well more than doubles the yield of ground water and that these yields are sustainable throughout the dry season. Safe yields from these wells average an equivalent continuous yield of 60 m3/day, assuming a 100 day dry period.

TI VALUING THE RAIN-FOREST - ECONOMIC-STRATEGIES BY SMALL-SCALE FOREST

DT Article
DE RAIN FOREST; COMBU ISLAND; MANAGEMENT
AB The current interest in non-timber forest products as an economic option for the Brazilian Amazon represents a radical departure from the policies that have guided development in the region during recent decades. Despite this interest, little is currently known about the forms of resource management or economic strategies practiced by populations dependent on such resources. In this study, we measured the annual income and expenditures of ten households on Combu Island, located in the Amazon estuary near the major port city of Belem; in addition, we documented local uses and management of natural resources on the island Average annual income per household was found to be over U. S. $4000, derived primarily from the harvest and sale of non-timber forest products. The results of this study show that the combination of proximity to a major market and appropriate resource management can lead to high and apparently sustainable economic returns.

AB There is increasing interest in including indigenous peoples of Amazonia in conservation activities. Conservation biologists and anthropologists often rely on assumptions of sustainable resource use by these native Amazonians based on traditional patterns of subsistence. As indigenous societies become more market oriented, however, they often must exploit floristic and faunal resources to meet growing needs for trade goods. Little is known about how these groups use their resources (particularly those involving animal products) under these conditions, or whether this use is in fact sustainable. In this paper we explore the question of subsistence hunters as commercial hunters, drawing on data collected among the Siriono of lowland Bolivia and their exploitation of the Paraguayan caiman (Caiman yacare). We suggest that any attempt to develop and implement resource conservation management plans must include both biological and social research to assess fully the complexities inherent to the human exploitation of faunal resources.

AB This note studies the sustainability of primary budget deficits in a situation where the public sector has also incurred debt to the private sector. It shows that if the rate of pure time preference is small relative to the population growth rate, if public consumption constitutes a modest fraction of output, and if the primary budget deficit is sufficiently small, then it is also sustainable, and the associated steady state is locally stable.

AB Variability in reproduction and pathogenicity of 12 populations of Meloidogyne arenaria race 1 was evaluated on Florunner peanut, Centennial soybean, Rutgers tomato, G70, K326, and Mc944 tobacco, and Carolina Cayenne, Mississippi Nemaheart, and Santanka pepper. Differences among M. arenaria populations in rates of egg production 45 days after inoculation were observed for all cultivars except Santanka pepper. Differences among populations in dry top weights or fresh root weights were recorded on all cultivars. Numbers of nematode eggs produced on Florunner peanut varied from 3,419 to 11,593/g fresh root weight. On resistant tobacco cultivars (G70 and K326), one nematode population produced high numbers of eggs (12,042 and 6,499/g fresh root weight on G70 and K326, respectively), whereas the other populations produced low numbers of eggs (less than 500 eggs/g fresh root weight on both cultivars). Two variant M. arenaria race 1 populations were identified by factor analysis of reproductive rates on all nine cultivars. Differences in reproduction and pathogenicity observed among populations would affect the design of sustainable management systems for M. arenaria.

TI TRADITIONS OF FOREST CONTROL IN JAVA - IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIAL FORESTRY
   AND SUSTAINABILITY
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Ideally, social forestry programs and philosophies are intended to involve local people in the management and distribution of forest resources. In practice, the structures of social forestry programs are influenced by political, economic, and cultural factors at national and local levels. When social forestry programs entail the reallocation of access to forest resources on state lands, power relations are particularly influential. As the case of the Java Social Forestry Program illustrates, powerful social forces that have historically shaped the national forest management agency and the social structures of forest-based villages have distorted social forestry ideals. When their traditional management tools are unable to curb deforestation and the social processes causing deforestation, forestry agencies may be persuaded to implement social forestry policies. The natures of changes in forestry programs and the orientation of social forestry are inevitably subject to local negotiation and renegotiation. The outcomes of negotiation, however, are dependent on the structures of power relations both before and after implementation of new policies.

AB A methodic pathway is suggested for the definition, elaboration, evaluation and introduction of farming systems based on an 'integrated' or an 'ecosystem-oriented' vision, both considered more sustainable than a 'world-market-oriented' vision. The objectives of these three basic types of systems are defined in measurable terms with respect to the major social values or interests supported or adversely influenced by agriculture. For each type of systems, a strategy is assessed through which the objectives can be achieved while avoiding their conflicts. Arable farming is taken as an example of the elaboration, evaluation and introduction of integrated and ecosystem-oriented systems. It is discussed how prototype systems can be developed on an experimental farm, evaluated by a pilot group of farmers and dispersed on a large scale. For the short term it is recommended to focus research and policy on integrated farming systems, as an urgently needed compromise between socio-economical and socio-ecological interests. For the long term it is recommended to develop ecosystem-oriented farming systems to solve the agricultural crisis in a more comprehensive and sustainable way.

AB The LD process as a basis for the productionof high purity steels is an important factor for steel and its way to a recycling hightech product. Its flexibility with regard to charge materials is a contribution to the internal and external scrap recycling. The process is a solution for processing of metal-coated scraps.
   Dust minimization and dust recycling is possible. Additional converter gas as an ecological generated valuable by-product will be produced. An utilization of the slag is possible.
   The basic oxygen steelmaking process is an important link in a process chain offering essential economic and ecological options-therefore, in its present state a contribution to the "sustainable development".

TI INTEGRATED PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT IN PROTECTED CROPS
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Considerable progress has been made in developing integrated pest and disease management strategies for protected crops. Bacteria, nematodes, fungi and insect predators and parasites are used as biological control agents for pests and diseases and are combined with plant breeding for resistance, environmental control and informed intervention with minimal amounts of compatible pesticides. Some crops can already be grown with greatly reduced or no pesticide input. With others there is a need for further research on integrated pest and disease management strategies to develop sustainable systems of crop protection.

TI USING CROP MODELS FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY
   ASSESSMENT
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article, the question of how various aspects of sustainability can be studied is outlined, with particular reference to ways in which the efficiency of the agricultural research and development process can be enhanced, The role of crop simulation models as useful tools in sustainability research and in the assessment of environmental impact is discussed with reference to some of the collaborative model development and application activities of the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC). Despite the fact that much development work is needed on crop simulation models, there are few practical alternatives to address the complex and interactive nature of sustainability issues and environmental impact assessments.

TI RETRIEVING LIFE-PLACE FROM COLONIZED SPACE - TRANSCENDING THE
   ENCUMBRANCES OF THE POSTCOLONIAL STATE
SO POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB The thesis advanced in this paper is that the phenomena of impeded development and ethno-national unrest in the Third World are inextricable from one another. Their origins are identified in the spatial structure of post-colonial states, which produce societies that are anthropologically, economically and ecologically fragmented. Such fragmentation derives from the drawing of colonial borders in a manner aimed at maximizing economic benefit and/or geostrategic advantage to the metropolitan powers. Boundaries drawn in this way did not serve the interests of indigenous social formations since they frequently divided such groups and the ecosystems of which they are a part. The post-colonial state today is essentially indigenized colonized space. These polities perpetuate the fragmentary ethnic and ecological territories pieced together as part of the imperial enterprise; decolonization simply entailed the transfer of control over these polities to indigenous elites. In this context, the territorial composition of the post-colonial state renders it resistant to sustainable development. The social fragmentation which is so dominant a feature of post-colonial societies seriously challenges the possibilities for nation-building as well as for development. The fragmentation of the Kurdish ethno-region as a result of the establishment of the post-colonial states into which it is divided serves as the illustrative case of this study.

TI LABOR AND PRODUCTION BARRIERS TO THE REDUCTION OF AGRICULTURAL CHEMICAL
   INPUTS
SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ADOPTION; TECHNOLOGIES
AB Advocates of sustainable agriculture consider farmer flexibility and innovativeness a key element in efforts to develop farm practices that reduce chemical inputs. In contrast to labor displacing technologies, farming with reduced chemical inputs may increase labor demands. Consequently, concerns about labor supply may affect farmer adaptability in reducing chemical inputs. This research addresses two specific questions. First, how concerned are farmers about the availability of labor needed to reduce chemical inputs? Second, do farmers view production problems as insurmountable without chemicals because of labor constraints? The majority of farmers surveyed agree that it is difficult to reduce chemical inputs because additional labor is hard to find, and their own labor inputs would have to increase. Results of OLS regression analysis show that whether the farmer hires workers affects the relationship between perceived labor and production barriers. Labor supply is less elastic for farmers who hire no labor, and they have less access to social networks that would provide them with sources of the additional workers needed if chemical inputs were reduced. The significance of these results for the development of sources of information that enhance farmer adaptability is discussed.

SP RURAL SOCIOL SOC
AB In recent years, publicly funded agricultural science at land grant universities (LGUs) has come under increasing criticism by those who argue that LGUs have contributed to an industrial mode of agriculture that is neither ecologically nor socioeconomically sustainable. The views of critics and defenders of modern industrial agriculture reflect two competing perspectives on agriculture-an alternative and a conventional paradigm. Utilizing a 24-item alternative-conventional agriculture paradigm (ACAP) scale, this study analyzes the paradigmatic positions of faculty in the College of Agriculture and Home Economics at Washington State University, Results reveal that the faculty are slightly more conventional than are farmers statewide, slightly less conventional than proponents of conventional agriculture, and far more conventional than known alternative agriculturalists. When looking at particular elements of the agricultural debate, however, the faculty tend to be more conventional than farmers on the socioeconomic elements of the competing paradigms but considerably less conventional on elements dealing with ecological and conservation issues. Women, younger faculty, non-land grant educated faculty, and faculty not raised on farms are somewhat more likely to endorse the alternative agriculture paradigm than are their counterparts. These differences are minor, however, compared to the differences across academic disciplines. Faculty of departments oriented to the social sciences (with the exception of agricultural economics) tend to most strongly endorse the alternative paradigm, while faculty from the more production-oriented departments and agricultural economics are the most conventional. Possible implications of the findings are discussed for the future of publicly-funded a cultural science.

TI SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - ITS MEANING FOR THE CARIBBEAN
SO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to give historical perspective to the concept and process of sustainable development, a brief review of major recent views, from the Greek to the now emerging Biospheric World View is presented. Sustainable development is presented as the pathway from the current mechanical world paradigm to the emergent biospheric view.
   Concepts of sustainable development are reviewed and discussed in general terms and with specific reference to the Caribbean. Approaches at operationalising the concept at the global level and in the Caribbean region are summarised. An attempt is made at laying the foundations of an integrated academic discipline of sustainable development.
   In conclusion, imminent world events are mentioned and the potential importance of environmental economics noted. ''Recognising that our economic development should be sensitive to environmental concerns, we reaffirm our strong commitment to achieving patterns of sustainable development that will permit improvement in standards of living with protection of the ecology. We will cooperate with the international community in pursuit of these environmental concerns...'' From the Kingston Declaration issued by Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community 2nd August 1990.

AB Much of the current donor discussion of governance takes place outside of a historical or theoretical context. This article locates the governance issue within recent political science, development management, and institutional economics literature. The review focuses on accountability, participation, transparency, and predictability or the rule of law, and includes a discussion of the impact of these variables upon economic performance. It concludes that donors can best assist good governance to develop by helping to foster conditions under which developing societies can push their governments to deliver the accountability, transparency and rule of law that sustainable development requires.

TI SUSTAINABLE PASTURE SYSTEMS IN THE HUMID TROPICS OF QUEENSLAND
SO TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
LA English
DT Article
ID SITE
AB Research and development of improved pasture technology for the humid tropical coast of Queensland has resulted in the successful development, maintenance and regeneration of large areas of commercial pastures, many of which are now over 20 years old. Weeds have been controlled, a good balance of desirable pasture species has been maintained and large numbers of high quality fat cattle are being turned off. These demonstrations of sustainable high production are contrary to most experience with pastures in the humid tropics.
   The major objectives of the R & D program were: firstly, to find means of halting or reversing the decline in productivity which followed pasture development on rainforest lands; and secondly, to find productive pasture systems for infertile open forest lands where sown pastures had failed completely.
   Priority was given to research programs on (a) the selection of suitable legumes and grasses, (b) the assessment of soil nutritional problems, and (c) control of weeds and timber regrowth. Information from these studies was synthesised into a range of commercial management packages. Field studies of management alternatives indicated that high levels of sustainable production were possible. Results were subjected to further analyses in a computer modelling program aimed at assisting decisions on the most desirable of the management options for individual farms.

TI PERFORMANCE OF YEARLING STEERS GRAZING BAHIA GRASS PASTURES WITH SUMMER
   ANNUAL LEGUMES OR NITROGEN-FERTILIZER IN SUBTROPICAL FLORIDA
SO TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
LA English
DT Article
ID PENINSULAR FLORIDA
AB In the subtropics, bahia grass (Paspalum notatum) is a widely adapted but low-quality pasture grass. In peninsular Florida it is the predominant pasture grass, and levels of cattle production supported are typically low. Established pastures of bahia grass with either aeschynomene (Aeschynomene americana), phasey bean (Macroptilium lathyroides), or nitrogen fertiliser were evaluated over 3 years at Ona, Florida, USA for potential to provide sustainable pasture systems of increased productivity. Aeschynomene pastures produced the highest average daily gains (ADG) of yearling steers at 0.57 kg compared with an average of 0.36 kg for the other treatments. Crude protein (CP) concentration of legumes was high (over 20%), however, the legumes comprised only 7.2% (for aeschynomene) and 2.3% (for phasey bean) of the herbage dry matter during the peak period and did not increase CP or in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) of total herbage samples even during this period. The high nitrogen treatment (224 kg/ha N) produced higher (P < 0.05) total herbage CP and IVOMD than did the zero N control (12.9% CP vs. 8.8% and 48.8% IVOMD vs. 42.3%) but did not produce higher (P > 0.10) ADG. Carrying capacity was lowest on aeschynomene (536 d/ha) and highest at 224 kg/ha N (1322 d/ha). During the late summer period in 1983 and 1984, when aeschynomene comprised 12% and 6% respectively of the available herbage dry weight, ADG of 1.70 and 1.46 kg on the aeschynomene treatment substantially exceeded (P < 0.05) that of 0.79 and 0.84 kg on the control for that period. Stands of the legumes were not sustained, apparently due to dense grass sod and erratic rainfall. N fertilisation of bahia grass increased carrying capacity but failed to enhance individual animal performance despite increases in forage quality.

TI THE POLITICS OF PROTECTING THE POOR DURING ADJUSTMENT - BOLIVIA
   EMERGENCY SOCIAL FUND
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Emergency Social Fund (ESF), a compensatory scheme implemented as a complement to Bolivia's dramatic structural reform plan, attracted a great deal of both national and international attention, and there have been several attempts to set up similar programs in Latin America and Africa. Enthusiasts of the ESF cite its demand-based approach, its efficiency and transparency, and its rapid results. Critics question the program's ability to provide permanent poverty alleviation or to target the poorest sectors, and its institutional position outside the public sector. This study analyzes the impact of the ESF on politics and on the sustainability of the adjustment process. It also evaluates the ESF's effects on central and local level institutions, nongovernment actors, and the poor. The study seeks to enhance efforts to protect the poor during adjustment, and to identify the contributions such efforts can make to the political sustainability of the process.

TI THERMAL BUOYANCY ON VENUS - UNDERTHRUSTING VS SUBDUCTION
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID FREYJA-MONTES; CONSTRAINTS; CONVERGENCE; TECTONICS; GRADIENT; BELTS
AB In an effort to define the conditions distinguishing underthrusting and subduction in the Venus environment, we have modeled the thermal and buoyancy consequences of the subduction endmember. Predictions of the thermal evolution of a slab subducting at a fixed angle into the Venusian mantle are used to find slab densities based on slab composition and changes of temperature, pressure, and phase. The sustainability of subduction is assessed by considering the effects of slab buoyancy and mantle flow on the subduction angle. Mantle flow induced by slab motion applies torques on the slab, which are compared to buoyancy torques. Flow torques tend to decrease the angle of subduction. Buoyancy torques also act to decrease the subduction angle when the slab is positively buoyant. The basalt-eclogite phase transition dominates the transformation of positively buoyant slabs to negative buoyancy. Slabs that have descended to depths less than about 275 km remain positively buoyant. Beyond 275 km slabs become negatively buoyant. We predict that the combination of flow and buoyancy torques will tend to force initially subducted slabs to assume an underthrusting position, leading to crustal thickening, deformation, melting, and volcanism. This may provide a model explaining the association of compressional mountain belts and tessera blocks with apparent flexural rises, foredeeps, and voluminous volcanic deposits. Only special circumstances appear capable of promoting the conditions for negative slab buoyancy. These might include one where an under-thrust slab becomes attached to or included in a densified crustal root created in a zone of crustal thickening. The subsequent delamination and sinking of the root may then lead to the subduction of the slab.

LA English
DT Article
AB Since ecological issues in developing countries such as India are poverty related, they demand participatory research involving local communities in order to ensure sustainable development. Effective linkages between ecological process and social process studies need to be established in order to give a new orientation to research. Such studies are limited; the jhum system and tribal development in northeastern India is one of the very few examples. The International Sustainable Biosphere Initiative (ISBI), a new initiative developed at Cuernavaca, Mexico, in June 1991, provides the basis for such a worldwide programme.

AB Environmental degradation and the call for 'sustainable development' provide an extended context and new challenges for decision-theoretic research on risk assessment and management. We characterize environmental risk management as the resolution of four different types of 'survival' dilemmas in human social activity: benefit-risk, temporal, spatial and social dilemmas. These may lead into traps which arise through discounting of risks, future and distant effects, and collective interests, respectively. Each type of dilemma is discussed separately, against the background of differing research traditions. The four types of dilemma may combine into various problems of environmental degradation; descriptive field research should clarify this in each case. For resolving such problems a number of policy strategies is discussed. The dilemmas paradigm suggests multidisciplinary research whereby decision theorists could play meaningful roles, e.g., in formulating decision problems, assessing environmental quality and risk, describing typical human responses to the threat of being trapped, and designing and evaluating ways to achieve a better position in a given dilemma.

AB Planning agroforestry research programs requires the participation of people from many disciplines. They may have different interests in allocating financial resources for research purposes and, therefore. the decision-making is complex. Guidelines are needed to improve the decision-making process. Such guidelines may include a fist of weighted criteria identified by experts through group processes. This study used a qualitative approach (the Delphi method) to identify criteria to be used when planning agroforestry research programs in the developing countries. The panel of respondents was comprised of agroforestry experts who have experience and expertise in the developing countries. Fourteen (14) criteria were identified in questionnaire 1. These criteria were ranked in questionnaires 2 and 3. A Friedman test of analysis of variance followed by a Mann-Whitney U test of pairwise comparison produced four groups of criteria: group 1, the most highly ranked, comprises local people's needs, sustainability, adoptability and research quality; group 2 includes existing systems and economic criteria; group 3 encompasses biophysical effects, institutional capabilities, partnership and transferability; and group 4, the least ranked. includes diversity of products, tree/crop interface, flexibility and species selection. A Kruskal-Wallis test on each criterion and several respondent characteristics showed that the respondent characteristics of current work, highest degree held, ecosystem experience, geographic area of experience, and number of years experience influenced respondent criteria rankings. The test was not significant for background and respondent origin characteristics.

SO AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The disposal of sewage wastes may cause severe environmental problems as was graphically demonstrated with pollution on Sydney's ocean beaches in recent years. Sewage sludges contain valuable plant nutrients and organic matter which can Improve the fertility and structure of the soil. However, human parasites, pathogenic micro-organisms and chemicals capable of causing soil contamination, phytotoxicity and residues In animal products may also be present.
   Although sewage sludge is frequently spread on agricultural land overseas, it is not common In Australia and most states do not have specific regulations to minimise risk and promote good practice.
   A sludge-to-land program began in the Sydney region in 1990.  It follows guidelines written by NSW Agriculture to encourage beneficial agricultural use of sludge by adoption of environmentally sustainable practices. This article describes the major risks to the food-chain and the environment, which may be associated with applying sewage sludge to agricultural land. It summarises how the risks are managed, and where further research data are required.

AB We examined the dependence of epilithic algal standing crop, production, and nutrient limitation upon water column nutrients in 12 softwater lakes of northeastern Pennsylvania. Elevated dissolved inorganic nitrogen accompanied low dissolved inorganic carbon in the more acidic lakes, while P varied little within the study area. The growth of epilithon on clay flower pot substrata diffusing combinations of N (NaNO3), P (Na2HPO4), and C (NaHCO3) was compared with growth on control substrata to evaluate which of the three nutrients limited growth in each lake. Standing crop accrual as chlorophyll a on control substrata averaged 0.8-mu-g/cm2, with little variation among lakes. Nutrient limitation of growth, however, was strongly related to lake alkalinity. Chlorophyll a was typically enhanced by N and/or P only in lakes with alkalinity greater than approximately 100-mu-eq/L and responded strongly to C enrichment in the two most acidic lakes. Combined addition of all three nutrients produced the largest chlorophyll a accrual in all 12 lakes. Invertebrate grazer biomass, dominated by chironomids in the more acidic lakes and by snails at higher alkalinity, was negatively related to chlorophyll a on these NPC substrata (r = -0.57, p = 0.05) and may have reduced algal standing crop well below nutrient-sustainable levels in some lakes.

AB The USDA Forest Service is taking a new direction in its research and management programs in response to changing views of land and natural resources. The changes reflect the complexity of society's concerns and expectations for national forest management, including biological diversity, ecological function and balance, product yields, social values, and the beauty and integrity of natural environments. The new direction involves a shift in management focus from sustaining yields of competing resource outputs to sustaining ecosystems. More than ever, management of public lands and resources requires knowledge about ecosystems, including relationships to human values, activities, and patterns of resource use. Also required are new roles for scientists, including closer partnerships with managers to achieve large-scale studies and adaptive management of public lands and resources.

AB Natural resource management must integrate commercial development and use of forest resources with the maintenance of ecological values. The "New Perspectives" program of the U.S. Forest Service is responding to increased public environmental awareness and legislative mandates in placing a greater emphasis on ecosystem sustainability and non-traditional utilization of national forestlands. The forest of the southern United States is a complexity of associations developed along topographic and environmental gradients and shaped by natural disturbances and anthropogenic perturbations. It is highly fragmented as a result of past clearing for agriculture and timber harvesting and patterns of land ownership. Southern forests, in contrast to those in other regions, are mostly privately owned. This fragmentation is being maintained by current urbanization and industrialization as the population of the South increases.
   Our purpose is to identify ecological themes and concepts compatible with the stewardship philosophy of the Forest Service's New Perspectives that can be applied to the management of sustainable southern forest resources. Of special concern are the maintenance of biological diversity, watershed and water quality protection, and the assessment of regional land-use effects on the integrity of forest ecosystems and on continued forest productivity. Ecological principles must be integrated with natural resource management on landscape and regional scales to achieve sustainability of the southern forest ecosystem.

AB Gradient analysis is a powerful technique to analyze for, and detect change in, the dynamics, structure, and function of ecosystems. Boundaries between zones or communities occur at distinctive locations along environmental gradients and are expected to be especially sensitive to environmental change. Gradient analysis can be performed at a range of scales, and allows integration and extrapolation of change across scales from those associated with communities to those of biomes.
   This review outlines the properties of gradients in space and time and uses an example of forests in the Rocky Mountain Physiographic Province to demonstrate constraints, the complex mosaics associated with distributional limits, transfers across boundaries, the role of disturbance, and threshold dynamics. A climate-change scenario is developed to hypothesize future changes in boundary movements, community mosaics, and ecosystem properties along elevational and latitudinal gradients in the Rocky Mountain Province.
   Mechanistic explanations of ecological phenomena that are necessary for management require information on: (1) the physical environmental constraints operating on the ecosystem; (2) the biota that operate within those constraints; and (3) the interactions among the biota and between the biota and environment. The relative importance of these three elements differs between environments and along environmental gradients. Biota and their interactions may account for much of the variance in system structure and function in mesic environments, while abiotic factors may limit biotic activity in less-favorable (arid) habitats. Plot studies that are analyzed as points along broader scale environmental gradients can provide quantitative information on the major driving variables, and broad-scale analyses of environmental factors along the gradient generate the information for extrapolating between sites and across scales. Modeling that includes such spatial gradients provides the foundation for local to regional management programs.

AB Forest management practices on Federal lands in the Pacific Northwest of the United States have been the center of intense controversy. Conflicting value systems, new information, and new perspectives have fueled the debate over the balance between timber production and preservation of natural ecosystems. In this paper we consider examples from three aspects of forest management: (1) management of forest stands, (2) management of the patchwork of forest stands at the landscape scale, and (3) management of streams and riparian networks. In each of these cases we examine: management practices and perspectives of the recent past, findings from ecosystem research that are leading to change in those practices, resulting changes in management practices, and future research directions. We also suggest a path for future change, including systems for managing in the face of uncertainty.
   Results of research in natural and managed forest and stream ecosystems have been pivotal in reassessment and redesign of management practices to provide a broader range of management options for society to consider. Results of studies of natural disturbance processes and their effects are used as reference points for management systems intending to sustain biological diversity and ecosystem productivity. Stand management practices, for example, are being modified to retain some live trees and greater amounts of dead woody debris, both standing and down, in areas that would instead be clear-cut under intensive plantation forestry practices. The motivations for these modified practices are to sustain biological diversity, including key wildlife species, and to maintain soil productivity. Models of alternative forest-cutting patterns at a landscape scale are being used to examine their effects on ecosystem structure and function. One result of this analysis has been to shift from the previous system of dispersing cutting units to a system involving greater aggregation of units using designs to provide for species preferring forest interior habitat as well as species favoring edge and early seral habitats. As a result of ecosystem research, the management of stream and riparian networks can now be based on understanding of forest-stream interactions and designed within a drainage-basin context. Overall, emphasis in research and management seems to be in early stages of shifting from featured species-e.g., Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) - to ecosystems, and from the scale of forest stands to landscapes and the entire region.
   In addition to the contributions of ecosystem research to redesign of management techniques, ecosystem scientists also have roles in the social processes for determining the future course of management of natural resources. An important medium for scientist participation is establishment of adaptive management programs, in which management activities are conducted as experiments to test hypotheses and to develop information needed for future natural resource management.

AB In this paper we present a simple model of multiple-element limitation of plant production and biomass accumulation. The primary aim of this model is to develop a theoretical framework for examining multiple-element limitation vs. single-element limitation and for examining the relationship between short-term and long-term responses to changes in element availability. In the model we assume that there is an "optimal" ratio of mineral elements in vegetation biomass, and that the vegetation continually adjusts its relative element uptake capacities to compensate for shifts away from this optimum. We examine the responses of this model to changes in element availability in the plant environment, where "availability" is defined either as fixed concentrations of non-depletable elements or as fixed replenishment rates of depletable elements.
   The model results suggest that the nature of the controls on element availability has a major impact on whether single- or multiple-element limitation prevails, even when plants can acclimate so as to maintain an "optimal" nutritional balance. Single-element limitation occurs when the replenishment rate of an essential element to the available pool is limited and sustainable plant uptake of that element equals the replenishment rate. Furthermore, when single-element limitation prevails, there is little or no correlation between short-term responses to a change in element availability and long-term, equilibrium responses.
   In general, previous experimental studies and models of plant growth in response to changes in relative availability of multiple, essential elements have either not specified how those resources are controlled, or have examined only one type of control. Our results help to explain the diversity of results of past studies of multiple-element limitation, suggest some improvements in experimental design for future studies, and have important implications for the extrapolation of the results of controlled experiments to field situations.

TI CARTEL STABILITY IN AN EXHAUSTIBLE RESOURCE MODEL
SO ECONOMICA
LA English
DT Article
ID REPEATED GAMES; EXTRACTION
AB A simple oligopolistic common-pool exhaustible resource game is considered. By analysing punishment strategies, including optimal punishments, it is possible to determine which cartel agreements are implementable in a non-cooperative play of the game. Joint-profit-maximizing allocations are sustainable for sufficiently low discounting, but in general it is shown that no folk theorem exists for this model. In particular, for sufficiently high elasticities of demand, it is shown that optimal punishments are not sufficiently severe to enforce most stationary symmetric extraction paths, thus confirming the hypothesis that sufficient market power is needed for a cartel to be stable.

AB Juvenile rainbow trout (2-5 g) were chronically exposed (for 22 days) to acidified softwater (Ca2+ = 25 muEq/l, pH 5.2) in the presence or absence sublethal Al (30 mug/1). Al-exposed fish (5.2/Al group) suffered 20% whole body Na + and Cl - losses and a 30% reduction in the maximum sustainable swimming speed (U(crit)) over the initial 7 days. These disturbances were approximately 2 fold greater than those observed in the fish exposed to low pH alone (5.2/0 group). However, whole body ion levels were completely restored in the 5.2/Al fish by day 22, whereas they merely stabilized at a new reduced level in the 5.2/0 group. Increased resistance to acutely lethal Al (200 mug/l at pH 5.2) was observed from day 17 onwards in the 5.2/Al fish. Despite this acclimation and recovery of whole body ions, U(crit) remained significantly lower than in the 5.2/0 group throughout. Growth on a restricted diet of 1 % body wt./day was normal in the 5.2/0 group compared with controls maintained in pH 6.5 softwater, whereas 5.2/Al fish suffered a 50% reduction in growth rate on the same diet. The 5.2/Al fish accumulated large amounts of Al on the gills, reaching an initial peak after 4 days, followed by a decline at 7 days, and a secondary rise thereafter. Therefore acclimation and recovery of whole body ionic status was not associated with a reduction in the gill Al burden. Some of the metabolic costs of acclimation to Al, namely a continued impairment of swimming speed and growth, are discussed in light of the physiological and structural changes reported to occur at the gills.

TI THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR NATURAL
   SOCKEYE-SALMON STOCKS IN BRISTOL BAY, ALASKA
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB There has been an extraordinary evolution of the management Program In Bristol Bay for natural sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks that has coincided with a roughly two-fold increase in sustainable harvest level. During this evolution there has been a continuous expansion of projects to assess the stocks and monitor fisheries. Escapement goals were continuously revised as warranted by the emerging data, and management has become more accurate and precise. Computer simulations showed how changes in harvest policy and reductions in management error can increase the sustainable yield of these fisheries. These benefits and costs were expressed as the ratio of present value of the incremental increases in sustainable harvests to the incremental cost of the program. The ratio of benefits to costs, resulting from investment in the program of management and research, was approximately 10 in 1984.

AB In the context of the current debate over sustainable development, this paper will review the role of market forms of environmental regulation. Despite the fashionability of claims that markets are superior to conventional, bureaucratic systems of regulation, there are significant limits to their adoption in practice. Some of these limitations will be exposed by considering why and in what forms economic tools have actually been used. It will be argued that, contrary to some theoretical expectations, their use does not represent any 'retreat of the state', any shift in the locus of power to decide our environmental futures. Rather they are employed highly pragmatically to allow politically bargained choices to be implemented. The achievement of sustainable development will continue to depend on the complex processes which create social values, and drive political and economic decision making.

AB The discussion of sustainable development has frequently proved confusing. Some writers are concerned with the sustainability of the natural resource base, others with present or future levels of production and consumption. Similarly, there are marked differences of opinion over the way in which sustainable development might be achieved. We need to examine the different dimensions of sustainability separately, to consider the kinds of international policies that would be required to achieve them, and the extent to which global solutions are either possible or available. This paper addresses these issues of theory and divergent intellectual tradition, and considers the problems and possibilities of reaching agreement between the countries of the North and those of the South.

DT Article
AB A rainfed field experiment was conducted Lo assess the N and S fertilization requirement of 'JS 71-05' soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and 'JSF 1' safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) sequence on Vertisols. The treatments comprised combinations of 0, 20 and 40 kg N/ha and 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 kg S/ha applied to rainy-season soybean and no fertilizer to safflower. Higher and sustainable seed yield with better nutrient recovery and water-use efficiency was realized from a combination of N, P and S @ 40,22 and 60 kg/ha respectively applied to soybean. Application of 40 kg N/ha to soybean gave additional 30.5% advantage in seed yield, and 36.5. 47.9, 37.6 and 74.6% additional recovery of N, P, K and S respectively and 29% more water-use efficiency compared with the control. The safflower grown on residual nutrients gave 37% more seed yield and water-use efficiency, and 46-67% increase in recovery of N, P, K and S respectively due to 40 kg N/ha applied to the preceding soybean. Application of 60 kg S/ha as agricultural grade pyrite (22% S) gave 23.7% additional seed yield, and 27.6,29.6,21.4 and 74.5% higher recovery of N, P, K and S respectively, besides 24.4% greater water-use efficiency in soybean. The residual beneficial effect of 60 kg S/ha was also evident in safflower with higher seed yield and water-use efficiency and increased uptake of nutrients.

AB The energy allocation model MARKAL and the demand simulation model SMEDE, both implemented and/or developed at PSI, are applied to study the problem of CO2 emission control for Switzerland. The shadow prices necessary to fulfill the recommendations of the Toronto Conference are estimated, The main conclusion is that although CO2 Control is feasible, the required investments in the energy system are so high that the realization of the Toronto proposal seems to be quite improbable for Switzerland. On the other hand, there are options in the international level which, when combined with an appropriate national energy policy, could lead to a sustainable energy future.

TI ANALYSIS OF REWETTING FOR SURFACE-TENSION INDUCED FLOW

ID STABILITY
AB An analytical investigation was conducted to determine the rewetting characteristics of thin, surface tension driven liquid films over heated plates as a function of the fluid properties, the film thickness, and the applied heat flux. Analytical expressions for the maximum sustainable heat flux and the rewetting velocity were developed for both flat and grooved plates and were compared with data from previous investigations. The results indicated good agreement for low film velocities, however, at high velocities the experimental data deviated significantly from the theoretical predictions. It was hypothesized that this deviation was due to the presence of liquid sputtering near the liquid front. To compensate for this liquid sputtering, the expressions for maximum sustainable heat flux and rewetting velocity were modified using an empirical correction factor developed from the data of previous thin film thickness investigations. The resulting modified expressions were found to compare very favorably with available experimental data over a large range of flow conditions and velocities.

TI SCENARIOS FOR ENERGY - SUSTAINABLE WORLD VS GLOBAL MERCANTILISM
SO LONG RANGE PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Long-term forecasting is not a very successful enterprise. Some of the most important events of the last 2 years, particularly the political upheavals in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, caught most observers off guard-even knowledgeable ones. In the oil industry, experts have sometimes been able to suggest, but rarely to predict, the key turning points in crude oil prices. Time after time, events that are considered improbable or even implausible occur.
   The future is too important to be ignored, notwithstanding this difficulty.   The Shell approach to strategic planning is, instead of forecasts, to use scenarios, a set of `stories' about alternative possible futures.  These stories promote a discussion of possibilities other than the `most likely' one and encourage the consideration of `what if' questions.  Although scenarios deal with the future, they are essentially a way of structuring the overwhelming, confusing information we have about the present.  One of the important uses for this structure is to help us recognize more of what is going on around us, including the early, weak signals of change.
   Good scenarios are challenging, plausible and internally consistent.  They also illuminate the uncertainties and issues that are critical for the future (in the case of this paper, for the future of the energy industry to the year 2010).  Scenarios lead to better decisions if they improve our understanding of the world.
   This paper outlines two scenarios prepared in the Group Planning Coordination of Shell International Petroleum Company. Two notes are important.  First, the author has summarized a much larger body of work to which approximately twenty members of Group Planning contributed, under the leadership of Kees van der Heijden.  Second, this work was completed in the summer of 1989 and so, naturally, were we to re-formulate the scenarios now, our assessments in many areas would be very different.  The value of this paper is therefore less in the content of the scenarios than in the particular approach to thinking about the future.

AB Environmental Assessment (EA) is recognized by conservationists as a tool which provides probably the best basis for helping to secure environmentally sustainable development in the future. Its application beyond simple projects to plans, programmes, and policies is the logical progression for EA, and would bring improved public participation. The need to provide EA with a secure quality control framework within which to operate in the future, through the establishment of an overseeing agency, has now become all too apparent, and needs to be a central requirement of the revised EC Directive. The U.K. Government has often been hostile to EA in the past, and at best ambivalent, but persistent lobbying by environmental groups over recent years has helped maintain the momentum for improvements in the application and scope of the EA process.

AB The soils of the Amazon's rainforests, unlike soils in rainforests in other parts of the world, have very low productivity. Experiments have shown that the Amazon's timber productivity of 2-3 m3 per year per hectare is considerably below that achievable in Northern Europe. Sustainable agricultural development therefore can be expected to be very low. However, the mineral resources of the Amazon are very extensive and offer a way to develop the Amazon without destroying the ecology, provided that some limits are set on non-mining activities.

AB The greenhouse effect, and other transnational and global environment, health and safely issues, require energy system planning on an international scale. Consideration of equity between nations and regions, particularly between the industrialized and developing countries, is an essential ingredient. For the immediate future, the next several decades at least, fossil fuels will remain the predominant energy sources. More efficient use of energy seems to be the only feasible strategy for the near to mid-term to provide growing energy services for the world economy while moderating the increasing demand for fossil fuels. In the longer term, nonfossil sources are essential for a sustainable world energy system, and nuclear power can play an important, if not dominant, role. The challenge is to design and implement a safe and economic nuclear power world enterprise which is socially acceptable and is complimentary to other nonfossil sources. The elements of such an enterprise seem clear and include: much safer reactors, preferably passively safe, which can be deployed at various scales; development of economic resource extension technologies; effective and permanent waste management strategies; and strengthened safeguards against diversion of nuclear materials to weapons. All of these elements can best be developed as cooperative international efforts. In the process, institutional improvements are equally as important as technological improvements; the two must proceed hand-in-hand.

AB Key concepts, procedures, adapted land classification schemes, and potential contributions of applied remote sensing, information systems, and applied models are discussed, to formulate an integrated framework for quantitative performance assessment of natural resources and their respective use alternatives in lesser developed countries. This framework represents a set of procedures and software requirements designed to support database compilation and comparative spatial/temporal analysis to derive information for decision support in sustainable development planning and policy analysis.
   The procedures are designed to define a Comparative Site Index (CSI), a quantitative performance indicator related to the comparative advantage among competing land-use alternatives, including potential environmental impacts. To provide a dynamic land evaluation framework and a realistic decision-support system, the framework permits calculation of the CSI based on the most timely and accurate information available as represented in the spatial, thematic, and temporal domain. An overview is provided of the four consecutive phases of a systems approach to resource development planning and policy analysis. Within this context, the current and potential contributions of geographic information system (GIS), applied remote sensing, and its essential linkage with performance or impact assessment models are specifically identified.

AB Evidence on the performance of development projects shows that sustainability is seldom achieved. Project sustainability is influenced by ecological, social, political and economic systems. However, the blueprint approach to project choice tends to incorporate sustainability into the project cycle by considering only economic and environmental systems. This is done by adopting elaborate methodologies such as expanded CBA and EIA. This approach is unlikely to lead to sustainable projects. The 'participation approach' is more sensitive to the social and political systems than the blueprint approach. It involves people in decision-making and sees the achievement of sustainable projects as the result of people's empowerment and self-reliance. However, under certain circumstances, this approach can lead to environmentally unsustainable projects. Smaller scale projects tend to bring about sustainability, but government control might be needed to ensure this. Social obstacles exist in implementing participation but occur for top-down projects as well. Problems exist in combining the bottom-up and top-down approaches.

AB The deterioration of both the human and environmental conditions on one side and the unintegrated connection between the sciences, techniques and their application in our country, on the other side, stimulate the present project about sustainability and diffusion of so called appropriate technologies on a Purepecha village in the state of Michoacan. Opportunities and limitations of critical mass constitution around sustainability and social applications of science are analysed, specially in the energy sector and the forest.

DT Article
AB Two articles in this issue of Search were prompted by the publication of Jeremy Rifkin's book Beyond Beef and the well-funded campaign to reduce beef consumption and production that will accompany it. Here John Mott and Geoff Edwards look at the lessons that need to be learnt from a century of cattle grazing in central and northern Australia. They argue that the sustainable land management sought by both the pastoral industry and conservationists is unattainable without more fundamental changes in the Australian economy.

   INDUSTRIAL; ECOLOGY; SUSTAINABILITY
ID UNIFORMITARIAN THEORY; HUMAN PALEODEMOGRAPHY; MORTALITY; TRIALS
AB Both the material and non-material aspects of social life are viewed as determinants of major transformations in the patterns of fatal disease and injury. A 'worst case' scenario for the burden of fatal disease is taken as a poor agrarian society precariously dependent on starchy staples and a narrow range of other foods. In such a society life expectancy may be as low as 20. However in many 'pre-modern' societies the regime of roughly matching fertility and mortality levels was set at a 'submaximal' level, with completed fertility rates moderated by marriage conventions. The relative importance of the factors contributing to the historical decline in fatal infection continues to be debated. Evidence on the central role of maternal literacy in the recent decline in Third World mortality suggests the importance of changes in the body of civil society as well as the activities of professionals and public agencies. The decline in fatal infections has been offset to varying extents by an increase in non-communicable disease (NCD): the Mediterranean and East Asia having smaller epidemics of NCDs and Eastern Europe having sustained rises of NCDs. Most industrialised countries have experienced declines in overall NCD mortality in the last 2 decades. Both the fall in fatal infection and the rise and early fall of NCDs can usefully be viewed against the baseline of hunter gatherer cultures. When this is done, the relationship between economic development and disease is seen to be complex. Much 'progress' has been achieved by countering (and then doing better than countering) the adverse effects of earlier developments. Although most members of the generation now alive have experienced marked health benefits from economic and technical advance, it is unclear whether these gains can be both sustained and generalised. It is possible that adverse lagged effects of current industrial (and military) activities will disrupt the habitat of future generations of our species through processes such as stratospheric ozone depletion, global warming and others as yet unpredicted. Modern hygienists have dealt successively with influences on survival mainly operating in early life (infection) and influences operating across the lifespan (determinants of chronic disease). They have now to deal with even greater separations in time and space between potential health determinants and their ultimate effects. To a high level of scientific uncertainty is added the ethical problem of equity between generations.

AB Community participation in health care programmes is considered axiomatic in health development. Cultural and structural influences are discussed in relation to community participation with the intention of highlighting some critical issues affecting its generation and sustainability. These influences include structurally defined perspectives and perceptions of community participation, limitations of the necessary supportive systems, the structural and cultural factors of marginalization, community stratification and organization, mobilization, and the political context. It is concluded that given these factors against a situation of a financial and economic crisis, of economic restructuring and the values of competition and individualization, community participation will be increasingly difficult to generate and sustain.

DE PROTON AND POTASSIUM TRANSPORT; SUGAR-BEET; SUSPENSION CULTURES
AB The effect of starvation (sugar deprivation) on some transport properties of the cell membrane of suspension cultures of sugarbeet was evaluated by direct measurements of the medium. Medium conductivity and potassium concentration decreased sharply in the control cultures throughout the six days of the experiments, while moderate changes were measured in the starved cultures. The evaluation of results on a fresh-mass basis revealed that potassium influx was about the same in both cultures during the first day but decreased sharply afterwards in the starved cultures. Starved and unstarved cultures acidified the medium one day after subculturing, and this was followed in both cultures by proton influx. Redox activity and proton extrusion were higher in the starved cultures during the first few hours after subculturing. The results indicated that proton fluxes in starved cells were sustainable and no different from control cultures over the period of study.

TI SHOULD WE STORE CARBON IN TREES
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to explore for the most effective strategy for using forests to mitigate global climate change, we have constructed a simple model of C uptake during forest growth and the fate of this C when forests are harvested and used as fuel to replace fossil fuels. We suggest that trees are equally effective in preventing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere if they remove a unit of C from the atmosphere or if they supply a sustainable source of energy that substitutes for a unit of C discharged by burning fossil fuels. The model shows that the most effective strategy for using forest land to minimize increases in atmospheric CO2 will depend on the current status of the land, the productivity that can be expected, the efficiency with which the forest harvest is used to substitute for fossil fuels, and thc time perspective of the analysis. For forests with large standing biomass and low productivity the most effective strategy is to protect the existing forest. For land with little standing biomass and low productivity, the most effective strategy is to reforest or otherwise manage the land for forest growth and C storage. Where high productivity can bc expected, thc most effective strategy is to manage the forest for a harvestable crop and to use the harvest with maximum efficiency either for long-lived products or to substitute for fossil fuels. The longer the time perspective, the more likely that harvesting and replanting will result in net C benefits.

AB Healthy forests are essential for life on earth. Their multiple benefits include sustainable production of wood and other products, soil protection, air and water purification, wildlife habitat, noise control, various types of recreation, but also climate regulation and CO2 storage. Owing to man-made influences, forests have  been endangered since a long time. In various parts of the world  these adverse impacts are now representing a risk for human life. For example, the still increasing destruction of tropical and  subtropical forests leads to detrimental soil erosion problems and great losses of soil fertility including soil C. Furthermore,  atmospheric Pollution brought about forest declines in Europe, North America and elsewhere. In order to overcome these and related problems a variety of efforts have been established. In commercial forests of the temperate/boreal zones forest management practices including fertilization regimes focusing on sustainably increasing yields have been utilized for several centuries. However, new management strategies are under research and/or have been implemented in these forest ecosystems to mitigate the so called new types of forest damage. As these declines are frequently associated with nutritional disturbances fertilizer applications have proven useful when conducted properly. Agro-forestry is one approach to reduce the further deterioration of tropical/subtropical forests. Also rehabilitation of devastated land ist partly concentrated on afforestation. With the ever increasing demands of a fast growing human population and increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, proper multi-purpose forestry on a permanent or short rotation basis or in the wide realm of agro-forestry is essential for mankind. In many cases adequate forest management will only be possible when soil fertility is restored and/or maintained through fertilization/manuring considering the demand of a specific forest stand/system under specific site conditions.
   Clearly, also the potential to increase the CO2 storage capacity Of forests is often limited by insufficient nutrient availability. However, in general this site specific limitation can be overcome easily by proper nutrient supplementation.

ID POLLUTION
AB An immense and increasingly well-to-do population has forced China to relent in strictly following the principles of organic farming that so strongly characterized its agriculture for centuries. The environmental and fossil-fuel energy problems accompanying China's remarkable rural economic development during the 1980s have caused an intensive reexamination of the country's agricultural development policies. Emerging from this reexamination is the concept of "ecological" agricultural development involving the hybrid pursuit of "conventional" innovative and modern technologies from the West, and traditional organic practices from times past in China. This article portrays the background for and current status of Chinese agricultural development, characterizes and presents illustrative results from China's strategy for ecological agricultural development, and highlights similarities and contrasts between ecological agriculture in China and sustainable agriculture in the West.

AB Rhino dehorning is increasingly seen as a method of halting poaching in vulnerable black rhino populations. However, mathematical models suggest that, under current costs and prices, dehorning must be done annually if poaching is to be made unprofitable. As dehorning carries a risk of rhino mortality, it is unsustainable as an anti-poaching measure. A profit-maximizing manager will dehorn at less frequent, but still unsustainable, intervals. Sustainable dehorning produces near-optimal profits but will not deter poachers.

DT Article
ID FLOW DIRECTIONS; ROCKS
AB Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility fabrics have been studied in a suite of mafic early Proterozoic (Kikkertavak) dykes and two mid-Proterozoic (Kokkorvik) sills in the Hopedale Block of Labrador. Two sets of en-echelon dyke arrays from the Kikkertavak Swarm are considered to represent two linear dyke intrusions al depth. Three main fabrics were revealed in the Kikkertavak dykes. In the first, the maximum susceptibility axis is sub-horizontal or gently inclined and parallel to the dyke walls, and is interpreted as the primary magma flow direction. A second fabric affects only dykes along strike from a much younger dyke and is interpreted as the result of local stress anisotropy. The third fabric with significantly lower susceptibility is only locally developed in the southeast, near the mid-Proterozoic Kanairiktok Shear Zone, and is also interpreted as the result of local superimposed tectonic stress. The Kokkorvik sheets preserve a single flow-induced fabric, sub-parallel to the measured crack propagation lineation, indicating that the magma flow was parallel to the crack propagation direction.
   The gently inclined magma flow direction inferred for the Kikkertavak dykes is believed to reflect later-stage magmatic emplacement when consolidation had already commenced. At this stage, the buoyancy contrast between magma and host rock had been reduced to the point when the initially vertical magma flow was no longer sustainable and was replaced by lateral flow.
