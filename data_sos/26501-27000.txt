DT Article
AB The essence of green accounting is accounting for the air we breathe, the water we drink. One way to do this is to create a natural asset account for essential natural resources - such as fertile land - on which an enterprise is economically dependent. As these assets are degraded, a natural resource expense would be recorded in an enterprise's financial statements. This would disclose pollution levels in excess of levels sustainable by an ecosystem. This accounting would reflect a new social contract between business and the stakeholders to whom they are accountable. lt would also reflect a business mission that recognizes that some things are beyond accounting.

AB Agriculture in industrialized countries is based on specialized agroecosystems, where high yields are obtained from sequences of annual crops (cash crops) with large inputs of chemicals. A sustainable agriculture should conversely rely on major exploitation of native resources, i.e. sun energy, water from precipitations, atmospheric nitrogen, soil organic matter. Crop rotation, based on the inclusion of polyannual legumes, is to be considered among the most powerful management practices for pursuing such aims because of its implications for maintaining soil fertility, saving energy and avoiding pollution. Results confirming the validity of this statement are presented.
   The residual effect on the succeeding crop (sunflower) of a long-term rotation, which included a four-year lucerne ley, in comparison with a sequence of annual crops, was investigated in a mediterranean environment (Central Italy). Similar yields were obtained in very contrasting conditions. Approximately up to 3000 kg ha-1 seed yield and 1400 kg ha-1 oil yield were recorded either with lucerne as the preceding crop, without any addition of inorganic-N and with mechanical weed control, or with safflower as the preceding crop, supplying sunflower with 130 kg ha-1 of inorganic-N and chemical weed control. The effects of the treatments on yield are also discussed.

AB Research to identify appropriate means of sustaining tropical soil productivity has intensified during the last 2 decades and promising technologies such as minimum tillage, herbaceous and tree based systems, and improved fallows have been identified. This paper discusses the contribution of soil microorganisms to the sustainability of such cropping systems in the tropics. A favourable environment for biological activity is promoted by management practices which: (1) maintain continuous vegetational cover of the soil and extensive perennial root growth; (2) encourage the return of plant litter to the soil; (3) support a diversity of plants (preferably and including legumes) and thence of litter inputs; (4) minimize soil disturbance (e.g. by tillage). It is concluded that although the importance of biological processes for soil fertility conservation is increasingly recognised there is still little understanding of these processes in tropical cropping systems.

AB Lowland steeplands cover more than 40% of New Zealand's area. Occurring in a tectonically active environment and subject to recurrent erosion-inducing storms, they were largely forest-covered until about 130 years ago, when they were rapidly deforested and converted to pastoral land use. We describe the geographical and historical background to this deforestation and some of the profound ecosystem process changes that have accompanied it, particularly those related to mass movement erosion. We then relate research findings on the ecosystem changes to the sustainability of current land use.
   Our own research in three contrasting regions of the North Island, New Zealand has examined disturbance regimes, vegetation succession, soil properties and soil erosion rates on pastoral hillslopes and in forest ecosystems. Under both forest and pasture, almost all ecosystem processes were highly dependent on topographical unit and slope steepness. A comparison of ecological process and erosion rates in pasture and forest, and analysis of pastoral production data, indicated that although significant erosion occurred under forest and was one of its principal regeneration mechanisms, rapid net soil depletion was occurring on steep hillslopes under pasture and that pastoral use was not sustainable on these areas.
   A more sustainable pattern of land use can be achieved by intensification of pastoral use on gentler hillslopes and better spatial integration of pastoral use with timber plantation, agroforestry, and conservation land uses. Strategies for the implementation of more sustainable land management are also discussed. Establishment of critical parameters for the development of land management guidelines has been dependent on a good prior understanding of landscape ecological processes.

AB While tropical multistrata home gardens (or tree home gardens) are classically said to be sound, efficient and sustainable land-use systems, there is little quantitative evidence and detailed analysis of home gardens in the literature to support this. In order to strengthen the basis of this assumption and to contribute to an operational understanding of sustainability, a literature review was applied to home gardens, covering different bio-physical and socio-economic conditions. For this, a series of sustainability descriptors were identified, hypotheses formulated on what should be the effect of home gardens on these descriptors, and possible indicators confirming the hypotheses mentioned, when found in the literature.
   Home gardens possess a number of sustainability attributes, with regard not only to their ability to meet a number of farmers' needs without negatively affecting the resource base, and in many cases even improving it, but also to their potential to meet several economic, social, ecological and institutional conditions which contribute to their sustainability.

AB If sustainable land use systems are to be adopted, they should be based on ecological principles. The concept of an 'environmental unit' (arbitrary ecosystem) has been introduced and used as a basis of land evaluation in land use planning in Iran. The environmental units of land are selected and depicted on a map, using stationary ecological factors (landform, geology, soils, plants). The variation of dynamic ecological characteristics (climate, water, wildlife) and the socioeconomic resources of lands under scrutiny are considered, to narrow the selection of a suitable system. Consequently, land capability is decided on the merits of the ecological and socioeconomic properties of each unit. By this means, decision-makers are given a process of land use planning which has the ecology as its core, rather than economics.

AB Conventional agriculture is facing serious resource and environmental problems in northeast China. There is need to develop ecological approaches in agricultural management to make more effective use of soil, water, energy, and biological resources. Developing ecological resource management is essential to the development of a sustainable, productive agriculture for China. With sound environmental farming, more food will be produced more economically than previously. Equally important, the sustainability of land, water, and biological resources will be guaranteed for the future, while the use of fossil fuel will be reduced. Overall there will be social and economic improvement in the lives of farm families.

AB A mail survey was conducted to gain understanding of the agroforestry practices of non-industrial private forest landowners (NIPF) in Washington State, located in the northwestern USA. Although NIPF owners control 1.5 million hectares of the state's commercial forestland base, their diversity of forestland uses, land management practices and objectives as land managers are not well understood. Past NIPF surveys and anecdotal information suggest agroforestry is a major use of NIPF lands. We defined agroforestry as a potentially sustainable land use practice combining the deliberate growing of woody perennials with agricultural crops and/or animals.
   Objectives of this study were to: 1) determine the extent that agroforestry is used by Washington's NIPF owners, 2) develop insight into NIPF owners' motivations for practicing agroforestry, 3) describe the agroforestry practices within three distinct physiographic and agroecological zones in Washington, and 4) determine the agroforestry information needs of NIPF owners.
   The target population consisted of NIPF owners in 4 counties within each of the three regions. Response to the August 1990 mail survey was 63.5%, yielding 296 useable questionnaires. Fifty-seven percent of all respondents practice agroforestry. Forestland grazing is the most common agroforestry practice (39% of all respondents), followed by windbreaks (34%), harvest of special forest products (12%), livestock enrichment plantings for forage or shelter (7%), orchard grazing (5%), orchard intercropping (2%), and Christmas tree grazing (0.34%).
   The most frequent motives for owning land were passing land on to children (80%), keeping it natural and income from timber (both 72%). Respondents saw aesthetics (77%), increasing land unit income (74%), and water conservation (70%) as possible advantages of practicing agroforestry. High establishment costs (66%) and livestock damage to trees or crops (64%) were the most frequently selected potential disadvantages to practicing agroforestry. Lack of technical and educational support (67%) and lack of access to livestock/livestock facilities (58%) were disincentives to practicing agroforestry. Landowners are interested in learning more about agroforestry and how agroforestry techniques might be incorporated in their land management tool kit. A significant number of non-industrial private forest land owners in Washington believe that management of forestland, balancing conservation and production goals, can be furthered by suitable agroforestry practices.

TI EFFECTS OF CONSERVATION TILLAGE ON SHEET EROSION FROM SANDY SOILS AT 2
   EXPERIMENTAL SITES IN ZIMBABWE
SO APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB Soil erosion from low-fertility sandy soils in Zimbabwe's Communal Areas is a major problem. The main factors causing soil degradation are inappropriate livestock management and poor cropping technology. The latter is due to insufficient knowledge concerning appropriate permanent cultivation techniques under tropical rainfall and soil conditions. The existing tillage method is characterized by clean cultivation, which begins with inversion tillage, followed by clean weeding through hoeing (badza). These practices encourage water erosion under the prevailing rainfall pattern. Therefore, one pressing research need in Zimbabwe is to reduce soil erosion in the Communal Areas through improved tillage systems. Consequently, a project was initiated in 1988 to test the sustainability of several ox-drawn tillage systems considered potentially suitable to dryland farming conditions in the Communal Areas. Of the systems tested, a method known as no-till tied ridging showed the greatest potential. With one exception, experimental soil losses were always lower than 0.5t ha-1yr-1, whereas up to 9-5t ha-1yr-1 was typical under the conventional system of mouldboard ploughing. Similarly, ripping into crop residues revealed a distinct downward trend in sheet erosion rates over the seasons, with losses of only 0.6t ha-1yr-1 during the 1990-91 season at both research sites in the current programme. The remaining methods under investigation-ripping into bare ground and hand hoeing-showed sheet erosion rates similar to conventional tillage.

AB The stability of a predator-prey system, involving the Michaelis-Menten form for the functional  response of the predator, under harvesting is investigated. The nature of the domain of attraction as the yield is systematically changed is shown and the stability at maximum sustainable yield is clearly established. Sensitivity of the stability regions to changes in the parameters of the model are considered. A method for determining the period and the ratio of the amplitudes of predator and prey populations for nearly elliptic limit cycles is given.

TI MANAGEMENT ADVICE FROM A SIMPLE DYNAMIC POOL MODEL
SO FISHERY BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID DEPENDENCE; GROWTH; YIELD
AB This paper is devoted to a theoretical examination of two rules of thumb commonly used in fishery management: (I) the fishing mortality rate associated with maximum sustainable yield (F(MSY)) equals the natural mortality rate, and (II) the equilibrium stock biomass at maximum sustainable yield equals one-half the pristine stock biomass. Taken together, these rules of thumb are shown to be inconsistent with any simple dynamic pool model in which three conditions hold: (1) the first derivative of the stock-recruitment relationship is uniformly nonnegative, (2) the second derivative of the stock-recruitment relationship is uniformly nonpositive, and (3) the first derivative of the weight-at-age relationship is uniformly positive. An example of such a model is presented and the equilibrium solution derived analytically. In this model, F(MSY) can be either greater than or less than the natural mortality rate, while the equilibrium stock biomass at maximum sustainable yield is consistently less than one-half the pristine stock biomass. To illustrate the utility of the theoretical framework developed, the model is applied to the eastern Bering Sea stock of rock sole Pleuronectes bilineatus.

AB A simple dynamic pool model is used to examine the problem of stock-recruitment parameter uncertainty from a Bayesian perspective. Probabilities associated with different parameter values are used to weight the losses (i.e., opportunity costs to society) associated with any given fishing mortality rate. By choosing appropriate forms for the loss and probability density functions, the model is shown to result in an analytic solution. Because this solution gives the fishing mortality rate that maximizes the expected value of the logarithm of sustainable yield, it is denoted F(MELSY). The solution is a monotone-decreasing function of parameter uncertainty, converging on the fishing mortality rate corresponding to maximum sustainable yield as the degree of uncertainty approaches zero. As an empirical illustration, the model is applied to the eastern Bering Sea stock of rock sole Pleuronectes bilineatus.

TI FROM GROWTH TO EQUITY AND SUSTAINABILITY - PARADIGM SHIFT IN TRANSPORT
   PLANNING
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Societal innovations today are more likely to originate from grassroots movements than from technical elites, but innovations are not likely to be successful without the consent and active support of the experts. Therefore the attitudes and perceptions of experts are of interest. This article discusses the findings of a scenario project undertaken covering nine separate fields of activity ranging from population and lifestyles to regional development and urban form with special emphasis on issues of transport and communications. A structured questionnaire was used to solicit responses to seed scenarios from experts involved in transport and communications planning and research. The article discusses how these experts see the future of transport and communications in Europe in the context of other fields related to the spatial organization of society, and in which direction they want policy making in these fields to develop. The results showed a widely shared concern that the current growth-oriented development may lead to serious conflicts with other objectives such as equity and environmental balance.

AB Unless the advanced nations adopt a new socioeconomic order compatible with the technological milieu of the information age, they could face catastrophe in the years just ahead. Free societies should consider shifting from capitalism, with its perilous obsession with consumption, to the competruistic ideology which provides a sustainable future through its focus on conservation. This emerging ideology employs 'productive efficiency' as the criterion of success in its mission to maximize the value its free societies add to the global economy.

TI WEIPA - INDUSTRIALIZATION AND INDIGENOUS RIGHTS IN A REMOTE AUSTRALIAN
   MINING AREA
SO GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB The changing place of Aboriginal people within the Weipa region of Cape York is reviewed, from the development of the Comalco mine in the late 1950s and early 1960s through to current negotiations concerning normalisation of the mining town and a proposal to develop an alumina refinery. It is argued that the relationship between Comalco and the Napranum community is unique within the Australian mining industry. While problems and ambiguities persist, Weipa provides valuable examples of ways to pursue equitable resolutions to the inequitable legacies of history. Three issues are identified as crucial at Weipa - development of strong personal relationships between the company's senior management and Aboriginal community leaders; the impact of divisions within Comalco around issues of sustainable development; and recognition by Aboriginal leaders that the mining company had an ambivalent rather than simply hostile role in the region.

TI ASPECTS OF A PEASANT MODE OF PRODUCTION - EXCHANGE AND THE EXTENT OF
   SUFFICIENCY AMONG SMALLHOLDERS IN WEST-LAIKIPIA, KENYA
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID TENURE
AB The Laikipia Plain in the north-western footzone of Mt. Kenya is one of the semi-arid areas where migrating Kikuyu cultivators go for land and permanent residence. However, unfavourable ecological and economic conditions create contradictions, and many households undergo a considerable risk to fall into marginality. In this paper, the autor aimes at reexamining the thesis that the extent of a household's sufficiency can rise if mutual exchange within a network is practised. The aspect of social networks is obviously manifest in the access to land and other key resources. With regard to the ability to survive in Laikipia, it is obvious too, that the migrants must rely on social capital and informal transactions. Thus it is argued, that the 'invisible' economy of affection is a predominant feature in order to succeed and to generate certainty and sustainability among the small-scale farmers.

TI LCA - A TOOL FOR MARKETING CLEAN PRODUCTS
SO JOURNAL OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Recently there has been a fundamental shift in the way large companies think about their corporate missions. Prior to the 1970s, most companies were simply concerned with profitability. In the past two decades, a new management concept appeared and included high-performance, total quality management with a higher awareness of social and environmental responsibility. These concepts were also coupled with an increased awareness of the demand for a cleaner environment, the higher cost of energy, and a scarcity of some natural resources. Recent surveys have shown that most people want to protect the environment, even if they have to pay higher prices. This verdict from public opinion polling indicates that the manufacturing industry has to look carefully at the impact of its operations and products on the environment if the industry is to maintain market share and, in some extreme cases, stay in business.
   To meet this challenge, the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) was introduced to examine the environmental impact of a product from its birth in the R&D laboratory through manufacturing and marketing to its ''ultimate fate'' after the completion of its useful life. A great need now exists for the development and application of an analytical methodology for LCA that could be acceptable to the business community, the regulating agencies, and the public at large.
   LCA is an effective tool that can be used to reduce environmental stresses and potential depletion of our natural resources. Most environmental economists and policy analysts believe that people in the United States, as well as in other industrialized countries, have grossly underestimated the value of environmental resources, therefore inducing tremendous levels of stress on and abuse of air, water, and land resources, as well as mineral and energy reserves. A true accounting of the monetary and non-monetary costs associated with the total life of products will undoubtedly raise the level of awareness.
   A level of commitment to achieve our ultimate goal of environmentally sustainable development will depend on programs such as life cycle management of products and responsible care. This program, in turn, will allow future generations to meet their own needs. The great challenges of the 1990s must include making significant strides toward clean technology and pollution prevention and managing our production and consumption of products in a manner that meets the concepts of sustainable development and responsible care toward the environment. This paper addresses the critical issues related to the application of LCA as a tool for working toward meeting these goals.

TI EXPERIMENTAL DISCUSSION ON MAXIMUM SURFACE-CHARGE DENSITY OF FINE
   PARTICLES SUSTAINABLE IN NORMAL ATMOSPHERE
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROSTATICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The maximum surface charge density for large spherical particles in normal atmosphere is thought to be 27-mu-C/m2, assuming that the electric breakdown field strength of air is 3 MV/m. For a given surface charge density, however, the layer of a very high electric field strength for electron avalanche in air around the particle becomes thin, when the particle size is small. As a result, a higher limit in the surface charge density is expected for small particles. In the present experiment. droplets with high surface charge density in the size range between 1 and 6-mu-m in diameter are prepared by evaporating negatively charged liquid particles of 45-mu-m. For a few kinds of liquids, the size and the charge of individual droplets are measured simultaneously by using an LDV system to obtain frequency histograms for the charges of droplets with several narrow size ranges. The results indicate that the maximum surface charge density sustainable in atmosphere for negatively charged particles depends mainly on the particle size and is inversely proportional to the square root of particle size to give very high surface charge density in micrometer order size range.

ID SOCIAL-SECURITY; GENERATIONS; PLANS
AB Veall's (1986) model of public pensions is generalized to allow for endogenous fertility. We show that gifts to the old, which can be viewed as social security contributions, are always positive in the steady state. An optimal stationary allocation is sustainable if savings are zero and fertility is exogenous. However, the optimal allocation is in general not sustainable. In particular, if a government enforces a social security plan setting the pension level at the optimal gifts and individuals optimize under the pension constraint. the resulting sustainable outcome is in general different from either the optimal or Nash outcome.

DE DYNAMIC RESPONSE ANALYSIS; MAXIMUM NET PRODUCTIVITY LEVEL; POPULATION
   DYNAMICS; MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT
AB A new method, the "dynamic response method," was developed (DeMaster et al. 1982) in an attempt to use time series data on relative population sizes to satisfy the requirements of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 for maintaining an "optimum sustainable population" of marine mammals. Three methods of implementing this approach were studied, using a computer simulation of stochastic population growth with density-dependence operating on first-year survival in the form of a generalized-logistic function. Methods developed by Gerrodette (1988) and Boveng et al, (1988) appeared to be less sensitive than desirable when used with the simulated population data. The third method, developed in this study, offers better protection against "Type II error" (failing to identify populations in the optimum sustainable population range), particularly when combined with Gerrodette's (1988) approach.

TI MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE-YIELD OF POPULATIONS WITH CONTINUOUS AGE-STRUCTURE
SO MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB We address the problem of finding the harvesting policy that will maximize the yield and maintain a population in a steady state. The population is characterized by continuous age classes and therefore follows differential equations. Here, we assume that the equations are linear (no density dependence).
   Two possible constraints are considered: either recruitment or total population are fixed to a constant. Under these conditions, the optimal policy is to harvest the fraction-theta of a younger age class a and to harvest totally an older age class b. The optimal solution (theta, a, b) can be calculated explicitly if the fecundity and mortality schedules are given.
   The solution is compared to the simpler strategy of harvesting all individuals beyond a single age class a. It is shown that the latter strategy can be much less profitable than harvesting two age classes because it cannot take account of the different values of individuals according to their age.

AB Somatic embryogenesis was initiated from immature embryos of western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) on media containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and N6-benzyladenine. The effects of explant type and ammonium nitrate and glutamine concentrations on initiation were tested. Although 21-93% of explants rendered cultures in various experiments, only 3% yielded sustainable embryogenic lines. Excised embryos at the early cotyledonary stage were optimal for initiation. Maturation of somatic embryos was promoted by abscisic acid. Response to abscisic acid concentrations and duration of exposure to abscisic acid varied with genotype. Maximal results were obtained with 0.025-mu-M abscisic acid for 1 to 2 weeks followed by individual culture on medium without growth regulators. Mature somatic embryos developed into shoots with roots. Plantlets have been established in peat.

TI BARRIERS TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN NATURAL-RESOURCE BASED ECONOMIES

SO SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
DE AUSTRALIA; DEBT; ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB A growing number of nations are debating the appropriate path and speed of adjustment toward sustainable development in 21 st century. However, for many nations whose economies are based on natural resources, implementation of environmental protection and resource management strategies designed for longer-term development purposes seems highly improbable in view of formidable pressures for maximization of output levels in the short term. Many will not even be faced with the choice between environmental quality or economic growth as envisaged in traditional growth models. External debt pressures and a struggling trade sector based on primary sector exports undergoing extensive terms of trade deterioration could well induce an insidious and protracted period of simultaneous economic decline and degradation or depletion of natural capital stocks. This situation would represent a fundamental constraint upon the attainment of sustainable development proposals. While Australia is unique as a "Western" industrialized nation with a trade structure hinged upon natural resources, it appears to be entering the vicious cycle of external financing pressures, higher volumes of natural resource exploitation, environmental degradation, and trade and current account deficits. The nature of this predicament is briefly described together with some predictions about the longer-term consequences of the future paths available. The development of competitiveness in environmental technologies is assessed as a potential solution.

TI AN EVALUATION OF SUSTAINABLE CULTURAL-PRACTICES FOR RAIN-FED SORGHUM
   PRODUCTION ON VERTISOLS IN EAST SUDAN
SO SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Cultural practice trials have been conducted in east Sudan since 1986 to demonstrate that Vertisols can be managed successfully for sorghum production using only shallow tillage (0.08 m depth) or manual no-till planting. The trials have compared tillage inputs and crop yields (outputs) of traditional manual no-till planting methods with shallow overall weeding tillage, using tractor-drawn shallow discing (one-way or wide-level discs) at three levels of manual weeding (none, once and twice). Four systems of field preparation were compared: (1) manual operations with broadcast seeds; (2) manual operations with row planting using the Saluka planting stick; (3) broadcast seed using tractor-drawn one-way discs; (4) crops planted in rows using the one-way discs fitted with a seed box. The results for three consecutive growing seasons, with very different total rainfall and distribution, show that (1) early weed control after planting has a very significant influence on grain yield; (2) shallow discing provides effective weed control and reduces the need for subsequent manual weeding; (3) crop yield is related to rainfall distribution rather than the seasonal total. These results confirm and justify the need for long-term tillage trials to clarify the temporal effect climate has upon crop yield and the local economy in semi-arid regions.

DE INTEGRATED WEED MANAGEMENT; REDUCED HERBICIDE USE; ATRAZINE; METOLACHLOR
AB The acceptance of no-till crop production systems has been limited due to expected problems with weed management. Field experiments were established at two locations in Ontario in 1988 and one location in 1989. Band or broadcast applications of preemergence (PRE) combinations of high or low label rates of atrazine with or without metolachlor or inter-row cultivation, were evaluated for their effectiveness in controlling annual weeds in no-till com. At each location, different herbicide and cultivation combinations were required to achieve adequate weed control. Com grain yield was equivalent regardless of whether herbicides were applied as a band or broadcast treatment at all three sites. At two of the three sites, one cultivation combined with herbicides applied as a band was adequate to maintain weed control and com grain yields. Selective application of herbicides in bands represented an approximate 60% reduction in total herbicide applied into the environment. The integration of a shallow post-plant inter-row cultivation combined with the soil conservation attributes of no-till, would enhance the sustainability of a modified no-fill com production system.

AB Herbicide-resistant crops (HRCs) have been used extensively during the past five decades, because crop tolerance is necessary for a selective herbicide. In the past, chemical company personnel screened a large number of organic compounds against a limited number of major crop and weed species to discover HRCs. Now a single herbicide can be evaluated for crop selectivity against a great number of biotypes of a single crop in tissue culture, or sometimes gene transfer can be used to produce tolerant genotypes. Thus, one can now choose an environmentally "benign" herbicide and search for or develop resistant crop cultivars. The advantages of these new HRCs are: (a) solutions may be more easily found for difficult weed management problems, (b) growers are more apt to use integrated weed management when they have effective backup weed control procedures if cultural or mechanical methods fail, (c) increased weed management options for growers of minor crops, (d) economic advantages to growers, and (e) increased use of more environmentally "benign" herbicides. Concerns about HRCs include: (a) these weed management procedures do not eliminate herbicides, (b) some believe biotechnology should not further herbicide use, (c) HRCs may become weeds, (d) this approach may facilitate less ecological diversity, (e) HRCs may increase herbicide use, (f) it could result in more herbicide carryover by facilitating the use of environmentally "harsh" herbicides, (g) HRCs may be less competitive to weeds, and (h) dependence on HRCs may decrease the weed control practices that a farmer uses. One needs to consider both die benefits and risks of HRCs to properly evaluate this technology.

AB Weed management is an integral part of agriculture; weeds lower both productivity quality of agricultural products. A combination of mechanical, chemical, biological, and cultural methods is expected to deliver a sustainable weed management Program for the next two While chemical methods offer the most cost effective means of weed management, crop selectivity has hampered the use of the best chemicals for weed management. Recent progress in gene technology has facilitated the introduction and expression of genes to confer a wide range Of traits to crop plants. Application of this technology has resulted in the development of croP plant genotypes that are resistant to a specific herbicide. This article describes the progress that has been made by our group toward the introduction of glyphosate tolerance to crop plants. Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] kills plants due to inhibition of the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds via the shikimate pathway. Our approach for introduction of glyphosate tolerance is based on insertion and expression in plants of a gene encoding a glyphosate-tolerant 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, a key enzyme of the shikimate pathway. The wild type enzyme present in plants is susceptible to inhibition glyphosate; variants of EPSP synthase have been produced that are less susceptible to inhibition by glyphosate. Expression of genes encoding these variants has been shown to confer glyphosate tolerance to plants. The degree of glyphosate tolerance is related to the tolerance characteristics of the EPSP synthase variant, its substrate activity, targeting to the plastid, and the level of expression of the variant gene. The tissue specificity of expression of the variant EPSP synthase has also been shown to be critical since glyphosate is a systemic herbicide and is translocated to many growing points within the plant.  Our studies on glyphosate tolerance have substantially enhanced our understanding of the mode-of-action of glyphosate, the shikimate pathway, and protein sorting within plant cells, as well as developmental and tissue specific expression of genes in plants. Commercial use of glyphosate tolerance technology is expected to affect positively, the weed management arsenal available to the farmers, the sustainability of farm land and groundwater, and promote the use of a "soft" herbicide.

LA English

AB Technology transfer requires long-term and wide-ranging investment beyond information sharing and training. Transfer is concerned with adapting technology to given socioeconomic and technical environments but it is also the development of suitable mechanisms within the destination environment. Risk sharing and institutional development are required to achieve sustainable transfer.
   Micro-hydro technology in Nepal is an example of successful technology transfer over 20 years of in-country adaptation, promotion and training by international and Nepali technical, financial and development institutions. The successes and disappointments of the sector provide useful lessons for technology transfer programs.
   The paper arises from original research, personal experience of Nepal's micro-hydro sector and a review of associated literature.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; POLICY
AB As a result of a lawsuit, in 1975 the US Agency for International Development (AID) began to define for the first time an environmental mission. Despite the fact that agriculture is one of the major budgetary sectors at AID, the environmental programs of the Office of Foresty, Environment and Natural Resources on the whole neglected (until recently) addressing the environmental sustainability of agricultural practices. This outcome is consistent with several models of the public policy process, especially with respect to how technical information is integrated into mission plans. Specifically, the unique shape of the AID environmental mission can be explained by three sets of elements: (a) the conflicting interests of AID's external environmental, agricultural, and forestry constituencies; (b) internal organizational structure and reinforcing ideological predispositions of the Reagan White House, and (c) the developmental priorities of recipient governments. The case illustrates the complexity of executive branch program development where intraorganizational and domestic politics can affect international policy formulation in a way that does not encourage resolution of technical issues. In broad terms, AID's environmental mission still is characterized by an unresolved tension between production goals and sustainability goals, which is perpetuated by organizational rigidities despite evidence of good will and hopeful rhetoric.

ID DEFORESTATION; VIEW
AB The tropical timber trade appears to have promoted neither sustained forest management nor sustained forest-based industrialization. The boom-and-bust export pattern is often blamed on demand by developed countries, high import barriers, and low international wood prices. In fact, it is rooted in tropical countries' own policies related to timber concessions and wood-processing industries. These policies suppress timber scarcity signals and must be revised if the trade is to promote sustained economic growth. Even if this is done, the trade may not promote sustained-yield forestry in individual countries.

DE NONTIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS USE; ECONOMIC ANALYSIS; MULTIPURPOSE TREE
   PLANTATIONS; PHILIPPINE TRIBES; UNDERSTORY CULTIVATION
AB The Negrito (Ati) tribe of Nagpana, Iloilo, Philippines has traditionally been dependent on shifting cultivation and on hunting and gathering of non-timber forest products for its livelihood. In recent decades the Ati have derived increasing income from wage labor for adjacent landowners and from permanent rice cultivation. The consequent clearing of residual forests has resulted in extensive soil degradation, reduced crop yields, and loss of both commercial and subsistence non-timber forest products.
   Various agroforestry systems which incorporate permanent tree crops into traditional systems have great potential to reverse these losses. This study analyzes the economic sustainability of four different land-use options for the Ati. The net present value (NPV) of a system which  incorporates both sustainable use of the existing forest and plantations of fast-growing tree species on agricultural lands is superior to all other alternatives. Social and environmental benefits from this system further justify implementation. Any recommendations to develop such an option must take into account the constraining factors typical of such upland communities.

AB The paper attempts to juxtapose the theoretical debate on sustainability and the practical issues pertaining to two well-known environmental movements in the Indian Himalayan region of Tehri-Garhwal. A brief review of the current debate on sustainable development is followed by a search for the reasons behind the growth of consciousness about sustainability in the forest protection movement called Chipko and a movement against a high dam at Tehri. While the presence of indigenous consciousness of sustainability at micro-levels is undeniable, the success of these movements in generating it at the macro level is linked with the leadership's capability to extract supporting arguments in their favor, from modern ecological sciences.

TI REASONS FOR THE LIMITED ACCEPTANCE OF THE EC EXTENSIFICATION PROGRAM BY
   FARMERS
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB In the first two years less farmers than expected have converted their farms to organic agriculture within he EC extensification program. To get knowledge about the reason for the limited acceptance of the program 130 farmers in the Saar territory have been interviewed. While most of the farmers are on principle open to the methods of organic farming, they see the main reason for the limited acceptance in the obscure situation of marketing the organic products. Out of the economic sight, organic farming is only sustainable over a period of more than five years (during those the farmers get subsidies for the convertion of their farms), if the farmers can sell their organic grown products to customers at premium prices. Farmers see themselves unassisted in trying to find solutions for their marketing problems, especially by the official advisory service, that was criticized by the farmers in many points.
   If those, who are responsible for deciding agricultural policy, want to have a higher acceptance of thc EC extensification program, they should start ensuring that deficiencies in the state advisory service are made good. On the other hand it would be better to support marketing groups of farmers for organic grown food than to support the stimulation of the supply with organic grown products by subsidies for the conversion of farms to organic farming. This kind ot support would not disturb the working market for organic grown products by a stronger increase of supply than of demand and would not discriminate those farmers who have converted their farms before the set up of the extensification program and who have developped the market without subsidies.

AB Programs for desertification control have to be formulated in response to the specific causes of environmental degradation. A method is presented to identify the main cause(s) of desertification in countries depending highly on agriculture. Applied to the Sahelian countries, overexploitation of the natural resources through overpopulation is identified. This is illustrated by developments in animal husbandry. As a consequence intensification of agriculture is a must. It is difficult to make the available technical options profitable in view of the socioeconomic conditions. Chances are negligible where natural resources are already degraded.

DE AGROFORESTRY; DIVERSITY; FERTILITY; MANAGEMENT; MOIST FOREST; SOILS;
   SUSTAINABLE USE; TROPICAL; WEST AFRICA
AB This article examines reasons for the continuing degradation of forests and land in the moist forest zone of West Africa, where land is predominantly used for crop agriculture and forest production. Crop production is primarily limited by problems of soil management. The predominant soils, kaolinitic days, being dominated by low activity, retain little nutrients or water. Their fertility depends largely on their organic matter content, but this latter breaks down rapidly under cultivation. Continuous cultivation combined with shortened fallow periods, forced by increased demand from burgeoning human populations, leads to rapid degradation of soils, while so-called modem alternative practices are ecologically unsustainable. Forest production is constrained mainly by the high diversity of trees and the complexity of forest processes, which must be understood for successful management. Lack of such understanding, and the consequent inability to manage the natural forest to meet rising wood demands, has shifted emphasis to plantation production. This together with pressure from other land uses accounts for increasing natural forest degradation. Agroforestry practices, revival of narural forest management based on better understanding of forest regeneration dynamics, and fuller utilization of forest sites by managing plantations also for their undergrowth species, all within the framework of integrated land use policies, are underlined as promising approaches to sustainable use of land in the region.

AB The consumption patterns of the industrialized countries are already placing a grave burden on the earth's natural resources.  If ecological disaster is to be averted, these patterns must be changed as a matter of urgency.  Equally pressing is the need to create the conditions in which the developing countries can meet the growing needs of their populations without compounding the damage caused by the developed nations.  They need an international system that offers them financial and technological support to effect the transition to strong and ecological sustainable economies.  This calls for a wholly new global partnership based on common interests, mutual need and shared responsibilities.

AB Today's polarization of society for and against big hydroprojects relates to environmental costs, particularly borne by vulnerable ethnic minorities and the poor; such costs include species extinctions and tropical deforestation. This counterproductive polarization can be reconciled by transparency of planning, pluralism involving the society and especially all affected people, and by engendering national consensus on the best project. Detailed criteria for consensus are discussed. These include promotion of energy efficiency and conservation, ranking of alternatives to the next hydroproject, and environmental ranking of potential sites. Environmentally well designed hydro can be preferable to alternatives (coal, nuclear), and most environmental costs can be prevented, thus making hydro renewable and sustainable.

AB Rural energy, in developing countries is discussed with a view to sustainable development. The project-oriented approach in rural energy which has often dominated in the past, is contrasted with an overall strategy for sustainable rural energy demand and supply. An outline for a demand-oriented policy is formulated, indicating the role of the government in energy, pricing and market development. Special attention is given to electricity as the fastest-growing energy, subsector. It is concluded that major changes are required to accommodate and institutionalize the planning of decentralized energy supply.

AB Recent findings indicate that some alternative energy strategies promote equity, efficiency, and self-reliance and are both economical and sustainable. The Asian Development Bank therefore initiated a case study to formulate energy strategies which could contribute to the solution of both local and global energy problems. The study focuses on technical and economic details of energy end uses in India. The conclusions, some of which are surprising, are supported by data from several studies. The study recommends a shift to least-cost electricity planning, improving the available database for and information availability about energy, rationalizing energy pricing and related fiscal policies, and achieving energy efficiency by judicious investment in and support of energy forms which will be both sustainable and affordable in the long run.

AB The role of energy in pursuit of policies seeking sustainable development is crucial. Correspondingly, the work of energy economists will be affected in many traditional areas of analysis and will require enhanced scope and new expertise. This would lead to a better understanding of the place of natural resources in the production process, better delineation of trade offs between avoidance of ecological degradation and economic stagnation, and more interdisciplinary feedback.

DE RURAL DEVELOPMENT; TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER; RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB As analysis of the energy situation in rural areas in developing countries has shown that the major cause of the prevailing energy crisis is the shortage of organic fuel (biomass).  To cope with this crisis, therefore, technologies must be sought either to enhance biomass resources or to substitute for them.  As the majority of the population in rural areas are poor, the technologies applied should not only meet energy needs; they must also be geared to particular economic and sociocultural conditions.  Technically efficient, decentralized systems for the utilization of renewable energy can help in this by raising the availability of organic fuel resources (biomass) and meeting the demand for higher quality energy. Despite their advantages, however, there has as yet been no widespread dissemination of these technologies.  The main reasons for this are discussed, and some precepts are presented upon which, it is argued, a strategy for overcoming these obstacles should be based.

TI THE PASTORAL ROAD TO EXTINCTION - COMPETITION BETWEEN WILDLIFE AND
   TRADITIONAL PASTORALISM IN EAST-AFRICA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSERVATION
AB In some developing countries there is a call to open-up protected areas and even National Parks for low-intensity use by the local population to alleviate the pressure of the rapidly increasing human population, or because conservationists have been able to 'take' too much land according to others. This conflict in land-use has been noted by conservation authorities, and proposals have been formulated to give way to such pressure. Moreover, it has been suggested that there can be a harmonious coexistence between wildlife and livestock, so that opening-up of protected areas would not necessarily be to the detriment of wildlife, and also that the indigenous populations were able to manage wildlife and their habitats in the past (so why not again in the future). The last point in the concerted attack on the status of the protected areas is that 'conservation is an alien concept in Third World countries'.
   In this paper is reviewed the question as to whether there ever has been such a harmonious coexistence between wildlife and pastoral Man in East Africa, and aerial census data from a number of districts in Tanzania and Kenya have been used to demonstrate that livestock outcompetes wildlife. At present 'prestige overstocking' is not the case any more, due to the fact that the human population outgrows the livestock population. Apparently, a very high rate of population growth is at the root of the call for more land, and even if, for example, the whole of the Serengeti were to be handed over to the local Masai, this enormous, relatively undisturbed ecocomplex could absorb die growth of the Masai population for only some forty years.
   Finding the key to increased development should not be sought in an opening-up of protected areas but in payment of in absentia benefits by the rich western countries. This money should be used for developing programmes aimed at population limitation, increased income for the rural poor, and increased sustainable human densities in areas outside the protected areas.

AB Wildlife culling is the most preferred form of wildlife utilization in ULGMA. Nevertheless, die frequency of game-meat consumption by local people is low, partly due to the problem of irregular meat sales from the culling scheme and partly due to the low purchasing capability of villagers. LIRDP needs to improve the distribution routine of meat sale at lower prices if the culling scheme is to fulfil its objective of providing game-meat to local people. It is also essential to spread comprehension of the use of benefits from wildlife utilization among the local residents. Any increase in the allocation of the wildlife harvest quota should be considered with caution in order that species are not harvested at a rate beyond their reproductive capacity.
   There is resentment against safari hunting, based on the opinion that it gives to foreigners the opportunities to utilize wildlife resources while the local people are forbidden access to them. Appreciation of benefits from safari hunting is minimal, and option for reduction of the off-take allocation quota is strong. Although safari hunting is the most prominent revenue-generating form of utilization, benefits from it are not visible to local communities. Exchange of information between LIRDP and the local communities concerned with the use of revenue from wildlife utilization programmes needs to be reinforced. This would be instrumental not only in minimizing misconceptions about safari hunting, but also in establishing cooperation between LIRDP and local communities. An increase in the number that may be taken of the more numerous species during DGL hunting could well be considered, so as to enable more local people to utilize wildlife resources legally.
   Control shooting has a marginal effect in reducing crop damage. Even though electric fencing could be an effective barrier against large animals such as Elephants, it would be better to encourage traditional methods of self-defence. Control shooting is advocated only if and when the problem gets out of hand. Subsistence poaching is widely successful, due to the skills of the practitioners, the use of appropriate traditional technology, and the low operating costs. These features may be considered favourably in wildlife culling operations. Through allocation of a sustainable off-take quota to local hunter cooperatives, their services could be used to provide game-meat to local communities.
   Continued confrontation with commercial poachers through regular and more intensive patrols is essential, particularly in vulnerable areas. LIRDP should maximize the services of Village Scouts stationed at Miliyoti and Kauluzi wildlife camps by providing adequate firearms and ammunition for more effective anti-poaching patrols in the game management areas than currently exist. To gain local support, LIRDP may consider an increased wildlife off-take quota for the Malaila Kunda traditional ceremony. This would serve to sustain local culture and would help to develop enthusiasm among local people for due conservation of animal wildlife and other natural resources.

AB This study uses sequential aerial photography to identify environmental changes. The interpreted aerial photos constitute a data-bank of past and present land cover/uses.* Substantial changes have been observed in the areas of cultivation, woody cover, and bare ground.
   An increased 449.9% of the surveyed area has been cleared for cultivation during the last 30 years, while 77.2% of the former woodland has been destroyed during the same period, contributing to a 15.6% increase in grassland. Bare ground increased by 33.1%. Increased cultivation is caused by increase in the population of subsistence farmers and mechanization. Expansion of cultivation and overexploitation of woody resources (fuel-wood and building materials) are the causes of decline in the woody vegetation. As consumption of woody resources exceeds natural regeneration, woody cover is gradually replaced by grasslands.
   Diminution of the woody vegetation results in shortage of fuel-wood and building materials and consequent misery to the local people. Expansion of cultivation reduces grazing-land, leading to overstocking and over-grazing. Extensive cultivation, based on soil 'mining', subjects more and more land to physical and chemical soil degradation, leading in tum to decline in soil fertility and crop yields. Both overgrazing and extensive cultivation accelerate soil erosion in the area, reducing available cropland, while siltation and flooding cause serious damage to property and infrastructure.
   Lack of effective land-use planning, uncontrolled population growth, and introduction of the Tanzanian village agricultural production system in a semi-arid area, have contributed to the present deplorable state of affairs. In general, the area shows increasing environmental degradation and resource depletion, while very little conservation effort is being made to reverse the trend. These results indicate that a sustainable resource management plan is urgently needed for the area.

ID INNOVATION
AB This article provides insight into technology-economy-ecology linkages which may help to define and accomplish environmentally sustainable development. An evolutionary perspective is adopted in which economic growth and technological change are viewed as a complex, non-linear, path-dependent process, driven by short-term benefits instead of longer-term optimality. The article discusses the externality issues of technological change and the need for institutional adaptation, and talks about the relationship between economic growth and particular trajectories of technological change. It is stated that some of the present technological trajectories have reached their environmental limits and need to be replaced by environment-friendlier trajectories. However, such transitions are hindered by technical, economic and institutional barriers since the new trajectories have not yet benefited from 'dynamic scale and learning effects' and because the 'selection environment' is adapted to the old regime. The determinants of the decision processes to generate and adopt cleaner technologies are identified and analysed, and some policy issues of stimulating environment-friendlier technologies are discussed.

TI ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS FOR CENTRAL-EUROPE
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article alternative scenarios for Central Europe, ie Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland, are discussed within a national and an international context. It is shown how the various dimensions of change in Central Europe are closely interlinked. The solution of the major quests the region face, ie the quest for economic viability, the quest for social and political cohesion and the quest for a stable and secure international environment, occur in conjunction. It is argued that the completion of the various tasks exhibit different timescales which in itself may provoke additional problems. Moreover, potential synergies may easily turn into self-destructive dynamics. Based on a comprehensive assessment of the problems the region faces now and most probably in the 15-20 years to come, five scenarios are constructed which highlight the driving forces the region may face. Distinguished are the laissezfaire/capitalist scenarios, the populist-authoritarian scenario, the leaning-upon-the-West scenario, the sustainable development scenario and the muddling-on scenario.

TI RENEWABLE RESOURCE SYSTEMS AND REGIMES - KEY MISSING LINKS IN GLOBAL
   CHANGE STUDIES
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB The author argues that as we move towards a post fossil fuel era, societies will become more dependent on renewable resource systems; that current food and fibre systems at national and subnational levels are only partially understood because of the great emphasis placed on their production aspects; that at regional and international scales, agriculture, grazing, forestry, and fisheries overlap in multiple-use renewable resource regimes which are not captured with current concepts and data sets; that, just as with other aspects of industrial society, hierarchical approaches and contextual analysis are needed to capture the full environmental, social, and technological dimensions of these systems and regimes; and that only through a reconceptualization and rethinking along these lines will we be able to restructure current industrial systems in ways designed to develop more sustainable and regenerative systems.

TI THE ROLE OF THE LEGUME IN THE NITROGEN-CYCLE OF PRODUCTIVE AND
   SUSTAINABLE PASTURES
SO GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANIC-MATTER; LITTER; FIXATION; RYEGRASS; LEAVES; SOIL
AB The role of the legume in the nitrogen (N) cycle was examined in grazed pastures receiving no N fertilizer of both temperate and tropical regions by simulating the fluxes of N through different processes of the cycle. The amounts of legume-fixed N required to balance the cycle without invoking a drain on soil organic N reserves (i.e. no net N mineralization) was estimated to vary from 38 to 53% of the above-ground herbage N or from 20 to 31% on a dry matter (DM) basis for tropical pasture systems with a range of pasture utilization of 10-40%. At higher pasture utilization levels of 50-70%, more typical of intensively grazed temperate pastures, the N input requirement in the absence of fertilizer N would be 57-67% of the above-ground herbage N or 35-45% DM. An examination of the role of each contributory process of recycling (viz. excreta returns, internal cycling or remobilization from senescing tissues, litter decomposition) suggests that variations in the amounts of internally cycled N would have the greatest impact on the requirement for biologically fixed N at low levels of pasture utilization (10-40%), while at high pasture utilization levels of 70%, variations in the recovery of excreta-N would have a major effect on the requirement for fixed-N to balance the cycle.
   The amounts of biologically fixed N required to sustain a range of herbage DM yields of 3-22 t DM ha-1 yr-1 would range from 15 to 158 kg N ha-1 yr-1 for tropical pastures. For intensively managed temperate pastures producing 6-15 t DM ha-1 yr-1 with a N content of 3.5%, a range of fixation of 120-352 kg N ha-1 yr-1 is required. These simulations indicate how legume contents of 20-45% of herbage DM could contribute to productive and sustainable (in terms of N) pasture systems of both temperate and tropical regions.

TI ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL-DEVELOPMENT IN ZIMBABWE
SO GROWTH AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIALIST TRANSITION; FOOD-PRODUCTION
AB Zimbabwe's 1992 food crisis revealed both spatial and social contradictions associated with post-independence agricultural growth. Zimbabwe's pattern of agricultural restructuring demonstrates the need for agrarian reform programs that are more socially and environmentally sustainable. This paper examines one aspect of agricultural sustainability-the use of energy. Post-independence patterns of agricultural energy consumption are analyzed and traced historically, and the social relations of agricultural energy utilization are investigated. The energetic efficiencies of the primary farming systems are calculated as are the macro-flows of energy to agriculture generally. The data and historical analysis point to the need for a restructuring of agriculture that involves greater reliance on local renewable energy in all farming systems, and the continued resettlement of black smallholders onto former white-settler estates.

TI STRENGTHENING HEALTH-SERVICES FOR MCH IN AFRICA - THE 1ST 4 YEARS OF THE
   BAMAKO INITIATIVE
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID DRUGS; GHANA; COSTS; CARE; PAY
AB More than four years have passed since the adoption of the 'Bamako Initiative' by African Ministers of Health.  It has evolved into a movement to revive and extend peripheral health services within a district-level strengthening of health care delivery systems, placing responsibility for health care management at thh local level, but with continuing national Ministry of Health (MOH) technical supervision and support.  This will provide the basis on which prime mother and child health care interventions, such as immunization, prevention and control of common diseases and pre- and postnatal care, can be made accessible to the majority of the population, and on which HIV/AIDS-related action can be accelerated.  Community action in the management and financing of peripheral health services is seen as the most critical element for improving service quality and ensuring long-term sustainability.  Whilst many countries in Africa have initiated action, difficult issues remain:  access for the very poor who cannot afford to pay; the rational use of drugs given a more continuous supply of essential drugs in the delivery system; the ability of governments to maintain their support in the face of declining economies; and the role of women in community action.

TI IMPLEMENTING EFFECTIVE LOCAL-MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL-RESOURCES - NEW ROLES
   FOR NGOS IN AFRICA
SO HUMAN ORGANIZATION

AB Sustainable development seems an elusive objective for Africa's rural peoples, yet there are unique opportunities for nongovernmental organizations in Africa to work toward that goal. NGOs can facilitate this effort by strengthening institutional capacities at the local level. Several factors, however, impede NGO effectiveness. Among them are 1) issues surrounding NGO needs for autonomy and Government needs for control; 2) problems in "scaling up" NGO efforts and creating the necessary micro-macro linkages; and 3) confusion over appropriate roles for NGOs.
   This paper considers these issues in the context of two cases of NGO activity, an organization in Zimbabwe called Environment and Development Activities-Zimbabwe (ENDA-Zimbabwe) and an approach to rural development in Kenya, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), which involves international and national NGOs as well as the Kenyan Government. The paper suggests that NGOs can be more effective if they move from a project orientation to an "enabling" orientation. They also must move beyond individual agendas, turf struggles, and long-established roles to identify some emerging approaches to local development and resource management which will increase their capacities for flexible, innovative action.

TI THE ROLE OF HYDROMETALLURGY IN ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

LA English

ID METALS
AB It is becoming increasingly clear that humanity must address quickly the rapid degradation in the quality of our planet's environment. No human activity will be allowed without regard for its impact on air and water quality, on energy consumption and on greenhouse gas evolution. This is particularly true for industries such as mining and extractive metallurgy, which have high visibility and which have for some time been prime targets for legislation and public concern.
   Hydrometallurgy, because it is a discipline central to the preservation of water quality and to the safe and economical treatment and disposal of wastes, has a significant role in making sustainable development a workable doctrine. Selected examples of hydrometallurgical technologies that will continue to be important are reviewed, including abatement of acid drainage from tailings, heavy metal and arsenic removal from wastewaters, recycling alternatives and processes for decreased energy requirements. Cyanide destruction technology is a practical example that is discussed in terms of a successful environmental technology development. What is abundantly needed are multidisciplinary scientific teams, working closely with government regulatory agencies and with design engineers and plant operators, to transform laboratory ideas into industrial facilities that are acceptable to a knowledgeable public.

AB With the meagre possibility of bringing additional area under plough, it is of immense importance to produce more for the ever-increasing population in the years to come. The study integrating crops with fish and poultry farming in the lowlands of Tamil Nadu clearly indicated the best advantage over the conventional system of cropping. ne study conducted for 3 years (1987-1990) indicated an additional income of Rs 15,320, Rs 11,574 and Rs 15,505/ha/year during first, second and third year respectively over conventional cropping.

AB One of the most interesting theoretical issues that comes up from the analysis of the tablita period in the Southern Cone economies-Argentina, Chile and Uruguay-is the interpretation of why interest rates on domestic currency loans were much higher than the rate on foreign currency loans adjusted for devaluation of the domestic currency, even though the rate of devaluation was set by the monetary authorities six months ahead and published in a little table (tablita). This was particularly puzzling in the case of Uruguay which had practically perfect capital mobility. We show that the reason rational economic agents were willing to pay high domestic interest rates rather than borrowing in foreign currency was that they realized that policy fundamentals were inconsistent with the sustainability of the exchange rate policy. Using data for Uruguay we show that a second systematic component of expectations of devaluation is what we call 'the policy risk factor' and modeled as a function of the fiscal and monetary variables. (JEL 41, 31).

AB Following the end of Communist rule in 1989, Poland has been facing the difficult challenge of responding to the legacy of a devastated environment amid an overwhelming economic crisis. This article describes how Poland has been responding to this challenge, with particular focus on the country's policy of sustainable development within the framework of transition to a democratic market economy. The article discusses achievements and difficulties in seeking both effective environmental protection and economic restructuring since 1989 and examines the country's future needs and problems. The conclusion discusses the implications of the Polish experience for institutional design and development theory.

AB While well-known as a practitioner of planning and architecture, and sometimes ambivalently remembered as the father of the shopping center, Victor David Gruen (1903-1980) also contributed significantly to the theory of good urban form. He argued that a world system of medium-sized, dense, urbane, cellular metropolises would improve considerably both human happiness and global ecological sustainability. This article first places Gruen's prototype in the contemporary literature on global sustainability, and outlines his life and work as a practitioner/theorist. Then, after detailing his metropolitan ideal, the study comments on its value in planning thought and practice. Gruen's position, though seriously incomplete, is an important middle-left synthesis in planning theory. As an integrated transit/auto concept, his prototype is conceptually useful for automobile cities planning to add more mass transit, and for mass transit cities planning to add more freeways.

TI INFLUENCE OF SEA OTTERS ON SOFT-BOTTOM PREY COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHEAST
   ALASKA
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
LA English
DT Article
ID PREDATION; STATE
AB Sea otters Enhydra lutris, well documented as 'keystone' predators in rocky marine communities, were found to exert a strong influence on infaunal prey communities in soft-sediment habitats. The effect of sea otter predation in subtidal soft-bottom prey communities in southeast Alaska was evaluated via a natural experiment comparing prey populations in similar habitats with and without sea otters. Results indicate that otters forage primarily on bivalve prey, especially the butter clam Saxidomus giganteus and dramatically reduce infaunal bivalve and sea urchin (Strongylo-centrotus spp.) prey populations. Bivalve prey abundance, biomass and size were negatively correlated with sea otter occupancy. Otter-cracked shells of the deep-burrowing clams Tresus capax and Panope abrupta were rarely found, even at otter foraging sites where these clams accounted for the majority of available prey biomass, suggesting that these species have a partial depth refuge from otter predation. The differential impacts of otter predation on prey populations suggest that infaunal bivalves provide a more sustainable food base than do sea urchins.

   APPLICATION TO THE PACIFIC COAST TRAWL FISHERY
SO RAND JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPORARY EQUILIBRIUM; CAPACITY UTILIZATION
AB This article measures total factor productivity in industries that exploit resources held in common. Particular attention is paid to the valuation and specification of in situ common-property resources in a neoclassical production technology, catchability of the resource, and variations in economic capacity utilization. An empirical analysis of the open-access Pacific coast trawl fishing industry demonstrates that disentangling the productivity residual from changes in resource abundance, its catchability, and variations in capacity utilization hones the productivity residual to finer precision, lowering mean productivity growth by about half. Removing biological noise from highly variable resources is also important. The results are related to a program limiting the number of vessels and can contribute to sustainable resource management whenever resources are held in common.

AB Stability of the stock-harvesting system regulated by a feedback control procedure of catch quota is examined. In the procedure considered, catch quota is changed proportionally to the difference between current and the target stock level (with a proportionality constant h) and to the annual stock growth rate (with a proportionality constant g). Condition for the local stability of the target equilibrium is obtained as a function of the stock-recruitment relation, survival probability of adults, target stock level, time lag before implementation of regulation, age of sexual maturity of the stock, and proportionality constants g and h. It is shown that, (1) the procedure has the stabilizing effect; it can stabilize the target stock level that is unstable under constant harvest, (2) lower target stock level favors larger g and smaller h, when the target is set around MSYL (the stock level that gives MSY), (3) the degree of stability, measured by the time required to recover the target stock level, is an increasing function of the target stock level, (4) stability and sustainable yield are in trade-off, (5) time delay caused by the time needed before sexual maturity does not affect the stability significantly, but the effect of the time lag before implementation of regulation is significant. Comparison between harvest-control and effort-control procedures is also made, and the advantage of the latter in terms of stability is shown.

TI FOOD SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN VIETNAM - A SEARCH FOR A VIABLE SOLUTION
SO SYSTEM DYNAMICS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This article attempts to assess the effects on an agricultural resource system of policies to maintain food self-sufficiency in a centrally planned economy. Vietnam's case serves as an illustration. Experimentation with a system dynamics model of the food production system, incorporating relations concerning soil ecology and agricultural land management policy, serves as a basis for this assessment. Short-run policies to increase production appear to be detrimental to maintaining food self-sufficiency in the long run. It appears that a sustainable food production policy must incorporate soil conservation and improvement, and population control. Although difficult to implement in a market system, such a policy agenda may be feasible in a centrally planned economy.

TI ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS OF QUERCUS DOMINATED WOODLANDS IN CALIFORNIA AND

AB There are many similarities between Spanish and Californian Quercus woodlands and savanna. Both are located in Mediterranean climate zones, and are used predominantly for livestock grazing. The Californian overstory is dominated by one or a combination of five Quercus species and their hybrids: Quercus douglasii H.&A., Q. agrifolia Nee., Q. wislizenii A.DC., Q. lobata Nee., and Q. englemannii Greene (blue, coast live, interior live, valley, and Englemann oaks). In southern Spain and Portugal, Quercus woodland overstory is predominantly one or a combination of two Quercus species, Quercus ilex L. (holm oak) and Quercus suber L. (cork oak). The underlying natural and semi-natural ecological dynamics of the Quercus woodlands of Spain and California are different, and it follows that the management practices employed also differ. The greatest point of contrast between California and Spain is in the intensity and diversity of management goals and practices. A state-transition model for, comparing the ecological dynamics of Quercus woodlands and savanna in California and southern Spain is developed and examined. The highly simplified model is an analytic tool of use in organizing research and developing management practices. States are reached and maintained in different ways in Spain and California, but their appearance and their function in each landscape are quite similar.

AB A review of the existing literature on biodiversity connected with agricultural activities has been developed, and the possible sustainable alternatives have been looked into.
   Following recent evaluations, only one-twentieth to one-sixtieth of the planet's species have yet been described and most of these will be lost if the destruction of the environment continues at its present rate. Most of the terrestrial environment (up to 95%) is affected by human activities including agriculture and the terrestrial habitats provide up to 98% of human food on the planet. Sustainable strategies in food production in agriculture improve the existing biodiversity and include the following items: increased porosity of the landscape through proper management of natural vegetation, better use and recycling of organic residues, introduction of integrated farming systems, reduced tillage, rotation, biological control, increased number of biota involved in human food-webs.

AB Optimization of symbioses between plants and microbes has been suggested as a method for enhancing nutrient uptake in low-input agroecosystems. In general symbioses may be maximized through:  (1) the selection of plant cultivars responsive to symbionts; (2) inoculation with highly efficient strains of symbionts; (3) habitat modification to encourage symbioses. These methods were tested under a traditional, slash mulch 'frijol tapado' bean agroecosystem and/or a high-input ('espequeado') system to increase nodulation and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM) of beans with the following results: (1) Under the espequeado system (modified by the exclusion of fertilizer application), four cultivars of indeterminate, vining dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) nodulated more than two determinate, bush varieties, especially under low available soil phosphorus (P). VAM levels were not statistically different under these conditions. (2) Under the tapado system, pelletization with rock phosphate and Rhizobium inoculum did not significantly change nodule biomass, dinitrogen (N2)-fixation or yield. (3) Without P application, neither nodulation nor % VAM were significantly different between the two systems of bean production. However, as applied P increased, differences in % VAM of the two systems became significant, decreasing more sharply with increasing P in the tapado system.
   The tripartite symbiosis of beans can be influenced by various factors such as cultivar, nutrient application and production system. Although traditional varieties and systems may optimize certain microbial symbioses, the quantity of the symbiosis appears to depend on a number of complex factors. An intermediate agricultural technology, the mixing of traditional and modem, is exemplified here by the application of moderate levels of fertilizer to the traditional, tapado system. This intermediate approach promises to decrease inputs in comparison to the espequeado system, as well as the need for shift cultivation, but long-term testing is needed.

AB In 1983, the species composition and diversity of carabids, spiders and harvestmen was investigated by pitfall traps in a grassy field margin and in an adjacent, biologically farmed wheat field at Obere Lobau, Vienna, Austria.
   The carabid fauna of both habitats was diverse; it showed a high degree of similarity, the abundant species in both habitats being represented by typical field species. Only Metophonus spp. predominantly lived in the margin. Numerous species of different habitat origin occurred in the margin at low abundances indicating transitional stay rather than permanent populations.
   In contrast, the spider fauna showed a low degree of similarity, with few agrobiotic species strongly dominating the field fauna. In the field margin, a rich spider fauna containing rare elements indicates the general importance of grassy margins for nature conservation. The apparently low faunal exchange of spiders between the two habitat types is discussed. Harvestmen occurred mainly in the field margin; only two thermophilic species invaded the field.
   Seasonal fluctuations in the trapping numbers of Bembidion lampros, Platynus dorsalis and Brachinus explodens are interpreted as indicating migrations between field margin and field. Poecilus cupreus and certain other field species, however, apparently spend their entire life cycle in the field. The possible function of field margins for restoration of carabid losses due to impacts of intensive cultivation is discussed.
   It is concluded that both grassy field margins and sustainable farming methods, in particular biological farming, are necessary to maintain a diverse predatory arthropod fauna in agroecosystems.

AB The mutualistic relationship between leguminous plants and Rhizobium bacteria has synergistic biological effects in the fixation of atmospheric N. This fixed N in turn creates a resource base for other ecological interactions in the soil. We suggest that these synergistic effects can be extended to include human social interactions when forage legumes are used in agriculture and offer historical evidence for our hypothesis. Use of forage legumes in a rotation sequence is a cornerstone of successful sustainable agriculture as practiced in many parts of the world. The history of these practices is traced, with particular emphasis on development and use by various Anabaptist groups, whose attitude toward ecologically responsible innovation enabled them to embrace technological changes which the mainstream culture resisted. Before the widespread use of forage legumes in western Europe, agricultural production was little above subsistence level. As forage legumes became more common, soil fertility improved, resulting in surplus production and capital accumulation. Coincidentally, it was not until capital began accumulating from the surplus production resulting from widespread use of legumes as harvested hay that the Industrial Revolution began to expand. As agriculture has become more and more mechanized, use of forage legumes has decreased. Ironically, the environmental and economic fallout of the Industrial Revolution is creating selective forces for agriculture to return to these rotational practices.

AB The lack of suitable and appropriate crops has been a poorly recognized obstacle to the application of sound agroecological practices in some temperate and tropical regions. Cultivation of traditional hybrid crops in inherently hostile environments forces increased managerial and economic expenditures. Selection of ecologically harmonious crops exploits, rather than opposes natural forces. Based in part on US-AID funded research, we have identified three crops suitable for temperate/tropical cultivation. Amaranthus is recognized in Asia and Central and South America as a food crop that can be grown as a leafy vegetable or as a seed grain in mixed croppings. It does well under a wide variety of conditions using established cultural methods. It is nutritious and highly palatable and, in many areas. is well recognized in the market place. Prosopis species (mesquite) leguminous trees occur worldwide in arid and semi-arid areas. As phreatophytes, they are resistant to drought and high temperature extremes and produce abundant yields of edible beanlike pods. Using the beans from the tree, a variety of attractive, marketable food products have been prepared. We have also identified intermediate wheat-grass, a perennial relative of wheat, as an ecologically and economically attractive alternate crop. It is already a well-established range crop; grown for seed, it becomes a useful grain intercrop. The wholegrain or endosperm mill fractions make excellent tasting, appetizing and attractive baked products. Ongoing agronomic studies indicate it is especially suitable for balancing ecologically unstable areas.

AB Continental Australia and Tasmania cover a wide range of latitudes from tropical regions in the north through the arid and semi-arid core to cool temperate regions further south. Vegetation is equally varied and because of this and the continent's isolation during the Tertiary, floral and faunal diversity and endemism are very high. Europeans arrived 200 years ago and since that time have markedly modified the landscape by clearing and changing the vegetation, predominantly for agricultural and urban development. Both accidental and deliberate introductions of stock, weeds, crops, trees and pasture plants have also caused enormous changes to Australian environments. In the last few years the deleterious effects of some of these changes have been realised, for example the extent of soil degradation. Measures are being taken to rectify problems and techniques are being introduced which benefit both primary producers and other users of the land and also nature conservation. Some of these measures for a more sustainable use of the land are illustrated here for four vegetation types, eucalypt woodland, native forests, grasslands and arid systems. They include adopting native tree species for timber production and native grasses for pasture, retention of native vegetation and paying attention to conservation of invertebrates in Parks and Reserves.

TI THE ECOLOGY AND ECONOMICS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS - THE RESEARCH AGENDA
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEM
AB As the UNCED process draws global attention to the potentially enormous welfare implications of biodiversity loss, it is useful to take stock of what is and is not known about the problem. Combining the insights from the disciplines of economics and ecology, this paper outlines the most urgent questions for research in the area. Regarding humans less as managers than as co-actors with other species in complex self-organizing systems, we focus on the sustainability of resource use. In the context of biological conservation this implies the maintenance of sufficient biodiversity to assure the resilience of ecosystems delivering ecological services of fundamental value to human societies. The paper identifies four sets of research issues: the first comprises a set of ecological questions about the nature, measurement and consequences of change in biological diversity, both globally and at the level of particular ecosystems. The second concerns the economic valuation of ecological services as a means of judging the economic significance of biodiversity loss. The third concerns the driving forces behind biodiversity loss. It deals with both the proximate and underlying causes of change in the level of biodiversity. The fourth concerns the scope for changing the human behavior which threatens biodiversity, whether through the destruction of habitat, through specialization in production, or through harvesting strategies. The nature of the linkage between ecological and economic systems is discussed in the context of informational, institutional, ethical and cultural conditions. The paper takes a systems perspective emphasizing the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to biodiversity, and the gains from collaborative research.

DT Article
AB This paper seeks to show how the conservation of natural habitats and protected areas contributes to sustainable development, with special emphasis on economic arguments. The role of environmental economics and valuation of natural resources, as analytical tools that facilitate the avoidance of adverse environmental impacts, is discussed. An integrated environmental economic framework is outlined, and some practical case studies of environmental impact valuation in developing countries are summarized. The paper goes on to discuss the links between economy-wide policies (both macroeconomic and sectoral) and natural-resource degradation, and explains the important role of environmental accounting. Issues that arise in the practical implementation of efforts to conserve biodiversity in developing countries are delineated, and the status of international dialogue on agreements to protect the environment is summarized. The role of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) is described, and key issues in recent GEF projects are highlighted. In-country issues arising from the implementation of policy for the protection of biodiversity are reviewed. Recent integrated conservation development projects (ICDPs) are examined, which have attempted to link protected area management with social and economic development in local communities. The final section contains the principal conclusions.

TI SCALE AND BIODIVERSITY POLICY - A HIERARCHICAL APPROACH
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOW NETWORKS
AB A hierarchical approach to natural systems, which assumes that smaller subsystems change according to a faster dynamic than do larger systems of which they are a part, is advocated as a useful means to conceptualize problem's of scale in determining biodiversity policy. It is argued that conservation biology is a normative science that, like medicine, is shaped by a goal of protecting and healing ecosystems.The goal of sustaining biological diversity over multiple human generations implies that biodiversity policy must be set at the landscape level of the ecosystem. Since ecosystems can be described at many levels of organization, conservation biologists must model ecosystems on a scale appropriate to the crucial dynamic that supports the sustainability goal. This dynamic, the autopoietic feature of ecosystems, supports and sustains species across generations. The value of these ecosystem processes is measured as the avoided costs of sustaining species in zoos or highly managed habitats. The protection of the health of these landscape-level processes should therefore be the central goal of biodiversity policy.

TI CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY AS IF PEOPLE MATTER - A CASE-STUDY FROM INDIA
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB India has rich traditions of nature conservation as well as a vigorous official program of protection of nature reserves developed over the last 40 years. However, the official program suffers from total reliance on authoritarian management arrangements in which decisions are made centrally and coercion is used to implement them. At the same time, the state apparatus organises subsidized resource flows to the urban-industrial-intensive agricultural complex which promote inefficient, non-sustainable resource-use patterns that are inimical to conservation of biodiversity. These processes are illustrated within the concrete setting of the district of Uttara Kannada in southern India. It is suggested that the interests of conservation would be served far better by an approach that withdraws the subsidies to the elite so that a much more efficient, sustainable and equitable pattern of resource use, compatible with conservation of biodiversity, can be instituted. In conjunction with this, the larger society should involve local people in working out detailed plans for conservation of biodiversity and offer them adequate authority as well as appropriate financial incentives to implement these plans. The paper goes on to illustrate how such an approach may be implemented in the case of Uttara Kannada.

AB Recent studies of the lekking great snipe (Gallinago media) have shown that male mating success increases with display rate and the amount of white on the tail. An obvious question then arises: what is setting the limits to male display rate and to the evolution of even whiter tails? In this study the costs of these two traits are considered. In the case of the white on the tail, almost no predation was observed during the display period. However, predation on the winter grounds and/or during migration cannot be ruled out. Males differed in the amount of white on the tail between years. It is suggested that increasing the amount of white is costly, though the reason for this is still unknown. In the case of display rate, it is shown that predation cannot be a considerable cost, again because of the near absence of predation on the leks. Instead, it is shown that male displays are energetically costly. The daily energy expenditure of displaying males was estimated to be on average 4 times the basal metabolic rate, which is close to the supposed maximum sustainable work load for birds. Furthermore, males lost on average 1.8 g per h (1.7% of the body mass) which is about 7.2 g (6.8%) during a night of display activity. Males do gain some weight during the day when no displays are performed but loose on average 9 g during an 11-day period in the early part of the breeding season. These results indicate that high energetic demands set the limits to male display performance and that males do not have to trade off the benefit of attracting females by their displays against a cost of attracting predators.

AB Photosynthetic processes provide environmentally sustainable mechanisms for removal of CO2.  Biological systems produce biomass which can act as a reservoir of carbon or as a direct substitute for fossil fuels. Three alternative strategies are examined and compared: Sequestration of carbon by reforestation; growing energy crops to offset the use of fossil fuels; and the use of photobiology and photobiochemistry. This report concludes that it is more efficient to use land to grow biomass for energy, offsetting fossil fuel use, than to simply sequester CO2 in forests. Biological systems are among the most promising alternatives for reducing atmospheric CO2 levels in combination with improved energy efficiencies. A comparative study is shown for 16 European countries, the USA and Japan.

AB In this article concluding remarks are made about the status and potential of CO2 removal as an option to reduce the man-made CO2 emissions. The remarks are based on the results of the first intemational conference on carbon dioxide removal, held in Amsterdam from 4 to 6 March 1992, where aspects like the technology, the costs, the attainable emission reduction, the environmental consequences and the competitiveness were discussed. It is concluded that CO2 removal can contribute substantially to a reduction of the CO2 emissions. However, a massive introduction requires further R & D to improve its performance and to demonstrate that it can be applied within the concepts of sustainable development.

DT Article
AB In the Hawaiian Islands, planners and public officials have decided recently to raise the permissible level of urban development in central Oahu. The decision is opposed by many on the grounds that it threatens agricultural land as well as the sustainability of groundwater supply. A two-part procedure is presented for exploring the impacts of such development and designing urban-expansion patterns that minimize them. First, a water-balance simulation model is used to calculate groundwater recharge as it varies with land use and location within the area. The difference between recharge and withdrawal is computed, and any changes are then estimated for different land uses. This information is then incorporated into optimization models having objectives related to agricultural land retention, groundwater balance, and residential population growth. The models generate alternative land-use expansion plans and show the trade-offs among objectives. The consideration of slightly suboptimal (dominated) solutions allows a significant expansion in the range of such alternatives. The results suggest that, if future agricultural development does not occur on currently nonagricultural land, then both agricultural land and groundwater sustainability will suffer significant adverse effects under the new population limits.

DE ECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS; ESTUARIES; FEES; FINANCING; PERMITS
ID POLLUTION; PRESCRIPTIONS; RIGHTS
AB Economic instruments, such as effluent fees and tradable discharge permits (TDP), have often been suggested by economists as efficient or cost-effective means to control pollution. In recent years such instruments have received increasing attention due to their growing political acceptability. Still, their use in practice has been tentative.
   The interest in possible application of such instruments has led to a set of studies regarding their practical potential. These studies indicate that economic instruments require substantial government involvement, entailing high administration cost: require restrictions so as to prevent significant deterioration in receptor areas: and have ambivalent effects on innovation adoption. Consequently, the efficiency gains from such instruments may be smaller than potential gains identified in earlier studies. In addition, the distributional impacts of such instruments and their possible adverse effect on market contestability reduce their attractiveness in some cases. These findings raise the question: what is the desired role of economic instruments in addressing environmental concerns?
   In recent years the demand for environmental services has increased dramatically. Current legislation and studies indicate that desired environmental expenditures are likely to increase. At the same time environmental programs face increasing competition from other programs for a declining pool of general revenues. One outcome of these processes has been the search for alternative sources of funds for environmental programs. Furthermore, as the competition for general revenue funds increases, the allocation of such funds for environmental programs becomes less predictable. This may endanger many long-term environmental programs that require stable funding.
   This article suggests that economic instruments may prove one source of dedicated funds for many environmental goals. Consequently, studies of environmental-program financing as well as studies of economic instruments may well explore the possible role of economic instruments as financing tools. Some examples of the potential of such tools for estuary cleanup programs are discussed.

TI CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Countries richest in biological diversity ironically are often the poorest economically. In these countries, in which humans struggle daily to meet urgent basic needs, efforts to protect the environment will succeed only if implemented in the context of promoting economic growth. Yet economic growth itself depends on the normal functioning of ecosystems and on a sustainable supply of natural resources. This mutual dependence of development and environmental protection must provide the conceptual basis for any successful effort to protect diversity in the third world. Accordingly, the U.S. government, through the Agency for International Development (USAID), supports an extensive program to protect the world's biological resources as an integral component of foreign assistance. A primary goal of USAID's biodiversity program is to maximize the potential for both economic and environmental security in developing countries. A greater reliance on market forces, the judicious application of economic incentives, and the use of effective economic instruments within the framework of constructive regulations provide the foundation for USAID's approach to conserving biological diversity.

AB Stand tending is an essential component in the sustainable development of the forest resource. With ever-increasing demands on our forests and the loss of productive forest land to other uses, intensive management can provide the opportunity to maintain adequate timber supply through short- and long-term gains in the productivity of young established stands. This paper identifies problems in tending these young stands and examines how research can be used to address both present and unforeseen future management concerns.

AB For a large-scale fusion energy system the ability to recycle materials removed from reactor service could confer several benefits.  Firstly, it could extend the resources of strategic chemical elements, thus enhancing the potential of fusion as a sustainable long term energy source and, secondly, it could reduce the quantities of radioactive waste requiring permanent disposal.  A number of preliminary studies have been performed to assess the recycling potential of some candidate reactor materials and particular examples of tritium breeders, low activation steels, vanadium alloys, tungsten and copper are briefly described.  In most cases, technically-feasible processing routes can be identified for the recovery and reuse of material in the fusion cycle without the generation of large-volume waste streams.

TI CFOS AND STRATEGISTS - FORGING A COMMON FRAMEWORK
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Companies have become increasingly polarized into two divergent camps:  those who consider shareholder value the key to managing the company and those who put their faith in gaining competitive advantage.  Indeed, that age-old debate between investing for the long term and showing outstanding short-term results is back - only this time the camps are flying banners with the new buzzwords of corporate America:  competitive advantage and shareholder value.
   In this article, Alfred Rappaport attempts to settle the debate once and for all, arguing forcefully that establishing competitive advantage and creating shareholder value both stem from a common economic framework.  In fact, long-term productivity is the hinge from which both sustainable competitive advantage and consistent results for the shareholder hang.
   But many managers refuse to accept this theory and cling to the mistaken belief that the market does not actually value the long-term productivity of their company but judges it only by its short-term performance.  They then jump to a second mistaken conclusion:  assuming they must depart from the shareholder-value model to improve their competitive position.
   Rappaport attacks these mistaken beliefs, showing that the stock market does value the long-term productivity of a company and that it is not necessary to depart from the shareholder-value model to improve a company's competitive position.  Maximum returns for current shareholders will materialize only when managers maximize long-term shareholder value and deliver interim results that attest credibly to sustainable competitive advantage.

DE EXERCISE LIMITATION; USEFUL HYPERPNEA; RESPIRATORY MUSCLE FATIGUE;
   HYPERVENTILATION
ID LUNG-VOLUME; MUSCLES; AIR
AB We addressed two questions concerned with the metabolic cost and performance of respiratory muscles in healthy young subjects during exercise: 1) does exercise hyperpnea ever attain a "critical useful level"? and 2) is the work of breathing (W(v)) at maximum O2 uptake (VO2max) fatiguing to the respiratory muscles? During progressive exercise to maximum, we measured tidal expiratory flow-volume and transpulmonary pressure- (Ptp) volume loops. At rest, subjects mimicked their maximum and moderate exercise Ptp-volume loops, and we measured the O2 cost of the hyperpnea (VO2RM) and the length of time subjects could maintain reproduction of their maximum exercise loop. At maximum exercise, the O2 cost of ventilation (VE) averaged 10 +/- 0.7% of the VO2max. In subjects who used most of their maximum reserve for expiratory flow and for inspiratory muscle pressure development during maximum exercise, the VO2Rm required 13-15% of VO2max The O2 cost of increasing VE from one work rate to the next rose from 8% of the increase in total body VO2 (VO2T) during moderate exercise to 39 +/- 10% in the transition from heavy to maximum exercise; but in only one case of extreme hyperventilation, combined with a plateauing of the VO2T, did the increase in VO2RM equal the increase in VO2T. All subjects were able to voluntarily mimic maximum exercise W(v) for 3-10 times longer than the duration of the maximum exercise. We conclude that the O2 cost of exercise hyperpnea is a significant fraction of the total VO2max but is not sufficient to cause a critical level of "useful" hyperpnea to be achieved in healthy subjects. The VE and W(v) during maximum exercise are nonfatiguing and sustainable.

AB Following open elections in Poland in 1989 and 1990, municipalities in Poland have begun establishing and implementing government at the local and regional level.  This task is complicated by the preceding 50 years of a strongly centralized government in which all decisions were made in Warsaw, with very little room for local initiative and discretion. Although the environment has suffered in the City and Province of Wroclaw, local officials are determined to correct problems which have been building since the city was first settled, nearly 1,000 years ago.

TI A METHODIC PATHWAY TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE FARMING SYSTEMS
SO LANDBOUWTIJDSCHRIFT-REVUE DE L AGRICULTURE

DT Article
AB A methodic pathway is suggested for the definition, elaboration, evaluation and introduction of farming systems based on an 'integrated' or an 'ecosystem-oriented' vision, both considered more sustainable than a 'worldmarket-oriented' vision. The objectives of these three basic types of systems are defined in measurable terms with respect to the major social values or interests supported or adversely influenced by agriculture. For each type of systems a strategy is assessed through which the objectives can be achieved while avoiding their conflicts. Arable farming is taken as an example of the elaboration, evaluation and introduction of integrated and ecosystem-oriented systems. It is discussed how prototype systems can be developed on an experimental farm, evaluated with a pilot-group of farmers and dispersed on a large scale. For the short term it is recommended to focus research and policy on integrated farming systems, as an urgent compromise between socio-economical and socio-ecological interests. For the long term it is recommended to develop ecosystem-oriented farming systems to solve the agricultural crisis in a more comprehensive and sustainable way.

TI ESTIMATION OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THE TROPICAL LOBSTER PANULIRUS-ORNATUS IN
   TORRES STRAIT, USING VISUAL TRANSECT-SURVEY METHODS
SO MARINE BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ECOLOGY; YIELD
AB The Panulirus ornatus stock in a 25000 km2 area of Torres Strait was estimated by making visual counts of the number of lobsters in strip transects. Pilot studies in 1988 to assess the feasibility of a full-scale survey and optimize the sampling design showed that: 4 x 500 m transects were the most cost-effective of the different sizes trialled; two transects per location comprised the most optimal allocation of replication; and approximately 300 locations were necessary to achieve a 95 % confidence interval of +/- 10 % of the mean density found in the pilot study. Satellite imagery was used to map habitats in Torres Strait, and areas likely to be inhabited by lobsters were classified broadly into three strata: windward reef slope, submerged reef, and deep areas. The 300 locations were allocated to each stratum in proportion to its area and the estimated variance of lobster abundance within it; once allocated, the locations were positioned at random within each stratum. The main survey was undertaken over a period of 7 wk in May-June 1989, and the resulting estimate of lobster abundance was approximately 14 million with a 95 % confidence interval of +/- 21 %. The surveyed population was sampled concurrently to determine its size structure: the pre-fishery year-class comprised 43% of the population; lobsters greater than legal-size comprised 57 % and their average tail weight was 346 g. Thus, the estimate of stock size for the study area was 2200 to 3350 t tail weight, which is roughly ten-fold greater than the annual catch of about 250 t. The current catch is approaching the lower estimates of potential yield, calculated using simple maximal sustainable yield estimators, which suggests that the fishery is unlikely to be under threat at present and may support greater effort.

TI METABOLISM AND RAM GILL VENTILATION IN JUVENILE PADDLEFISH,

SO PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY
LA English

ID FISHES; MORPHOLOGY; RESPIRATION; GROWTH; TUNA
AB Metabolic rate, branchial morphology, and modes of gill ventilation were studied in young (2-10 g) North American paddlefish, Polyodon spathula, with anatomical, behavioral, and physiological methods.  Polyodon lacks the oral and opercular values that are typical for fishes that rely on a buccal pump system to ventilate the gills, and the jaw opening system of Polyodon is poorly suited for regular pumping movements.  Unrestrained, undisturbed juvenile paddlefishes swim constantly at a mean speed of 1.1-1.5 body lengths . s-1 (bls).  The maximum speed sustainable for > 10 min is 1.6-1.8 bls.  When forced to swim at slow speeds in flow tanks or water tunnels, ventilation of the gills by buccal pumping occurs at a frequency of 50-80 . min-1.  As swimming speed increases, buccal ventilation becomes intermittent and continuous ram ventilation occurs above 0.6-0.8 bls, which means that Polyodon is essentially an obligate ram ventilator under normal conditions.  Oxygen consumption (MO2), carbon dioxide production (MCO2), and the gas exchange ratio (R) were determined as a function of inspired PO2 during undisturbed swimming in still water at 25-degrees-C.  Oxygen consumption, buccal pressure, and swimming performance were also measured at set swimming speeds in a flow tank and small water tunnel.  Oxygen consumption at the preferred swimming speed of 1.25 bls was 6-7-mu-mol O2 . g-1 . h-1.  Carbon dioxide production was 3-4-mu-mol CO2 . g-1 . h-1, yielding an R of 0.5-1.0.  Paddlefishes are O2 regulators in mild hypoxia (150 down to 90 mmHg) but die quickly at PO2 <90 mmHg.  During steady swimming in normoxia, paddlefishes normally maintain 70%-80% of the maximum sustainable speed.  This results in a normal minimum metabolic rate that is about twice that of the minimum (resting) rate of other acipensiform fishes.  From a phylogenetic standpoint, other acipenseriforms also use ram ventilation, leading to the hypothesis that the evolutionary origin of a reliance on ram ventilation in Polyodon probably predates the origin of the filter feeding habit.  Constant swimming may be metabolically expensive, but it would appear to allow some energy to be conserved by ram ventilation.  This may be particularly advantageous for species such as P. spathula that combine filter feeding and ram ventilation.

AB This paper examines the ideology of growth in the context of local economic development activities in Flint, Michigan. The literature on urban political economies, which suggests that local communities can be best understood as "growth machines" directed by a "growth ideology," is examined first.  Then, Flint's growth ideology amid deindustrialization is explored through a case study of local economic development that pursued a costly and failed strategy based on tourism and tax abatement/infrastructure improvements.  Finally, scrutiny is brought to bear on the most recent suggestion that a centralized planning process will lead to an economic renewal in Flint, the conclusion is drawn that local growth ideology constrains the thinking of economic development decision-makers This ideological constraint inhibits consideration of progressive economic planning aimed at sustainable economic development strategies.

SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RESIDUES; CORN; SOIL
AB In agricultural systems where large amounts of crop residues are produced, there may exist possibilities for removing part of the residues for alternative uses without detrimental effects to agricultural productivity and the environment. A 4 year field study was conducted in central Texas to evaluate the effects of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) genotype, fertilizer N application rate and stover removal on crop yields and plant nutrient uptake and partitioning. Fertilizer N application rates of 112 kg ha-1 were generally sufficient to produce maximum yields, to attain the highest fertilizer N uptake efficiency and for the grain sorghum cultivars to achieve the highest percentage partitioning of N, P and K into grain. Quadratic relationships best described the relationship between fertilizer N application rate and the amounts of N, P and K taken up by grain and forage sorghum cultivars. A strong interdependence between fertilizer N application rate and stover return on nutrient cycling appeared to be developing in the cropping system under study. Stover removal adversely affected yields, nutrient uptake and partitioning during the last 2 study years. The interactive effects of sorghum genotype, fertilizer N and stover removal on yields and soil productivity need to be assessed over a longer term if stover removal is to be developed into an environmentally sound and sustainable production strategy.

TI FARMING SYSTEMS RESEARCH IN REMOTE AREAS IN NEPAL - THE NEED FOR A NEW
   APPROACH TO ON-FARM RESEARCH AND EXTENSION
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB On-farm research in remote areas demands methods that keep down costs and reduce the need for subsequent research and extension inputs and yet that still produce useful and sustainable recommendations. An important part of the process is to identify existing resource user groups and use them, rather than individual farmers, as a starting point for on-farm research. This approach is discussed in the context of farming systems research in the eastern hills of Nepal.

   POLLUTION; BUFFER STRIP RIPARIAN; GROUNDWATER QUALITY; DEEP-ROOTING
AB Research at the University of Iowa is testing the ECOLOTREE BUFFER(TM), a prototype wooded buffer strip planted between a creek and row-cropped land with roots grown intentionally deep enough to intersect the near-surface water table.  This project demonstrates that Populus spp. trees cultured by using this technique are both ecologically sustaining and productive.  Measured data prove that nitrate is removed from near-surface groundwater and that the nitrogen uptake is present as protein in the leaves and the woody stems.  The tree's physiological attributes contribute to a harvested value that can "pay its way"; these include fast wood growth, cut-stem rooting, resprouting from a stump, phreatophytic roots, and a high protein content in the leaves.  The wooded riparian strip changes the local agroecosystem by reducing fertilizer nutrients causing surface water, eutrophication, by diversifying wildlife habitat, by reducing soils erosion caused by wind and water, by diversifying the crop base, by creating an aesthetic addition in the landscape.  This idea is a potential technique for managing non-point source pollutants created by modern farming practices.

TI TRADEABLE EMISSION PERMITS AND THE CONTROL OF GREENHOUSE GASES
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article reiterates the case for tradeable permits as a global policy option for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, and considers the detailed design of a global tradeable-permit regime, emphasising the importance of the initial assignment of property rights, and arguing that the relevant property rights in this case are the rights of every member of the world community to share in a sustainable global atmosphere and climate. The allocation of permits should therefore be done on a per capita basis across the world community, with the result that rents generated by the process of reducing carbon emissions would accrue to non-polluters, most of whom live in the 'South'. The international transfers of income and wealth implied by the proposed scheme are large but feasible. There is therefore a real prospect that an international convention on carbon dioxide emissions could end the debt crisis and finance sustainable development in the South..

TI DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES OF VENTRICULAR-FIBRILLATION THRESHOLD AND
   SPONTANEOUS DEFIBRILLATION IN YOUNG-DOGS
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INFANT DEATH SYNDROME
AB This study was conducted to systematically investigate whether induction and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation in the canine heart, change with age during the early postnatal development. Forty-eight mongrel puppies from seven litters, were randomly selected for size and studied at weekly intervals from 1-6 weeks for determination of ventricular fibrillation threshold and incidence of spontaneous defibrillation. Another fourteen mongrel puppies 8-11 weeks old and 10 adult dogs were similarly studied.
   Ventricular fibrillation threshold increased progressively with age up to the eighth week (VFTmA=8.38+2.67wk-0.134.wk2, r=0.995) and thereafter reached a plateau, which was not significantly different from the ventricular fibrillation threshold of adult dogs (26.5 +/- 2.2 mA). In contrast, the high incidence of spontaneous defibrillation at early age decreased rapidly between second and fourth week and became, rare thereafter, (%SDF=281.e-0.60wk, r=0.94. This rapid drop could not be explained by the increase in mean body weight, which did not change significantly during this early period (BW(kg)=0.59.e0.23wk, r=0.97). Our findings suggest first ,that the vulnerability of the neonatal dog heart to electrical induction of ventricular. fibrillation decreases progressively during early age. Second, that spontaneous defibrillation decreases precipitously between the second and fourth week of age, a change not sufficiently explained by the modest body weight gain during that time. Thus, it appears that about the third week of age ventricular vulnerability to fibrillation and ability to defibrillation reach a critical point, where lethal arrythmias may become both inducible and sustainable, to result in death.

AB This paper analyses the effect of partial information on optimal policy design for stochastic macroeconomic models incorporating forward-looking expectations.  The main theoretical result is that reputational and nonreputational policies are certainty-equivalent, as has previously been conjectured, and it is also shown that the welfare loss does not necessarily increase with decreasing information.  Of particular additional interest in the analysis of reputational policy design is the issue of sustainability, and it is shown using an example that weak sustainability may be information-dependent.

AB Historical and recent estimates of the payoffs to agricultural research in the USA are presented.  The distribution of research benefits to producers and consumers, farms of different sizes, factors of production, and farms in different regions is discussed.  Implications of research for food safety and environmental sustainability are considered.  The results indicate continued high rates of return to agricultural research in the aggregate and for most commodity groups.  The commodity groups considered are cash grains, vegetables, fruits, other field crops, dairy, poultry, and other livestock.  Consumers, particularly low income consumers, are major beneficiaries of agricultural research.  Income differences between large and small farms tend to widen with agricultural research, and resources, particularly labor, are squeezed out of agriculture.  Agricultural research has an important role to play in designing technical and institutional solutions to food safety and environmental problems.

Using the supermarket retailing industry as an example, the existence of clearly defined group strategies is confirmed and those strategies are then interpreted for firm-level strategists interested in determining distinctive strategies for achieving long-run sustainable competitive advantages for individual firms. It is argued that the characteristics and dynamics of industries, strategic groups and firms must be analysed in an integrated manner in order to develop effective competitive strategies.

AB Changes in the consciousness of the consumers draw it nearer to public attention, how food is produced.  Within the increasing ecological development in agriculture the production of food of animal origin, considering the animal needs as well as the environmental conservation, is of great importance.  This development means a new challenge to the veterinarians.
   Ecological animal husbandry is signed by a self-restriction in input and by considering the specific production capacity of each farm.  Different examples from stock keeping, animal feeding and animal breeding demonstrate positive influences on a sustainable precaution to animal health by an ecological point of view.

DT Article
AB Four plant science departments of the two agricultural faculties at the Kassel University (Witzenhausen) have agreed in 1991 to establish a working group according to the Hessian law on Universities in view of the formation of a University institute for plant sciences at a later stage.  The mandates of the four departements carry on cereal and pulse agronomy, crop physiology with emphasis on tropical and subtropical field crops, plant nutrition and permanent tropical and subtropical crop production respectively.
   The mandate of the working group is to safeguard concerted teaching and research programmes among the participating departments.  Research emphasis is on renewable energy cropping, multipurpose crop utilization including tree - field crop integration, sustainability of production systems at high output levels, and multiple land resource use.
   The working group supports the establishment of a "Centre for Tropical Agriculture" at the intended unified agricultural faculty at Witzenhausen; the Centre is to safeguard and further enhance the international profile of this institution of higher learning.

DE CROPPING SYSTEMS; ON-FARM RESEARCH; WEED MANAGEMENT
AB Conventional strategies for developing component technologies are being challenged by the complexities of today's agricultural environment. The needs for support of adaptive research, for sufficient field sites to evaluate location specificity of technologies, and for testing components as parts of total farm systems are not easily met within the confines of the experiment station. On-farm research strategies involve the farmer and rancher in project design, field implementation, collection and evaluation of data, and interpretation of results. Farmer presentations in extension meetings and field tours involve these cooperators in the demonstration and technology sharing process. Farmers in Nebraska and Wisconsin have applied this process to research nitrogen levels in continuous and rotated cereals, the use of allelopathic chemicals from rye (Secale cereale L.) to reduce herbicide costs in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production, on other alternative weed management strategies, and strip cropping to reduce soil erosion and meet government program compliance requirements. Useful in a wide range of ecological and economic circumstances, participatory methods using farming systems research and extension strategies have global applications.

AB The widespread clamor for immediate draconian action to reduce the danger of global warming is an unjustifiable diversion of attention from the far more serious environmental problems facing developing countries. Resource constraints do not constitute limits to growth, and the likely economic damage done by climate change would be a negligible proportion of world output. The loss of welfare of the population in developing countries today as a result of inadequate access to safe drinking water and sanitation, or of urban air pollution, is far greater, and should be given priority over the interests of future generations. The "sustainable" growth concept is either morally indefensible or totally nonoperational.

LA English
DT Article
AB The food shortages, growing indebtedness and the appalling environmental crisis in sub-Saharan Africa cannot be understood in isolation from the strategies of development which African governments have followed since independence. While adjustment policies in the area of pricing, exchange rates, public sector reform and liberalization of markets are some of the essential ingredients of a balanced national strategy, conventional International Monetary Fund/World bank prescriptions have often resulted in negative social and ecological effects. These short-term policies, designed to improve commodity exports to generate foreign exchange, often conflict with long-term development needs. Scarce land, water, credit and technology are being preempted by the export sector while the needs of small farmers in the areas of soil conservation, reforestation and food security are ignored. For sustainable development to occur, there must be a fundamental reorientation of government policies and resources toward solving rural problems. Land reform, credit, improved extension, greater government accountability. and people's participation are important prerequisites if poor farmers are to succeed. Further, policy reform in sub-Saharan Africa needs to be backed by improved measures to compensate for shortfalls in commodity export earnings caused by factors outside their control. Finally, significant debt write offs by bilateral and multilateral agencies are a sine qua non if sub-Saharan Africa is to resume a steady path of development.

AB Macroeconomic and program policymakers are presently not well equipped with analytical methods for examining the environmental effects of their recommendations and actions. This paper proposes a framework for examining macropolicy effects on incentives and constraints in the environmental sector; and approach for adapting policy cost-benefit analysis to incorporate sustainability concerns. A simple model is constructed, and used to show how the environment may be incorporated as a sector of the macroeconomy. Aggregate demand policy, sectoral policy, and distributional issues are examined within the context of this simple model.

AB Urbanization, problems of the environment, and poverty have all grown dramatically over the past quarter century in many countries. We combine discussion of these three phenomena, using concepts of social class to make the connections. This, approach stresses the human element over matters of inanimate technology or nature. By disaggregating society into competing groups it reveals environmental problems to be essentially those of people and social and political organization, not of nature and technology. We conclude that improvement of the environment in large cities of the Third World will require social change.

ID PROSPECTS
AB This paper concentrates on what are perceived as critical issues which should be addressed if a productive and sustainable agriculture is to be achieved in Latin America. The attainment of such an agriculture is dependent on new technological innovations, policy changes and more socio-equitable economic schemes.
   By using several examples of biological control and integrated pest management programs as case studies, ways of promoting the transition of chemical intensive commercial agriculture to low-input management are explored. Similarly, the paper describes non-governmental efforts utilizing the agroecological approach to help the great mass of resource-poor farmers, mostly confined to marginal soils, hillsides and rainfed areas, to achieve year-round food self-sufficiency, reduce their reliance on scarce and expensive agricultural chemical inputs, and develop production systems that rebuild the productive capacities of their small holdings.

DT Article
AB Most agricultural regions of California enjoy long growing seasons, fertile soils and irrigation, all conditions that favor a highly diversified cropping. In addition. the wide variety of vegetables, field and tree crops determine a high diversity and flexibility of agricultural enterprises, Despite these factors, Californian agroecosystems are dominated by monocultural cropping systems. Although productive, these systems lack the ecological features to ensure efficient nutrient cycling, water and soil conservation, and biotic regulation. Productivity is subsidized with chemical inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers, some of which cause undesirable environmental and public health hazards. Large-scale monocultures are also highly susceptible to wind erosion and are dependent on ground water for irrigation, leading in some areas to a considerable 'overdraft'. In other regions, poor field drainage and rising water tables are leading to unacceptable soil salinity levels. In summary, Californian agriculture is very productive, but the environmental cost of such productivity is threatening the sustainability of agriculture.
   The search for self-sustaining, low-input, diversified and energy-efficient agricultural systems is now a major concern of researchers, farmers, policy makers and the public in California. The long tradition in biological pest control in California, as well as the experience of a number of organic farmers who developed low-input systems through 'trial and error', provide the building blocks for the search for a more sustainable agriculture.
   A key strategy in sustainable agriculture is to restore the agricultural diversity of the agricultural landscape. Diversity can be enhanced in time through crop rotations and sequences, and in space in the form of cover crops, intercropping, agroforestry crop/livestock mixtures, etc. Vegetation diversification not only results in pest regulation through restoration of natural controls, but also produces optimal nutrient recycling, energy conservation and less dependence on cultural inputs. In California, although this new approach to agriculture is actively researched, realistically it will work only if it is economically sensible and can be carried out within the constraints of a fairly normal agricultural system. Therefore, adoption of recommended diversification designs will proceed as these reduce costs and increase the efficiency and viability of farmers.

ID 17TH-CENTURY ORGANIC AGRICULTURE; JIAXING REGION; AGROECOSYSTEM
AB Agriculture in China has changed dramatically since the 1950s. The increase in agricultural production in China has been due largely to the enhanced use of hybrid seeds and fossil-energy-derived inputs such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This development has led to a noticeable shortage of major natural resources for agriculture and serious environmental degradation problems. The rapidly increasing population has placed major demands on Chinese agriculture. To meet those challenges, it has been necessary to develop more sustainable and productive agricultural systems. Among the ecological management practices that have been developed and that are now widely used in Chinese agriculture are: intercropping and multiple cropping; minimum tillage and conservation tillage; application of green manures and other organic fertilizers; water-saving cultivation techniques for rice and other crops; cultivation of common duckweed and/or fish in paddy rice fields; combined aquaculture and crop production systems; the development of various agroforestry systems; the integrated use of crop residues and other agricultural wastes for cultivating mushrooms, feeding animals and producing biogas. This paper briefly reviews these current practices in China. Some suggestions for the further development of a more sustainable and productive agriculture in China are discussed.

AB Although interest in organic farming in Canada has been growing, many obstacles to its development remain. The supply of produce is low and distribution systems are undeveloped. Consumer demand, however, appears to be strong, particularly in urban areas. The Federal Government and some provincial governments are beginning to examine how their policies and programs impede the transition to sustainable agriculture. Some programs dealing with transition, market development and certification have been developed to help facilitate the evolution of the organic sector. Also, some training programs in organic farming are now available, and research and development projects have started recently in several universities. A much more comprehensive package of institutional supports, however, will be required for these systems to develop in an orderly fashion and to realize their full potential.

TI THE QUEST FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE - THE CURRENT POSITION IN
   AUSTRALIA
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The primary production sector has contributed significantly to the growth of the Australian economy over the 200 years of European settlement. The farming systems that have developed utilise large areas of land, little labour and produce commodities for export, with pastoral farming systems accounting for more than half of all land farmed. Productivity increases were accompanied by a decline in the quality of the environment, particularly land degradation through non-sustainable farming practices. Several programs directed at sustainable resource management have been installed by the government. Organic farming is increasing rapidly and, at present, the demand for organic produce exceeds the supply. While farming techniques for sustainable systems have been developed through research, the adoption of such techniques by farmers has been slow. Community participation through landcare and catchment management groups in collaborative research and extension activities is being promoted throughout the country. Attitudes towards the land and awareness of environmental issues are changing in rural and urban communities. Innovative approaches are required to facilitate the learning needs of the people and to promote co-operation between landholders, researchers and extension workers. Systemic action research is an alternative paradigm for working with people towards a more sustainable agriculture in Australia.

ID GROUNDWATER
AB In the north central and northeastern regions of the USA, considerable research and extension work is now being directed toward developing farming methods and whole farming systems that can reduce production costs, soil erosion and pollution by agrichemicals. These efforts have been termed low-input/sustainable agriculture (LISA) and emphasize greater use of legume-based crop rotations, animal and green manures, integrated crop/livestock enterprises, biological pest controls, mechanical control of weeds, and soil and water conservation practices. LISA activities involve most of the important crop and livestock products of each region. Farmers and non-governmental organizations have been key participants in shaping and implementing new research and extension efforts through methods that include on-farm research and demonstrations. Many land grant universities are conducting experiments to aid the transition away from chemical- and capital-intensive farming methods, and are initiating closer ties with farmers interested in or already practicing LISA methods. New curricula are being developed for student and farmer training in LISA approaches. Future research and extension efforts for LISA should make better use of ecological theory; place more emphasis on topics that involve long-term research such as agroforestry systems, crop and livestock breeding, yield-enhancing crop rotation effects and biological pest control; and more fully examine the relationships between ecologically sustainable farming methods and socioeconomic structure.

DT Article
ID RESOURCE-BASED THEORY; STRATEGY FORMULATION; FIRM; INDUSTRY; MARKETS
AB Through strategy, a company seeks to sustain its competitive advantage.  Yet only recently has the study of strategy begun to examine how long a specific advantage can be sustained.  Based on a study of sustainability patterns in a number of industries, this article shows how the competitive pressures associated with product imitation can be predicted by identifying the core capabilities, or isolating mechanisms, that lie at the heart of a company's advantage.  A number of these dynamic core capabilities are classified according to how fast they are duplicated.  The imitation of capabilities shapes many strategic decisions in companies, indeed the distinctive character of companies, and that by thinking in these terms managers enhance their company's cohesiveness and responsiveness as they pursue their strategic mission in global markets.

TI WORK CAPACITY AND CARDIOPULMONARY ADAPTATION OF THE OBESE SUBJECT DURING

ID ANAEROBIC THRESHOLD
AB Twelve obese patients (six male subjects) aged 17 to 42 years with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 and 12 normal subjects (six male subjects) aged 19 to 39 years with a mean BMI of 22 kg/m2 underwent a cycloergometric test until exhaustion to assess work capacity and cardiopulmonary adaptations of the two groups. Minute ventilation, expiratory gas concentrations, and heart rate, together with anaerobic threshold (AT) were determined in each subject during the test. The same subjects were then submitted to normocapnic hyperpnea at rest to assess the oxygen cost of breathing. We found that in the obese patients, the maximal sustainable work rate was not different from that of controls (120 vs 136 W) while AT was significantly lower (78 vs 110 W). Nevertheless, there was no difference in maximum V(O2) and in V(O2) at AT levels (expressed in milliliters per minute) indicating that cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, and muscle performance did not differ from obese to normal subjects. Greater muscular effort was needed by obese patients when moving their heavier legs and less when doing external work with a decreased gross mechanical efficiency and an identical net mechanical efficiency between the two groups.

TI NATURAL CAPITAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A minimum necessary condition for sustainability is the maintenance of the total natural capital stock at or above the current level.  While a lower stock of natural capital may be sustainable, society can allow no further decline in natural capital given the large uncertainty and the dire consequences of guessing wrong.  This "constancy of total natural capital" rule can thus be seen as a prudent minimum condition for assuring sustainability, to be relaxed only when solid evidence can be offered that it is safe to do so.
   We discuss methodological issues concerning the degree of substitutability of manufactured for natural capital, quantifying ecosystem services and natural capital, and the role of the discount rate in valuing natural capital.  We differentiate the concepts of growth (material increase in size) and development (improvement in organization without size change).  Given these definitions, growth cannot be sustainable indefinitely on a finite planet.  Development may be sustainable, but even this aspect of change may have some limits.  One problem is that current measures of economic well-being at the macro level (i.e., the Gross National Product) measure mainly growth, or at best conflate growth and development.  This urgently requires revision.
   Finally, we suggest some principles of sustainable development and describe why maintaining natural capital stocks is a prudent and achievable policy for insuring sustainable development.  There is disagreement between technological optimists (who see technical progress as eliminating all resource constraints to growth and development) and technological skeptics (who do not see as much scope for this approach and fear irreversible use of resources and damage to natural capital).  By maintaining natural capital stocks (preferably by using a natural capital depletion tax), we can satisfy both the skeptics (since resources will be conserved for future generations) and the optimists (since this will raise the price of natural capital depletion and more rapidly induce the technical change they predict).

TI COMPETITION FOR A FOREST PALM - USE OF PHOENIX-RECLINATA BY HUMAN AND
   NONHUMAN-PRIMATES
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The palm, Phoenix reclinata, is heavily exploited by people of the Tana River District of northeastern Kenya and provides an important food source for an endangered forest primate, the Tana River crested mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus galeritus).  Humans use all parts of the palm; preferential harvesting of the reproductive size classes may affect the palm's population structure, and excessive leaf removal may influence reproduction.  Phoenix reclinata accounts for up to 62% of the monthly diet of the mangabey.  Mangabeys rely heavily on the fruits and seeds of P. reclinata when other fruits are unavailable; therefore, the elimination of palms and the reduction of fruit production degrade the mangabey's habitat.  Human exploitation of P. reclinata may not be sustainable.  Regulated harvesting outside protected areas and cessation of harvesting within protected areas are necessary to provide benefits to both the humans and the endangered Tana River crested mangabey.

SO CRITICAL REVIEW

AB The virtue of internalizing environmental costs so that prices reflect full social opportunity costs at the margin, reaffirmed by Terry Anderson and Donald Leal, is unarguable. Beyond that, however, Anderson and Leal's Free Market Environmentalism neglects the classic works in the intellectual tradition to which it is supposed to be a contribution; is unconvincing and inconsistent in the functions it ascribes to the ''environmental entrepreneur''; conflates problems of distribution and scale with the problem of allocation; ignores international dimensions; and misrepresents the debate over ''sustainable development.''

LA English

DE ENERGY INVESTMENTS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB Energy investments imply changes in the physical, social, and economic environment.  Hence; both the short-term and the long-term costs and benefits of these investments must be taken into account.  These changes may affect not only the immediate environment of the investment site but may extend geographically far beyond national borders as well as beyond the lifetimes of the people for whom the investments are intended.  This paper reviews the issues relevant to developing countries.  General conceptual and policies issues are discussed.  Issues about the measurement of costs and benefits (including issues of 'sustainability' and the internalization of externalities resulting from environmental changes) as well as the role of opportunity costs in deciding a country's energy investment strategies are raised.  The macroeconomic and institutional issues relevant to environmental impacts that might be incorporated in energy planning are suggested.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF AQUARIUM-FISH COLLECTION IN THE MALDIVES,
   WITH PROPOSALS FOR REGULATION
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Export of aquarium-fish from the Maldives began in 1980 and in 1989 almost 54,000 marine fishes, worth approximately US$ 130,000, were exported. The collection of aquarium species is confined to a relatively small area around the capital island, Male. Estimates of annual exports of 95 species were obtained by examining packing-lists held by Maldivian Customs. In parallel, the population densities of about 70 aquarium-fish species were estimated by visual assessment. Using a number of assumptions, potential (maximum sustainable) yields for 65 of these species - those for which export data were available - were estimated for the area (530 km2) within a 13-km radius (one hour's journey by local boat) of Male.
   For 27 species there were some reasons for concern about the levels of exploitation, although only 12 of these species appeared to be 'at risk' in 1986 (the year of highest exploitation). If the assumptions made in estimating potential sustainable yields were valid, these 12 aquarium-fish species were being overexploited or exploited at levels close to maximum sustainable yields. Should the trade expand threefold, a further 12 species are considered to be potentially at risk of overexploitation. Two species of butterflyfish, Chaetodon meyeri and C. triangulum, which feed exclusively on coral polyps and generally die in captivity after a short time, were being exported in significant numbers. Both clownfishes (Amphiprion spp.) and their host sea-anemones were being heavily exploited. Because of the symbiotic relationship between these fishes and their anemone homes, this group may be particularly susceptible to overexploitation.
   Damage to branching corals may result from the collection of specimens of Dascyllus aruanus, which shelter within them. With many thousands of individuals of this species being exported each year, this could represent considerable collateral coral damage. Although levels of exploitation of 'cleaner wrasses' (Labroides bicolor and L. dimidiatus) appear well below potentially sustainable ones, it is unclear whether the health of reef fishes might locally be adversely affected in heavily exploited areas.
   Monitoring and regulation of the aquarium-fish trade is discussed, together with the need for collection of catch statistics by those involved in the trade. The importance of regulation of collection techniques, of standards of facilities, and of satisfactory packaging of fish for export, is stressed. If more accurate estimates of sustainable yields are to be obtained, there needs to be monitoring of populations of key aquarium-fish species in designated collecting areas where exploitation levels are known. Until such estimates become available, the cautious approach adopted in the Maldives to estimate yields and set species-based quotas will, it is hoped, prevent local overexploitation.

TI CHANGE IN A PETRIFIED FOREST AND IMPLICATIONS TOWARDS MANAGEMENT

DE PETRIFIED FOREST; CONSERVATION; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The Gallatin Petrified Forest of Montana, USA, is a unique resource.  The extensive area of the fossil forests, the numerous petrified trees in upright positions, and the large number of vertical layers of "successive" forests are unparalleled in the world.  Collection by permit is permitted, but damage to the petrified forest by indiscriminate collection occurs.  To assess the impact, a comparative examination of replicate (over 13 yr) photography of selected specimens was undertaken.  The amount of change over time, the possible cause of change, and the relationship of the location of the specimen to that amount of change were determined.  It was found that although considerable loss continues, impacts prior to a 1973 collection policy were most severe.  There was more loss by natural erosion than by collection, but the collections are additive to the natural changes.  Size of petrified outcrops and the steepness of the slope on which they were found did correlate with the amount of natural change occurring over time.  Human-induced change was associated with the distance of the outcrops from the main trailheads and the specimen size.  This method provides a tool with which to monitor impacts and develop a future policy aimed towards conservation of a unique resource in light of the need for appreciative recreation and some specimen collection.  Recommended changes in present management policy are provided.

AB Sustainable development may mean different things to people with different worldviews. We sketch four worldviews, drawing on a schema developed by Bryan Norton. Of these four worldviews, i.e. exploitist, utilitist. integrist and inherentist, the third is the most consistent with the Brundtland Report (WCED 1987)and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA 1987).
   The integrist perspective combines analytic reductionistic study with comparative contextual study, with emphasis on the latter. This integrative approach moves from over-reliance on utilist information services such as impact assessment towards transactive study. Our own compromise emphasizes a stress-response approach to a partial understanding of complex cultural-natural interactions within ecosystems. Both cultural and natural attributes of ecosystems must be addressed.
   Currently the federal Canadian government tends toward an exploitist worldview; current government R&D funding and subsidies reflect this view. Old-fashioned scientists who rely on a monocular analytical vision of the world's minutiae may find contextual historical study offensive: these scientists hold sway on some advisory boards and hence research funding. Difficulty in finding funding for integrist information services should not be interpreted as a lack of need for this information; rather this difficulty results from resistance to a changing worldview.

TI RATES OF WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION
SO GEODERMA
LA English
DT Article
AB A new method for evaluation of rates of weathering and soil formation is proposed.  For the elements derived exclusively from rocks, geochemical mass balances were assumed to exist between parent rocks, soils and river waters on both global and regional scales.  Seven geochemical mass balance equations, which include the rate of weathering and soil formation as unknown quantities, were set up using the mean contents of seven major elements (Al, Fe, Ca, K, Mg, Na, and Si) in the earth's crust, soils and river waters, respectively.  Solutions of 21 sets of simultaneous equations made from the seven equations gave 21 sets of values of rates of rock weathering and soil formation.  Reliability of the results were checked by the criterion that the rate of rock weathering is higher than that of soil formation and both of them have to be positive values.  The ranges of results which satisfied the criterion were 520-1310 (mean = 1100) kg ha-1 yr-1 for the rate of rock weathering and 370-1290 (mean = 700) kg ha-1 yr-1 for the rate of soil formation on a global scale.  The comparison with the reported value of the mean rate of erosion, 906 kg ha-1 yr-1, suggested that the results of the calculations were reliable.
   By applying this method, we could calculate the annual rate of soil formation not only on a global scale but also on a regional scale.  Some regional examples in small watersheds were tested.  The rate of soil formation was 569 kg ha-1 yr-1 in Hubbard Brook watershed, New Hampshire, USA and 2700-5700 kg ha-1 yr-1 in Iu river watersheds in southwestern Japan.
   The rates of weathering and soil formation in watersheds are basic items of information for establishing sustainable watershed management practices to protect soil from degradation, to control desertification, and to minimize the effects of acid precipitation.

DE ST-HELENA; ECONOMIC DEPENDENCY; ISLANDS; COLONIES
AB The island of St Helena is more prosperous than other tropical Atlantic islands, but this prosperity is more a mark of the Aid it receives from its colonial power than any indigenous economic strength.  A number of problems with the economic and social situation on St Helena were identified in the early 1980s and, whilst many of these issues have been addressed since, the economy remains Aid-dependent and the population is still rather unambitious and seems not to have developed the enterprise looked for at that time.  The latest National Development Plan seeks to encourage enterprise by better use of island resources leading, it is hoped, to sustainable improvements in living standards and reduced dependence on its colonial power, the United Kingdom.  The paper also sets St Helena into a wider context of contemporary colonialism.

TI SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE - IMPLICATIONS
   OF A CHANGING AGENDA
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Much of the discussion of global environmental change has ignored the potential of human agency, which is essential to sustainable development.  Environmental policy has been slow to recognize that until a new sense of urgency is injected into the policy agenda the developed world is unlikely to pay serious attention to renewable sources of energy.  Human behaviour affects global environmental change in a variety of ways.  Social institutions, including those of the economy, mediate between the natural environment and social and economic outcomes.  It follows that we need to be prepared, now, to enlist people in alternative, more sustainable development agendas and to use their knowledge.  The tortuous road to greater global responsibility for environmental change will not, ultimately, be built on the uncertain predictions of natural scientists.  Rather, it is likely to be built on the daily lives of human subjects, and the recognition that these lives involve choices of global proportions.

AB In this paper I examine the complexity of human forces involved in tree cutting in a Ghanaian forest region. I provide evidence to link the indiscriminate tree-cutting activities of some local communities to the gradual loss of communal control over land and the replacement of kin group control with state property regimes. I point to the interrelated factors of the state's promotion of an export-led development strategy, the intensification of agricultural commercialization, and household and group variations in access to land as all having deleterious impacts on local traditions of sustainable forestry.

TI THE QUALITY-OF-LIFE - WHAT QUALITY - WHOSE LIFE
SO INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB The increasing rate at which changes in human life are occurring has important consequences for the environment and the carrying capacity of the Earth. The industrial revolution has brought greatly increased wealth to one-quarter of the population and also severe inequality. Pollution and accelerating energy consumption have already affected the equilibria of the Earth's land masses, oceans and atmosphere; particularly important is the loss in biodiversity. All these factors are potential causes of political and environmental instability. A solution must encompass increased awareness and different modes of thought and behaviour; improved education; interdisciplinary action; and the promotion of a values system enshrining the principle of sustainability over generations. Quality of life must be viewed in two perspectives: that of all human beings in a global society; and that of the countless other lifeforms on whom we unwittingly depend.

AB This article examines the concept of sustainable competitive advantage in the context of two theoretical frameworks:  environmental determinism (which encompasses microeconomic and industrial organization traditions) and "strategic selection" (which incorporates Schumpeterian economic and strategic choice perspectives).  It is argued that by ascribing competitive advantage to industry/market imperatives, the I/O-based model apparently overlooks the idiosyncratic competencies that potentially generate a sustainable competitive advantage for the firm.  An alternative conceptualization of sustainable competitive advantage from a resource-based perspective is offered.  Specifically, a systems model that integrally links four components of a firm's "distinctive competencies" (managerial competencies and strategic focus, resource-based, transformation-based, and output-based competencies) is proposed.

AB 1. Peak isometric force of single fast (type 1) and slow (type 3) muscle fibres of Xenopus decreased when fibres were stimulated intermittently above their predicted sustainable duty cycle at 20-degrees-C. Type 1 fibres could be fatigued to zero force. In most type 3 fibres force did not decrease below 50% of the original (P0) before activation failure, as indicated by irregular contractions.
   2. Fibres were rapidly frozen at different force levels and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for ATP, IMP, phosphocreatine (PCr) and creatine (Cr). Lactate was determined enzymatically in type 1 fibres only. The relationships between force and PCr, and between force and ATP during fatigue were, apart from the range of values obtained, the same for both fibre types. When force had fallen to about 60-80% of original, PCr was fully reduced. At lower force levels, the ATP content decreased, and a concomitant rise of IMP content was found. At zero force, ATP had fallen to about 25% of its value in rested type 1 fibres, and up to 200-mu-mol lactate (g dry weight)-1 had accumulated.
   3. Recovery from fatigue was studied in fibres where force had fallen to 0.6 P0 (both fibre types) and 0.2 P0 (type 1 only). After 1 h of recovery ATP had in all cases returned to the level measured in rested fibres. In fibres fatigued to 0.6 P0, force almost returned to its original value. However, in type 1 fibres fatigued to 0.2 P0, it returned to only 0.3 P0. After 1 h of recovery the PCr/Cr ratio in type 1 fibres was lower (probability, P < 0.05) than in control fibres, whereas in type 3 fibres it was not significantly different from controls.
   4. The relationship between peak force and stimulus frequency, which had a sigmoid shape in fully rested fibres, was drastically changed by fatiguing stimulation. Immediately after fatiguing stimulation of type 1 fibres, force hardly increased with stimulus frequency, corresponding to the observation that calcium efflux from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was decreased at high stimulus frequencies. The force-frequency relationship of type 3 fibres was the same before and after intermittent stimulation.

AB A very positive future is forecast for the battery manufacturing industry in Asia, and for the further development of sustainable and profitable long-term markets. In detail, it is argued that the lead/acid battery has a longer and more promising future than its detractors would like others to believe; that the supply of lead will remain fairly stable in both quantity and price; and that the regulatory and environmental pressures in other parts of the world can be turned to favour Asian manufacture, and to increase the global market share of the region.

AB Many companies are prepared to make considerable investments in developing technologies to support sustainable competitive advantages.  Yet translating technological capability into business opportunities remains a difficult problem.  Frank Lynn and Susan Heintz report their experiences with a three-level technology screening process, starting with a needs screen, moving to an economics screen and ending with a time screen.  The screening process is designed to emphasize the importance of identifying realistic market opportunities and it also helps to define a product roll-out timetable.

TI SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE - A VALID ALTERNATIVE
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The concepts of sustainable agriculture have been much debated in recent years. The emphasis in this paper is on alternative farming practices that optimize on-farm techniques to control pests and satisfy nutrient requirements; and that address broader ecological and societal goals. This contribution focuses on the economic findings and barriers to adopting sustainable farming practices in the USA. These issues are of major concern to policymakers, agribusiness and producers. Shifts are occuring in American agriculture, but major adjustments in farming practices will not occur until farm policy is changed and economic, environmental, and social goals are fully incorporated into the accounting framework.

TI STRATEGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE CROP PRODUCTION IN SEMIARID AFRICA
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB This is a record of the experience of a research team attempting to identify a development path for a farming system in semi-arid Africa. The farming system is the largely-subsistence production of crops and livestock by smallholders in the Machakos and Kitui Districts in Eastern Kenya. The region is known locally as Ukambani- "the place where the Kamba people live". This region has a long history in which the food demands of rapidly growing populations have periodically outstripped the productive capacity of the land and current technology. Today, the population pressure on land and its rate of growth are among the highest in the world, and emigration is no longer a feasible solution. But numerous other areas of Africa are not far behind in population pressures and a more sustainable agriculture in this region is important not only for Kenya. Almost certainly, the problems of agriculture in Machakos-Kitui today represent a future scenario for much of semi-arid Africa.
   This article is also concerned with methodology for conducting research on farming systems. While the project was designed according to the concepts of Farming Systems Research (FSR) (Collinson, 1982), the realities of development assistance projects created challenges in implementation. The research also departed from the conventional FSR plan as new possibilities were realized, and with great benefit.
   The outcome is a well-founded hypothesis: contrary to much contemporary wisdom, a strategy of augmenting traditional soil enrichment practices with modest amounts of fertilizer is economically feasible for many farmers and provides the best prospects for food security and sustainable agriculture in this climatic zone.

TI INTEGRATED FARMING - AN ECOLOGICAL FARMING APPROACH IN EUROPEAN
   AGRICULTURE
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL
AB European agriculture operates in challenging times as it faces uncertainties arising from economic, political, environmental and other pressures. In the arable sector, there are serious problems associated with overproduction and declining farm incomes as well as concerns about species decline and the pollution of ground and surface waters by agrochemicals. Such issues are forcing a fundamental re-orientation in agriculture. An Integrated Farming System (IFS) is identified as a most promising approach. It integrates natural regulatory components into farming activities with the aim of replacing purchased off-farm inputs, whilst maintaining farm income. Farm-scale trials across Europe indicate positive benefits of IFS. Yield potential does not deteriorate, agrochemical inputs are reduced and several agroecosystem components are enhanced without losses in financial returns. This paper discusses developments in IFS, together with possible technology transfer systems, in the context of the new, environmentally-orientated CEC-agropolicy to achieve sustainable agriculture in Europe.

DT Article
ID LOCOMOTION; SQUID
AB This study assesses swimming potential in a variety of ammonoid shell shapes on the basis of coefficients of drag (Cd) and the power needed to maintain a constant velocity. Reynolds numbers (Re) relevant to swimming ammonoids, and lower than those previously studied, were examined. Power consumption was scaled to a range of sizes and swimming velocities. Estimates of power available derived from studies of oxygen consumption in modern cephalopods and fish were used to calculate maximum sustainable swimming velocities (MSV).
   Laterally compressed, small thickness ratio (t. r.) ammonoids, previously assumed to be the most efficient swimmers, do not experience the lowest drag or power consumption at all sizes and velocities. At low values of size and velocity associated with Reynolds numbers below 10(4), less compressed forms have smaller drag coefficients and reduced power requirements. At hatching a roughly spherical shell shape would have minimized drag in ammonoids; with increasing size, hydrodynamic optima shift toward compressed morphologies.
   The high energetic cost of ammonoid locomotion may have limited dispersal and excluded ammonoids from high current velocity environments.

AB The economic and environmental costs of the heavy use of chemical N fertilizers in agriculture are a global concern. Sustainability considerations mandate that alternatives to N fertilizers must be urgently sought. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), a microbiological process which converts atmospheric nitrogen into a plant-usable form, offers this alternative. Nitrogen-fixing systems offer an economically attractive and ecologically sound means of reducing external inputs and improving internal resources. Symbiotic systems such as that of legumes and Rhizobium can be a major source of N in most cropping systems and that of Azolla and Anabaena can be of particular value to flooded rice crop. Nitrogen fixation by associative and free-living microorganisms can also be important. However, scientific and socio-cultural constraints limit the utilization of BNF systems in agriculture. While several environmental factors that affect BNF have been studied, uncertainties still remain on how organisms respond to a given situation. In the case of legumes, ecological models that predict the likelihood and the magnitude of response to rhizobial inoculation are now becoming available. Molecular biology has made it possible to introduce choice attributes into nitrogen-fixing organisms but limited knowledge on how they interact with the environment makes it difficult to tailor organisms to order. The difficulty in detecting introduced organisms in the field is still a major obstacle to assessing the success or failure of inoculation. Production-level problems and socio-cultural factors also limit the integration of BNF systems into actual farming situations. Maximum benefit can be realized only through analysis and resolution of major constraints to BNF performance in the field and adoption and use of the technology by farmers.

AB This paper summarizes recent achievements in exploiting new biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) systems in rice fields, improving their management, and integrating them into rice farming systems. The inoculation of cyanobacteria has been long recommended, but its effect is erratic and unpredictable. Azolla has a long history of use as a green manure, but a number of biological constraints limited its use in tropical Asia. To overcome these constraints, the Azolla-Anabaena system as well as the growing methods were improved. Hybrids between A. microphylla and A. filiculoides (male) produced higher annual biomass than either parent. When Anabaena from high temperature-tolerant A. microphylla was transferred to Anabaena-free A. filiculoides, A. filiculoides became tolerant of high temperature. Azolla can have multiple purposes in addition to being a N source. An integrated Azolla-fish-rice system developed in Fujian, China, could increase farmers' income, reduce expenses, and increase ecological stability. A study using Azolla labeled with N-15 showed the reduction of N losses by fish uptake of N. The Azolla mat could also reduce losses of urea N by lowering floodwater-pH and storing a part of applied N in Azolla. Agronomically useful aquatic legumes have been explored within Sesbania and Aeschynomene. S. rostrata can accumulate more than 100 kg N ha-1 in 45 d. Its N2 fixation by stem nodules is more tolerant of mineral N than that by root nodules, but the flowering of S. rostrata is sensitive to photoperiod. Aquatic legumes can be used in rainfed rice fields as N scavengers and N2 fixers. The general principle of integrated uses of BNF in rice-farming systems is shown.

AB The importance of soybean as a source of oil and protein, and its ability to grow symbiotically on low-N soils, point to its continued status as the most valuable grain legume in the world. With limited new land on which to expand, and emphasis on sustainable systems, increases in soybean production will come mostly from increased yield per unit area. Improvements in biological nitrogen fixation can help achieve increased soybean production, and this chapter discusses research and production strategies for such improvement.
   The soybean-Bradyrhizobium symbiosis can fix about 300 kg N ha-1 under good conditions. The factors which control the amount of N fixed include available soil N, genetic determinants of compatibility in both symbiotic partners and lack of other yield-limiting factors. Response to inoculation is controlled by the level of indigenous. competing bradyrhizobia, the N demand and yield potential of the host, and N availability in the soil.
   Research efforts to improve BNF are being applied to both microbe and soybean. While selection continues for effective, naturally occurring bradyrhizobia for inoculants and the use of improved inoculation techniques, genetic research on bradyrhizobia to improve effectiveness and competitiveness is advancing. Selection, mutagenesis and breeding of the host have focused on supernodulation, restricted nodulation of indigenous B. japonicum, and promiscuous nodulation with strains of bradyrhizobia from the 'cowpea' cross-inoculation group. The research from the host side appears closer to being ready for practical use in the field.
   Existing knowledge and technology still has much to offer in improving biological nitrogen fixation in soybean. The use of high-quality inoculants, and education about their benefits and use can still make a significant contribution in many countries. The importance of using the best adapted soybean genotype with a fully compatible inoculant cannot be overlooked, and we need to address other crop management factors which influence yield potential and N demand, indirectly influencing nitrogen fixation. The implementation of proven approaches for improving nitrogen fixation in existing soybean production demands equal attention as received by research endeavours to make future improvements.

AB Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in mixed legume/grass pastures is reviewed along with the importance of transfer of fixed nitrogen (N) to associated grasses. Estimates of BNF depend on the method of measurement and some of the advantages and limitations of the main methods are outlined. The amounts of N fixed from atmospheric N2 in legume/grass pastures throughout the world is summarised and range from 13 to 682 kg N ha-1 yr-1. The corresponding range for grazed pastures, which have been assessed for white clover pastures only, is 55 to 296 kg N ha-1 yr-1.
   Biological nitrogen fixation by legumes in mixed pastures is influenced by three primary factors; legume persistence and production, soil N status, and competition with the associated grass(es). These factors and the interactions between them are discussed. Legume persistence, production and BNF is also influenced by many factors and this review centres on the important effects of soil moisture status, soil acidity, nutrition, and pests and disease.
   Soil N status interacts directly with BNF in the short and long term. In the short-term, increases in soil inorganic N occurs during dry conditions and where N fertiliser is used, and these will reduce BNF. In the long-term, BNF leads to accumulation of soil N, grass dominance, and reduced BNF. However, cyclical patterns of legume and grass dominance can occur due, at least in part, to temporal changes in plant-available N levels in soil. Thus, there is a dynamic relationship between legumes and grasses whereby uptake of soil N by grass reduces the inhibitory effect of soil N on BNF and competition by grasses reduces legume production and BNF. Factors affecting the competition between legumes and grasses are considered including grass species, grazing animals, and grazing or cutting management.
   Some fixed N is transferred from legumes to associated grasses. The amount of N transferred 'below-ground', predominantly through decomposition of legume roots and nodules, has been estimated at 3 to 102 kg N ha-1 yr-1 or 2 to 26% of BNF. In grazed pasture, N is also transferred 'above-ground' via return in animal excreta and this can be of a similar magnitude to 'below-ground' transfer.
   Increased BNF in mixed legume/grass pastures is being obtained through selection or breeding of legumes for increased productivity and/or to minimise effects of nutrient limitations, low soil moisture, soil acidity, and pests and disease. Ultimately, this will reduce the need to modify the pasture environment and increase the role of legumes in low-input, sustainable agriculture.

DE BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN FIXATION (BNF); CEREAL, DRY MATTER PRODUCTION;
   LEGUME; MIXED CROPPING; N TRANSFER; SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB Cereal/legume intercropping increases dry matter production and grain yield more than their monocultures. When fertilizer N is limited, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the major source of N in legume-cereal mixed cropping systems. The soil N use patterns of component crops depend on the N source and legume species. Nitrogen transfer from legume to cereal increases the cropping system's yield and efficiency of N use. The use of nitrate-tolerant legumes, whose BNF is thought to be little affected by application of combined N, may increase the quantity of N available for the cereal component. The distance between the cereal and legume root systems is important because N id transferred through the intermingling of root systems. Consequently, the most effective planting distance varies with type of legume and cereal. Mutual shading by component crops, especially the taller cereals, reduces BNF and yield of the associated legume. Light interception by the legume can be improved by selecting a suitable plant type and architecture. Planting pattern and population at which maximum yield is achieved also vary among component species and environments. Crops can be mixed in different proportions from additive to replacement or substitution mixtures. At an ideal population ratio a semi-additive mixture may produce higher gross returns.

AB The integration of trees. especially nitrogen fixing trees (NFTs), into agroforestry and silvo-pastoral systems can make a major contribution to sustainable agriculture by restoring and maintaining soil fertility, and in combating erosion and desertification as well as providing fuelwood. The particular advantage of NFTs is their biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), their ability to establish in nitrogen-deficient soils and the benefits of the nitrogen fixed (and extra organic matter) to succeeding or associated crops.
   The importance of NFTs leads to the question of how we can maximise or optimize their effects and how we can manage BNF and the transfer of nitrogen to associated or succeeding plantings. To be able to achieve these goals. suitable methods of measuring BNF in trees are necessary. The total nitrogen difference (TND) method is simple, but is better suited for low than high soil N conditions. The acetylene  reduction assay (ARA), although sensitive and simple, has many technical limitations especially for NFTs, and the estimates of BNF have generally been very low, compared to other methods. For NFTs, the N-15 techniques are still under development, but have already given some promising results (e.g., has been used to measure large genetic variability in BNF within different NFTs).
   Various  factors affect BNF in trees. They include the age of trees, the microbial component. soil moisture,  temperature, salinity, pH, soil N level and plant nutrient deficiencies. Some of the factors, e.g. temperature. affect the symbiosis more than plant growth, and differences in the effects of these factors on BNF in different NFT genotypes have been reported. These factors and research needs for improving BNF in trees are discussed.

AB This paper seeks to go beyond the sui generis conception of the increased role of "green" forces and the concomitant environmentalization of institutional practices in the United States and elsewhere across the world. It is argued that these forces must be located in the transition from social-democratic to neo-conservative regimes of social regulation of economy and society that has occurred during the past 15 or so years of global economic stagnation. This transition and its reflection in greening and environmentalization may be seen to have contradictory implications for rural societies. These implications are explored briefly with respect to sustainable development programs in the developing countries, sustainable agricultural research and outreach in the United States, and the possible growth of environmental symbolization of rural spaces.

DT Article
AB Despite its small human population and great size - over two-thirds the area of Australia - the Australian arid zone has lost more mammalian species than any comparable area in the world. Such a high extinction rate is a sure indicator that the land is not being used sustainably. Here Stephen Morton and Geoff Pickup review the requirements for better long-term management of the quintessential Australian landscape.

TI IS PAYING FOR HEALTH-CARE CULTURALLY ACCEPTABLE IN SUB-SAHARA AFRICA -
   MONEY AND TRADITION
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE; MONEY; BAMAKO INITIATIVE; AFRICA
ID BAMAKO
AB In 1987 UNICEF launched the so-called Bamako Initiative, which has as its main objective to improve the sustainability of primary health care in Africa by making people pay for it.  The question is raised whether paying for health care is culturally acceptable in African communities.  The author argues that 'money' is not a new phenomenon in Africa and that paying for goods and services does not need to conflict with existing traditions of reciprocity in the field of health care.  Money is an artifact which is culturally incorporated in a creative manner to satisfy specific needs.  Cultural objections to paying for health care, therefore, are unlikely to exist, but how payment should be realised in an effective and just way is another question.

TI IMPACT OF SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES ON STERILIZATION SERVICES IN
   LATIN-AMERICA
SO STUDIES IN FAMILY PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB The Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception retrospectively examined the impact of funding decreases on access to sterilization services at 20 nongovernmental family planning clinics in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Brazil. Clinic staff were asked questions about client fees, caseloads, availability of comparable low-cost or free services nearby, cost-recovery activities, and the socioeconomic profile of clients before, during the time, and after subsidies were lowered or eliminated. Funding reductions were followed by decreased caseloads at 14 of the 20 sites studied. Of the six others, four experienced an increase in caseloads, one saw no perceptible change, and one experienced a decrease only as a result of management policy to cut the caseload to improve quality. The most common response to the decrease in funding (shared by 17 sites) was an increase in client fees. In all but three of the 17 clinics, the increase in fees was met with a decline in caseloads. Moreover, at nine of these 17 sites, the fee increase effected a change in client mix; anecdotal evidence suggests that more middle-income and fewer lower-income clients were using sterilization services. Four lessons can be drawn from this study: Donors need to plan funding phase-outs carefully, in conjunction with grantees; grantees need to assess the costs of the procedure realistically, and assign fees accordingly; management needs to seek alternative funding sources in lieu of, or in addition to, increasing fees; and caseloads can be increased and costs recovered by diversifying services.

TI COMPETITIVE REGIMES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN BUS INDUSTRY - THEORY AND
   PRACTICE
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONTESTABILITY; DEREGULATION
AB There seems to be a general move within Europe and North America towards a reduction in economic regulation and a further move towards public enterprise privatisation.  This paper takes a European-wide analysis of the conditions of competition and contestability within the bus industry.  The first part examines the theoretical arguments for regulatory reform and focuses in particular on the dynamics of the likely responses from the incumbent operators in anticipating the actual form of deregulation prior to legislative changes, and in the likely consequent actions to maintain their market position - Pre-entry actions and post-entry reactions.  Comment is also made on whether contestable bus markets are sustainable.  The evidence of 10 years experience in Britain will be used to argue these propositions.  The second part of the paper argues the case that potential competition is not enough and that certain actions need to be taken to ensure the market remains contestable.  The experience of Britain is compared to the competitive regimes in other European Countries.

TI CHALLENGES TO AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA WATER-RESOURCES
   IN THE 21ST-CENTURY
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The People's Republic of China is a developing country.  Great achievements during the past 40 years have attracted worldwide attention, especially the fact that 22 per cent of the world population were sustained by only 7 per cent of the world's farmland.  However, the sustainable economic and social development of China is and will be facing serious challenges more critical than those that have happened in any part of the world.  Water is a particular problem.  The shortage of water that is almost inevitable in China is due to the following:  1.  The heavy burden overpopulation places on development in the foreseeable future.
   2.  Compulsory development of irrigated agriculture as new reclaimable farmland is not adequate to satisfy increasing food demand.
   3.  The rapid increase in water demand by industry that is now still in its initial stage.
   4.  Increase in domestic water demand due to growth of urban populations and improvement in their living standards.
   5.  Degradation of the water environment due to pollution, deforestation, soil erosion, overpumping of groundwater, siltation of estuaries, salinization, and alkalization of farmland, desertification, etc.
   6.  Deficiencies in finding.
   In spite of the serious situation mentioned above, opportunities for development of water resources in the 21st century do exist as follows:  1.  Practice of water-saving strategies in the entire country, including industry, agriculture, and domestic life.
   2.  Coordination of economic development with water resources development; rational compositional structure of industry, and agriculture; rational layout of the township system.
   3.  Implementation of large-scale inter-basin water transfer projects within the bearing capacity of natural environment.
   4.  Control of water pollution and improvement of the ecological environment.
   5.  Large-scale afforestation, as well as water and soil conservation works.
   6.  Better water resources management through legislative, technical, and educational measures, and through systematic training.
   7.  Control of overpopulation, which is of the utmost importance.

LA English
DT Article
ID PRIMARY HEALTH-CARE; DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT; ORGANIZATION; EXPERIENCE;
   COMMUNITY; PROJECTS
AB This article presents a generic framework for understanding institutional sustainability in development.  Its lessons draw from the agriculture and health sectors.  The framework treats institutions as:  (a) systems that function in relationship to their environments; (b) organized and managed entities whose organizational structures and procedures must match the tasks, products, people, resources, and contexts they deal with; and (c) settings intimately concerned with the exchange of resources where economic and political relationships intertwine to create varying patterns of power and incentive.  Application of the analytic framework has shown that institutional sustainability depends upon maintaining:  responsive output flows (high quality and valued goods and services); cost-effective goods and services delivery mechanisms (organization and management); and resource flows (recurrent costs, capital investments, human resources).

TI ENERGY ANALYSIS OF AGRICULTURAL ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT - HUMAN RETURN AND
   SUSTAINABILITY
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The objective of this paper is to present a different perspective in energy analysis of ecological and agricultural systems. A set of parameters derived from energy analysis is proposed to examine the ecological aspects of agricultural management. In this way cost/benefit analysis can be extended also to the 'biophysical capital' responsible for the sustainability of agricultural production. The text is divided into two parts: first, the basic concepts related to the thermodynamics of biophysical systems are examined to provide a theoretical framework; second, numerical examples illustrate the assessment of the trade-offs between ecosystem stability and human return in food production when natural ecosystems are altered.

TI POPULATION, DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL DISRUPTION - AN ISSUE ON
   EFFICIENT NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Population growth rate has been shown to decline with development. The flow of greenhouse active gases to and from the atmosphere, which is associated with several activities in society, is used to demonstrate that development, based on present techniques and projections of developed countries' industrial systems, is associated with insurmountable economic constraints and is also not sustainable. It is argued that this is because present development organization is hampered in its efficient natural-resource management by conservative procurement activities. This is claimed to be due to the fact that the market-oriented economic theory which dominates present development activities, has a low capacity to pragmatically attack the problem complex of natural-resource management, a process where several independent infrastructure subsystems interact with the same function in ecological systems by different mechanisms. It is proposed that the governance of development should be analyzed in terms of management, transactions and property rights and their influence on the structure and function of the development organization, emphasizing the efficient and sustainable use of natural resources.

AB Energy and technology are essential ingredients of development; it is only through their use that it became possible to sustain a population of almost 5 billion on Earth. The challenges to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries in the face of strong population increases can only be successfully met with the use of advanced technology, "leapfrogging" the path followed in the past by today's industrialized countries. It is shown in the paper that energy consumption can be decoupled from economic development. Such possibility will contribute significantly in achieving sustainable development.

ID SCARCITY
AB This paper is an interdisciplinary attempt to address the relation between the population with its social interactions, and the resource base of the surrounding landscape. It tries to merge a sociological and anthropological approach in explaining population and demographic conditions with an ecohydrological approach in explaining fundamental environmental functions and phenomena in the landscape. It draws attention to the fact that Third World development often has to take place under genuine water scarcity. At the same time, livelihood demands and production activities necessitate manipulations of soil, vegetation and water, in spite of the environmental vulnerability typical of low latitudes. This calls for skillful balancing methods between intended benefits and unavoidable side effects to secure environmental sustainability, protection of land fertility being crucial.

TI POPULATION AND AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE - TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE
   FOOD-PRODUCTION SYSTEM IN BANGLADESH
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The rate at which the population of Bangladesh is increasing, and the present level of technology, make it impossible to produce enough food for its population in the future. Population pressure has already begun to affect the environment and agricultural sustainability. Because of the intensive land use and biomass shortage cultivated soils are now being depleted of essential nutrients and organic matter. Fisheries, livestock and forestry resources are also under increasing environmental strain. With current technology it would be possible to produce 25.52 and 31.95 mill. tonnes of foodgrain by the year 2000 and 2010 AD. The current level is 18.5 mill. tonnes although greater potential exists. The production of oilseeds, sugar and fish could be doubled by the year 2010 AD. Increasing production would not be enough in view of population increases from 115 mill. today to 145, 177 and 232 mill. by the years 2000, 2010 and 2030, respectively. Unless, Bangladesh controls its population growth more effectively, regenerates already depleted agricultural resources and brings about a major breakthrough in agricultural technology, it will not be able to produce enough food to feed its own people after 2010 and continues to move towards major ecological disaster. In view of this critical situation, some measures have been recommended to control population to regenerate agricultural resources, and future areas of research thrust.

TI DEMOGRAPHIC-TRANSITION AND PATTERNS OF NATURAL-RESOURCES USE IN THE
   REPUBLIC OF KOREA
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Since 1960, The Republic of Korea has experienced one of the most spectacular levels of economic development in the world. At the same time, it experienced one of the most rapid demographic transitions from high to extremely low levels of fertility and mortality. These changes had profound impact on all spheres of the lives of Koreans. The social norms of extended family relations gave way to nuclear families. The reduction in family size combined with a rise in income led to changes in the lifestyle and consumption patterns of Koreans. These changes, together with rapid industrialization resulted in greater demands on the use of natural resources. As a result, the environmental degradation and, therefore, levels of all kinds of pollution (air, water, and solid) have emerged. The gains from the slower population growth rates have thus been partially offset by these trends. Efforts should be directed to inform and educate people about the sustainable use of resources, especially when a range of opportunities becomes available due to a rise in income and reduction in family size.

TI RATIONAL LAND MANAGEMENT IN THE FACE OF DEMOGRAPHIC PRESSURE - OBSTACLES

SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Numerous constraints make the attainment of sustainable development a foreboding challenge for the world's poorest countries. Among these obstacles are demographic pressure, natural-resource degradation, and the disadvantaged position of the rural poor, particularly women. While programs and projects continue to be designed to address each, it is argued that these constraints can be overcome only by viewing them in an integrated manner, that is, by understanding and addressing the interrelationships among them. This paper is organized around the theme of land management and argues that one of the effects of the vicious circle of population pressure, resource depletion, and rural poverty is to prevent people in the least developed countries from engaging in rational, forward-looking land-management practices. Specific problem areas in which the dynamic manifests itself acutely are reviewed, namely health and nutrition, legal and regulatory matters, access to information, and rural people's economic status. It is suggested that program planners and policy makers must adapt their modes of thinking and acting in order to focus on the notion of maximizing rural people's potential for taking rational decisions concerning land management.

DT Article
AB Sustainable development can only be achieved through a broad participatory process involving all layers of societies, both in the public and private sectors. International institutions, including the United Nations system, can contribute to the process through setting standards and providing a framework for collaborative endeavors. This paper makes a critical review of UN sponsored special conferences on global issues relating to sustainable development over the past 20 years. It discusses some negative tendencies that detract from the effectiveness of multilateral efforts, as well as good progress that has already begun, towards sustainable development. This paper also discusses the need for conceptual tools for the assessment of options for action in rational pursuit of sustainability as global interest. The paper also suggests a conceptual equation that might help to articulate the global interest focusing on the relationships between resources, technology and population.

ID IMPACT
AB Biomass in all its form currently provides about 14% of the world's energy, equivalent to 25 million bbl oil/day; in developing countries where it is the major energy source, biomass supplies 35% of total energy use.  Although biomass energy use affects the flux of carbon to the atmosphere, the main carbon emission problem is caused by fossil fuels and land clearance for agriculture.  Biomass fuels make no net contribution to atmospheric CO2 if used sustainably.  A major global revegetation and reforestation effort is a possible strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and to slow the pace of climatic change.  However, a more attractive alternative strategy might be to substitute fossil fuels, especially coal, with biomass grown specifically for this purpose producing modern fuels such as electricity, liquids and gases.  This paper examines biomass energy use, devegetation, biomass burning, the implications for global warming and the ability of biomass to sequester CO2 and substitute for fossil fuels.  It also discusses some socioeconomic and political issues.

AB We measured the performance (burst speed and endurance) and the energetic cost of sidewinding locomotion for the viperid snake Crotalus cerastes. The linear scaling regressions relating log mass to log burst speed and log endurance have slopes of 0.29 and 1.01, respectively. Maximal burst speed observed for an individual snake (SVL = 41.9 cm, SVL is snout-vent length) was 3.7 km h-1. Adult snakes were able to match a tread speed of 0.5 km h-1 for times ranging from 33 to more than 180 min, and at 0.7 km h-1 endurance times ranged from 9 to 52 min. Rates of oxygen consumption increased linearly over a range of aerobically sustainable speeds (0.28-0.50 km h-1), with a resulting net cost of transport (NCT) of 0.408 ml O2 g-1 km-1 for eight snakes with a mean mass of 110 g. Sidewinding of C. cerastes involves periodic movements with a frequency that increases linearly with mean forward speed. At 0.50 km h-1, the mean (N = 8) mass-specific energetic cost per cycle of movement was 0.28-mu-l O2 g-1 cycle-1 for sidewinding. The NCT and the cost per cycle of movement of C. cerastes sidewinding are significantly less than those of similar mass snakes (Coluber constrictor) performing either terrestrial lateral undulation or concertina locomotion. The NCT of C. cerastes sidewinding is also significantly less than that predicted for the terrestrial limbed locomotion of lizards of similar mass. Mean V(O2max) Of C. cerastes (0.405 ml O2 g-1 h-1) is only about half that reported for C. constrictor; however, the mean endurance at 0.60 km h-1 (73 min) for sidewinding C. cerastes does not differ significantly from that reported for C. constrictor laterally undulating.

AB An increase in the functional surface area (FSA) of the gills of freshwater fish facilitates increased oxygen consumption (M(O2)) but also increases ion loss across the gills - a phenomenon that has been termed the osmorespiratory compromise. This study on the rainbow trout confirms that Na+ loss (J(out)Na) accelerates with increasing M(O2) but also shows that the former always exceeds the latter, i.e. the ion/gas ratio (IGR, J(out)Na/M(O2)) increases. Since an increase in FSA should affect J(out)Na and M(O2) equally, the increase in the IGR is attributed to an increase in ion permeability and is thought to arise through opening of paracellular diffusion channels via disruption of tight junctions - a conclusion supported by the effects of brief osmotic shock, low external Ca2+ concentration and catecholamine infusion on ion losses across the gills. By analogy with extensive studies on 'leaky' epithelia, these treatments disrupt tight junctions by cell shrinkage, by displacement of Ca2+ from tight junction surfaces or by increasing intralamellar pressure, respectively. While enforced exercise or handling stress substantially increased the IGR of the trout above routine levels, animals were also capable of reducing IGR to about one-tenth of routine levels. This regulation may, in part, be due to decreasing intralamellar pressure, achieved in part by down-regulation of adrenergic receptors, but there appears to be a significant additional level of control that is probably exerted directly at the tight junctions. Such a degree of control is only possible, however, if animals do not continue to exercise and if Ca2+ levels in the water are not reduced. With continued exercise, the IGR returns to routine levels. Consequently, ion losses remain substantially elevated, suggesting that they may ultimately limit maximum sustainable activity. Measurement of the IGR under routine conditions is proposed as a simple means of predicting ion losses during activity and of analyzing the nature of the osmorespiratory compromise.

AB A sustainable plant regeneration system in vitro through somatic embryos from mature sexual embryos has been reported in Clitoria ternatea. Somatic embryos developed through callus from seedling roots on hormone-free MS medium (MS1). Addition of growth hormones, KN 0.5 mg dm-3 (MS2) or KN + 1AA 0.5 mg dm-3 of each (MS3) induced direct somatic embryos, in high frequency, on split root and hypocotyl systems. The embryogenic potential varied with the organ, roots or hypocotyls, and also with the medium. The morphogenetic capacity of the somatic embryos is retained for more than 2 years by subculturing at intervals of 4 weeks on MS3 in complete darkness. Somatic embryos. under the appropriate subculture conditions (16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod at 24 +/- 1-degrees-C on media MS3, MS4 and MS5), resulted in recurrent-somatic embryogenesis and was profuse at the shoot and root apices of the somatic embryos. Mature somatic embryos were transplanted to MS1 to stimulate germination and plantlet regeneration. Plantlets, developed from primary and secondary embryos on MS1, were successfully hardened and grown in natural outdoor conditions. The morphology and histology of the somatic embryo and plantlet and the culture conditions for continuous production of plantlets through direct somatic embryogeny are discussed.

TI TOPICS IN GRADIENT MAINTENANCE AND SALT RECYCLING IN AN OPERATIONAL
   SOLAR POND
SO JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA English
DT Article
AB Since 1986, the 3355 m2 salt gradient solar pond facility in El Paso, Texas, has operated with a temperature difference between the upper and lower zones of 55 to 75-degrees-C while delivering industrial process heat, grid-connected electrical power, and thermal energy for the experimental production of desalted water.  Because the El Paso solar pond is an inland facility, it is necessary to recycle the salt in a sustainable salt management system.  A method that uses the main pond surface for initial brine concentration and short-term storage was developed after it became evident that the original evaporation pond system was undersized.  This paper examines the method for brine concentration and storage, the effects of a brine storage zone on pond operation, and the installation of an enhanced evaporation net system and an automatic scanning injection system.  A short description of the performance history and current status of the project is also included.

ID CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT
AB "Biosphere reserve" is a Unesco designation intended to recognize areas with strong natural values and minimal human use. Biosphere reserve designation encourages regional integration of protected areas through the establishment of buffer zones and locally-based management committees. It also promotes use of biosphere reserves for environmental monitoring and research. This concept becomes relevant in terms of regional integration, scientific management, and sustainable development concerns in and around many protected areas. It suggests the need to assess proposed and potential biosphere reserves in the context of regional environmental and cultural change. This paper discusses the prospects and implications of biosphere reserve designation for the Kluane/Wrangell-St. Elias National Parks and Preserve region which extends both sides of the Canada-USA boundary in Yukon and Alaska. Here it could contribute to regional integration and coordination of activities for sustainable development and provide scientific information concerning environmental and socioeconomic change.

DT Article
AB The demand for energy services is growing rapidly in developing countries.  Low levels of energy efficiency in electric power supply and in energy use mean that the energy sector threatens to absorb an intolerably high share of available financial resources.  Energy inefficiency also contributes to local and global environmental problems.  A strategy of vigorously improving energy efficiency is thus a key element of a sustainable development path.  Results reported in this paper show that there is considerable room for efficiency improvement in both existing and new capital stocks, but a much larger effort than presently underway is essential if the potential is to be realized.  Assistance from the industrialized countries can play a major role in such an effort.

AB The objective of sustainable development is to integrate environmental concerns with mainstream socio-economic policies.  Integrated policies need to be supported by integrated data.  Environmental accounting achieves this integration by incorporating environmental costs and benefits into conventional national accounts.  Modified accounting aggregates can thus be used in defining and measuring environmentally sound and sustainable economic growth.  Further development objectives need to be assessed by more comprehensive, though necessarily less integrative, systems of environment statistics and indicators.  Integrative frameworks for the different statistical systems in the fields of economy, environment and population would facilitate the provision of comparable data for the analysis of integrated development.

TI SHORT-TERM DYNAMICS OF A NEOTROPICAL FOREST - WHY ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
   MATTERS TO TROPICAL CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
AB Arguments that ecolocial research on species-rich tropical forests is too little, too late, an irrelevancy, and a luxury we can ill afford when time is running out to save tropical forests are wrong. Focused basic and applied ecological research has a vital and cost-effective role to play in tropical forest conservation and management. Sustainable management of natural tropical forests is not possible without a better holistic understanding of how such forests actually work ecologically and interact with humans. Because time is short, however, we must learn "on-the-job" by conducting research as we implement management plans. We base our argument on experience with a large-scale study of the tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. In the space of 5 years, it was possible to collect essential silvics data on stocking levels, growth, yield, survival rates, and microhabitat requirements of a large fraction of the BCI tree community of more than 300 native species. We conclude that a program of comparable studies of representative natural and managed tropical forests at key sites throughout the tropics would rapidly improve the global fund of knowledge on which to base better decisions for the conservation and management of tropical forests. International agencies and foundations should increase their support of mission-oriented, holistic research on the community ecology of tropical forests far beyond the present emphasis on basic inventories of biodiversity.
   On one point there is no argument: tropical forests are indeed in big trouble.

AB Long-term ecological sustainability is incompatible with an open materials cycle. The toxic heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, silver, uranium/plutonium, zinc) exemplify the problem. These metals are being mobilized and dispersed into the environment by industrial activity at a rate far higher than by natural processes. Apart from losses to the environment resulting from mine wastes and primary processing, many of these metals are utilized in products that are inherently dissipative. Examples of such uses include fuels, lubricants, solvents, fire retardants, stabilizers, flocculants, pigments, biocides, and preservatives. To close the materials cycle, it will be necessary to accomplish two things. The first is to ban or otherwise discourage (e.g., by means of high severance taxes on virgin materials) dissipative uses of the above type. The second is to increase the efficiency of recycling of those materials that are not replaceable in principle. Here, also, economic instruments (such as returnable deposits) can be effective in some cases. A systems view of the problem is essential to assess the cost and effectiveness of alternative strategies.

AB As the persistence of subsoil compaction has a major impact on agricultural sustainability, responses of soil pore characteristics and plant roots to subsoil compaction were examined as related to heavy axle loads. A Ves clay loam was originally compacted with three axle loads of less than 4.5 (control), 9, and 18 Mg in the fall of 1981 (soil dry (D) ) and in the fall of 1982 (soil wet (W) ). The 9 Mg treatment was recompacted on both trials in the spring of 1988 with an 18 Mg axle load, and maize and soybean were grown in rotation. Field measurements in 1988 and 1989 included bulk density, biopore area, root number and location, ponded and negative water pressure infiltration, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(sat)), and ped size distribution. Bulk densities measured under the row in 1989 for the W plots were increased in the 10-28 cm layer by the new 18 Mg load, whereas the original 18 Mg treatment had higher bulk densities in the 28-68 cm depth. The control had lower bulk densities than both compacted treatments for the 18-58 cm increment in 1989. The number and areas of biopores in the D control plots were at least ten times greater than in W control plots. Compaction at 35 cm reduced K(sat) and ponded infiltration compared with the control. Mean ped diameter ranged from 1.3 to almost four times greater in the compacted treatments than in the control. In spite of increased soil density, a substantial reduction in root growth was not observed. Roots grew around dense clods in the compact treatments allowing continual vertical extension. There was no evidence of poor drainage hindering crop growth in the heavy axle load treatments.

AB In explaining financial performance variance, strategic management researchers and industrial organization economists have emphasized industry factors, market share, generic strategy, and strategic group membership, whereas organizational contingency theorists have emphasized alignments involving environment and internal structure.  This study integrates these perspectives, testing the financial performance consequences of organizational alignments, in context with the effects of industry, market share, and strategy.  In an empirical study in two manufacturing industries, it is shown that some organizational alignments do produce supernormal profits, independent of the profits produced by traditional industry and strategy variables.  The results are consistent with the resource view of the firm:  to the extent that alignments result from skill rather than luck, it is reasonable to regard alignment skill as a strategic resource capable of generating economic rents.  The article suggests that, by focusing on industry and competitive strategy variables, contemporary industrial organization and strategy research has understated the role of organizational factors in producing sustainable competitive advantage.

DE STRATEGIC ANALYSIS; INTANGIBLE RESOURCES
AB Sustainable competitive advantage results from the possession of relevant capability differentials.  The feedstock of these capability differentials is intangible resources which range from patents and licenses, to reputation and know-how.  A framework of intangible resources has been produced which formed the basis for a national survey of chief executives in the U.K.  Some of the more significant findings of the survey were that:  employee knowhow and reputation are perceived as the resources which make the most important contribution to business success; and that for most companies operations is the most important area of employee know how.  This article argues, by means of both theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence, that the analysis of intangible resources should play a major role in the strategic management process.

AB The question which this paper addresses concerns the types of environmental and resource-related agricultural policy adjustments that could properly address the costs of resource degradation and increase long-term prospects for sustainable development.  Various public policy approaches (e.g., Polluter-Pays Principle, fiscal measures, regulations, etc.) are discussed and analyzed with regard to their environmental and resource impacts.  The paper provides illustrative experiences from industrial and developing nations and, where possible, lessons and insights of relevance to policy making in developing countries are sought.

ID TECHNOLOGY; ISSUES; INNOVATION
AB Egyptian farm families encounter harsh conditions when they attempt to reclaim farm land from open space at the fringes of the Nile Valley and the Nile Delta.  This article first discusses what settlers have done and how, then turns to the broader significance of their search for sustainable techniques.  These examples from the extreme circumstances of private land reclamation illustrate that both the potential complementarities between farmers' initiatives and scientific research and the problems of organizing effective interaction between farmers and scientists are amplified in heterogeneous, harsh agricultural environments.

AB Ecological restructuring of all areas is the most essential action needed for the future of our cultures on earth.
   This paper intends to clarify how human technology activities can be embedded in the cycles of the biosphere. A new quality of life will be maintainable by this concept of ecologically sustainable technology. The background of this innovation is explained in more detail and the fundamentals are elucitated comprehensively. A series of principles of general validity are derived from the study of ecosystems in biosphere, which are to be transferred to technologies. This will result in the new technology paradigm of "ecologic process engineering" which is part of a new paradigm in sciences.

AB In the next decades, Asian farmers-particularly rice growers-will collectively face the biggest challenge of their lives in trying to produce enough food for the very rapidly growing world populations dependent on them. For practitioners of the systems approach, primary attention must focus on how to help those farmers meet this challenge. Any narrow scientific or technical approach aimed just at providing productive and sustainable systems will not provide the answer to the complex question of how to make the very fundamental changes which are required. Scientists particularly those at the international agricultural research centers such as IRRI and its national partners, accordingly must conceive of and carry out their research in a constantly broader framework. They must take into consideration the whole range of human problems that farmers face, problems which will differ substantially from region to region. Achieving real sustainability that not only produces enough food for the present, and protects the key assets for the future (i.e. water and particularly soil), but also does this without disrupting the age-old and usually healthy rhythms of rural life is indeed a mighty challenge. Although the adaptation of systems that scientists design to meet the needs of farmers in the thousands of different ecological and economic circumstances is a formidable challenge at the micro level, there is an even more daunting task still that requires the serious participation of scientists, i.e. devising country-specific strategies for attaining agricultural sustainability. Such strategies must address economic, political, environmental and social conditions and objectives. They can take many forms and be of varying sophistication, but must be based on a realistic analysis of such diverse aspects as trade, science, and demographics.Forming the partnerships that can facilitate the tough political decisions required from national leaders and international supporters must become one of the highest priorities of all those concerned with sustainable increases in food production.

AB Increasing population pressure in the semi-arid regions of the Sahel has resulted in a breakdown of the fallow system, low crop yields and reduced availability of communal land. Adoption of sustainable, yield increasing technologies is critical to the future development of the region. A farm level programming model was constructed for the Central (Mossi) Plateau of Burkina Faso). According to the model predictions,farmers are induced into adopting yield increasing intensive technologies as land supply becomes more inelastic, and as the economic environment becomes more profitable. The model predictions are confirmed by recent field surveys thereby providing some grounds for cautious optimism about the future of Sahelian agriculture.

ID CATTLE; REPLACEMENT; STRATEGIES; MODELS
AB The productivity of a sustainable livestock production system can be assessed at a steady (stationary) demographic equilibrium. When it is determined for an optimal culling regime, the assessment is free of the effects of initial state, planning horizon and culling pattern. Its derivation is more rigorous and efficient than its dynamic simulation. Few herd-level models derive the steady state, while numerous ones can simulate it stochastically or deterministically. Derivation algorithms currently in use are based on differential equations, transition matrices and actuarial tables. The actuarial derivation of steady-state demography and productivity is outlined. Optimal culling ages in beef and dairy ranching, respectively, are determined for the sake of demonstration. The advantages of the actuarial approach seem to be conceptual ease, conciseness, versatility with regard to realistic culling regimes, and good prospects for the implementation of model extensions. The algorithm has been implemented as an interactive PC program (PRY) which is species- and systems-independent and has been validated against stochastically, simulated population dynamics.

ID WEST-AFRICA; PROFITABILITY; NITROGEN
AB Farming systems in West Africa's semi-arid zone consist of mainly purely nomadic pastoralism and purely sedentary crop production with a minor crop-livestock production system.  Farmers there are slow to integrate cropping and livestock and utilize their intermediate farm products of crop residues, draft power, and animal manure to tackle production constraints such as shortage of animal feed, labor bottlenecks, and soil degradation.  This paper uses a crop-livestock linear programming model to show that, apart from the adoption of crop technologies, by integrating and using crop-livestock farm linkages, farmers can make more efficient use of their marginal land with less chemical fertilizers, improve their economic gains substantially, and achieve a more sustainable agricultural production system.

The changing definition of agriculture to embrace a systems perspective and two emerging issues (sustainability and concern with human goals) are discussed.  It is suggested that debate on the goals and processes of agricultural education and on the nature of agriculture itself should give rise to changes in university teaching and learning.  Such changes will best be achieved, and ongoing education will most effectively address emerging issues in agriculture, if there is rationalisation of institutions to one faculty within each Australian state or perhaps two faculties in New South Wales.  We might also plan towards placing agricultural faculties, department of agriculture and CSIRO in close proximity within each state.  These views contrast with an image of tertiary agricultural education in Australia as having predominantly rather narrow, technically based curricula and small fragmented faculties.  The authors' viewpoint arises from two residential workshops involving staff of the School of Crop Sciences in 1988 and 1989, and travel in Asia, Europe and North America in 1989-90.

ID FARMING SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB Rapid rural appraisal (RRA), a qualitative survey methodology, is being increasingly utilised in Third World situations to formulate better the problems and identify opportunities for agricultural research and development.  In Australia there have been few recent innovations in research methodologies and in the processes by which agricultural research and development problems are formulated despite the increasing complexity of the problems being encountered.  Outcomes of an exploratory RRA and a subsequent topical RRA, first used in an Australian context in the Forbes Shire, central western NSW, in 1988, are discussed.  It is suggested that the concepts which underpin RRA and the range and richness of outcomes make it a relevant tool for the formulation of problems for agricultural research and development in Australia and other developed countries.
   A model for future agronomic research which has emerged from the RRA experiences and which incorporates RRA is proposed.  This model, which focuses on farmer participation in the research process, is seen to offer greater potential for sustainable agricultural development in Australia than the increasingly questioned linear 'transfer of technology' model.

AB Three production systems (robusta coffee, cattle pastures and swidden agriculture), all associated with trees, have provided a strategy for regional development in the Ecuadorian Amazon.  Feedback from more than 250 on-farm demonstrations, project evaluations and visitors have all contributed to strengthening the ability of the Ecuadorean Ministry of Agriculture's Forestry Directorate to provide colonists and indigenous groups with management guidelines for low-input sustainable agroforestry production.  The existing market for 20 fastgrowing native tree species presents an opportunity for the diversification of farm income (currently dependent on robusta coffee) and for the development of a forest industrial base.
   The collective area of land owned and operated by these small holders constitutes a national resource and a "Collective Forest Estate" that can be individually managed.  Commercial timber production in these extensive secondary forests can help alleviate conversion of primary forest without taking agricultural land out of production.

   ANALYSIS; ON-FARM RESEARCH; SHIFTING CULTIVATION
AB Since 1985, Ecuador's Ministry of Agriculture has undertaken a demonstration project to promote improved agroforestry practices in already cleared lands of Ecuador's Amazon lowlands to promote regeneration of deforested areas.  An important expected outcome of this project is to ameliorate growing population pressures on remaining national forests and natural reserves.  These practices include managing natural regeneration of marketable timber trees intercropped to Coffea canephora var. robusta and grass-legume associations, using adequate techniques of coffee pruning, and planting Desmodium ovalifolium CIAT 350 as a ground cover crop or a forage legume in paddocks of the genus Brachiaria.  This research was conducted to assess the potential economic impact of such a strategy and to feed back information on research and policy issues.
   Improved agroforestry practices in this region are not only technically practicable but also economically feasible.  Proposed technologies enhance long-term productivity of both land and labor while saving on external inputs and hired labor, making on-going systems more adoptable and sustainable.  Future land-use policies should consider on-farm primary forest preservation and controlled natural regeneration of high-value timber in secondary forests as socially efficient land-use patterns.  Future research must address germplasm of grass and forage legumes both shade tolerant, and less field management-demanding than current ones.
   To have a lasting effect this technology should probably be incorporated into a Regional Forest Management Plan, for sustainable production at the secondary forests created with agroforestry technology.

AB Some conservation based agroforestry systems (AFS) were developed for possible adoption in place of high risk rainfed farming on land capability classes I to IV of a typical topo-sequence of foothill north India. The agri-silvi-horticulture system integrating leucaena, lemon, papaya and turmeric on class I irrigated land provided sustainable mean net returns of Rs. 17066 against Rs. 7852 ha.-1 yr.-1 from double cropped agricultural system. The intercropping of cluster beans with leucaena gave the highest net returns of Rs. 3540 ha.-1 yr.-1 in the agri-silvicultural system adopted on class II land. Eucalyptus tereticornis (Smith) in top and Bhabbar grass (Eulaliopsis binata Retz) in the understorey on a sandy loam class III land gave four years (1985-1988) mean air dry grass yield of 4.2 (used for paper pulp) from October and 1.19 t. ha-1 yr.-1 (used for fodder) from June cut. The net returns from grass alone were Rs. 4672 against Rs. 1679 ha.-1 yr.-1 from rainfed field crops raised on an adjoining plot. The returns from trees would be additional. Bhabbar grass raised under Acacia species on a 25 to 30% sloping gravelly class IV land provided yield varying from 2.18 to 4.31 from October cut and 0.50 to 1.1 t. ha.-1 yr.-1 from June cut with 6 years mean of 3.9 t. ha.-1 yr.-1 which at 1988 prices provided net returns of Rs. 2402 ha-1. These AFS proved superior to traditional farming on each land capability class.

AB Three trials investigating the potential of alley cropping to improve the traditional systems of cultivation, chitemene and fundikila, in the Northern Province of Zambia are described. Flemingia congesta, Tephrosia vogelii, and Sesbania sesban, were grown in association with finger millet, groundnut, cowpea, and maize in various traditional cropping sequences. The indigenous species Tephrosia vogelii and Sesbania sesban were not able to withstand repeated pruning and the long following dry season, and were replaced with Calliandra calothyrsus, and Cassia spectabilis.
   Over a four year period, there was no benefit by alley cropping with any of the tree species on crop yields, and yields in alley crop treatments even dropped significantly below the control treatments in the fourth year, casting doubt on the potential of alley cropping for sustainable production. There was also no consistent effect on soil chemical characteristics in any of the trials. It was suggested that this lack of beneficial response to alley cropping was due to low tree biomass production, low quality of prunings, and an inappropriate cropping sequence. There was no evidence that alley cropping contributed to enhanced nutrient recycling, despite substantial localised pools of soil nutrients, particularly in the chitemene, with which recycling could potentially occur.

TI CROPS - A WHOLE-FARM CROP-ROTATION PLANNING SYSTEM TO IMPLEMENT
   SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
SO AI APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB The Crop Rotation Planning System, CROPS, was developed because of the growing need for whole-farm planning systems in response to the environmental, economic, and legislative pressures that are facing natural resource managers. CROPS assists farmers who want to integrate sustainable agriculture while complying with an increasing number of federal laws; minimizing problems of soil erosion, chemical leaching, or surface runoff; and maintaining a whole-farm profit. CROPS also helps provide the formal plans that many federal agencies now demand.
   CROPS generates crop rotation and tillage plans for farms. The planning engine is a three-level hierarchy, and within each level are pre-planning, planning, and post-planning phases. Post-planning phases at each level allow the recognition of potential failures to ensure that planning does not proceed too far before no possible plans are reported. At the third level, a two-dimensional constraint-propagation algorithm assigns crops to fields to obtain a final six-year plan. The user is able to evaluate the generated plan in the final post-planning phase of CROPS. Inherent in the crop rotation and tillage plan are recommendations for nutrient, Pest management and soil conservation strategies.

TI THE PLANNING PROBLEM IN AGRICULTURE - FARM-LEVEL CROP-ROTATION PLANNING
   AS AN EXAMPLE
SO AI APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB In response to the public's concern over environmental pollution from farming operations, legislatures have begun to require farmers to file resource management plans. These plans are intended to show how farm management practices are addressing problems like soil erosion, pesticide leaching, and surface runoff of farm fertilizers. However, neither farmers nor the government agencies responsible for administering and approving the plans have the tools necessary to devise plans that meet the environmental, economic, and practical needs of farmers. This paper discusses the application of AI planning methods to the problem of farm-level planning. We briefly introduce the planning problem, then show how three different planning engines were applied to the problem of developing whole-farm crop rotation plans on a specific farm. These approaches include case-based planning, heuristic search and pruning, and constraint-based planning. The discussion is based on the development of CROPS, the crop rotation planning system, a program funded by the USDA's program in low-input sustainable agriculture that helps farmers who want to incorporate more environmentally sound crop production practices without sacrificing economic stability.

TI POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON RURAL ECONOMIES OF CONVERSION TO SUSTAINABLE
   FARMING SYSTEMS
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; ORGANIC FARMING; RURAL ECONOMY; MULTIPLIER
   EFFECTS; FORWARD LINKAGES; BACKWARD LINKAGES; NET FARM INCOME
AB Conversions from conventional to sustainable farming systems could affect local rural economies either positively or negatively, by several means: changes in income of agricultural households; backward linkages to input supply firms; forward linkages to transportation, processing, and marketing firms, and changes in consumer expenditures by agricultural and other households. We estimated these effects for five local rural economies in South Dakota, representing different agroclimatic and population settlement patterns. Whole-farm economic models of case study conventional and sustainable farms in each area were used to estimate differences in input purchase and marketing patterns. We found declines in on-farm personal income (returns to farm labor and management) in four of the five case comparisons under a conversion to sustainable farming systems if organic price premiums are ignored, we found increases in three of five cases if applicable organic premiums are included. In all five study areas, total off-farm personal income drops in the portions of local economies connected to farming through backward linkages. It also drops in four of the five study areas in the portions of local economies connected through forward linkages if organic premiums are ignored (all five if organic premiums are included). However, net forward linkage effects are usually much smaller than net backward linkage effects, and on-farm personal income effects are substantially greater than either backward or forward off-farm linkage effects in most cases. The total (on- and off-farm) personal income effect of converting to sustainable systems is positive in only one area without organic premiums, and in one additional area with premiums. The ratio of total to on-farm personal income effects within local economies, considering only first round effects on backward- and forward-linked firms, averages 1.2 without organic premiums, or 0.6 with them. Taking account of more complete multiplier effects, which also consider changes in consumer expenditures and changes in expenditures for supplies by backward- and forward-linked firms, the average is 1.8 without organic premiums, or 0.8 with them.  With more time for changes in sustainable production techniques and in the structure of farms and the rural economy, the overall economic effects of conversions to sustainable farming are likely to be more positive than our estimates.

TI IMPROVEMENT OPTIONS FOR A FORMER WATER-DRIVEN-MILL BUILDING NOW USED AS
   A THEATER
SO APPLIED ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB After investigating the financial feasibility (and so abandoning the idea) of providing self-generated electricity using hydro-power, it was recommended that the top priority should be the direct connection of an electricity supply, from the mains grid to the building; this would cost approximately 8800 pounds. Thereby, the theatre would receive a relatively unrestricted supply of electricity at cheaper unit tariffs. This improvement should be followed by the most urgent repairs being carried out to the building fabric, at an estimated cost of 6990 pounds. These repairs are necessary to ensure the continued integrity of the building's structure, thereby inhibiting the on-going deterioration.
   The energy and financial appraisal also suggested a priority listing of overall improvements to the building in order to achieve a significant, economically justifiable reduction in energy demand, the recommended options are estimated to cost in total 39 819 pounds. However, the capital cost of such an upgrading would only be recouped, and the theatre achieve a sustainable future, if the building were to be used more intensively and for a wider range of activities than at present in order to increase its revenue significantly.    All prices as stated are those at August 1991.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITING - ESTIMATING AND REDUCING CORPORATE
   GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS USING MONITORING AND TARGETING SOFTWARE SYSTEMS
SO APPLIED ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Current concerns about global warming, the alleged increasing greenhouse effect, environmental instability and sustainable developments have prompted organisations to devise and implement environment audits. These are undertaken in order to assess the impact an organisation's activities have on the environment and should include obtaining estimates for the airborne pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions produced. Recommendations are normally made to lessen detrimental effects on the environment and these aims are increasingly incorporated in organisations environment policies. Reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and improving corporate profitability can be mutually compatible. Estimating emissions from multi-site organisations (as part of a corporate environmental audit) can be a difficult and lengthy task. The present paper describes a computer model, which has been developed to estimate corporate greenhouse-gas and airborne-pollutant emissions from readily-available fuel-invoice information and/or plant details. How monitoring and targeting techniques, developed for energy-thrift campaigns, can be used to monitor and reduce corporate greenhouse-gas emissions, with little or no capital outlay, by reducing energy waste, are also described.

TI REGIONAL-PLANNING IN RURAL MANITOBA - A STUDY OF THE HEALTH OF A PRAIRIE
   REGION
SO APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
ID SETTLEMENT
AB Regional planning has commonly been concerned with large units at the expense of small, and often treats these areas as more or less homogeneous entities, rather than as regions that might vary internally, in their economic and social well-being.  In contrast, this paper discusses a survey of agricultural and small business soundness and vitality, or 'health', conducted in the relatively small North Central Plains Region of Manitoba, Canada.  It was found that serious problems of agricultural health occur in this area of Manitoba, which make many rural communities less 'sustainable', although there are also great variations in potential well-being within the region.  In particular, the family farm is still largely dependent upon family labour input, but it is also critically dependent upon outside income sources; without these the farm unit could not function.  Small businesses were found, however, to be much healthier and much more optimistic about the future, although many only survived as a result of unpaid family labour and outside employment.  In conclusion, we thus have a conundrum.  Agricultural health was poor and deteriorating, and yet small business health was quite good and seemed to be improving, despite the fact that the latter has traditionally been dependent upon, and a reflection of, the former.  Interestingly, many of the problems of this rural area are similar to those observed in other countries, which suggests that solutions, or at least decision-making towards solutions, could be more universally applied than in the past.

TI THE EFFECT OF PLOT TYPE ON THE ESTIMATION OF HETEROSIS IN BREAD WHEAT
   (TRITICUM-AESTIVUM)
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE HYBRID WHEAT BREEDING; GENOTYPE X PLANT DENSITY INTERACTION
AB The demonstration of an economically sustainable level of heterosis for grain yield is a key factor which determines the commercial viability of hybrid wheat production. Identification of sufficient hybrid advantage involves testing hundreds, possibly thousands of hybrid combinations each year. The design of an effective hybrid evaluation program depends on the characterization of genotype x plant density interaction effects. These were examined at Narrabri, N.S.W., using six hybrids and their parents and two commercial hybrids planted in four replicate, randomized complete block design experiments using three different plot types, viz. hill plots, space planted plots and multi-row plots.
   The level of heterosis for grain yield varied depending upon the plot type, with least heterosis being observed in multi-row plots. While the genotype x plot type interaction was significant for grain yield, it was non-significant for yield heterosis.
   The relative rankings of hybrids did not alter across plot type. Highly significant phenotypic and genotypic correlations between plot types for yield indicated that each plot type provided comparable information on relative genotype performance.
   The lesser seed requirement and ease of planting points to hill plots being the preferred plot type for preliminary evaluation of hybrid performance. The modulation of heterosis level by plot type suggests that while hill plots will provide an efficient first evaluation, performance would need to be substantiated in multi-row plots.

ID WATER REPELLENCE; SOIL STRUCTURE; SANDY SOILS; WHEAT; RAINFALL
AB The mediterranean region of Australia extends from Geraldton in Western Australia across southern Australia into western and northern Victoria. This region experiences hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters, with 300-600 mm annual rainfall. In the dryland farming zone, the cereal-livestock farming system dominates and produces 30-35% of Australia's total agricultural production. The major soils in the region are deep, coarse-textured sands and sandy loams, duplex soils with coarse-textured sands over clay (generally low in nutrients and organic matter), and fine-textured red-brown earths of low hydraulic conductivity.
   Major soil problems in the region include sodicity, salinity, soil structural degradation, nutrient deficiencies, boron toxicity, acidity, waterlogging, inadequate nitrogen nutrition, water-repellence, and root diseases. These problems have been exacerbated by excessive clearing of trees, increased frequency of cropping, reduced area sown to pastures, declining pasture production, and a decline in nutrient levels. With improved soil management there is potential for increased productivity from dryland farming areas of the region and improved ecological sustainability.

TI FARMING DUPLEX SOILS - A FARMERS PERSPECTIVE
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The methods we have employed to tackle the problems of farming duplex soils are being carried out by many farmers statewide to varying degrees. These methods also apply to soils other than duplex ones. In this paper I will give a brief description of the area that we farm and its soil types, and outline the problems with farming duplex soils, our solutions to them, and how we have implemented the solutions.
   To illustrate the differences that management and rotations can achieve in increasing yields, I will describe our previous management compared with our current management and outline what we will be attempting in the future to increase yields further. Finally, I will give some of my views on sustainability and neglected research areas.

AB Duplex soils are widespread in Western Australia and occupy about 60% of the south-west agricultural area. The physical and chemical properties of these soils reflect their origin as erosional surfaces of old laterite profiles and the predominance of underlying, quartz-rich, granitic materials. The resulting combination of high contents of quartz sand, kaolin clay, and iron and aluminium oxides has important consequences on water-holding capacity, fertility, nutrient leaching, phosphate fixation, anion and cation exchange capacity, and buffering capacity.
   These soils are generally held to have a number of physical and chemical problems. Among these, low fertility and low permeability of the clay B horizon have greatest effect. While data on the chemical properties of these soils are limited, significant data sets on the physical properties of duplex soils are available from several studies of catchment hydrology. These studies reflect concern with runoff, waterlogging, and the development of secondary salinisation. Depth to clay varies from 5 to >100 cm. The shallower depths (10-40 cm) predominate and, in medium and high rainfall areas, combine with low permeability in the clay to result in widespread waterlogging. Commonly, the sand surface can be hardsetting and can have high strength from structural decline, from the presence of cementing agents, and from traffic effects. Sodicity is widespread and has effects on hardsetting in the A horizon and on permeability of the B horizon.
   Management strategies are available to treat some of these problems, but generally, much has yet to be done to develop sustainable agricultural systems on these soils.

TI COMPONENTS OF THE WATER-BALANCE ON DUPLEX SOILS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE

DT Article

   MANAGEMENT; CHLORIDE; SYSTEMS; PASTURE; BELT; OLD
AB The water balance of soils is of interest both in terms of crop productivity and of sustainability, because water that is not used by crops contributes not only to loss of yield but also to the processes of land degradation. Land clearance for agriculture in Western Australia has changed the hydrological balance resulting in greater drainage and increased secondary salinisation.
   The relative importance of components of the water balance changes with rainfall. In the drier, eastern wheatbelt, evapotranspiration dominates the balance and there is little drainage, except through narrow, preferred pathways. In contrast, in the wetter region of the Darling Peneplain up to 40% of rainfall may be lost by pathways other than evaporation.
   Movement of water at the interface of the sand and clay layers (throughflow) has been poorly quantified. The dominant direction of flow is vertical, but substantial lateral flow may occur during winter storms on sloping sites. For example, measurements at a site near Narrogin showed up to 15 mm of throughflow during the cropping season. Drainage using interceptor drains provides a practical means of removing the throughflow and reducing the incidence of waterlogging.
   Yields of wheat on duplex soils are poorly related to the amount of evapotranspiration. At low rainfall, the relationship is poor, because rainfall is rarely uniformly distributed throughout the season, and lack of water during grain-filling may depress yields. In high rainfall areas, there are few detailed studies of water use, but yields may be lower than anticipated because of waterlogging, low inputs of fertiliser, and disease.

   AUSTRALIA; FALLOWING PRACTICES; WHEAT; YIELD; VICTORIA; CLAY
AB The environment, duplex soil types and trends in crop production in South Australia, southern New South Wales, north-eastern and north-central Victoria, the southern Wimmera and the Victorian Western District are reviewed. In the latter 2 regions, pastoral industries dominate and crop production is curtailed by regular and severe soil waterlogging, except for limited areas of lower rainfall. Subsurface drainage can eliminate waterlogging, but is feasible only for the Western District where subsoils are sufficiently stable. The other regions all have a long history of soil degradation due to cropping practices, but these effects can now be minimised with the use of direct drilling and stubble retention cropping methods. A vigorous pasture ley phase is still considered necessary to maintain nitrogen levels and to restore soil structure to adequate levels for sustainable farming. Future productivity improvements will require increased root growth in the subsoils. Deep ripping, 'slotting' of gypsum, and crop species capable of opening up subsoils are techniques which may hold promise in this regard. The inclusion of lucerne, a perennial species, in annual pastures and intercropping at intervals is a technique being pioneered in north-central and western Victoria and may provide the best opportunity to crop duplex soils successfully without associated land degradation.

AB The soil is a habitat for a vast, complex and interactive community of soil organisms whose activities largely determine the chemical and physical properties of the soil. In a fertile soil the soil biota may have a biomass exceeding 20 t ha-1, with life forms ranging from microscopic bacteria to the largest of earthworms which may be 1 m in length. Only a small fraction, probably <20%, of the soil microflora and microfauna (including bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa, nematodes, collembola, acari) have been described. The role of soil organisms in the development and maintenance of soil structure, in nutrient cycling and in their various interactions (including associative, harmful and beneficial) with plant roots is described. Trophic interactions between soil organism groups in developed agroecosystems are considered in relation to nutrient cycling and the impact such interactions have on populations of saprophytic, parasitic and symbiotic microorganisms. Prospects for the management of the soil biota to promote sustainable productivity are illustrated by describing the effects of tillage on the composition of soil organism communities. Management technologies that conserve the biodiversity of communities may provide the greatest benefits for the long term sustainability of the soil resource.

AB The soil scientist's duty in the debate on environmental management is, at least, to understand the soil and to provide and purvey accurate and precise information concerning it. This paper deals with information m environmental soil management; especially the way its quality and quantity may be modified by soil variation and various kinds of uncertainty, and how its presentation may be enhanced by the accoutrements of information technology. Soil exhibits continuous change m space and time. This variation is usually considered to be problematic in relation to sampling effort, quality of information and for optimal soil management. When ecological principles are considered soil variation is seen as a risk-averse strategy and may be advantageous for sustainable management. Evidence from cultivation is presented to support this hypothesis. The concept of pedodiversity is discussed and a simple example of an optimal preservation strategy based on pedodiversity is given. Three types of uncertainty in soil information are considered in detail: stochastic, deterministic and semantic. The tools of informatics which allow the soil scientist to provide more information or more detailed information for the same effort are discussed briefly These are knowledge-based systems, simulation modelling, spatial and temporal statistics and geostatistics, multivariate techniques, aspatial and spatial information systems. Combinations of these techniques are particularly powerful. Environmental soil management requires a philosophy that generates ways of thinking about soil from which flows realistic soil data models. Such models can be manipulated by the tools of informatics which are not to be considered as ends in themselves.

TI REASONS FOR NEW INTEREST IN ON-FARM RESEARCH
SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Locating research on a commercial farm is essential for three types of investigation: studies involving 1) management histories and physical conditions not available on experiment stations; 2) farmer management, especially of innovative systems; and 3) ecological effects of whole-farm changes. On-farm research with the farmer involved beyond assisting with operations has advantages in the design, implementation, and dissemination stages. These benefits may warrant locating a project on a commercial farm even if it could also be done on-station. Misunderstandings about the value of on-farm research are often due to its promotion in conjunction with sustainable agriculture and greater political power for farmers. On-farm research, especially with high farmer involvement, is more appropriate for answering some questions critical to developing more sustainable agricultural systems; but other aspects of sustainable agriculture are more suitably studied at experiment station sites. Greater involvement of farmers in all stages of a project is conducive to improving communication and cooperation with agricultural researchers and administrators. However, not all research on farms should have this kind of farmer involvement; and simply increasing the amount of on-farm research does not necessarily augment farmers' political power.

AB An understanding of ecophysiology of the crop is critical to the effective management of short rotation forest crops. There are many interacting ecophysiological factors such as canopy structure and development, water and nutrient use efficiency, root architecture and function, sustainability of coppicing, which, through a deeper understanding, can be manipulated through genetic improvement and silvicultural practice. These complex factors are discussed, and areas requiring further research to elucidate the nature of the processes are highlighted.

AB A healthy environment is not only a need, it is also a right; the right to live and work in an environment conducive to physical and mental health is enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Everyone shares the responsibility for ensuring that this right is duly acknowledged.
   The responsibility for action lies with individuals and with business. Governments have the responsibility of setting up the strategic and institutional framework within which action is taken. There are three main global objectives: - achieving a sustainable basis for health for all-by slowing down population growth as soon as possible, and promoting life-styles and patterns of consumption among affluent groups and countries that are consistent with ecological sustainability; - providing an environment that promotes health-by reducing the risk of physical, chemical and biological hazards and ensuring that everyone has the means to acquire the resources on which health depends; - making all individuals and organizations aware of their responsibilities for health and its environmental basis.

TI CORPORATE-STRATEGY AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS - A COMPARISON OF DEVELOPMENTS

SO BUSINESS HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB Studies of dynamic American firms reveal that new accounting systems developed during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries represented important adjuncts to administrative innovations which supported strategies designed to secure sustainable competitive advanages.  Investigations of British firms have not previously been undertaken to provide a basis for international comparison of costing methods and systems designs which arose during the 1890-1914 period when technological change, the rise of scientific management, and growing foreign competition called for new types of strategic decisions.  The following article examines the interaction between strategic processes and systems development within two British steel firms which pursued divergent strategies during the same years that du Pont made its pioneering accounting innovations.  The study draws attention to the impact of environmental conditions and firm-specific factors in influencing strategy, structure, and systems design.

TI SUSTAINABLE OR UNSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - AN ANALYSIS OF AN
   ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROVERSY
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY-CAHIERS CANADIENS DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
AB A growing literature on sustainable development has tried to reconcile the contradiction between economic development and environmental preservation. This paper analyzes the environmental controversy surrounding two proposed pulp and paper megaprojects. One is the Japanese-owned Alberta-Pacific (ALPAC) mill to be sited on the Athabasca River in northern Alberta. The other is the proposed expansion of the Repap mill in The Pas, northern Manitoba. Our analysis suggests that there are three principal reasons for the continuing conflict between economic development and environmental preservation. First, the shift from manufacturing to information industries fails to provide a panacea for non-polluting, non-depleting growth. Second, globalization of world trade has transformed the conflict over environmental costs or externalities. Finally, the state is in a contradictory position as promoter of economic development and as environmental regulator.

TI NEW PLANT NUTRITION ADVISORY SYSTEM IN HUNGARY
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB The status and role of soil testing and plant analysis in the rather heterogeneous agricultural development of Central and Eastern Europe are summarized in the present paper, and an attempt is made to formulate the future tasks under the given changing political-economical circumstances. The paper is based, in the majority, on Hungarian facts, taking into consideration the experiences of the other ''post block-countries,'' as well. Soil testing and plant analysis were in a relatively favourable position in the monolithic, centrally-organized, quantity-oriented systems of Eastern Europe, where agricultural production was based - in most of the cases - on large-scale (sometimes ''giant scale'') state farms and collective farms. Relatively well equipped laboratories were established with high (sometimes oversized) analytical capacities and with highly qualified staff well trained in soil survey, laboratory analysis, data processing, interpretation, soil mapping, and advisory service. In the large state farms and collective farms, well educated agronomists represent the potential guaranty for the successful and efficient practical use of the provided data. Most of their activities - large-scale, 1:10,000 practical soil mapping; soil tests and plant analyses for quality control and for the planning and implementation of rational plant nutrition; irrigation, drainage and soil reclamation practices; the establishment of forests, orchards, vineyards and other plantations; etc., were frnanced from the central state budget and the information-advisory service was practically free of charge or given only for a ''symbolic price'' from the users. Similar systems were used in Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, and even in Poland and Yugoslavia - with mainly private and partly collective agricultural production, respectively. Within the framework of the COMECON, the methodology (from field survey and sampling through laboratory analytical methods up to their evaluation) was more or less standardized, making the data comparable and giving a good opportunity for integrated international cooperation. Some characteristic figures (list of parameters, capacities, etc.) related to the soil testing and plant laboratories are presented in this paper. The main problems of ''collective'' agriculture are also mentioned in the paper in connection with their relationships to soil testing and plant analysis.
   The favourable political changes and restructuring of these countries' economics can be characterized by the following tendencies in agricultural production: i) privatization of agricultural land to a rational extent, ii) market-oriented production, with special regard to efficiency, input reduction, and sustainability (prevention, or at least minimalization, of harmful environmental side-effects), and iii) steps toward an European integration, with special attention to quality standards and environmental aspects.
   Under these new conditions, soil testing and plant analysis require a new conceptual approach. This consists of three main activities: 1) Environmental monitoring: continuous registration of changes in land-site characteristics (microclimate, hydrologic, soil and plant parameters) due to human activities, 2) soil-plant advisory service for agricultural production, and 3) soil-plant advisory service for other soil functions (e.g., storage of water and other materials, buffer media, filtering or detoxication of pollutants, etc.
   Item 1 is a national task, consequently, it must be financed from the central state budget, while 2 and 3 are market-oriented activities, paid, at least part, by the owners or the users of the land, or by the pollution sources.
   At the present phase of economy-restructuring, the soil testing and plant analysis laboratories are in a critical situation and are faced with serious survival problems. The governments have not paid adequate attention to this problems in spite of the obvious fact that within a very short time these laboratories - necessarily - will have a particularly important role in the modem agricultural development of Central and Eastern Europe.

DT Article
AB Sustainable agriculture aims to develop food and fiber production systems that benefit farmers and society both economically and environmentally. A key step toward that goal is helping farmers simultaneously use and improve the fundamental resources they have on their farms, such as air, water, soil, sunlight, labor, and capital. The more ''tools'' farmers have for achieving that goal, the better they'll be able to meet their own and society's needs. Proper, timely soil testing and plant analysis can be very valuable tools, provided they are coupled with fertilizer recommendations based on realistic yield goals, appropriate credits for organic sources of plant nutrients, and field-proven crop response trials.

TI APPLICATION OF SOIL TESTING IN THE GAMBIA
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB The Gambia is a small, densely-populated country along the Gambia River on the Atlantic coast of West Africa. Most of the population depends upon subsistence agriculture. Groundnuts are the primary export crop, with fruit and vegetable production for local sale as well as air shipment to Europe increasing. Under the Gambia Agricultural Research and Diversification (GARD) project contracted by USAID, the University of Wisconsin has established a soil testing laboratory at the Yundum Agricultural Research Station to serve both research and service functions. Soil test procedures include the following: water pH and electrical conductivity (EC) in 2:1 water: soil suspension; 0.01M CaCl2 pH; available P by colorimetric determination in Bray I extractant; K, Ca, Mg, and Na by flame photometry on NH4OAc extractant; organic matter by weight loss on ignition; and particle size analysis. Innovations include the methods used for soil drying and the modification of a flame photometer to determine Mg. Research to verify or correct the initial soil test interpretation and fertilizer recommendation levels will be required to optimize soil testing in The Gambia. Experiences in The Gambia will be useful to others interested in establishing sustainable soil testing programs in other less developed countries.

AB Nypa fruticans Wurmb. dominated wetlands are commonly found where brackish waters overflow with the tides.  This swamp palm is harvested for a variety of purposes, including roofing, construction materials and peels for rolling cigarettes from its leaves, and sugar syrup, an intoxicating juice, vinegar and alcohol from its floral and fruit stalk exudate.  Extraction techniques are traditional, and current resource development strategies are non-existent in areas where nipa palms are being harvested.  Maintenance of adequate supplies of the resource requires knowledge of demand on the resource and its renewability under natural and harvest regimes.  To sustain production, indigenous populations follow conservation-oriented practices in husbanding the natural resource.

TI BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND ADJUSTMENT OF THE ENTERPRISES
SO EKONOMICKY CASOPIS

DT Article
AB In the paper the business environment as one of the determinants of adjustment of the enterprises in Slovak republic in the first phase of transition is considered. The main characteristics of the business environment: stability and sustainability, stimulativeness, uncertainty, phase of the economic cycle and credibility of the government's economic policy and their impact on enterprise behaviour and performance are analyzed.
   It is proving that the economic environment favourable for the adjustment of the enterprises has not been created yet. The decline of economy in SR and inflationary trends will reflect negatively in prospects for medium-term and long term adjustment of the enterprises. Stimulativeness of the environment - in spite of the rapid grow of the prices at the starting point and devaluation effects which have been considerably exhausted by the inflation is due to the high interest rates and high taxes considerably low. Relatively low credibility of the government's policy increases the uncertainty and risk.
   The paper comes to the conclusion that recession, a low sustainability, a short political cycle, a low credibility, a high risk, etc. impair expectations of the enterprises with a negative impact on the production, prices and investments.

TI HOW SHOULD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMS BE DESIGNED
SO EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA Czech
DT Article
AB More than seven years have elapsed since the onset of the generalized debt crisis of 1982, yet the affected countries have still not managed to stabilize their economies. These countries must now attempt structural adjustment in the midst of pervasive macroeconomic and political instability. Structural adjustment packages should be designed with this reality in mind. This paper argues that structural adjustment programs should strive for sustainability, rather than the economic liberalization that they presently stress. Illiberal policies which do not damage overall macro stability are preferable to liberal policies which are inherently unsustainable or engender macro instability. Liberalization programs that are not sustainable are likely to bring few benefits, but have high costs in terms of private investment. The paper discusses some of the chief implications of this opinion for the design of adjustment programs.

AB Biomass is the world's fourth largest energy source and the first in developing countries representing 14% and 35%, respectively, of primary energy.  The provision and use of biomass energy is a complex issue; it is an integral part of the problems associated with sustainability of all types of vegetation which in turn is a key to ensuring stable socioeconomic development.  The financial costs of producing biomass are also very complex since they depend upon many different factors and tend to be quite site specific, eg agricultural and forestry costs, type of feed-stock and its productivity, equipment requirements, etc.  The last two decades have witnessed numerous proclamations of failure and success of biomass schemes.  There is no short cut to trying to understand the factors required for success except by extensive investigation.  We consider the socioeconomic and technological implications of four case studies where we have had long-term direct experience of evaluation at the local, national and international levels.  These case studies are:  ethanol from sugarcane in Brazil and Zimbabwe; community biogas in an Indian village; and, land rehabilitation for fuel and fodder in Baringo, Kenya.

AB The paper addresses the general question of identifying the optimum environment for selection in plant breeding programs for low input agricultural systems. After defining low-yielding and high-yielding environments based on the average grain yield of large numbers of barley genotypes in different cropping seasons, we examined: 1) the phenotypic relationships between the highest yielding genotypes in low- and high-yielding environments, and 2) the genetic correlation coefficients between grain yield in low- and high-yielding environments. The results indicate that the alleles controlling high grain yield in low-yielding conditions are at least partially different from those controlling high grain yield in high-yielding conditions. Therefore, selection in high-yielding environments is expected to produce a negative response or no response in low-yielding environments. This may explain why crop varieties bred under high-yielding conditions failed to have an impact in low-yielding agricultural systems. The results may be extrapolated to systems where environmental concern suggests a reduction of inputs by raising the question of whether crop breeding programs based on selection under high inputs are likely to generate the right type of germplasm for an environmentally friendly agriculture.

AB This paper addresses the current and future contributions of plant genetic resources and plant improvement to sustainable agriculture with reference to the activities of the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) in association with national programmes in West Asia and North Africa.  These regions constitute the primary centres of diversity of crops such as wheat, barley, chickpea and lentil.  Genetic erosion is being curtailed by germplasm collection and preservation.  Selection for low-input cultivars of barley is conducted under low input conditions, and new cultivars of lentil and barley are often intentionally heterogeneous to stabilize their performance in dry rainfed areas.  The importance of genetic differences in the cultivars on subsequent crops in the rotation and on straw quality for livestock is under study.  Insect pests and diseases contribute to yield instability.  Because of the potential adverse impact of pesticides on the fragile ecosystems of the region, integrated control strategies based on agronomic management, host plant resistance, biological control agents and strategic use of selective insecticides are being developed.

AB The management potential of neotropical secondary lowland rain forests is reviewed in the light of the increasing land area occupied by them and the continuing destruction of primary forests. The ecological group of long-lived intolerant trees, or big pioneers, is shown to consist almost exclusively of commercial or utilizable trees which are abundant and fast-growing in secondary rain forests throughout the neotropics. The timbers are relatively light and lack natural durability but these factors do not constitute problems for utilization. The Trinidad Shelterwood System is analysed, demonstrating the technical and economic feasibility of secondary forest management in situations in which markets accept timbers of long-lived intolerant species. It is concluded that while the biological management potential of secondary forests is general in the neotropics, favourable market conditions are not, but the growing demand for and shrinking supply of forest products should change this in the future. A population-based model of secondary succession is used as the framework for a simple preliminary sequence of silvicultural treatments, based upon a monocyclic approach. The ecological sustainability of secondary forest management is considered to depend on the maintenance of ecosystem function which, on poor soils, may be broken down by the relatively intensive interventions of a monocyclic system. This is by no means certain, however, and research is needed. Secondary forests usually constitute habitat islands and this must be taken into account in their management, especially with respect to natural regeneration from seed. The relatively high productivity of secondary forests and their potential for management through simple operations, in combination with certain crops if desired, are considered to suit them for incorporation into small and medium farm production systems.

DT Article
AB The north eastern Irangi Hills of the Kondoa District, Tanzania are severely affected by soil erosion with consequent land degradation caused by the loss of productive soil, gullying, sand deposition on lower slopes, and rapid siltation of lakes. Major changes in land surface morphology and soil characteristics have drastically altered the pattern of cultivation and settlement. A knowledge of soil and environmental conditions that existed prior to the phase of modern accelerated erosion is fundamental to the accurate assessment of land degradational processes, the extent of soil erosion and sedimentation, and the degree and sustainability of land recovery. This paper integrates the results of recent field-based geomorphological, pedological and sedimentological studies in the Haubi and Mwisanga catchments. Landforms, soil toposequences and recent colluvial and alluvial deposits are described in relation to erosion features, the dynamics of vegetation/land use changes and the development of Lake Haubi. Modification of the pre-existing soil landscape by accelerated erosional and depositional processes is discussed.

AB The environmental protection decision-maker wrestling with such problems as climate change, deforestation, loss of bio-diversity, water pollution, and loss of sustainability, is faced with an enormous variety of potentially incompatible information sources from which to extract key indicators and forecast consequences of action. Decision-support technology is evolving to assist in this process, but there are many challenges to overcome. The challenges include the sheer size of the data banks, the geographic distribution of the information, hence need for spatial information systems technology, the difficulty of reconciling information collected by different methods and the needed integration of multisectoral data (including environmental, social and economic factors). Some of the principal tools for managing global environmental information include geographic information systems (GIS), data acquisition technology (satellite and ground based), metadatabases, advanced distributed databases and spatio-temporal modelling and forecasting systems. A number of important new technological tools are now available, but environmental decision-makers must continue to articulate their requirements to ensure that the continued evolution to meet future requirements.

AB In several countries the availability of environmental data are very different and subsequently, information on sustainable development often has been unavailable. To assist in the development of environmental programs in Eastern Europe, the Austrian Ministry of Environment, Youth and Family provided a grant for the creation of the Central European Environmental Data Request Facility (CEDAR). Through CEDAR, an additional link between West and East will be established. Environmental issues, examples of emission control and waste management and the role of compter applications for environmental data integration are described in this paper.

AB A focus on the conditions and prescriptions for sustainable investment and resource use could bring environmental considerations into the heart of economic policy formulation. Recognizing that no single paradigm may be correct, the search is on for an overlapping consensus about the policy options that governments should not pursue and the policy prescriptions that, if implemented, would discourage resource waste and environmental degradation. Solutions include the modification of resource rights so that they couple markets to ecosystems; the reform of taxation and other macro-economic policies so that the values reflected by the market reward management for the future; and the greater use of economic instruments to make markets environmentally-friendly.

DT Article
AB Tropical forests, an important natural resource used traditionally on a sustainable basis by the local communities, are currently under serious threat due to over-exploitation. Ironically, deforestation carried out in the name of 'development' has led to a steady erosion of the very life support base of the vast majority of the people in the tropics, causing social disruption. Conservation and management represent two sides of the same coin and need to be tackled through a broadly-based interdisciplinary approach with interacting components: silvicultural, ecological, social and economic. Only such a strategy would ensure people's participation and ecologically sustainable management of this valuable resource.

TI TRAINING ADMINISTRATORS FOR IMPROVED SERVICE DELIVERY TO SMALL FARMERS -
   EXPERIENCES FROM SOMALIA
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Effective training must be properly conceived and relevant and therefore based on identified performance problems or gaps in the organization.   It is also crucial to distinguish those needs which may be addressed by training from those which have their root causes in other factors such as inappropriate policies or exogenous factors arising from the international economic environment. The objective of the FAO's project "Training Administrators of Agricultural Development for Small Farmers" was to bring about improvements in the administration of small farmer agricultural development, particularly relating to the performance of the Ministry of Agriculture and constituent agencies. A key strategy to achieving this objective was a series of training programmes, on a pilot basis including: (a) an analytical assessment of the effectiveness of the delivery system to small farmers, based upon a sample survey at the village level; (b) taking the latter into account, preparation of case study material which suggested concrete recommendations for improvement.      The training approach adopted was thus inductive and farmer-centered. The conventional Training Needs Analysis (TNA) based upon the appraisal of duty statements, required skills and assessment of performance gaps was conducted. Most crucially, it was decided to solicit the views of the farmers themselves as the ultimate consumers of the services.
   In consequence of the opinions voiced by small farmers in the survey, the following conclusions were drawn as a preliminary to drawing up a performance focussed training programme:              (a) availability of inputs, (b) adjustment policies, (c) public service morale.  Overall, the training needs reflected not only on skill gaps or job descriptions but on exogenous factors which neutralized the motivation to acquire the necessary skills and undermined the environment in which the skills would be exercised. Hence the need to look at a broader institutional and policy context in an holistic diagnosis of the training process before actually addressing the detailed profiles of training needs. Three levels of training need were identified:          (a) headquarters level ("senior") staff; (b) middle-level (Regional and District) staff; and (c) field staff of the various agencies and services.       At the national level, a number of the problems mentioned by the respondents were of a non-trainable nature - i.e. they were organizational problems more than a matter of individual skill deficiencies.   The project placed special emphasis on the use of Somali experts to undertake the training activities envisaged - for reasons of language as well as self-sustainability and institution building. In many of the areas where training is required, little had been undertaken in recent years, especially as far as the management of small farmer input delivery services is concerned. For field staff the curricula designed was on the basis of needs reflected in the small farmers survey and was aimed at a number of performance gaps lying within the competence of field staff. At the senior management level, the training needs assessment carried out by the project indicated a number of performance problems or gaps that lay within the competence of senior administrators.
   Overall training implementation strategy under the project was based on the following:    First, at all levels of training, to varying degrees in accordance with the educational level of participants, emphasis was placed on participative approaches: practical exercises at the field and middle levels (the application of work planning principles to real situations such as AFMET work plans or those of their agencies/services) and group discussion at the middle level seminar in relation to the findings of the small farmer survey. Second, maximum use was made of the small farmer survey and its case studies, not only as training materials but also as the basis for developing ideas for organizational improvement. Third, in the same participative spirit, training was designed to be action oriented.        Thus middle level training involved group diagnosis of the small farmer survey and recommendations for action to the  senior and national workshops on improvements of the organization  of the delivery system for small farmers. This overall strategy of implementation is par excellence innovative and conducive to macro organizational development, since it facilitates dialogue between levels of agricultural development administration and provides feedback from the field to policy makers at the highest level. The culmination of the project was the holding of a national workshop attended by the Minister and Vice Minister, Permanent Secretaries and Directors-General of the Ministries of Livestock and Fisheries and top managers of parastatals and sector technical assistance projects, amongst others.   The agenda for the national workshop ranged over 3 principal areas of concern (a) at the policy level, the need for national support for effective input delivery, the consideration of policy alternatives and the feasibility of each of the latter; (b) administrative issues arising out of the small farmer survey and recommendations of middle level officials; (c) the performance of major input delivery services. The National Workshop provided the occasion for the affirmation of Somalia's agricultural development strategy, as follows (a) the raising of farm income, output and the achievement of food security and basic needs; (b) an institutional strategy aimed at the mobilization of farmers groups to help themselves, with government providing items beyond the capabilities of self-help and the improvement of input distribution and support for small farmers; (d) reorganization of the Ministry to increase production.
   In conclusion, the Government of Somalia acknowledged that the project had made important contributions to (a) the monitoring of how the government is responding to farmers' needs and the mixed results; (b) the exchange of experience and ideas regarding agricultural  sector management     and   organization   and   other deficiencies; (c) through training and the national workshop, the assessment of training needs at various levels within the Ministry and its parastatals; however, the provision of guidance about how training can be institutionalized as an ongoing activity. In the final analysis, all this will have to take place within the context of a holistic strategy of         organizational   improvement    and development.

   MINIMIZING; ECOLOGICAL MODEL
ID RUNOFF; SWEDEN
AB Using the new Energy-Transport-Reaction Model, the nitrogen-cycle is presented in relation to energy flow in a system. This model is applied exemplary to three degraded inland water bodies. The increase in the density of energy flow in a spatially limited system provides the framework for this model. By this model the N-cycle can be observed in relation to other abiotic and metabolic processes.  The N-cycle proves to be an important indicator, sensitive to disturbances in the hydrologic cycle. A poorly managed hydrologic cycle will increase resource losses from the watershed, and simulate the formation of loss processes. The model allows an evaluation of a catchment's management according to its ion losses related to its nitrogen losses. Based on a longterm sustainable function of a catchment the integrity of the system is measured by its degree of closure of material cycles and lack of losses. Moreover, loss-minimizing management practices can be derived from the model. Planning and management can be directed towards this goal of minimizing losses and evaluated accordingly.

DE SUSTAINABILITY; ENVIRONMENT; ECOLOGY; DEVELOPMENT; RESOURCES; CARRYING
   CAPACITY; ECO DEVELOPMENT
AB Six separate but related strains of thought have emerged prominently since 1950 in discussions of such phenomena as the inter-relationships among rates of population growth, resource use, and pressure on the environment. They are the ecological/carrying capacity root, the resources/environment root, the biosphere root, the critique of technology root, the "no growth"/"slow growth" root, and the ecodevelopment root.
   Each of these strains of thought was fully developed before the word "sustainable" itself was used. Many of the roots are based on fundamentally opposing assessments of the future of mankind. Many of the roots, such as the ecology/carrying capacity root, are based on physical concepts, and they exclude normative values. Others, such as the ecodevelopment root, include such values as equity, broad participation in governance, and decentralized government.
   When the word "sustainability" was first used in 1972 in the context of man's future, in a British book, Blueprint for Survival, normative concepts were prominent. This continued to be the case when the word was first used in 1974 in the United States to justify a "no growth" economy. "Sustainability" was first used in a United Nations document in 1978. Normative concepts, encapsulated in the term "ecodevelopment," were prominent in the United Nations publications.
   After about 1978, the term "sustainability" began to be used not only in technological articles and reports but also in policy documents culminating in the use of the term in the report of the summit meeting of the Group of Seven in 1989.
   The roots of the term "sustainability" are so deeply embedded in fundamentally different concepts, each of which has valid claims to validity, that a search for a single definition seems futile. The existence of multiple meaning is tolerable if each analyst describes clearly what he means by sustainability.

DE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; ASSESSMENT OF
   TECHNOLOGY; HIERARCHY THEORY; ENERGY ANALYSIS
AB The problem of assessing the sustainability of human development is discussed in theoretical and practical terms.
   In Part I, two theoretical tools for describing the challenge of assessing sustainable development are introduced and briefly discussed: (i) the use of an energetic model to describe the dynamic interaction between the human and the biophysical compartment; (ii) basic concepts derived from the hierarchy theory applied to the development of human society. Sustainable and ethical development of human society requires the consideration of three hierarchical levels: the biosphere, the societal and the individual level. Such a holistic assessment can be obtained by integrating scientific and ethical considerations.
   In Part II, data illustrating the current terms of the dilemma of human development are presented and discussed within the theoretical frame provided in Part I. It is argued that even if we had a better understanding of the consequences of human activity on the biosphere, current modes of organization of human society and its economic activity do not readily enable adequate planning for the sustainable development of mankind. Ideologies that can bias the discussion and the assessment of sustainable and ethical development are discussed. No solution is at hand; therefore, when we consider human development today, we are facing a high level of uncertainty.

AB The present study examines the dynamic principal-agent problem, in an optimal control framework, with an emphasis on the equity issues.  It is demonstrated that (a) cooperative solutions will not be sustainable even if both the workers and the management have full information, and (b) most of the conventional incentive schemes can at best make cooperative behavior enduring if it can be obtained in the first instance.  As such, any inference that cooperation will be a result of organizational mechanisms of this nature appears to be indefensible.

AB This article examines the issue of the sustainability of information systems in developing countries. While the availability and use of information is often taken for granted in our daily lives, it is important to recognize its potentially tremendous value when applied towards a particular need or task, specifically with respect to meeting development objectives. This is a fact that many Third World countries do not appreciate, hence, the general lack of attention and support, in developing countries, to the establishment and maintenance of adequate national information systems and services. This article discusses the level of information use and the general state of information systems in developing countries. It then goes on to outline the findings of a recent study that empirically explored the issue of sustainability of information systems in developing countries. Recommendations for the creation and enhancement of conditions conducive to sustainability are presented to three groups - development planners, information professionals and aid agencies - each of whom are urged to work, individually and collectively, to develop programs to limit disparities in the development process; support "needs-based" information programs, services and activities and provide the necessary financial and infrastructural support.

TI NITROGEN CYCLING IN PASTURE AND RANGE
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Direct recycling of nutrients by grazing animals is often suggested as a means to achieve a sustainable agricultural production system. The mere presence, however, of large herbivores, their management, and uncontrollable site-specific environmental conditions can cause significant nutrient losses. Nitrogen is of particular interest because it is usually the most limiting nutrient to production; it represents a major variable input cost; it has a variety of pathways for input and outflow; and it can have important negative environmental impacts. Large herbivores shorten the N cycle, increase the rate of N cycling, and cause significant redistribution of N. Input of N through symbiotic N2 fixation is greatest in tropical and temperate pastures, whereas wet and dry deposition provide much of the usable N under semiarid conditions. Pathways of N loss also vary with climate, with gaseous losses predominating in dry conditions and NO3- leaching predominating under high rainfall. Spatial and temporal variability in pasture and rangeland N cycles has limited our ability to predict the effects of management decisions on N losses. Development of new experimental methodologies promises substantial advances in our understanding of nutrient cycling processes, from the scale of the microsite to that of the ecosystem.

DT Article
AB Recently completed and ongoing field projects in the United States that are self-labeled as sustainable agriculture research or funded through sustainable and low-input agriculture research programs were surveyed to find how closely they match the rhetoric of sustainability.  Out of 122 projects, almost all covered techniques that have the potential to conserve nonrenewable resources and reduce environmental pollution.  However, they did not show the broad scope that current writing about sustainable agriculture emphasizes:  only 22 % focused on entire farms; 25% looked at integrated crops and livestock, 19% studied general processes from which basic agroecological principles could be learned, 44% measured environmental effects, and 7% analyzed off-farm social and economic effects.  Projects on commercial farms and projects conducted on farms combined with experiment station or private research farm sites included studies of whole farms, combined crops and livestock, and analyzed off-farm social and economic effects more frequently than projects done solely at experiment stations.  In aggregate, these projects demonstrate disparities between the principles and practice of sustainable agriculture research.  However, this may reflect overly rigid assertions about what sustainable agriculture research should be, rather than of true shortcomings in addressing sustainability through research.

AB Successful range management depends on the selection of the correct stocking rate.  Evaluations of the reliability of different stocking rate procedures have not been published, however.  In this study, six stocking rate procedures were compared using longterm data from moderately (sustainably) stocked Chihuahuan desert and shortgrass prairie experimental ranges in New Mexico.  Without adjustment for distance from water and for slope, all procedures gave stocking rate estimates much heavier than the ranges actually carried.  A quantitative stocking rate procedure that bases guidelines on available research relative to forage utilization, forage intake, adjustment for distance from water, and adjustment for slope underestimated actual stocking rate by an average of 10%.  It appears this procedure can provide reasonable stocking rate estimates for most western U.S. rangelands, providing reliable data are available on standing crop of the key forage species.

TI WHAT IS SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE - AN EMPIRICAL-EXAMINATION OF FACULTY
   AND FARMER DEFINITIONS
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB To overcome the ambiguity of the concept of sustainable agriculture in surveys of personal definitions of this phenomenon, a semi-structured approach allowing respondents to provide their own definitions was employed. Agricultural faculty at a land-grant institution and a statewide sample of farmers were given a list of 14 possible components in mail questionnaires and asked to fate each in terms of its necessity for achieving sustainable agriculture, as well as to add any additional components they felt were important.
   This paper compares the faculty's and farmers' responses to each component, highlighting points of agreement and disagreement between the samples. It then analyzes their responses to determine the appropriateness of combining the items into an overall ''Definition of Sustainable Agriculture Scale,'' as well as the degree to which the items form distinct ''dimensions'' of sustainability. Sources of variation in both the overall scale and its three dimensions (ecological, socioeconomic, and ethical sustainability) are then examined for both samples, but with limited success. The largest source of variation is academic discipline, as faculty in production-oriented disciplines tend to hold narrower definitions of sustainability than do faculty in less production-oriented disciplines.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development is emerging as an alternative to conventional development, which has apparently failed to alleviate poverty in the Third World countries. Sustainable development links the maintenance of ecosystem directly with the sustainability of resources. Therefore, any indigenous knowledge that helps people to deal with their environment over centuries has potential value for the sustainable development. This study explores the Sri Lankan paddy farmers' indigenous knowledge of pest control, and points out its relevance to sustainable development. It also suggests that modem technology should be integrated with the indigenous knowledge. This approach should lead to environmentally sound, economically viable and effective technologies that could form the basis of sustainable development.

TI SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND MIGRANT FARMWORKERS
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Agriculture has industrialized to the point that commodities such as fresh fruits and vegetables are grown seasonally in large quantities as monocultures across certain regions of the United States. Production methods require short term, intensive labor. This pattern creates streams of migrant farmworkers who suffer disrupted, unstable lifestyles and many inequities in spite of their contributions as a vital labor force. A process of sustainable community development (CSCD) is needed to create the opportunity for migrant farmworkers to integrate into local communities, participate in a community decision-making process, and identify a means to create a desirable quality of life. This paper describes the migrant farmworker lifestyle and the CSCD process for improved opportunities for better quality of life.

AB Current agricultural practices are contributing to environmental degradation, which also threatens the sustainability of agricultural production. Ecology has the potential to contribute significantly to the development of a sustainable and environmentally sound agriculture. However, the results of a conference organized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggest that only a small part of this potential has been realized. Successful translation of ecological research results into agricultural management decisions will require a multidisciplinary approach.  Ecologists may be most effective in influencing agricultural practices by working as members of multidisciplinary research teams that include farmers and on-farm research.

AB Agricultural management systems function in an environmental, social, and economic context. The future context of agriculture in the United States will differ from the present in ways that cannot be predicted with certainty, but will likely challenge the sustainability of current systems. Research on sustainable agricultural systems must consider this uncertainty, and policy decisions must take uncertainty into account. Approaches for dealing with uncertainty include planning for extreme events, adopting policies with multiple benefits, improving predictive capabilities, and educating decision makers and citizens on the implications of future uncertainties.

AB Traditionally, American farm policies have dealt with the cost of food, the supply of commodities, and incomes of farmers. Concerns about environmental impacts have been peripheral. The resource concerns that led to institutions like the Soil Conservation Service were linked closely with income and other program goals. The programs we have today were not designed to address the new resource uses and sustainability goals our society now desires. Relative resource prices have given strong signals to farmers to use more of some resources than others. Inexpensive petrochemicals in contrast to more expensive land and labor have encouraged the substitution of these less expensive inputs for the more expensive ones. There has been a strong trend of such substitution since the Second World War.
   A whole new outlook toward farm size, cropping systems, and relative resource use has evolved since the coming of the tractor. The mechanization of agriculture allowed modem chemicals and responsive varieties to have tremendous impact that further changed the face of agriculture away from more traditional mixed enterprises and cropping systems.
   Analysis shows that changes in existing farm programs, or even the elimination of these programs, will neither result in very large relative or absolute changes- in input use, nor in basic changes in the way farmers farm. A number of nonfarm policies and events have been more important to farm structure, input use, and crop mix decisions than have so-called "farm" programs.
   Existing farm programs were neither designed for, nor were effective in, changing the way farmers farm. Therefore, new types of policies will have to be created-policies that might target specific concerns, reassign property rights, of give very different direct incentives in order for farmers to change the way they fam.

AB Sustainable agriculture requires the balancing of a variety of goals. This means that often no single goal can be maximized, since such optimization might totally preclude the achievement of one of the other goals of sustainability. For this reason, transdisciplinary teams containing advocates of the various goals, with ability to negotiate priorities, provide an important input into research and extension toward a sustainable agriculture. Further, farmer membership on these teams is particularly crucial, because a sustainable agriculture means that the farmer shifts from a user of technology to a producer of technology and a monitor of its impacts.
   A major impediment to the development of transdisciplinary approaches is the lack of good indicators of sustainability. In part this is due to the ease of use of traditional measures of production and profit. Not only do these yield single, summary measures; they have relatively short term manifestations. Indicators of the impact of agricultural practices on sustainability are more diffuse and more long term. Systematic efforts are needed to develop such measures.
   Farming systems research and extension (FSR/E) has traditionally involved multidisciplinary teams, which have included farmer participation. However, both the composition and process of FSR/E must be altered to include the multidimensions of sustainable agriculture. Such adaptations are possible in all phases of FSR/E: from diagnosis, to design, to on-farm trials, to monitoring and evaluation, and finally extension.

AB "Sustainable agriculture" has emerged as the most agreed-upon term to synthesize a variety of concepts and perspectives associated with agricultural practices that differ, from those of conventional production. Definitions of sustainable agriculture contain three equally important components: environmental quality and ecological soundness, plant and animal productivity, and socioeconomic viability. The Agroecosystem component of the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program is developing a systems-level approach to the long-term monitoring of agroecosystem sustainability. Measurements will be made for a suite of indicators at sites selected from a probability sampling frame. Associations between indicator values over time will be used to assess agroecosystem condition and status on a regional and/or national scale. One or more measures of sustainability will be developed by organizing indicators and assessment end-points into a framework based upon the three components of sustainable agriculture.

AB Perspectives from different but complementary schools of thought in ecology are being applied to sustainable agriculture-population and community ecology on one hand and ecosystem ecology on the other. These perspectives intersect in the study of mechanisms and controls of processes in ecosystems. Increased understanding of these processes in agroecosystems will contribute to development of sustainable agriculture.
   Current models of nutrient cycling in soil suggest that active or readily mineralizable fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) are coupled to plant-available nutrient pools through the processes of mineralization and immobilization. Factors that control these processes (soil temperature, water, and texture; and resource quality of organic inputs) are influenced by management practices and represent potential controlling points for managing nutrient cycles in agroecosystems.
   Organic inputs present different problems for nutrient management than do synthetic fertilizers, because most nutrients must be mineralized before they are available to plants. This extra link in the nutrient flow pathway adds uncertainty to nutrient management. However, this may reflect more our lack of understanding of processes involved than an inherent unmanageability of organic fertilizers.
   Further research is needed to determine longterm trends in organic-matter processes in agroecosystems; to improve predictive capabilities of nutrient-cycling process models and linkages with landscape-scale models; and to determine relationships between biodiversity of soil biota and nutrient cycling processes in agroecosystems.

AB Landscape ecology focuses on the development and dynamics of spatial heterogeneity at large temporal/spatial scales. A landscape is a mosaic of elements (patches and corridors) generated at various scales. Agriculture has traditionally been managed at the agroecosystem (landscape patch) level of resolution and has been judged successful based on the concept of crop yield. A new transdisciplinary approach to agriculture at the landscape level needs to be implemented based on the concepts of sustainability, hierarchy theory, and landscape diversity. New transdisciplinary research and educational approaches must include problem-solving algorithms, the concept of net energy, and tools such as Geographic Information Systems. Recommendations are presented for changes that are urgently needed if sustainable agriculture is to be developed and managed at the landscape level. These recommendations include changes in and the integration of our present research, educational, and management philosophies. A new field of study-agrolandscape ecology-must evolve if we are to develop and manage agriculture in a sustainable and cost-effective manner for future generations.

TI CAN A MODERN DAIRY FARM BE SUSTAINED
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Farm sustainability is embodied in a concern for intergenerational equity. It is influenced by the contemporary material and social context of the farm and by its history. The evolution of a ''modern, progressive'' Pennsylvania dairy farm from ca. 1950 to 1986 was determined during interviews with the farmer. The buildings and structures of the farmstead were indicators of the changes and could be linked to other less readily apparent changes on the farm. Survival of the farm relative to neighboring farms may be related to the rapid changes in the scale of various farm attributes that reflected the outcomes of the farmer's management decisions. Successful intergenerational transfer of the rapidly evolving farm may be attributed to both the competitive advantage of the technology used and the associated evolutionary path of the farm. But, the rate of change on this farm will be difficult to sustain indefinitely. Since decisions regarding farm sustainability reflect more than just the technology used in agriculture, a widespread perspective regarding sustainability must develop in society. This new paradigm will create a favorable and meaningful context for farm decisions about sustainable agriculture.

AB Ecological sustainability, the ability of life-support systems to maintain the quality of the environment, is a necessary condition for longterm agricultural sustainability at the field, farm, or national level. Research is needed at the watershed/landscape level to address the effects of changes in inputs, land use, or management practices on the ecological sustainability of modern agriculture. This research should address the impact of perturbations on the responses of watersheds relative to objective indicators of sustainability, Ideally this research would be done within a set of managed landscapes that could be perturbed to change the watershed or landscape response. The perturbations could be to the inputs of materials, energy, and management; the structure of the landscape; or the desired production outputs. An existing set of watershed improvement projects, funded by Federal, State, local, and private sources, could provide the landscapes for this research. Projects funded through Clean Water Act Section 319 grants, USDA Water Quality Demonstration projects, and USDA Hydrologic Unit Area projects provide landscapes throughout the United States that are valuable resources for research on ecological sustainability. These landscapes should be used in research to determine ways to enhance the longterm sustainability of agriculture.

AB Policy makers are more willing to adopt changes when the benefits of the change are clearly documented. The 1977 National Resources Inventory (NRI) and the dramatic changes it helped bring about is an example of the power of information in facilitating environmental policy innovation for agriculture. Multibillion-dollar conservation programs now address soil erosion in the United States in a relatively strategic and technically sophisticated way. This greater integration between farm policy and environmental policy has had an impact on commodity policies for agriculture, which have been modified in an attempt to avoid barriers to sustainable agriculture crop rotations. However, identifying the benefits of sustainable farming systems presents a greater research challenge than the soil conservation studies that used the NRI. The rewards for policy-oriented ecological research are great because many opportunities remain for U.S. and world agriculture to become more supportive of environmental and ecological goals while simultaneously meeting farmer and consumer needs.

AB Successful adoption of sustainable agricultural practices in the United States will hinge on identifying the potential benefits of these practices and demonstrating their feasibility within the context of agricultural economic conditions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a number of ongoing research efforts that relate to sustainable agriculture. However, these efforts have not been designed as, and do not constitute, an organized environmental/agricultural research program. New research initiatives, such as the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program, are evolving towards a more integrated approach for solving environmental/agricultural problems. These efforts provide a foundation for an integrated program in sustainable agriculture research. One of the major challenges will be to work effectively with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, taking advantage of the research capabilities and strengths of each agency.

AB Individuals are growing increasingly concerned over the state of the environment and are aware that many of their current choices and actions will have lasting impacts on environmental health. However, the general lack of science/environmental education in the United States has resulted in a public that is poorly prepared to understand these problems and formulate effective solutions. Proponents of sustainable agriculture must recognize that the precollege school system (K-12) is an essential place to begin disseminating information that will allow individuals to understand the implications of different agricultural practices in terms of their own health, the health of their environment, and the maintenance of their food supply. Science education in the United States is undergoing reform, providing an excellent opportunity to use sustainable agriculture as a theme in teaching science. Efforts are underway to make science more relevant relevant to real world situations through the establishment of partnerships between subject matter experts and educators. Scientists, farmers, and teachers can form alliances that will enhance students' knowledge of both sustainable agriculture and science.

AB Two local varieties, a white type and a red type, of Sorghum vulgare cultivated in Ghana were malted, using a micro-malting method, and their malt characteristics studied and compared to that of a commercial barley malt. The optimal germination time, at 30-degrees-C, to produce a good malt of high diastatic power and extract from local varieties of these varieties was 4-5 days. The local varieties were also found to have high diastatic activities of between 55 and 68% of the commercial barley malt. Hot-water extracts of the well malted sorghum varieties were also found to have higher and sustainable amounts of free amino nitrogen than the commercial malt. The hot-water extracts of sorghum malts were lower than the commercial barley malt, yielding about 66-77% of the barley malt, but contained a higher glucose to malt ratio. In terms of varietal superiority, the white sorghum yielded higher malt extracts than the red type.

AB A set of 840 pure line faba beans (Vicia faba L) derived by a process of cyclic single plant selection from 1979 to 1985 was used for this study. Mean content of protein was 240 g kg-1 with a standard deviation of 18 g kg-1 and a range of 180 to 310 g kg-1. For eight subregional groups (Nile Valley, West Asia, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, North Africa, Ethiopia and the Indian subcontinent) and for a large and small grouping, the means and ranges of protein content were similar. There were no significant correlations between protein content and seed yield or its components. This resulted in a strong correlation (significant at P < 0.01) between seed yield and protein yield (r = 0.98), supporting the hypothesis that the optimal way to increase sustainable protein yield per hectare is to increase and stabilise seed yield.

AB Concern over the extent of marine pollution in many of the world's more populated coastal environments has stimulated an international debate on how to improve strategies for marine pollution prevention. Much of the debate centres on the concepts of Sustainable Development and Precautionary Action and the various ways to reflect these concepts in new strategies and measures for reducing emissions of substances and wastes. The degree to which scientific considerations should influence regulatory actions in limiting the types and amounts of substances emitted to the environment is also a matter of intensive discussion. However, some scientists now believe that a common and comprehensive strategy for protection and management of the total environment is a logical prerequisite to significant reductions in marine and other forms of pollution on a global scale.

AB Malaria and other arthropod born diseases remain a serious public health problem affecting the lives and health of certain social groups when the two basic strategies to control fail due to: (1) the lack of effective chemoprophylaxis/chemotherapy or the rapid development of drug resistance of the infectious agents and (2) the ineffectiveness of pesticides or the arthropod vectors develop resistance to them. These situations enhances the need for the design and implementation of other alternatives for sustainable health programmes.
   The application of the epidemiological methods is essential not only for analyzing the relevant datu for the understanding of the biological characteristics of the infectious agents, their reservoirs and vectors and the methods for their control, but also for the assessment of the human behaviour, the environmental, social and economic factors involved in disease transmission and the capacity of the health systems to implement interventions for both changes in human behaviour and environmental management to purpose guaranteed prevention and control of malaria and other arthropod born diseases with efficiency, efficacy and equity.
   This paper discuss the evolution of the malaria and arthropod diseases programmes in the American Region and the perspectives for their integration into health promotion programs and emphasis is made in the need to establish solid basis in the decision-making process for the selection of intervention strategies to remove the risk factors determining the probability to get sick or die from ABDs. The implications of the general planning and the polices to be adopted in an area should be analyzed in the light of programme feasibility at the local level, in the multisectoral context of specific social groups and taking in consideration the principles of stratification and equity.

AB This paper argues that in an overall context there does not seem to be a binding water constraint on sustainable development. Where such a constraint exists, a realistic approach is advocated, one that should not discount the ability of humankind to adapt to such circumstances and devise coping mechanisms without necessarily resorting to armed struggle. The paper also deals with the requirements for environmental impact assessment of water projects, particularly in the context of less developed countries and notes that such efforts run the risk of stifling sustainable development itself.

AB The status of fish species and fish resources is reviewed. Actual and potential threats are identified and, as far as possible, quantified in terms of their potential to cause local or general extinction.
   Excessive depletion by fishing alone has rarely, if ever, caused extinction, but the circumstances in which unrestrained fishing could potentially do so are identified.
   The harm to fish arising from deterioration of water quality caused by toxic pollutants and acidification is well documented and, for the most part, well understood. More subtle and potentially more dangerous conditions arise from excessive organic enrichment in low-energy systems such as deep lakes and semi-enclosed seas, which may lead to the creation or enhancement of an anoxic layer and its spead into shallower regions.
   The majority of introduced fish species have proved either non-viable or ecologically neutral. A small proportion have been beneficial, mainly in man-made water bodies. Some, notably general colonisers and powerful predators, have seriously harmed the native fish fauna.
   Most serious, because the fish have little or no natural protective response, is disruption of water flow or loss of habitat. Significant loss of genetic diversity can be caused even when these factors are not so serious as to cause total extinction.
   In reality, it is usual for two or more of the above threats to operate together; it is shown how the result may be more dangerous than the sum of their independent effects.
   In conclusion, it is suggested that a more rigorous and uniform definition of ''threat'' is needed. The established criteria and methodology of ''risk assessment'' could be used with advantage. Complete protection, except in special circumstances, is unattainable. A better strategy is to intensify efforts to convince the users of fish resources, whether for food, sport or the aquarium trade, that sustainable harvesting is to their long-term advantage as well as that of the fish. Above all, the need is to convince the general public that the conservation of fish is just as important as that of other more visible fauna and flora.

AB Fish communities of inland and coastal waters react to fishing pressure and environmental stresses by the disappearance of larger individuals and species and an increasing dominance of smaller fishes. Changes in the water quality and quantity, the timing of discharges and the structure of the environment have had a major modifying effect on population structure, especially in inland and coastal marine waters. Fishing has also changed the composition and state of fish stocks by bad practices, excessive effort and physical damage to the environment. Many usages to enhance productivity such as stocking, introductions or aquaculture are also detrimental to the sustainability of the resource base. It is concluded that fish stocks and aquatic environments are in a poor state word-wide and that action at national and international level is urgently required to remedy the situation.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were determined during the first 3 years of cropping a Kairanga soil out of pasture, with either full cultivation or no-tillage cereal establishment. The CO2 emitted during cropping was compared with calculated methane production by ruminants grazing pasture at the site. Cultivation resulted in the loss of about 10 t soil organic carbon (C)/ha over 3 years but there was no change in soil C with no-tillage cropping. Grazing of pastures at a high but sustainable stocking rate was calculated to produce 205 kg C/ha per year as methane (CH4). No-tillage cropping of this site therefore contributes much less CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere than either grazing or cropping with cultivation. Using 20-year global warming potentials of 20 and 1 for CH4 and CO2 respectively, the data showed that ruminants grazing this site would have had more influence on atmospheric warming than cropping with cultivation did.

TI AQUACULTURE WITH ITS ENVIRONMENT - PROSPECTS FOR SUSTAINABILITY
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The rapid expansion of intensive one-species aquaculture has generated severe environmental as well as socio-economic problems.  A major reason is that Western-oriented aquaculture has been managed as an isolated part of its supporting environment.  In this paper, the authors compare the use of industrial energy for various aquaculture, fisheries and agriculture systems and analyze the connection between resource use, methods of culturing and environmental impacts.  The characteristics of one-species aquaculture, such as intensive throughput-based salmon cage-farming and shrimp pond-farming, are found to be similar to those of stressed ecosystems.  Among these characteristics are a very inefficient resource use and generation of by-products that are stored or exported.  Because of the problems with these monocultures, there is a great need for Western-oriented aquaculture to redirect the industry's present behavior towards a path of synergy between development and environment.  A challenge is to find ecological economic ways to integrate culturing activities in coastal areas.  Based on principles of ecological engineering, Chinese integrated systems are synthesized, intensive mangrove-destructing shrimp farming is opposed to integrated shrimp farming, and how a coastal culturing system of seaweeds, mussels and salmon could be developed is suggested.  Such systems aim at increased efficiency, reduced resource use, avoidance of chemicals and medicals, less waste generation and the recycling of nutrients and materials.  The authors conclude that the more a cultivation system recognizes and mimics natural ecosystem functions the less resource inputs are required and the less environmental effects can be expected.  A successful aquaculture system does not have wastes, only by-products, to be used as positive contributors to the surrounding ecosystems and the economy.

AB The author addresses the evolution of environmental cooperation in the Mediterranean region by surveying the Mediterranean Action Plan framework and recent initiatives by UN specialized and funding agencies promoting sustainable development. The author notes that an initial concern with marine pollution in the 1970s led to greater attention to integrated planning of development of coastal and marine areas since the 1980s. In concluding, the author draws attention to growing complexity, the limits of regionalism, the continuing lack of popular constituencies for regional arrangements, and problems of implementation.

LA Finnish
DT Article
AB On its completion early in 1985, the Forest 2000 programme was given a favourable reception.  The findings showed that more wood than ever can be cut from Finnish forests to provide industrial raw material.  The 8th National Forest Inventory, which is currently nearing completion, shows that both the volume of standing timber and the annual increment are much greater than was forecast in the early 1980s.
   A recent report by the committee set up to revise the Forest 2000 programme states that the Finnish forest industry has every opportunity to lead the economy by setting an example in sustainable development.  To achieve this, however, the forest industry's competitiveness will have to be safeguarded both through its own efforts and with the support of the public sector (article on pages 179-180).

AB The Dutch government has a coherent, long-term policy regarding attainment of a sustainable development affecting agriculture and horticulture, the requirements of which are very strict and will be difficult to satisfy. The growers of protected crops try to meet these requirements by developing so-called closed growing systems. Two other approaches in the policy are a substantial reduction of the volume of pesticides used and a very critical evaluation of the pesticides permitted. In this governmental policy, Integrated Pest Management has shown prospects in horticulture; it will play a very important role in the near future but is now considered as part of the broader concept of Integrated Production Systems.
   The glasshouse industry is very actively developing its own strategy to satisfy government targets and market demands for high-quality products produced by environmentally safe methods. The vegetable auctions have developed a policy of environmentally conscious production which should put the vegetable industry into a strong marketing position for its produce.

AB Species of the marine algal genus Gracilaria (Gracilariaceae, Rhodophyta) reported from the Mediterranean are critically reassessed.  Nine species are recognized: Gracilaria armata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh, G. bursa-pastoris (S.G. Gmelin) Silva, G. conferta (Schousboe ex Montagne) J. Feldmann et G. Feldmann, G. corallicola Zanardini, G. dendroides Gargiulo, De Masi et Tripodi, G. dura (C. Agardh) J. Agardh, G. heteroclada (Montagne) J. Feldmann et G. Feldmann, G. longa Garguilo, De Masi et Tripodi, and G. verrucosa (Hudson) Papenfuss.  Descriptions and distributional data are provided for these species, and a synoptic key to their features is presented.  An examination of the reproductive morphology of these species suggests that the currently accepted criteria for distinguishing between the genera Gracilaria, Hydropuntia (Polycavernosa) and Gracilariopsis are not sustainable, particularly with regard to the development and nutrition of the developing carposporophyte and the formation of spermatangia.

AB Work on short-rotation coppice willow as an alterative and renewable energy source began in Northern Ireland in the mid-1970s, prompted by the massive rise in oil prices during that period. Although in the short run oil prices have dropped in real terms, interest in short-rotation coppice willow has ben sustained because of the potential role it has in the development of agriculture, particularly in marginal areas. This is particularly relevant in the current situation of over production of a wide range of agricultural commodities within the European Community and the moves to reduce Government support in the form of farm and export subsidies.
   Although Salix cultivars have yielded in excess of 30 tonnes dry matter (DM) ha-1 annually under experimental conditions, it is considered that 10-12 tonnes DM ha-1 is a sustainable commercial yield.
   Melampsora spp. rust has emerged as one of the most important factors limiting the development of short-rotation coppice as a commercial crop. For economic and environmental reasons, the application of fungicide for rust control is not a possibility. Consequently, other disease control strategies have to be established. The main focus of this work is in the selection, for suitability for coppice application, of the widening range of genetic material becoming available from breeding programmes in Canada, Sweden and Finland with a view to their incorporation into mixed stands.
   End product utilisation is considered a priority area for investigation if short-rotation coppice is to make a contribution to land use and the development of agriculture in marginal areas. Currently two potential end uses are being investigated: firstly fractionation - to produce cellulose for paper manufacture, hemi-cellulose for the production of molasses and lignin for further processing into other industrial chemicals, and secondly the simultaneous generation of heat and power using gasification - 'combined heat and power'.

ID REGIME ANALYSIS
AB This paper assesses the World Bank's proposal for regional cooperation and integration in Sub-Saharan Africa: From Crisis to Sustainable Growth. The assessment is based on the view that forms of economic regionalism can be usefully described and analysed using the concept of the international regime which has been developed by international relations theorists.
   The World Bank's proposal argues for an innovative regional regime which is compatible with a continued commitment to structural adjustment policies. The World Bank's proposals for regional cooperation and integration is compatible with adjustment policies because it is a regional regime which conforms to the norms of a liberal international order at a global scale. With such conformity, the regional regime is 'nested' within a broader international regime.
   The World Bank's proposal is also a necessary complement to adjustment policies. It complements such policies by providing the framework for a spatial fix for growth-oriented adjustment in Sub-Saharan Africa. The successful implementation of the proposal may increase aggregate incomes, but this outcome is uncertain. If it does occur, there would be increasing geographical differentiation between countries, in terms of their production structures, and the emergence of a stronger African bourgeoisie. The latter trend implies that there is a contradiction in the World Bank's study. Whilst the study as a whole supports equitable growth, the proposal for regional cooperation and integration will, if it is successful, strengthen income differentiation and stratification.
   Some alternative approaches to regional economic cooperation are proposed. These include, firstly, approaches which are compatible with World Bank adjustment policies, and secondly, approaches which require the modification of these policies to take account of the practice, rather than the theory, of a liberal international economic order.

AB Soil organic matter sequesters close to three times the carbon existing totally in the living biomass and nearly the same for the total carbon in the atmosphere. Models, such as Jenkinson's or Parton's Century model, help to define soil organic matter fractions of different functions, based on residence time/C-14 age. Rejuvenation of soil carbon was felt to be the principal impediment to absolute soil dating, in addition to the ambiguity of the initiation point of soil formation and soil age. Recent studies, for example, of Becker-Heidmann (1989), indicate that a soil C-14 age of >1000 yr cannot have >0.1% rejuvenation in the total soil organic matter compartments/fractions to be possible and sustainable. Always problematic in earlier observations were age vs. depth increases, in C-14 profile curves showing an inflection of reduced age in the deepest samples, i.e., from the rim of the organic matter containing epipedon. We attribute this phenomenon, in mollic horizons, to earthworm casts in the terminal part of the escape tube. Becker-Heidmann (1989) has shown, in thin layer soil profile dating, a highly significant correlation between the highest C-14 ages and the highest clay content. Thus, optimization of soil dating is, to a lesser degree, related to the applied extracting solvent system than to soil texture fractions. Such observations allow us to mitigate error ranges inherent in dating dynamic soil systems.

AB To support an assessment model, we propose a set ot numerical models where distribution and growth of capelin (Mallotus villosus) is modelled by biological (evolutionary, ecological) and physical forces. The basics of a dynamic optimization fish distribution model is outlined. This model must be coupled to hydrodynamical/meteorological (temperature, ice conditions, light regime) and biological (plankton transport and production) models. While modelling capelin distribution is the short term aim, the ultimate goal is to develop management models where understanding (theory) rather than knowledge (empiricism) is the basis for prediction. This will enable sustainable management also in years deviating from past experience.

   COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS OF AGRICULTURAL POLLUTION-CONTROL IN THE
   NETHERLANDS, THE UNITED-KINGDOM AND FRANCE
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of sustainable development, which symbolizes the aspirations of environmental policy, conceals the nub of the environmental question:  namely, the crucial part played by the destructive competition between social groups, each pursuing their separate interests, even at the expense of the environment.  This proposition is supported by an analysis of the agro-environmental question in the Netherlands, the UK and France.  There are remarkable differences in the nature and scale of agriculture pollution in these countries and in the governmental regulations.  Nevertheless, the agro-environmental question seems in each case to be trapped in the same iron law whereby policy making advances reactively through a succession of crises, the pace of change being dictated by an entrenched agricultural-policy community staunchly opposed to any far-reaching environmental measures.

TI ADAPTED FARMING SYSTEMS FOR A RURAL LANDSCAPE - A SOCIAL TYPOLOGY OF
   DUTCH FARMERS
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB Agricultural practices in The Netherlands are based on a strong socio-economic sector. Current production methods have an immense and often unwanted impact on the environment and threaten its function for urban and rural populations in a nation that is densely populated, industrialized and urbanized.  A comparative qualitative study was carried out in five different regions, each region representing a particular rural landscape of great value.  The study assessed the willingness and capability of full-time farmers in land-based agriculture to modify their farming practices and farm organization in favour of a multi-functional rural landscape.  According to their perceptions and ideas about the use of rural land, in each region only one (dominant) type of farmer was to be found, with a few individual 'exceptions'.  By investigation their orientation to adapted farming systems (i.e. sustainable agriculture and landscape management), several groups were identified within the dominant type.  However, these groups cannot be considered as sub-types: the differences were too minimal, due to the preoccupation of many respondents with optimum agricultural production and the unavailability of equivaler.

   SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
AB In response to the widely acknowledged deepening crisis in African agriculture, the rush to promote 'sustainable agriculture' is indeed warranted. However, maintaining the existing development paradigm renders sustainability in agriculture impossible. An epistemological and methodological reorientation is required to support sustainable agricultural practices. Local knowledge systems (LKS) in agricultural production and resource management are defined and their central social and economic dimensions are highlighted. Three models of development are examined, the first excludes LKS, the second incorporates LKS, and the third is fully based upon LKS. Examples of each type are examined and the implications discussed.

AB Leucaena [Leucaena spp., especially L. leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit] is a perennial woody legume which regrows each spring from below ground rootstock in colder subtropical and warm temperate climates where temperatures below -2-degrees-C occur. The crop is useful for biomass (energy), browse for cattle, and sustainable agroforestry systems. Results of several biomass and forage experiments conducted during the 1980's on a two-replication, 373-accession leucaena nursery at Gainesville, Florida, which was planted on Lake sand (hyperthermic coated Typic Quartzipsamment) in the 1979 season, are reported. In December 1990, ratings were conducted to determine plant vigor and survivability of selected accessions from the nursery of the then 12 yr-old stand. Of 12 accessions selected for their high biomass production in 1982, only six [PI No. 263695 (K8), 281608 (K28), 288005 (K67), 443482 (K49) 443647 and 4436961, stilt had good stands and vigor. Accession PI 443655 from a forage experiment had all plants living but relatively low vigor. Overall, 20 leucaena accessions were selected which still had good vigor and/or stands after 12 yr. These accessions should be considered for use in future research on leucaena in Florida and the Lower South USA where good persistence and vigor are required.

   SEEWETENSKAP
LA English
DT Article
AB The potential ecological consequences of commercially exploiting the limpets Patella argenvillei and P. granatina on the west coast of South Africa were investigated. Standing stocks were quantified and population parameters (growth, mortality and recruitment) determined for both species. These data were used to derive empirical estimates of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for P. granutina and P. argenvillei (7,4 and 1,5 tons wet foot mass respectively). The population parameters were also used in the development of a length-based simulation model to provide a second estimate of MSY for P. granatina (up to 12,9 tons). Small-scale experimental harvesting showed that both species recovered extremely slowly if all limpets were removed (total clearance). When the harvest was size-selective (partial clearance), with P. granatina >60 mm and P. argenvillei > 75 mm being removed, P. granatina failed to recover after 13 months but P. argenvillei recovered within 15 months. Partial and total clearance led to enhanced growth and survival of the remaining limpets. Partial clearance of P. granatina had no effect on other species in the community, but partial and total removal of P. argenvillei resulted in increased cover of sessile filter-feeders and macroalgae as well as a decrease in the cover of encrusting coralline algae It is concluded that the potential exists for the development of an economically viable and ecologically sustainable fishery. Empirically derived quotas and minimum size limits of 60 mm for P. granatina and 75 mm for P. argenvillei are suggested as the chief mechanisms for regulating a potential fishery. The need for a holistic approach to the management of living (particularly intertidal) resources is stressed.

AB The biology of the sparid fish, Pachymetopon grande, was investigated from data collected on the southeastern Cape coast between August 1984 and March 1987. Sectioned sagittal otoliths revealed that they are a slow-growing, long-lived species capable of reaching ages in excess of 40 years. Detailed histological examination of gonadal development showed that they are rudimentary hermaphrodites, males and females maturing after a non-functional intersexual stage. The breeding season is restricted to between January and June, and observations suggest that they are group spawners with pelagic eggs. Maturity was reached at 300 mm fork length or approximately 5,5 years old. P. grande is primarily herbivorous, feeding selectively on rhodophytes found on inshore reefs down to approximately 20 m. Minor dietary components included hydrozoans, octocorals and other small invertebrates. Macroalgal degradation by gut endosymbionts or the utilization of macroalgal epibionts was not evident, suggesting that storage and extracellular carbohydrates of the macroalgae were utilized in the diet. The importance of P. grande to the inshore recreational angling fishery, together with certain aspects of its biology, underline the need for conservation measures aimed at ensuring the sustainability of this resource.

AB The viability and sustainability of civilizations, corporations, institutions and ecological life-support systems (CIES) can now effectively be enhanced with new insights, new methods and new strategies.  This is urgently needed because CIES's are increasingly more endangered by new as well as long-known threats and risks.  CIES' have many strengths to deal with these but also many deficiencies or weaknesses.  Strengths and deficiencies of systems are relative terms which have to be assessed against potential threats and risks.
   Important potential threats are analysed and, in particular their combinations into new, more severe threats.  Here a viability approach for CIES's is used to analyse their strengths and deficiencies and devise new criteria showing how to make these systems more capable of dealing with threats and more capable of viable evolvement.

TI LIFE-HISTORY AND STATUS OF DELTA SMELT IN THE SACRAMENTO-SAN-JOAQUIN
   ESTUARY, CALIFORNIA
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID STRIPED BASS; MORONE-SAXATILIS; RIVER FLOW; ABUNDANCE; FISHES
AB The delta smelt Hypomesus transpacificus is endemic to the upper Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary. It is closely associated with the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone except when it spawns in fresh water, primarily during March, April, and May. The delta smelt feeds on zooplankton, principally copepods. Its dominant prey was the native copepod Eurytemora affinis in 1972-1974 but the exotic copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in 1988. Because the delta smelt has a 1-year life cycle and low fecundity (mean, 1,907 eggs/female), it is particularly sensitive to changes in estuarine conditions. Tow-net and midwater trawl samples taken from 1959 through 1981 throughout the delta smelt's range showed wide year-to-year fluctuations in population densities. Surveys encompassing different areas showed declines in different years between 1980 and 1983. After 1983, however, all studies have shown that the populations remained at very low densities throughout most of the range. The recent decline of delta smelt coincides with an increase in the diversion of inflowing water during a period of extended drought. These conditions have restricted the mixing zone to a relatively small area of deep river channels and, presumably, have increased the entrainment of delta smelt into water diversions. Restoration of the delta smelt to a sustainable population size is likely to require maintenance of the mixing zone in Suisun Bay and maintenance of net seaward flows in the lower San Joaquin River during the period when larvae are present.

TI SHOULD WE GREEN THE BILL
SO UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The third installment of the University of Illinois Law Review's year-long celebration of the Bill of Rights Bicentennial begins by addressing the effects of the Bill of Rights on environmental concerns.  Professor Freyfogle questions whether the rights protected under the first ten amendments are sufficient in today's world of industry and advanced technology; is it time to adopt a constitutional amendment to protect the environment, a so-called "green amendment"?  Professor Freyfogle surveys the three obvious forms a green amendment could take:  a negative right to be free of governmental degradation of the environment, a positive proclamation of an individual's right to a healthy environment, and an affirmative obligation for the government to ensure a healthy environment.  The author examines these possibilities and assesses their utility in stimulating ways of living on Earth that are sustainable for generations.  Each option, he concludes, has defects and difficulties.  The most useful amendment would be one that fosters in all people, individually and collectively, a duty to respect the Earth, and that gives them the power to reshape institutions and living patterns to carry out that duty.

This system must be fully funded and resourced for the foreseeable future if the service is to be sustainable. Today the major obstacles to effective immunization of young children in developing countries is the inadequate, insecure and unpredictable availability of funds and their management.

AB Weed Science Extension is in a period of change.  Though there is decreased funding for extension in the United States and Europe, the number of programs including extension activities is increasing in developing countries as shown by World Bank funding.  There is a perception problem with the name weed science; we need a strong, recognizable science name.  Decreases in one-on-one contact method for teaching, fewer extension weed specialists, and the increased need for interdisciplinary projects to support Integrated Pest Management and Sustainable Agriculture will increase stresses on our positions.  These factors also increase the challenge for weed specialists and extension advisors (agents) to become leaders in current programs, initiate new multidisciplinary programs, and choose those programs that will benefit our discipline.  Our clientele and the method of communicating with them will change, presenting yet another challenge.

TI OPTIMAL TRANSLOCATION STRATEGIES FOR SAVING THE BLACK RHINO
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the past 30 years the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) populations in Africa have dwindled dramatically. To enhance the survival prospects of the species, a national conservation strategy has been developed in South Africa. Its main goal is to formulate and implement policies to increase the southern African rhino population as rapidly as possible. This involves translocating animals from areas where the population is approaching the ecological carrying capacity and establishing new viable populations in other suitable reserves.
   A non-linear differential equation model for a population of black rhino was developed. The model is used with a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to investigate a number of issues relating to the translocation of rhino from well-stocked, high-density areas to low-density areas with small herds or no herds. Firstly, the model is used to determine the maximum sustainable yield from the well-stocked reserves. The model is then applied to a newly established population to determine optimal import policies. Finally, the model is extended to include both an established exporting population and a new understocked importing population. Simulations are performed to give an indication of the number and age of animals which should be translocated to maximise the growth rate of the total rhino population in southern Africa.

TI WETLANDS IN DRYLANDS - KEY RESOURCES FOR AGRICULTURAL AND PASTORAL
   PRODUCTION IN AFRICA
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Valley bottomland wetlands are of major importance in agricultural and pastoral systems in savanna Africa.  They act as key resources for cultivators and pastoralists, providing a source of arable land or grazing during droughts or the dry season.  As well as sustaining rural livelihoods and increasing food security, wetland patches allow the opportunity for diversification of crop production and the provision of a wide range of direct and indirect benefits. Wetlands are central to resource-management strategies that make use of catenal variations and seasonal and interannual changes in resource availability. Such wetland patches are also of major importance in land-tenure regimes and resource-access conflicts. With increasing resource pressure in Africa's drylands, wetlands are becoming even more valuable components of agroecosystems. Land-management policy needs to take account of wetland-area significance and develop effective economic techniques to assess their value, appropriate technologies for their sustainable use and land use and tenure policies that recognize the importance of wetlands in dryland areas.

TI RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT ISSUES FOR AFRICAN DRYLANDS
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The African drylands have proven staggeringly vulnerable during the last two decades.This article summarizes major current research on environment/development issues in the drylands, with respect, not only to environmental vulnerability, but also to other major obstacles towards sustainable development. It highlights three interrelated dimensions of security; environmental security, food security, and international security. It is illuminated that food production may be undermined by regional armed conflicts which block efforts to improve food security as well as jeopardize sustainability. Once this obstacle is removed, the major issue is; how to offset food production and environmental management. To secure livelihood at the local level, demands the effectuation of levels of empowerment appropriate and capable of transcending the conventional notions of popular participation. Of greatest significance is the comprehension of decision-making processes to encompass the local community, national, regional and even global perspectives. It is suggested here that efforts towards sustainable environment/development are better based on interdisciplinary research and cross-sectoral profile linking policy and adaptive research.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English

ID SUSTAINABLE-YIELD; FISHERIES
AB Spawner-recruit relationships (SRRs) are indeterminate for most species. Earlier workers proposed solving" amount of harvest" problems for such cases by tacitly assuming that the SRR is density independent (a straight line through the origin) for the available data. I extend that concept and demonstrate a technique for solving "method of harvest" problems when the SRR is indeterminate. This technique uses spawning biomass per recruit, rather than fishing effort, as the benchmark for comparing alternative methods of harvest. Yields from different harvesting methods are deemed comparable only when they produce the same spawning biomass per recruit. If the comparisons are consistent over the entire range of spawning biomass per recruit values, one can evaluate the relative merits of competing methods of harvest without the benefit of spawner-recruit data. Although this technique does not determine the optimal gear selectivity, it allows comparisons of sustainable yields from currently available gear types. The technique is particularly useful for analyzing fishery allocation and by-catch problems. Two life history parameters, critical age (age at which a cohort maximizes its biomass or dollar value) and the age at 50% sexual maturity, may be most important in determining the optimal method of harvest (fishing gear selectivity).

TI SIMULATION-MODEL OF NATURAL TROPICAL FOREST DYNAMICS
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
ID GROWTH; CARBON; SYSTEMS
AB Assessments of the long-term natural regeneration of tropical forests following selective logging are today mostly based on extrapolation of limited empirical observations. Mounting evidence suggests that current logging policies overestimate forest regrowth by a wide margin, and are therefore not sustainable. The need for more reliable assessment of natural forest growth dynamics has led to the development of a vertically and spatially structured dynamic simulation model of natural forest development. The model accounts explicitly for biomass and tree numbers in five distinct canopy layers (seedlings, saplings, poles, main canopy, emergents). Energy accounting of assimilation and dissimilation rates leads to biomass, diameter, and height growth in each layer. Leaf mass in each layer determines photoproduction, and light and photosynthesis conditions in lower layers. Transitions to higher layers, mortalities in each layer, and seed events are accounted for. The basic model simulates the development dynamics of a forest gap. Parallel computation of spatially distributed single gap models with stochastic mortalities and seed dispersal provides a simulation of the spatial dynamics of the tropical forest mosaic. Simulation results are provided with parameters corresponding to unlogged and logged Malaysian lowland dipterocarp forest.

AB Determination of 9 kinds of herbicides containing nitrogen in agricultural products was studied by GC and HPLC.  FTD-GC and UV-HPLC methods were compared for adaptability, sensitivity of the pesticides, and for interfering peaks from food components.
   Swep (N-phenylcarbamate), diuron, linuron (urea type) and propyzamide (acid amide type) were decomposed during determination by GC.  Alachlor and butachlor were not able to be determined by HPLC.  Sensitivities of the pesticides by GC were 5 times (50 times by the same injection volume) that by HPLC, and GC was more sustainable for in terfering peaks than HPLC.
   Preparation method for test solution was systematically established according to the kind of agricultural products.  Pesticides in common vegetables and fruits were directly determined for the extracts, and recoveries of the pesticides added at 1 ppm were 77.1-96.5%.  Extracts from onion, garlic, etc. were purified on a florisil column before determination, and recoveries of the pesticides added at 1 ppm were 77.2-89.7%.  Extracts from grains, beans, etc. were defatted by coagulation, purified on a florisil column before determination, and recoveries of the pesticides added at 1 ppm were 77.5-89.6%.

AB The spruce budworm outbreak in Newfoundland from 1971 to the early 1980's damaged 50.8 million m3, or nearly 30% of the Island region's softwood growing stock.  Short and intermediate-term economic costs for timber salvage operations and lost stumpage revenues were $72.1 million (1989 dollars).  The budworm damage has created a potential timber supply problem for the next few decades.  Other longer-term effects include potential unemployment in the forest industry, reduced recreational values, and concerns about forest succession on some degraded sites.  The Newfoundland experience with the budworm is a case study of problems arising from failing to manage forests according to the concept of sustainable development.

AB Fertility and fertility regulation remain key issues in dealing with global problems of population control and ecological sustainability in modern society. The present study focuses on reproductive behavior and contraceptive use in a historically high fertility population in rural Southern Appalachia. The methodological design and analytical framework draws upon various survey and field research techniques to provide an integrated community study of fertility and family planning. Interviews were conducted with 407 husband-present women of childbearing age. A sub-sample of 105 of the same women was followed up for in-depth interviews. Ethnographic data were also gathered within the community in order to assess available services and knowledge about and attitudes toward fertility regulation. Study results show that although the community remains economically poor and relatively isolated, it has undergone a dramatic decline in fertility, and demonstrates a high level of support for fertility regulation, both at the community and individual level. This research tends to support the theoretical position that fertility decline in contemporary populations may be due as much to the availability and accessibility of modern contraceptive delivery systems as it is to the level of socio-economic development.

TI BIOLOGICAL POTENTIAL AND ECONOMIC-FEASIBILITY OF INTERCROPPING OILSEEDS
   AND PULSES WITH SAFFLOWER (CARTHAMUS-TINCTORIUS) IN DRYLANDS
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB An experiment was conducted to evaluate the sustainable intercrop association for 'A 300' safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) with 'T 397' linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), 'BR 23' toria [Brassica rapa (L.) Thell. emend. Metzger var napus L.; syn B. napus L. var napus L. sensu stricto], 'Varuna' rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) and 'BR 77' chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) during 1985-88.  Among intercrop associations, linseed sown between 40 cm row spacing of safflower gave grain yield of 860 kg/ha.  It also gave the maximum land-equivalent ratio (1.34), product of crowding coefficient (K = 4.86), monetary advantage (Rs 1 187/ha), net return/Re investment (Rs 2.08) and moderate net return (Rs 3 160/ha) together with relative net return of Rs 1.60 compared with sole safflower.  It proved the best intercrop stand among all the crop associations.

AB In the years prior to independence, farmers had access to the international market through the production of export crops which at that time received considerable input from research. Access to export crops has dwindled, support for research by national governments is disappointing, human resource development is inadequate, donor funding is uncoordinated, and the food crisis has taken on political dimensions. The assumption that direct importation of western technology can solve the problems of Africa is no longer valid in the face of several failures. The challenge to national agricultural research systems and the problems associated with the generation or adapting of farmer-oriented, location-specific technologies for sustaining agricultural production are discussed. Examples are drawn from India and an agenda for action, involving national governments, the international agricultural research centres and donors, in resolving these problems is presented.

AB Insect rearing and its management is a prerequisite in developing IPM packages for various food crops. Insects reared for the development of these packages should be regularly monitored for quality in order to ensure success. This paper describes various methods of rearing followed at the ICIPE in the process of IPM development. The rearing of Chilo partellus is described as an example of large-scale rearing. Steps in the experimental rearing of Busseola fusca are outlined. The rearing of an egg parasitoid, Trichogramma mwanzai is described as a vital technology in the IPM of maize and sorghum. The value of quality control is emphasized using the rearing of the phytoseiid mite, Neoseiulus teke as an example.

TI A TECHNOLOGY FOR PROGRAM MAINTENANCE - PROGRAMMING KEY RESEARCHER
   BEHAVIORS IN A STUDENT HOUSING COOPERATIVE
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
DE MAINTENANCE; EXPERIMENTER BEHAVIORS; STUDENT HOUSING COOPERATIVE
AB Behavioral researchers play critical, but often unanalyzed, roles in the programs they develop. Unless they replace their key activities with standardized procedures, their continued participation may be essential to program success-a situation that is often not only impractical but may be prohibitively expensive and disliked by local staff. This study was conducted in a student housing cooperative that is dependent on dose researcher supervision for its continued health and survival. A key activity of the co-op researchers was to provide public recognition for good job performance by co-op members. The purposes of this study were (a) to replace that idiosyncratic recognition with systematic procedures so members, instead of the researchers, would provide public recognition to each other for good job performance; and (b) to evaluate those procedures by comparing job performance when member-delivered recognition was provided and when it was not. When the procedures were in place, job performance increased and fines for poor job performance and complaining at meetings decreased. This study suggests that procedures can be developed to reduce program reliance on the researcher that are effective, inexpensive, sustainable, and acceptable to the participants-a first step toward developing a technology of program maintenance.

AB The tensile strength of the muscle fibre surface membrane was estimated (1) from the suction required to burst membrane patches and (2) by aspiration of sarcolemmal vesicles into micropipettes of uniform bore. Each method gave an average value dose to 60-mu-N cm-1 for the maximum tension sustainable by normal mouse sarcolemma and only slightly lower values for sarcolemma from mdx mice which lack dystrophin. The elastic modulus of area expansion, as measurable by pipette aspiration of sarcolemmal vesicles, was found to have an average value of 3160-mu-N cm-1 for normal and 2770-mu-N cm-1 for mdx mouse sarcolemma.
   The tensile strength of the sarcolemma is much too small for any differences in it to be the basis for the different osmotic behaviour of normal and mdx muscle fibres reported recently (Menke & Jockusch, 1991). By analogy with the better understood origin of the osmotic fragility of different types of red blood cells, the higher osmotic fragility of mdx muscle fibres is suggested to be of morphological origin. We postulate that dystrophin functions as an element of the submembrane cytoskeleton so as to maintain the normal folding which safeguards the sarcolemma against mechanical damage.

SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE

DT Article
AB In this paper I summarize the conclusions from a series of three consultations that I have organized with leading agricultural, environmental and health scientists, with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, to explore the constraints on sustainable growth in agricultural production (Ruttan, 1989, 1990a, b). I explore a number of agricultural, resource, environmental and health concerns that will condition the capacity of the agricultural sector to respond to the demands that population and income growth will place on the sector, particularly in the developing countries of Latin America, Asia and Africa. Before doing so however, I would like to place these concerns about the implications of natural resource availability and environmental change within a broader historical context.

TI LAND-BASED LIMITATIONS AND THREATS TO WORLD FOOD-PRODUCTION
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The decreasing availability of new productive lands for agricultural use combines with many threats of degradation to lands now in productive use to pose serious challenges to scientists, planners and policy makers who aim to meet the ever expanding demand for food, fodder, fuel, and fibre around the globe. Constraints to productive land use may be physical or biological, natural or man-made. All prevent the realization of high and sustainable production goals, particularly in the developing and less developed countries. Climate, topographic and water supply constraints are, in general, less manageable than are soil-based constraints; these can be alleviated by an abundance of available technologies. The current emphasis towards agricultural sustainability is very timely for countering the threats of degradation to the availability and productivity of land resources as well as the quality of the environment.

DT Article
AB Food and nutrition security involves physical and economic access to balanced diets and safe drinking water to all human beings. The challenges faced by scientists working on sustainable agricultural systems in industrialized and developing nations are different, with the former being concerned with defending the high yield levels already obtained and the latter, struggling to raise substantially the productivity per units of land, water, labour and energy without ecological harm. The new paradigm of agricultural research and development based on concurrent attention to issues of ecological sustainability, economic viability and social equity needs for its adoption intensive research on blending traditional and frontier technologies. It also needs new measurement and monitoring tools and genetic resources and enhancement centres.

AB A consequence of intensive livestock production is an increase in the incidence and impact of gastrointestinal (GI) parasites.  Farmers have sought to redress this shift in the natural host-parasite relationship by chemotherapy.  However, with the widespread development of resistance to anthelmintics and the current impetus for sustainable agricultural practices, alternatives such as vaccines are being sought to maintain animal productivity.  In this article, David Emery and Barry Wagland discuss recent advances in immunity to nematode infections of ruminants and the development of vaccines made possible by the dogged persistence and ingenuity of cadres of parasitologists who have done more than 'go throught the motions'.

TI IMPROVING FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH-CARE IN THE CARIBBEAN -

SO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES

DT Article
AB Structural adjustment is reducing the traditional dominant role of the state in the financing and provision of health care. Issues of equity, allocative efficiency, sustainability and clinical freedom are brought into question. This paper examines two models of escalating health costs and discusses the possibilities and limitations of cost sharing (mainly health insurance), cost recovery (user fees) and cost containment (privatisation and decentralisation) measures in the health sector. It also explores additional measures to improve financial management in the health sector - this must be seen as a moral obligation by all rather than a managerial imperative by a few.

TI THE SOUTHERN MOUNT KENYA FOREST SINCE INDEPENDENCE - A SOCIAL ANALYSIS
   OF RESOURCE COMPETITION
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Large forest reserves represent a long-standing state response to tropical forest destruction.  There are, however, growing doubts about their effectiveness as sustainable resource management regimes.  This case study uses a social and historical perspective to examine conflicts about the use and management of the Mount Kenya Reserve in Kirinyaga District, Kenya since independence in 1963.  Official policies and practices have treated local households and small-scale forest enterprises as the most serious threat to the reserve.  In contrast, the paper argues that forest degradation has long been associated with official mismanagement and government-sanctioned development activities.  In addition, it suggests that planned and spontaneous conversion of woodlands accelerated in the mid-1980s largely because of the implementation of government plans to establish extensive forest plantations.  The paper also discusses proposals by the local and national government to convert forest reserves into tea revenue farms.

TI PARTICIPATORY MANAGEMENT IN LARGE IRRIGATION SYSTEMS - ISSUES FOR
   CONSIDERATION
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The inclusion of farmers in the decision-making process of management of irrigation systems is now accepted as necessary to increase productivity and income among the poor in the Third World.  Hence, farmer participation is not simply a call for empowerment and mobilization of a hitherto powerless group but, more fundamentally, a development strategy.  The author evaluates the experience of participatory management in Sri Lanka and arrives at general conclusions, taking into account the size and complexity of the irrigation system, objectives, and capacity of agencies and farmers for participatory management as key aspects in a sustainable development strategy.

AB One important facet of the technological solution to the problems of declining tree cover (which for many people means a shortage of energy), decreasing economic viability of agricultural enterprises and environmental degradation in the form of soil erosion, three of the major problems facing rural communities in the less developed areas of southern Africa, may lie in the field of agroforestry.
   A review of past successful and unsuccessful experiences in agroforestry suggests a number of constraints and policy issues that must be carefully examined in southern Africa, and the means to alleviate them carefully evaluated, if the potential contribution of agroforestry to sustainable development is to be realised: - Inappropriate government policies or legislation that constrain tree growing and harvesting by farmers, particularly insecure land tenure and the inadequate formulation of agricultural/afforestation/rural development policies. - The lack of incentives for tree planting, such as inadequate access to seedlings, low confidence in or lack of awareness of appropriate land use systems, and inadequate access to markets. - Weak, poorly trained, understaffed and underfunded extension services. - Inadequate communication and coordination among agriculture, forestry, and livestock development personnel. - The absence of site-specific research needed to adapt agroforestry principles to the wide range of social and ecological conditions encountered in developing areas.

SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyzes both positive and negative environmental impacts associated with, U.P. Government Chittaurgarh irrigation project, situated in the outer Indian Himalayas. The construction of a dam and canals have had a serious impact on flora and fauna. Agricultural and grazing lands have been lost by utilization of 405 ha Himalayan forest-land upstream and 212 ha of cultivated land downstream of the project. Impacts expected after canal operation include: rise in watertable; waterlogging; increased salinity, due to clay dominated soils with low permeability, and high watertable (0.43 m) during post-monsoon period; fuelwood and fodder crises due to deforestation in the catchment area; weed infestation, crop pests; and human diseases, e.g. malaria, poliomyelitis, filariasis and goitre. The siltation will increase 20 times after one decade due to the poor vegetation cover in the catchment area. Positive impacts include: flood control, increase in agricultural production (mainly rice, 25 330 t yr-1) and improvement in socioeconomic conditions. Guidelines have been developed to eliminate negative impacts at an early stage, to ensure sustainable development, and to protect natural resources.

TI ERGOPEPTINE ALKALOID PRODUCTION BY ENDOPHYTES IN A COMMON TALL FESCUE
   GENOTYPE
SO CROP SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID ACREMONIUM-COENOPHIALUM
AB The fungal endophyte, Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones & Gams, is present in many tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.) pastures. It imparts fitness-related traits to the tall fescue plant but produces ergopeptine alkaloids, which may be the cause of fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock. Inasmuch as the endophyte provides the plant with added vigor, development of endophyte-infected tall fescue populations that are incapable of producing ergopeptine alkaloids may be a solution to providing a sustainable nontoxic grass base for livestock producers. Our objective was to study changes in ergopeptide alkaloid production in a common tall fescue genotype that was infected by two different endophyte isolates that express different levels of alkaloids when in their host plants. Endophyte-free tall fescue Genotype PDN2 explants were cultured in vitro to obtain 28-d-old calli. Endophytes EDN2 and EDN11 isolated from infected PDN2 and another plant genotype PDN11 were cultured and inserted into germinating somatic embryos by placing pieces of mycelium into slits at the base of the noninfected embryonic PDN2 explant. Both endophyte-infected and -free plants were regenerated from callus culture. Regenerated plants with each reinfected endophyte were grown with their endophyte-infected naturally occurring forms to compare endophyte behavior within a common plant genotype under greenhouse conditions. The PDN11 plant with its naturally occurring endophyte was a high alkaloid producer while PDN2 was a low alkaloid producer. When the endophytes EDN11 and EDN2 were reinfected into noninfected individuals of PDN2, the resulting plants were low alkaloid producers. These data suggest that the plant plays a major role in controlling the expression of the genetic potential of endophytes for ergopeptine alkaloid production.

TI CO2 EMISSIONS FROM THE PRODUCTION AND COMBUSTION OF FUEL ETHANOL FROM
   CORN
SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Concern over the increasing concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere is causing us to re-evaluate how we use energy. In particular, we need to inquire if there are alternative energy systems which discharge less net CO2 per unit of energy service. This paper deals with the CO2 fluxes associated with the use of one biomass fuel, ethanol derived from corn. In a sustainable agricultural system, there is no net CO2 flux to the atmosphere from the corn itself but there is a net CO2 flux due to the fossil-fuel supplements currently used to produce and process corn. A comparison between ethanol from corn and gasoline from crude oil becomes very complex because of the variability of corn yield, the lack of available data on corn processing, and the complexity of treating the multiple products from corn processing. When the comparison is made on an energy content basis only, with no consideration of how the products are to be used, and at the margin of the current U.S. energy system, it appears that there is a net CO2 saving associated with ethanol from corn. This net saving in CO2 emissions may be as large as 40% or as small as 20%, depending on how one chooses to evaluate the by-product credits. This analysis also demonstrates that the frequently posed question, whether the energy inputs to ethanol exceed the energy outputs, would not be an over-riding consideration even if it were true, because most of the inputs are as coal and natural gas, whereas the output is as a high-quality liquid fuel.

ID DRUG-USERS; AIDS; RISK; REDUCTION
AB A total of 85 HIV seropositive subjects among consecutive new registrants in the STD Department were given health education measures directed to avoiding high risk behaviours and also the events with a high potential for transmission of infection.  The emphasis was on the use of condoms, discontinuing promiscuity, abstaining from homosexual acts and avoidance of pregnancy and advice against marriage for those contemplating it.  The Health Education Programme was delivered individually to each subject over two or three sessions, each lasting for 30 to 45 min.  At the time of follow up (one to 24 months) 42 per cent of subjects had become non-promiscuous.  There was a good compliance on advice against marriage and pregnancy.  Seven infants born during the follow up period were seronegative.  The use of condom was not found to be acceptable.  The prostitutes comprised the most resistant group to education.  Among the factors that influenced the behaviour change favourably was the absence of earlier STD or a short duration of the current STD.  Literacy, marital status, awareness of AIDS did not influence the outcome of education.  The study demonstrated the feasibility of health education at individual level in the clinical setting of an STD Department.  A longer follow-up may indicate the sustainability of behaviour change in the subjects.

AB A currently held view is that Information Technology (IT) has high potential for providing competitive advantage. This paper critically examines this view, particularly how IT can confer sustainable, strategic advantage. The areas in which IT can confer advantage are reviewed, both within the Competitive Arena and in the associated Industry. The analysis then shifts to cover the wider, technological environment within which the Industry operates. The consequences of the technological environment to the types of task undertaken by an organization are then analysed to determine where sustainable strategic advantage might lie. Our conclusion is that areas of sustainable strategic advantage through IT are not numerous and lie predominantly within the corporate culture.

TI COLD WATER EXTRACT OF MALTS - SOLUBLE CARBOHYDRATE AND MALTING BEHAVIOR
SO JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTE OF BREWING
LA English
DT Article
DE COLD WATER EXTRACT; RAPID TESTS
AB A rapid and simple method for the determination of the carbohydrate fraction of the Cold Water Extract of malts is described.  The extraction is preceded by treatment of the malt with barium hydroxide, which is then removed by precipitation with zinc sulphate.  This both deactivates enzymes and prevents solubilization of protein.  The method was modified so that it was both faster and used smaller samples.  A sustainable rate of 80 samples per day can be tested by one operator.
   This method was used to follow the pattern of modification through malted grain by analysis of pearler residues.  Malting and non-malting cultivars differed in the localization of modification through the grain, with modification confined to the outer layers in non-malting cultivars.  The method was also used to measure the proportion of soluble carbohydrate formed during malting with increasing modification.  The proportion of extract solubilized during malting by malting cultivars was less than that solubilized by feed cultivars.

TI NAVAL COMBAT LOGISTICS SUPPORT SYSTEM
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY

DT Article
DE DEFENSE STUDIES; NAVAL LOGISTICS; MODELING; PREDICTION; DECISION AID
AB The subject matter is the sustainability of naval forces in combat and the intimate relationships between tactics and logistics. The observation is made that it has been a long time since the United States Navy has worried about logistics in combat and that to some extent combat logistics have become somebody else's responsibility. It is argued that combat logistics is inescapably the force commander's responsibility and its dimensions are sketched. Necessarily, the amount of data and calculation in extensive if an accurate picture of the combat logistics states of the force are to be maintained predictions of future states are to be made. It is in the predictions of future states that the interactions between tactics and logistics become most apparent. The data storage and retrieval and computational aspects suggest a microprocessor-based support system. BGLCSS (battle group logistics co-ordinator support system) is a program of combat logistics data, event routines, and algorithms designed to allow the logistics co-ordinator to track and predict force combat logistics states and provide timely and meaningful insight to the force commander.

AB The highland valleys of Papua New Guinea contain substantial areas of steepland under dense human occupation. These steeplands are not severely afflicted by rill or gully erosion, but they are very liable to mass movement. The people using them have a range of cultivation systems that contain some elaborations directed specifically to slope management, but not of an order comparable with those of some other montane areas, nor have there been major changes within the past half century. Specific cases of recent slope failure, and their subsequent use history, are presented in some detail to assess the problems encountered. Discussion then focuses on a specific valley where it can be established that high density occupation has a history extending over several generations. In conclusion, plans for determining the sustainability of present cultivation on these slopes are outlined.

SO SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Major millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L. R.Br.) producing soils of West Africa ar mainly found in the Sudano-Sahelian agroecological zone. These soils are generally sandy in texture, have poor buffering capacity, and are low in native fertility. For successful management of these soils for sustainable production, fertility factors influencing nutrient availability need to be evaluated. Soils were sampled at selected locations throughout the agroecological zone. The nutrient status of these soils was determined and related to P dynamics. Soils were generally neutral to acid in reaction, but few had any measurable amounts of exchangeable Al. Total P, Bray 1 extractable P, and P adsorption maxima were low which reflected their low levels of clay and organic matter. Phosphorus sorption characteristics were controlled by the poorly crystalline Al and Fe phases and the soil clay fraction. The poorly crystalline Al and Fe phases were highly correlated with the clay fraction (r = 0.99***). The P external requirement ranged from 11 to 40 mg P kg-1 soil. Given the low levels of total and labile P in these soils, P amendments will be necessary for sustained productivity. However, moderate amounts of P amendments would be necessary as a result of the relatively low fixation capacity of these soils.

AB Sustainable development is emphasized in the Dutch national environmental policy plan (NEPP).  This plan is based upon a long term environmental survey carried out by the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection (RIVM).  In this respect the institute functions as a national environmental planning agency.  The nature of environmental problems is described, resulting in a division of problems on five scales:  global, continental, fluvial, regional and local.  Attempts are made to define sustainable development and to select indicators related to the dynamics of the processes involved.  Some examples are given to aid the construction of strategies for sustainable development on each of the scales mentioned.  It is illustrated that dynamic models are needed for policy exercises within a scale-related hierarchy.

TI POVERTY AND INCOME-DISTRIBUTION DURING ADJUSTMENT - ISSUES AND EVIDENCE
   FROM THE OECD PROJECT
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper draws lessons from country studies of the effects of adjustment policies on the distribution of income in Chile, Cote d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Malaysia, Morocco, and Indonesia. Following an analytical discussion of the issues that must be confronted in the design of adjustment programs with a poverty focus, the paper synthesizes the main conclusions from the interpretative description in the country studies. Simulation exercises exploring the effects of the design of the adjustment packages in these countries on poverty and the sustainability of the measures undertaken show considerable diversity in the evolution of income distribution during adjustment. These exercises also expose the fatal flaws of narrowly designed adjustment programs. Adjustment programs, whether efficiency-focused or welfare-focused, will fail when they do not recognize the interdependence of the three criteria of efficiency, welfare, and political feasibility. Thus adjustment programs must be carefully packaged to fit country circumstances, taking into account both the political and economic environments.

TI POLITICALLY FEASIBLE AND EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT - SOME ALTERNATIVES FOR
   ECUADOR
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB How can a government beholden to agroexporting interests survive while carrying out a stabilization program inimical to other powerful interests? How can it reduce the social costs of the program? The authors review the Ecuadorian experience with these dilemmas and build a real-financial CGE model to explore alternative approaches to stabilization made necessary by both a reduction in public foreign borrowing and a fall in world oil prices. The approaches considered include exchange rate devaluation, fiscal austerity directed at current or investment spending, and reduced growth of money supply. Each approach is assessed for its effects on GDP growth, on rural and urban poverty, and for its political sustainability assessed by changes in utility for politically dominant rural and urban interests. The results show that cutting current spending is best for restoring growth and protecting the rural poor, but is politically untenable. Making this approach politically feasible requires: complementary economic reforms to increase the flexibility of the economy and raise the share of public investment going to agriculture; social programs allowing some leakages in antipoverty transfers toward politically essential nonpoor; and political campaigns to increase the relative autonomy of the state, lower the social rate of discount whereby the public assesses the outcome of policy, and induce the public to compare policy outcomes against the counterfactual scenario of no intervention instead of pre-crisis living standards.

AB Biomass provides about 14% of the world's energy, about 25 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/day) (= 55 EJ).  It is the most important (35%) source of energy in developing countries but also plays a significant role in a number of industrial countries, eg the USA obtains 4% (1 1/2 mboe/day) of its energy from biomass, and Sweden about 14%; both countries have plans to increase bioenergy production and use.  Annual resources of biomass are eight times the world's energy-use but the problem is getting the energy to those who need it in an environmentally sustainable manner, and which is also economic when all internal and external costs are accounted for.  There is considerable scope to modernize biomass energy production delivery systems to provide varied energy carriers such as electricity, liquid fuels and gases.  Successful case studies for traditional and modern biofuels in a number of countries are presented.  Economic, social and environmental issues are examined over the whole biomass energy spectrum.

AB Coastal waters in South Johore, Malaysia are polluted to various degrees.  The major pollution sources are domestic wastes from human settlements, agro-based wastes from palm oil mills and rubber processing factories, industrial effluents from industrial estates and discharges from animal farms.  These pollution problems have adversely affected resources such as fisheries, recreational potential as well as the general aesthetic quality of the coastal environment particularly the Inner Johore Strait.  Hence proper management and control measures are urgently needed to protect and further enhance the water quality to ensure environmentally sustainable development.  This study examines various management options to control the pollution in the Inner Johore Strait.  The options involve partial opening as well as complete removal of the Causeway to improve the tidal flow for more effective dilution and dispersion of pollutants.  Computer simulation models are used to assess the impacts of the proposed options.

TI INSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS IN STRENGTHENING ON-FARM CLIENT-ORIENTED
   RESEARCH IN NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL-RESEARCH SYSTEMS - LESSONS FROM A
   9-COUNTRY STUDY
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID TECHNOLOGY
AB Many national research systems have launched major on-farm research efforts aimed at generating relevant technologies for resource-poor farmers, but institutional and policy factors have often hindered the effectiveness of these efforts. Experience has shown that on-farm research, linking farmers, researchers, and technology transfer agents, poses special organizational and managerial challenges. Institutional innovations and strong policy commitment are needed if on-farm research is to succeed in meeting the needs of resource-poor farmers. Sound research methods alone are not sufficient.
   This paper reviews key policy, organizational and managerial considerations for integrating on-farm client-oriented research as an effective and stable component of national agricultural research systems. It summarizes the findings of a major study sponsored by the International Service for National Agricultural Research on institutional factors affecting the performance and sustainability of such research systems. The conclusions are based on the systematic analysis of over 25 discrete on-farm research efforts in nine developing countries. The objective is to provide research managers, on-farm researchers and on-farm research advisors with concrete and practical insights for strengthening on-farm research and its contribution to the generation and transfer of relevant technologies.

SO GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW

DT Article
AB Tourist trekking is expanding among the hill tribes of northern Thailand.  These tribes are chronically poor, contribute to deforestation and soil erosion, and have been a focal point of past insurgency.  Development schemes have been initiated, but none has been totally successful in solving these problems.  Trekking annually now attracts more than 100,000 persons to the region and accounts for the influx of approximately U.S.$2,000,000.  This benefit must be weighed against the cultural and social effects on the native groups.  Tourism, properly managed, could both facilitate changes advantageous to the hill tribes and minimize environmental degradation.

TI EQUITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY

DT Article
AB It is now conventional wisdom that traditional patterns of economic growth must be changed to reduce the strain on the global environmental system and ensure that development is sustainable.  Clearly sustainable development raises the issue of intergenerational equity; current consumptive use of environmental resources must be curbed to allow the needs of future generations to be met.  However, policies designed to promote sustainable development or improve environmental quality cannot be divorced from questions about the present day distribution of wealth and welfare.  It is argued that the apparent consensus between Governments over the need to implement global, precautionary and sustainable environmental policies is an illusion.  There is in reality little agreement over desirable management strategies and still less over who should pay the costs of any required policy shift.

AB In the 21st century, vastly more people will need to gain sustainable livelihoods in difficult environments.  For this, changes are needed on the part of outsiders - professionals, officials and others - who have overlooked or underestimated the complexity and diversity of rural conditions, rural people's ability to take a long-term view, and their knowledge, creativity and competence in presenting and analysing complex information.  To serve poor people better, much of the challenge now is methodological:  for better learning from, with and by rural people; for enabling them to express and enhance their competence and creativity; and for the improvement and spread of new methods for changing the behaviour and attitudes of outsiders.

DT Article
AB Emergent new thinking on pastoral livelihood systems emphasises the strategic importance of high quality resource patches within the landscape, both for pastoral production and for sustainability.  In Mongolia, as in other herding economics, informal land tenure arrangements have evolved at the local level to regulate herders' access to these resources.  This paper consider how, historically, they have operated in conjunction with allocative procedures of a more formal nature, under first feudal-theocratic then socialist state structures.  A deliberate strategy that seeks to combine various customary and collective forms of tenure with new forms of private ownership may now be of value in the context of contemporary reforms of property legislation under perestroika.  This would assist efforts to increase productivity in the livestock sector, and at the same time help ensure the sustainable management of Mongolia's rangelands in the longer term.

TI NATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN REMOTE-SENSING - A CANADIAN PERSPECTIVE
SO ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
AB A brief review of the federal government's role in developing remote sensing activities in Canada over the years is given. The struggle to map a large country, together with an interest in space, brought about the Canadian remote sensing program. In particular, the paper focuses on the role of Energy, Mines and Resources Canada in coordinating research activities by all levels of government in remote sensing, thus fostering the growth of the remote sensing industry in Canada.
   An overview is given of the expanding remote sensing market. In addition, the paper looks at the present applications of remote sensing to agriculture, forestry and the study of ice caps and fresh water, for example, as well as its use in assessing and preventing environmental disasters. The paper concludes by stressing the importance of remote sensing in meeting the "Challenge of the 90's"-making sustainable development a way of life.

AB Birds have two independent locomotor systems: the forelimbs (wings) are used predominantly for aerial flight, but may be used for underwater propulsion, e.g. in penguins; the hindlimbs (legs) are used for running, surface swimming and diving. In birds of similar mass, energy consumption during flight is approximately 2.5 times greater than that when running or swimming at maximum speed. This difference is the result not only of the larger mass of the flight muscles compared with that of the leg muscles, but also of their greater oxidative capacity. Interestingly, the relationship of energy consumption to body mass in cursorial birds when running is similar to that of volant birds when flying. Energy consumption during diving may be as high in some birds (e.g. tufted duck) as when they are swimming at maximum sustainable speed, and this is not influenced by water temperature.
   The composition of the flight and leg muscles is different. The muscles of the leg consist of deeply situated slow oxidative (SO) fibres, which are active during quiet standing and walking, fast oxidative glycolytic (FOG) fibres, which are recruited during walking and sustained running or swimming, and peripherally located fast glycolytic (FG) fibres, which are recruited at the highest running or swimming speeds. In most volant birds, the pectoralis muscle consists predominantly of FOG fibres with a smaller percentage of FG fibres. There is some controversy over the occurrence of SO fibres in some species, although they are most probably present in those that glide. The FOG fibres are highly oxidative, with a high capillary density.
   The respiratory and cardiovascular adjustments that occur during flying, running and diving are described, and the ability of some species of birds to fly at extremely high altitudes, where the partial pressure is one-third of the sea level value, is discussed.

TI AGRONOMY OF DRYLAND CORN PRODUCTION AT THE NORTHERN FRINGE OF THE
   GREAT-PLAINS
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The farming systems of the semi-arid northern Great Plains, including the Canadian Prairies, suffer from overdependence on a narrow range of crops, particularly wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).  Diversification of economically competitive cropping would greatly enhance the long-term viability and sustainability of agriculture in this large and important region of North America.  The expansion of corn (Zea mays L.) production into the coolest and driest fringe of the northern Great Plains (e.g., southern Alberta) represents one attempt at diversification.  This expansion has largely been on irrigated land, but semi-arid dryland production of corn appears promising.  Eight years of research on dryland corn in southern Alberta focused on hybrid evaluation, irrigated and dryland comparisons, genotypic responses to drought and density stress, optimum plant density, paired row studies, weed control trials, and a 3-yr farm-scale study of three corn-based rotations.  Grain yields of 35 bu/acre on summerfallow were obtained with currently available hybrids for the 2840 growing-degree-day (GDD) area around Medicine Hat in southern Alberta.  Hybrids that yielded well on irrigation tended to yield well on dryland, and the hybrid most tolerant of stress on dryland had a short anthesis-to-silking interval.  Optimum plant densities on dryland are about 12 000 plants/acre, compared with 24 000 on irrigation (annual rainfall of 14 to 16 in.).  Dryland yields were more variable than irrigated yields; the lowest yields on dryland were 31 bu/acre (37% of the highest yields), whereas with irrigation the lowest yields were 81 bu/acre (66% of the highest yields).  Averaged over five location-year combinations, paired rows (two rows 8 in. apart on 30-in. centers) resulted in a 10 bu/acre advantage over conventional 30-in. rows.  The low crop density on dryland allowed late flushes of Russian thistle (Salsola iberica Sennen and Pau) and kochia, [Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad.] to flourish.  A herbicide combination to control this was identified:  pre-plant atrazine combined with postemergence 2,4-D.  Rotation results indicated that corn after corn yielded 18 bu/acre vs. 35 bu/acre for corn after fallow (similar to cereal yields).  Corn shows potential as an alternative dryland crop on the fringes of the northern Great Plains, and may find its place either in a corn-fallow rotation or in a winter wheat-corn-fallow rotation.

TI TECHNOLOGY AS DOMINATION - A PHILOSOPHY OF MANAGEMENT
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB A defensible theory of technology is not merely an academic exercise, but it is an integral part of and tool for management decision making and development policy initiatives. Unfortunately, in public discussion what is passed as technological theories is only unrealistic romantic ideologies rather than any comprehension of the nature of the technological process. Further all formal economic decisions on the choice of technology, technology is either taken as a given, is static, or is the "black box" about which we know nothing. Any action or choice concerning technology involves a theory of technology implicit or explicit. Unfortunately, most often theory has been implicit and therefore unexamined. A central thesis of this paper is that wrong choices of technology flowing from incorrect theory have retarded the development process while conversely rapid economic change that has been taking place can best be explained as flowing from correct technological choices. Recent theories of technology such as those of the appropriate technology and the environmental movement offer a critique against modern technology and offer what the authors of this article consider an unrealistic alternate conceptualization. It is our thesis that the human use of technology is a process of domination and it is only through the understanding of this process that we can find ways of using technology creatively and sustainably. Technological change creates emergent technological possibilities which can only be taken advantage of in a planning process that builds in evaluation as a continuous ongoing activity and is flexible and open-ended.

TI SUSTAINABLE PEOPLE - HYPOTHESES AND A CALL FOR PUBLISHABLE RESEARCH
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In various theoretical and applied disciplines ranging from forestry and medicine to politics and ethics, emphasis is currently being placed on what is called sustainability. To achieve sustainability in these spheres of human activity, people who are directly or indirectly involved need to possess certain attributes, five of which are tentatively postulated as follows: (a) the ability and patience to renounce present gains for those in the future; (b) adequate and relevant knowledge concerning the problems at hand; (c) aesthetic and moral feelings regarding people and their environments; (d) an internal rather than an external orientation, indicating that to some degree human existence can be controlled; and (e) the organization of such attributes in perspective. The Journal of Social Psychology seeks to encourage other efforts to specify the attributes of sustainable people. Articles will be assessed that deal with the theme either by summarizing and coordinating existing studies or by providing new insights through original, scholarly research. If a sufficient number of contributions is received and found acceptable, a special issue of this journal will be devoted to the subject.

AB The haematological and rheological characteristics of blood from seven marine mammal species have been examined to determine the relationship between increased haematocrit, which is correlated with the ability to increase aerobic dive limits, and blood viscosity. The species examined reflect adaptations to a variety of marine niches ranging from coastal to pelagic to ice-edge environments, and exhibit a wide range of diving behaviours. Average haematocrits ranged from 43-45% in bottlenose dolphins, killer whales and California sea lions to more than 60% in the deeper diving species (beluga whales and northern elephant seals). Whole blood viscosity (eta) increased exponentially with haematocrit (eta = 0.96*e0.0335*Hct), representing a two-fold increase from 4.1 cP for killer whale blood to 8.9 cP for northern elephant seal. There was no apparent compensatory mechanism to reduce viscosity at any shear rate. The optimal haematocrit for oxygen transport was calculated to be 40-50% for all species tested. The species with lower haematocrits were within optimal values for oxygen transport, while the two species with the highest haematocrits (beluga whales and northern elephant seals) were above predicted optimal oxygen transport values. On the basis of comparisons of the diving behaviour of these seven species, we suggest that marine mammal species with the greatest adaptation for increased oxygen stores via increased haematocrit have the capacity for deep, long-duration dives, but a limited oxygen transport capacity. We predict that this compromise precludes fast sustainable swimming behaviour in these species.

TI MANUAL RECOVERY OF SHALLOW GROUNDWATER FOR IRRIGATION BY AFRICAN FARMERS
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS PART 1-DESIGN AND
   CONSTRUCTION
LA English
DT Article
AB This Paper describes work carried out over a six-year period (1984-90) in the communal areas of Zimbabwe.  Self-sufficiency and sustainable food security in Africa is one of the goals of the new decade, and irrigation is likely to play a significant role in achieving this objective.  In Zimbabwe, dambos (a form of wetland) represent an underused source of shallow groundwater for cultivation.  Previously, fears of environmental degradation and water resources depletion have led to legislation restricting their utilization.  However, the current hydrological (and socio-economic) research has shown that if the area of cultivation is constrained, and good agricultural practices are employed, there is a potential safely to increase the currently cultivated area by a factor of a least four 80 000 ha.  Irrigated plots are small, typically less than a hectare, and each plot contains a water source which is controlled by a single farmer or family group.  Simple pumps using human power are appropriate for this form of irrigation by rural farmers.  Four types of pump were selected for testing, after initial selection, and two were found suitable for further development.  These are the rope-washer pump and the treadle pump, both of which are now being manufactured in Zimbabwe and require village level maintenance.  Sustainable outputs of at least 1 l/s were easily achieved at low lifts up to 5 m.  The Paper gives details of the performance of the pumps, and of how they have stood up to field use.

TI THE NEW ENVIRONMENTALISM AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmentalism is a metaphor for both how we feel about the natural world, and how we feel we ought to behave towards all living and inanimate objects. Because our values are not consistent, so our environmental ideologies are not consonant. We all experience, to a greater or lesser extent, three levels of "greenness" - dry, shallow and deep. The concept of sustainability is enmeshed in this tripartite interpretation of the world. There is no unity of view as to what sustainability means or how it can be applied to different cultures and economies. What may be necessary is a geography-led approach to sustainable development, incorporating land, culture and enlightenment borne of experience and experimentation. In principle, this should be handled through independent non-governmental channels, and separately monitored.

AB Broadening the framework of environmental impact assessment (EIA) involves an examination of the principles and policies which should underlie ecologically sustainable development.  To work effectively, EIA procedures need to be located within a broad framework of policies and environmental objectives, standards and monitoring.  This paper discusses the political and environmental context in Australia within which the debate on sustainable development is occurring.  Some important principles which underlie an ecologically sustainable development policy framework are discussed.  These include inter-generational equity, conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity, maintenance of natural capital and a recognition of the biophysical limits on natural resource use.  Economic policy needs to emphasise the qualitative aspects of development as opposed to the quantitative growth in resource use.  Several key aspects of a broad Australian policy framework are discussed, including reform of Federal/State environmental arrangements and the establishment of a Federal Environment Protection Agency; development of a systematic means of measuring progress towards an ecologically sustainable development; materials, natural resources, energy, waste, transport and urban development policies.  The overall objective of these policy areas would be to bring the scale of human activity in Australia within the carrying capacity of the environment.

AB This paper reviews the Australian approaches to influencing development through economic evaluation, statutory planning, environmental assessment and pollution control.  It indicates an emphasis on projects rather than policies, and an emphasis on planning stages rather than monitoring and management of implementation and operation.  The requirements of an effective monitoring programme are identified in terms of measuring changes in the entire impact pathway, measuring natural changes with similar consequences and generating data that can be analysed to determine causation of changes.  The Australian approaches to influencing development are examined in relation to achieving sustainable development.  Economic evaluation which discounts future benefits is not consistent with sustainable development's concern of not compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.  Environmental assessment would need expansion in scope to consider resource use and not just individual projects as well as the ongoing management of resources and not just planning of new projects.  Statutory planning could be a valuable tool, but needs to incorporate definitions of appropriate land-use based on sustainable development concepts.  Pollution control would need to be based on the concept of the carrying capacity of receiving environments to absorb wastes, rather than on emission controls.  Model frameworks for resource use and waste management are put forward using sustainable development principles and incorporating monitoring as the basis for control.

AB This paper considers the meaning of "sustainable development", emphasising the broad sense in which development needs to be constructed.  For governments, sustainable development means taking account of environmental consequences, both beneficial and damaging, in all decision making.  It is argued that, given present economic structures, governments need to intervene in favour of the environment.  The main contention is that government, and in particular Ministers and agencies with a mandate for environment protection, need to formulate a strategy for sustainable development as the basis for a coherent approach across government agencies and the private sector.  Such a strategy requires the support of monitoring and reporting mechanisms, yielding accurate and comprehensive data on which to base decisions.  This paper examines the availability of environmental data in New South Wales and recommends the introduction of State of the Environment reporting.  It also recommends the setting of environmental quality goals and measuring of the performance of all agencies whose activities affect the environment against these goals.  Finally, looking to prospects for implementation of the recommended changes, it refers to the greater environmental awareness apparent in institutions and the general public and the need to ensure this becomes a genuine commitment to change.

AB Economic growth will almost certainly continue.  Although there are those who dispute the compatibility between economic growth and environmental sustainability, it is likely that future economic development will be increasingly based on the principle of substainability.  Systems for decision making therefore need to be designed with this in view.  A distinctive feature of the existing decision making process surrounding environmental policy is the minor role played by markets, and the predominance of government intervention in the allocation of resources.  The resolution of environmental issues within the political process has been time consuming and in many cases inadequate.  Critics of the market process argue that private sector agents will try to internalise benefits and externalise costs wherever possible.  However, the political process also creates externalities by diffusing costs and concentrating benefits.  Either way, the potential for the creation of externalities exists.  Hence a combination of market-based policies with some outright regulation is suggested as a means of intergrating economic and environmental considerations.  There is undoubtedly more scope to use market-based mechanisms in the resolution of environmental problems.  In the event of a move to a more market-orientated approach, the role of government would be more to ensure the smooth workings of the market through regulation, the provision of information and education.  Direct regulation could be reserved for the more difficult environmental issues.  In this paper, the potential role of market-based mechanisms in solving environmental problems is examined, with reference to some particular policy instruments.

AB General agreement on the need to conduct our economic activities in a more sustainable manner breaks down into different schools of thought and important value differences once sustainability is examined in detail.  A sustainable energy future presumably means one based on renewable energy supplies, but there are major differences of opinion on the opportunities for energy conservation in the current system, and on the rate of transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources.
   Similar differences between 'technical optimists' and those espousing the ecological view occur in the areas of food and material consumption, employment creation and the desired level of overall resource consumption.  The most difficult questions concern sustainability and Australia's international relations.  To what extent is there a beneficial relationship between international trade and sustainability?  If international disparity of income is one of the greatest obstacles to achieving sustainability, how can it be overcome?
   There are a number of relevant short-term policies that are economically and ecologically beneficial, such as providing fiscal incentives for energy conservation, incentives for renewable energy research and development, pricing and taxing for environmental externalities, and making structural changes within the government.  Longer term, more difficult policies include a re-orientation of education and research towards less resource-intensive industries, seeking smaller, high value export markets, reforming governmental planning processes and involving the community in participative planning.  In the international arena, Australia could take the lead in regional inter-governmental activities, co-ordinate  raw materials resource diplomacy, and stimulate international discussion of mechanisms for income redistribution.

AB Many nations are now pursuing a policy of 'sustainable development', but the interpretation of this concept, as well as practical implementation, pose special difficulties.  However altruistic the intention, a variety of political and administrative barriers arise in trying to move from the outright pursuit of economic growth towards ecologically and socially acceptable forms of development strategies.  In particular, existing interests may be challenged and new programs involve substantial adjustment of extant provisions, threatening profitability, employment and power.  In such circumstances strong countervailing forces for the status quo may emerge.  The difficulty is exacerbated for federal nations in that various levels of government, as well as private corporation positions, may be challenged.

AB Sustainability has to be defined in terms of specific areas of economic and other activity.  Behaviour will be changed only through perceived benefits or the creation of sanctions.  Appropriate legislation is not sufficient, but it is a very important factor in bringing about changed values.  Governments can give leadership through legislation, and there are notable examples of successful leading initiatives.
   The common law tradition is under threat because of legislative environmental controls, yet these are needed if environmental damage is to be reduced.  Examples are given.  There is challenge not only in drafting legislation, but in making it enforceable.  Restrictive rules of law and traditional legal rules on environmental interests need revision.  In all this, history has shown that results are best obtained through cooperation and consultation.

AB While this paper recognises that the goal of sustainability may require philosophical and institutional changes of a radical nature, it compares the strengths and limitations of a range of strategies within the context of reform.  Beginning with education, at the 'soft' end of the spectrum, it works through regulation, rationing, taxing and price controlling, to the 'hard' strategy of public ownership.  But the authors argue that the soft/hard dichotomy is not an accurate perception of the implications of these strategies.  Education may prove to be the most radical tool of all, while the impact of public ownership on the environment depends on the private sectors, and their interdependence, makes value judgements about their respective merits environmentally irrelevant.  Different mixes will be appropriate for different purposes in different contexts.  The important thing is clarity of purpose, which is where value judgements are important, and to select the strategy which will work best to achieve good results without being confused by ideological preconceptions.

AB Debate about the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, and fears that it will result in an intensification of the greenhouse effect and global warming, have spurred consideration of sustainable development.  It has been claimed that technology to improve energy efficiency already exists that is cost-effective without consideration of the gains from abatement of carbon dioxide emissions.  Likewise, changes in the behaviour of households or firms that would result in lower energy use per capita have been predicted as answers to the problem.  But the question of implementation is often ignored or assumed away, while it should correctly be costed into the technology or the behavioral changes.  This paper attempts to redress this lacuna in the debate, by analysing policy options within a framework of exchange, authority, or persuasion.  Carbon taxes and lower interest rates are the recommendation.

AB Policies and institutional arrangements aimed at environmental sustainability need to address both spatial and inter-temporal (inter-generational) externalities, particularly when public goods are involved.  Both types of externalities are extremely complex when they occur at an international level.  International public goods, such as the oceans, atmosphere, biodiversity, and internationally unique areas and phenomena require regulatory arrangements at both national and international level for their protection, maintenance and rationing.  In particular, international standards and rules, beyond those already in existence, for the prevention of transnational and inter-temporal externalities and for the protection of international public goods need to be established by the international community, and accepted and enforced by all members of the community of nations.  Stringent, internationally accepted procedures for environmental impact assessment should be adopted as a first step.

AB With the publication of the Brundtland Report the words "sustainable development" became well known throughout much of the world.  The words were first used in the international context in the World Conservation Strategy published by IUCN in 1980.  By its nature the Brundtland Report is a broad document with sweeping recommendations on a wide range of measures.  Countries and their governments must devise in detail how concepts such as sustainable development can be implemented.  This has involved assessing what sustainable development actually means and considering ways in which it can be implemented at a national level.
   This discussion paper has sought to raise some of the legal issues which need to be considered if the concept of sustainable development is to be implemented at a national or state level in Australia.  It seeks to highlight some of the limits of the legal system, particularly in limiting the discretion of elected representatives who make many of the crucial development decisions.  It suggests changes to existing legal mechanisms such as environmental impact assessment to implement sustainable development objectives and refers to some new measures which should be implemented; for example, a Bill of Environmental Rights and a reversal of the onus in favour of development which presently exists.
   This discussion paper was expressly written to raise points of interest for people with no formal legal training and is not exhaustive of all the possibilities for change.

AB Increasing food production in pace with the growth in population may aggravate environmental problems, and undermine the agricultural resource basis for future production. On the other hand, measures introduced to alleviate pollution and to reduce pressures on the environment from agriculture may lead to lower production and more expensive food. Change and improvement will have to take place over a very broad field, and this will require active cooperation between research institutions, farmers, and the political policy makers. New production technologies and improved plant varieties must be developed, and a better insight must be pined into the links between machinery, soil, plants and animals.

   The rapidly accelerating growth in population and release of industrial gases into the atmosphere pose separate threats to our survival.  Silviculture, or tree farming, is a positive step toward offsetting air pollution and more productive use of renewable resources.  Technology, through better standards of living and improved health care, is encouraging a slowdown in population growth.
   TAPPI President F. Keith Hall takes a critical, though hopeful look at some of the global issues that will be crucial to the future of the pulp and paper industry-and all life on earth.

TI AREA INTENSIVE FARMING IN CHINA - AN EXAMPLE
SO TROPENLANDWIRT
LA German
DT Article
AB The restricted availability of arable land in China makes an intensive farming of the land necessary. Over the years the so-called "three- dimensional farming" has been developed, a system which allows intensive farming of the land. An example of these three-dimensional farming practised in the northern chinese plains, is described and discussed in this paper. It is also questioned wether this system is sustainable, since it depends on intensive irrigation under conditions of a restricted ground water supply and a high labour input.

TI FUELWOOD, SUBSISTENCE FORAGING, AND THE DECLINE OF COMMON PROPERTY
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Ideally, common property can adapt to particularities in the social and physical environment to create environmentally sustainable regimes. In practice, common fuelwood foraging has been subject to numerous problems intimately linked to the historically changing role of common property. Schematic histories of fuelwood and forests in Europe and Java illustrate how common property systems have been undermined, and the different implications their dissolution can have. Both cases indicate that fuelwood problems may be best interpreted within the rubric of subsistence foraging and the decline of common property, rather than that of energy shortage and tree mismanagement.

TI PLANNING FOR SUSTAINABILITY - ACCESS TO FUELWOOD IN DHANUSHA DISTRICT,
   NEPAL
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID DEFORESTATION
AB This paper examines the problem of putting sustainable development ideas into practice through the detailed consideration of a recent fuelwood planning exercise in Dhanusha District in southern Nepal. The ways in which biomass fuels are produced and used are examined through their relationship to tenurial relations and proximity to the district's forest area. From this, the scale and nature of fuelwood problems are identified and a strategy to develop sustainable solutions to these problems is advanced. This strategy is based on the involvement of the local community at every stage of the planning process and the empowerment of local people through their direct control over decisions on the use of land and financial resources. The study concludes that sustainable planning is possible, but is far from easy. Above all, it depends on a different relationship between agencies of the state and the local communities which planning is intended to help.

TI OPTIMIZATION OF THE CHANNELING RADIATION SOURCE CRYSTAL TO PRODUCE
   INTENSE QUASI-MONOCHROMATIC X-RAYS
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID ELECTRONS
AB Channeling radiation is a source of intense, tunable, quasimonochromatic x rays produced by electrons traveling along a direction of symmetry through a crystal.  We analyze the effect of the channeling source crystal, through both its composition and lattice structure, on the number of photons emitted per electron, the linewidths of the radiation, and the maximum sustainable currents to identify the crystal which will yield the most photons in a bandwidth of less than 10% full width at half maximum (FWHM).  Although high atomic number (Z) crystals produce a greater number of photons per electron, given their poor thermal properties these crystals cannot sustain as high average currents as lower Z crystals.  The linewidths of the channeling radiation emitted from high Z crystals are as large as 50% FWHM, and electrons are dechanneled more quickly in these crystals, limiting their use as a quasimonochromatic x-ray source.  Given its exceptional thermal conductivity and narrow linewidths, diamond is the optimal source crystal for the production of intense, quasimonochromatic x rays using channeling radiation.

AB Erosion of mountain slopes by landslides and mudflows is mainly connected with extreme events such as rainstorms of high intensity or earthquake shocks as the trigger mechanism. Large mudflows can be very destructive and wipe out forests and villages and kill thousands of people. Monitoring and studies of mudflows are important for disaster prevention and for the sustainable use of land and water resources particularly in mountain areas threatened by deforestation. We describe and discuss cases of large mudflows in Norway, Tanzania, Brazil, Colombia and China.

TI MINIMIZING ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH-EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDES
   IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a growing worldwide concern over the toxicological hazards caused by agricultural pesticides to humans, animals and desirable plants in developing countries. This is not only because of the undesirable side effects caused but, more importantly, is due to the potential long-term exposure of such chemical to nontarget living forms. The problems that have been identified include current pesticide use patterns. Hence, it is necessary for developing countries to put in place sustainable programs to reduce such pesticide effects to the barest minimum. This paper examines the efforts one developing country has made to achieve this and practicable options opened to other countries. Such options include strategies to regulate the use of pesticides and prevent undue exposure of farmers to pesticides; restricting the use of persistent chemicals; alternatives to pesticide use, such as biological and natural control measures within the concept of integrated pest management practices, should be vigorously pursued.

AB Wheat and rice are the most important crops from the point of view of maintaining a sustainable nutrition security system for India, a country whose population may reach one billion by the year 2000.  The implications of climate change deriving from tropical deforestation, particularly as concerns temperature and precipitation, with reference to the yield of wheat and rice in different parts of India are hence being studied carefully.  Any possible positive gain arising from increased CO2 concentration is likely to be offset by the yield decline induced by higher temperature and shorter growing period.

TI HUMAN IMPACTS IN THE GREATER YELLOWSTONE ECOSYSTEM - EVALUATING
   SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND ECO-REDEVELOPMENT
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem is composed of a mosaic of national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and private lands, each managed with different goals.  Perturbations, both natural and anthropogenic, influence these areas.  Maintaining naturalness and sustaining the systems within the GYE are desired assessment endpoints in determining the need for ecosystem redevelopment.  Ecosystem degradation is a natural response to human impacts, and evaluation of degradation relative to management goals can be used to determine the acceptability of the goals and the potential for eco-redevelopment.  Goals may range from maintaining very natural sustainable ecosystems to developing sacrifice areas for heavy tourist use or oil development.  To evaluate human impacts in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, management goals for all systems should be reexamined to determine whether the original goals remain appropriate and whether some level of eco-redevelopment is necessary to achieve these or newly established goals.  Special attention should be given to impacts of interactive and cumulative human activities.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF RESOURCE EXPLOITATION IN AMAZONIA
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Development pressures are triggering rapid ecological, cultural, and economic changes in Amazonia, one of the world's largest remaining forest frontiers.  Some of the environmental effects of development schemes and spontaneous settlement have local and potentially regional and global repercussions.  Ecological issues surrounding human activities in Amazonia include pollution from mining activities; deforestation and climate change; accelerated erosion and declining soil fertility; soil erosion and flooding; and the impact of hydroelectric dams on fisheries.  It is important to develop sustainable agricultural systems to relieve pressure on the remaining forest.

AB Various formulations of surface evaporation are tested against in situ data collected over a plot of loamy bare ground.  Numerical simulations lasting seven days are compared with observations of near-surface water content and cumulative evaporation.
   A comparison of classical bulk aerodynamic formulations shows similar predictions of daytime evaporation while significant differences are exhibited during the night.  The so-called "surface moisture availability method" seems to overestimate the nocturnal evaporation flux.
   In the context of this dataset, threshold methods strongly underestimate surface evaporation during the whole period of observations.  A sensitivity analysis reveals that threshold evaporation (maximum sustainable water flux) is highly sensitive upon the depth of the top soil layer.

   AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE COASTAL MANAGEMENT; POLICY ANALYSIS; NATURE CONSERVATION; NATURE
   DEVELOPMENT; SEA-LEVEL RISE
AB Coastal defence is a major function of the Dutch dunecoast.  The dunes are considered to be important, in addition to coastal defence, as a nature conservation area and for recreation and drinking water production.  At many places the dunecoast is subject to erosion.  Without mitigation measures the erosive trend will continue into the next century and will probably worsen due to the increase of sea-level rise.  It will have serious effects on the safety of the inhabitants of the polders and on functions of the dunes.
   To develop a structural approach to coastal defence management after 1990, the Dutch government commissioned Rijkswaterstaat to carry out an integrated policy analysis study.  The period considered was 1990-2090.  Several scenarios of sea-level rise were taken into account:  20 (present-day), 60 (expected) and 85 (pessimistic) cm/century.  The study resulted in four alternatives for coastal defence:  admission of further retreat (W), selective erosion control (S), full erosion control (F) and seaward expansion at relatively weak sites along the coast (E).
   Implications of these alternatives to safety measures, costs and loss of dune area along the coast are presented.  An approach is proposed to integrate traditional coastal defence management with nature and landscape conservation.  A method for classifying nature in the outer dunes is given.  Five options for a more nature-oriented coastal defence management are discussed.  The options advocate the management of the dunes as dynamic systems requiring human activities to retain or regain valuable natural features.

TI THE IUG SYSTEMATICS OF IGNEOUS ROCKS
SO JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB In order to create a sustainable classification of igneous rocks which all geologists might use, an international body was set up by the IUGS: the IUGS Subcommission on the Systematics of Igneous Rocks. In the course of creating the classification, the Subcommission has established ten principles for its construction and for defining an appropriate nomenclature. The principles are: (1) use descriptive attributes; (2) use actual properties; (3) ensure suitability for all geologists; (4) use current terminology; (5) define boundaries of rock species; (6) keep it simple to apply; (7) follow natural relations; (8) use modal mineralogy; (9) if mode not feasible, use chemistry; (10) follow terminology of other IUGS advisory bodies. These principles and their rationale have not previously been enunciated.
   The classification separates and individually classifies the pyroclastic, carbonatitic, melititic, lamprophyric and charnockitic rocks before entering the main QAPF classification for plutonic and volcanic rocks which is based on the modal mineral proportions of quartz (Q), alkali feldspar (A) and plagioclase (P) or of alkali feldspar (A), plagioclase (P) and feldspathoids (F). Rocks with mafic content > 90% have their own classification. If the mineral mode cannot be determined as is often the case for volcanic rocks, then a chemical classification of total alkalis versus silica (TAS) is used. The nomenclature for these classifications necessitates only 297 rock names out of the c. 1500 that exist.

TI DERIVATION OF SAFETY FACTORS FOR SETTING HARVEST QUOTAS ON ADULT
   WALLEYES FROM PAST ESTIMATES OF ABUNDANCE
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID ESCANABA LAKE; WISCONSIN; DYNAMICS; AGE
AB Past population estimates of adult walleyes Stizostedion vitreum can be used to set harvest quotas, provided that temporal variability in abundance of adult walleyes is accounted for. We used a long-term data set from Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin, to evaluate the accuracy of past population estimates for setting current-year quotas for adult walleyes. The results from Escanaba Lake were corroborated by comparison with other lakes where adult walleye abundance was estimated in more than 1 year. The accuracy of estimates of adult walleye abundance declined over time from the year the estimate was obtained to the year it was used to set a harvest quota. We derived safety factors for application to past estimates of population size; these factors limit the occurrence of an exploitation rate exceeding the maximum sustainable rate (35%) to approximately 1 in 40. These safety factors declined from 35% for 1-year-old estimates to less than 20% for 10-year-old estimates.

TI IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS OF PRICE POLICY AND LAND DEGRADATION ON
   AGRICULTURAL GROWTH IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB In many developing countries, a high proportion of the population resides and works in rural areas. Agriculture is the dominant sector in rural areas and has the greatest concentration of poverty:  landless workers, small tenant farmers, and small farm owners. Thus, any development strategy that is directed towards increasing employment and alleviating a country's hunger must concentrate on sustainable agricultural growth.
   Historically, economic development in most countries has been based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly land resources. Soil erosion and land degradation have been serious worldwide. Due to reasons such as high population pressure on land and limited fossil energy supplies, land degradation is generally more serious in the developing world. Empirical studies show that soil erosion and degradation of agricultural land not only decrease the land productivity but they can also result in major downstream or off-site damage which may be several times that of on-site damage.
   In promoting industrialization, governments of many developing countries adopt a package of price and other policies that reduce agricultural production incentives and encourage a flow of resources out of agriculture. Increasing evidence shows that these policies cause a substantial efficiency or social welfare loss, and a great loss in foreign exchange earnings. In addition, a World Bank study on the effect of price distortions on economic growth rates concluded that neither rich resource endowments, nor a high stage of economic development, nor privatization are able to make up the adverse effects caused by high price distortions.
   This analysis is primarily concerned with identifying the factors that determine the agricultural production growth rate and in testing the effects these factors have on agricultural growth in developing countries. Specifically, this study involves statistical estimation of an aggregate agricultural growth function based on cross-country data for 28 developing countries. Special attention is devoted to land degradation and agricultural pricing policy, and to the policy implications resulting from the effects these variables have on agricultural and food production growth.
   The overall results of this study show that price distortions in the economy and land degradation had statistically significant negative impacts while the change in arable and permanent land was positively related to the growth of agricultural production and food production in 28 developing countries from 1971 to 1980. These results emphasize the importance of 'getting prices right' and implementation of sustainable land and water management practices if future growth in food and agricultural output is to be realized and sustained in developing countries.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Research papers on reduced-chemical agricultural methods published in single-discipline and multidisciplinary journals were compared with other agricultural research with respect to how the work was done and what it covered.  Reduced-chemical research did not involve more multidisciplinary collaboration, despite the commonly heard claim that it does.  It showed a slight but inconsistent tendency to run for more years and use more sites per study.  The production methods is studied showed to some degree the characteristics attributed to reduced-chemical systems, including greater concern with off-farm effects, greater species diversity, a more important role for information and management, and the use of close-grown crops in association with tilled crops.  However, this was much truer for the smaller body of research reported in multidisciplinary journals; in many ways, the larger amount of reduced-chemical research reported in single-discipline journals hardly differed from other agricultural research.

DT Article
ID POPULATION; ECOLOGY
AB In the present overview, environmental security is comprised of two inter-connected parts:  (a) environmental protection from wartime and similar abuse, from medically unacceptable pollution and, in some instances, from any permanent human intrusion; and (b) sane resource utilization, with the renewable resources utilized sustainably and the non-renewable resources utilized efficiently and frugally.  Environmental security is considered unattainable without the concomitant achievement of social security, the latter being comprised of four interconnected parts:  (a) political security; (b) military security; (c) economic security; and (d) personal security.  Environmental and social security together are considered to constitute comprehensive human security.  Ethiopia and Sudan are taken to illustrate this expanded concept of security.  Among other conclusions, it is suggested that in order to be able to achieve environmental security, Ethiopia and Sudan must:  (i) strive for this goal in cooperation with their ecogeographical partners, a fundamental prerequisite of which is to come to grips with their seemingly endless internal and cross-border wars; and (ii) bring resource utilization into balance with resource availability, a fundamental prerequisite of which is to come to grips with population pressures.

DT Article
AB Using Ethiopia as an example, the present study has demonstrated that it is a combination of socio-economic factors which culminates in episodes of famine in a society dominated by subsistence production.  The conditions and processes that have been seen to culminate in episodes of famine include:  (a) the precarious condition of subsistence production that arises from its quasi-natural foundation; (b) deforestation, over-grazing and other inappropriate land-use practices; (c) the aggravation of these processes by the increasing pressures of population in the face of a stagnant technology; (d) the susceptibility to drought of large areas that have been subjected to intensive exploitation; and (e) the marginalization of large numbers of subsistence producers by exploitative elements in so-called development activities.  The main economic consequences of recurrent drought, crop failure and famine were found to be declines in agricultural production that led to increases in food imports, reductions in agriculturally based manufacturing activities and substantial declines in agricultural (and thus in total) exports.  These negative impacts on the economy were clearly reflected in low, or even negative, growth rates in the gross domestic product; and also in reduced rates of domestic saving and investment.  Moreover, the relief and rehabilitation operations made necessary by the famine conditions were estimated to cost a staggering amount.  A great need was recognized for sustainable economic development as the means of dealing on a long-term basis with the underlying causes of famine.

TI ECOLOGICALLY-BASED STRATEGIES FOR CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE
   TROPICS
SO ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Tropical countries are endowed with a rich array of biotic and geophysical resources.  Only in the past 30 years has the rate of their resource transformation been so rapid as to threaten the environment, largely because of the demands of a growing human population resulting from the demographic  transition.  While resource transformations have produced the goods and services necessary to meet the needs of the growing populations, they have also generated a variety of effects on the environment and the societies of these countries.  The rapid pace of technological advances and social change seriously threaten the sustainability of natural assets and ecological processes in these countries, with global consequences.  This threat is exacerbated (1) by inadequate capability in these tropical countries to manage degradations in natural resources and the environment arising from technological interventions affecting large-scale ecological processes; and (2) by the coincidence of down-turns in long-term cycles of unequal amplitudes, which concern elitism and administrations, dependency on fossil fuels for industrialisation and shifts in cultural periods, all of which threaten the global structure and continuity of prevailing social institutions, Both phenomena endanger the prospects for international investments in the transformation of natural resources and management of the environment for sustainable livelihoods, especially in developing countries.  Most tropical countries have developing economies, and have inadequate capacity to manage the impacts and trade-offs of technological insertions largely because of financial constraints, poor technical expertise and the international character of their economies.
   In spite of harsh socio-biological, technological and financial constraints, there is a pressing need for investing in human expertise in tropical countries because of their effects on the sustainability of global climate, resource and environmental heritage, cultural heritage and societal organisation.  Assurance of this sustainability demands that investments in tropical countries must be founded on traditional knowledge, organisation and community participation; on comparative advantages in terms of resource endowments and technological skills; on strategies and actions promoting innovative futures; on the strengthening of institutional capacities for assessing impacts and trade-offs; on a universally-acceptable system for exchanging experiences about technological insertions with reference to spatial areas, levels of sophistication, assessment of impacts and standards; and on the attraction of various forms of international cooperation at professional, governmental and non-governmental levels, which has been recommended by the World Commission on Environment and Development (Bruntland Commission).  This overall challenge for international development in the tropics amounts to advancing macro-ecological and -economic sciences of large-scale processes having local impacts, and vice versa, involving the dynamic interactions between culture and philosophy, politics, investment (economics), society, technology and environment at different spatial and temporal scales.

TI THE PROVISION OF SECURE FUNDING FOR SILVICULTURE THROUGH AN EVERGREEN
   TENURE SYSTEM BASED ON FOREST LAND RENT
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is not an attempt to devise a national tenure system that will satisfy all conditions and requirements across Canada.  It is rather an attempt to contribute some ideas to spur the evolution of tenure systems in Canada.
   The main thrust of these ideas are:  Sustainable development, Mechanisms to provide secure funding for silviculture, A new approach to public forest land tenure.
   In October 1990 the Woodlands Section, Canadian Pulp and Paper Association and the Canadian Institute of Forestry/Institut forestier du Canada held a workshop on silvicultural funding mechanisms for public forest land.
   Because silvicultural investment by the private sector is tied closely to the structure and security of tenure agreements interest quickly focused on tenure.

TI RESPONSES OF YEARLING STEERS TO DIFFERENT STOCKING RATES ON A

AB Despite potential benefits, limitations of individual tropical legumes have restricted development of sustainable grass-legume pastures in tropical and subtropical regions. Sowing mixtures of complementary legumes may overcome limitations of individual species. Responses of yearling steers grazing a mixture of three tropical legumes with bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) were evaluated at three stocking rates under continuous grazing. Carpon desmodium (Desmodium heterocarpon [L.] DC.), which is persistent under grazing but often difficult to establish, was combined with the short-lived legumes aeschynomene (Aeschynomene americana L.) and phasey bean (Macroptilium lathyroides [L.] Urb.). Diet composition, as determined by microhistological analysis of fecal samples, and animal performance were evaluated in three grazing periods:  summer 1987 and spring 1988 (2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 steers/ha) and summer 1988 (3.0, 5.3, and 7.5 steers/ha). Stocking rate did not affect percentage of the selectively grazed legumes, aeschynomene and phasey bean, in the diet. Average daily gain decreased linearly (P < .05) with increased stocking rate, as is typical for grass pastures. Aeschynomene and phasey bean contributed to diets during the first summer, and carpon desmodium contribution was greater in the second summer. These results indicate that this pasture mixture can provide legume herbage from aeschynomene and phasey bean in the year of sowing and from carpon desmodium thereafter. Over the range of grazing pressures obtained, legume responses were generally consistent; thus, optimizing stocking rate for gain per hectare or for economic returns can be targeted without additional constraints to maintain the contribution of these legumes to grazing livestock.

AB (1) A physiologically based mechanistic model of the dynamic interaction between plants and animals is used to consider the role of differences in growth rate between plant species, and of selective grazing by animals, in the stability of plant species in a continuously grazed mixture, and so the long-term consequences of different intensities of grazing on the composition of the sward and diet.
   (2) The model provides a means to apply a detailed account of plant physiology in controlling the availability of food resources (prey) in analyses of predator-prey interactions in grassland.
   (3) The model confirms that mixtures are intrinsically unstable. In the absence of a mechanism in either species to escape grazing, one which possesses a physiological advantage is shown progressively to dominate the mixture. Where the advantage is a simple one, the mixture tends to a monoculture of that species at all intensities of grazing. But, where the advantaged species is also the preferred species, the intensity of grazing is shown to determine which species dominates the mixture.
   (4) The model suggests that stable mixtures may arise when either species can escape grazing to some extent. Under these circumstances, the otherwise advantaged species takes the brunt of variations in the intensity of grazing.
   (5) The model is used to consider the sustainability of differences in composition between the diet and sward. At high intensities of grazing, the composition of the diet is shown to be more a reflection of differences in growth rate between plant species than of the preferences of grazing animals. It is also shown that, because of its adverse impact on vegetation dynamics, the long-term consequence of a preference for one species in the diet is that there may be less of that species in the diet (both as a proportion and as an amount) than if there had been less preference for it or a preference against it. The implications of these analyses for the biological interpretation of field data are discussed.

DT Article
AB The Brundtland Commission on Environment and Development considered the overriding political concept of 'Our Common Future' is sustainable development.  This paper considers the complexities of sustainable development in the mining/mineral development arena.  Companies in the 1990s will have to develop clear environmental plans, and nowhere is this more visible and demanding than in mining in Australia.  The wide range of issues extending from pastoral concerns to Aboriginal land rights are discussed.  The important role of Government is highlighted.  The range of strategic options open are discussed and key strategic considerations for the attainment of sustainable development are provided.

TI CHANGING RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
   IN THE MIDDLE ATLAS MOUNTAINS OF MOROCCO
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper discusses the social, economic, and ecological changes in terms of sustainable development in the mountain areas of North Africa.  In many mountain ranges in Morocco, such as the Rif, the High Atlas, and the Anti Atlas, centuries old sedentary communities depended on terracing, cultivation of steep slopes, and intensive animal breeding.  However, until the 1950s the northwestern section of the Middle Atlas was inhabited by semi-nomadic groups who depended on the summer pastures and in winter migrated to the surrounding lowlands in search of pasture and arable land.
   The paper recalls the cultural determinants behind these indigenous resource-use practices that no longer exist.  During the last 35 years the pastoral nomadic migrations have disappeared; the people have settled permanently in the highlands for the first time and are engaged in a new pattern of agropastoral activities.  The paper seeks explanation for the radical change in the perception and use of mountain resources.  The detrimental impacts of these change processes endanger the viability of the natural resource base.

AB Reliable, relevant data on which to develop management strategies are not usually available in developing countries, especially in mountainous areas.  This paper discusses the experiences of the Nepal-Australia Forestry Project from 1978 until 1988.  The research, aimed at improving the productivity of the forests, was developed in response to the expressed needs of the local people, although there were no qualitative nor quantitative data on forest use.  Changes were introduced at the panchayat level by local initiatives.  A series of questions were discussed concerning available land, species to be planted, forest protection, and other topics that arose during the course of the project.  Examples of this action research are described together with changes in community and private forest species and management practices that result from the direct participation of local mountain communities.  It is noted, however, that user groups tend to be dominated by men and by those of higher caste and higher economic status, whereas it is the women and the poor who depend on the forests for fuelwood and fodder products; changes may be needed to ensure sustainable utilization of forests and a reasonable equity in the distribution of benefits.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL-STRESS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE TROPICAL ANDES
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses two of the principal themes that affect the viability of, and the future prospects for, Third World mountains.  It summarizes research experiences of the author from the Andean test area of the UNU Highland-Lowland Interaction Systems Programme in Ecuador, and the results from the international workshop on "Sustainable Uses for Steep Slopes" organized by the Development Strategies for Fragile Lands (DESFIL) Program in Ecuador.
   The paper first makes reference to the meaning and the use of the key words "environmental stress" and "sustainable development," by different scholars and disciplines.  These concepts are then examined in the spatial context of the tropical Andes, specifically of the central Sierra of Ecuador.  An attempt is made to portray, in a tabulated form, a typology of the various stressors of the natural and human environments, their potential impact on the cultural landscape and human activities, and potential adaptation or adjustment strategies to counter the effect of the stressors.
   The final section of the paper is devoted to the theme of sustainable rural development of the Andes.  In a summarizing table, thirteen major problems are presented, together with a corresponding set of recommendations or solutions to counter these problems.  It is argued that a clear understanding of the stress factors or problems, especially as perceived by the rural population, form the basis for a sustainable development of the tropical Andes geared towards long-term ecological stability as well as towards a sustained socio-economic development of the rural populations.

AB Changes in N, P, K, Ca and Mg in soil and rice plants were investigated during a cropping season following a long fallow period in a system of traditional cultivation practised for several centuries, under a village tank irrigation system. Soil, N, P, K, Ca and Mg were not found to be deficient for rice production throughout the season. Flooding did not produce toxic levels of Fe and Na and soil pH remained at 6.4 during the season. The average grain yield (3.5 t/ha) without any addition of chemical fertilizer was almost the same as that from fields under major irrigation systems where fertilizer application (less than the recommended level) was common. The sustainability of soil fertility under the traditional system of rice cultivation appears to be dependent upon long fallow periods. The natural build-up of soil fertility during a three-year fallow was evidently adequate to support a good growth of the crop which produced a yield comparable to that obtained in chemically fertilized, more intensively cropped rice fields under major irrigation systems.

AB The aim of the Paper is to establish the essential components of effective environmental management.  One problem of the latter has been how to cost environmental damage, and the Paper sets out a technique, based on graphs, for overcoming this as far as is possible.  The Paper outlines legal aspects of environmental protection and shows how the compensation due for each case of damage may be costed by means of the respective graph, and also suggests how this compensation might be dispensed.  The case is made that, in order to achieve effective self regulation, all market prices must include the full costs of protection.  Consideration is given to the problem of achieving an environmentally sustainable economy.  Conclusions are drawn and recommendations made throughout on policy and practice pertaining to environmental protection.

AB Studies of earth cycles are used in a variety of ways, from mineral exploration to recording and explaining past, and projecting future climate change.  Geology helps us find the commodities we need to accomodate our lifestyles, to assess natural hazards, find drinking water and safe places to dispose of our waste.  As mankind will search for a way to achieve a globally sustainable society, the limits of this planet will have to be acknowledged.  Geology is one of the disciplines that can help us understand our planet and establish those limits.  Further research in the earth sciences is required to clarify our present knowledge of the environment, quantify many processes, and define limits of prediction for future change.

TI EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE MYOGLOBIN-FACILITATED TRANSPORT OF OXYGEN

SO BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL

AB An analysis of thermal effects on the facilitative transport of oxygen in skeletal muscle fibers is presented.  Steady-state mass and energy transport balances are written and solved analytically or numerically using a finite-difference procedure.  It is shown that no significant spatial thermal gradients exist due to internal reactions or bulk conduction effects across a muscle fiber.  At typical muscle conditions, it is predicted that increased global temperature reduces the fraction of oxgenated myoglobin, increases local oxygen concentrations, and increases the percentage of oxygen flux attributed to oxy-myoglobin.  The maximum supportable oxygen consumption rate, m(O2)max, is defined as the highest consumption rate sustainable without developing anoxic regions at the center of the fiber.  By considering only temperature sensitive effects within fibers, m(O2)max is found to increase slightly with temperature at low temperatures.  This increase is due to thermal effects on the diffusion coefficients as opposed to effects associated with the kinetics of the myoglobin-oxygen reaction.  If the simulations include the temperature effect associated with oxygen solubility in blood plasma, m(O2)max decreases with temperature.  A sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the values of relevant parameters.  The maximum consumption rate was least affected by parameters associated with the kinetic and equilibrium constants and most affected by the diffusion coefficients and the concentration of myoglobin.

AB Soil erosion is accelerating in developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  It has threatened the livelihood of millions of peasants, for agriculture is their economic mainstay.  A probe into the forces causing erosion reveals that the elite's resolve to accumulate ever more wealth and to maintain, consolidate, or expand their sociopolitical power and the necessity of the poor to fulfill their requirements of food, fuelwood, and fodder are the two major factors accelerating soil erosion.  Unless the vast masses of poor people are integrated into the national mainstream through the implementation of equitable and redistributive development policies, it is impossible to control the accelerating rate of soil erosion and thus to achieve the objective of sustainable development.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between anaerobic threshold (Th(an)) and muscle fatigue threshold (EMG(FT)) as estimated from electromyographic (EMG) data taken from the quadriceps muscles (vastus lateralis) during exercise on a cycle ergometer.  The subjects in this study were 20 female college students, including highly trained endurance athletes and untrained sedentary individuals, whose fitness levels derived from their maximal oxygen consumption ranged from 24.9 to 62.2 ml.kg-1.min-1.  The rate of increase in integrated EMG (iEMG) activity as a function of time (iEMG slope) was calculated at each of four constant power outputs (350, 300, 250, 200 W), sufficiently high to bring about muscle fatigue.  The iEMG slopes so obtained were plotted against the exercise intensities imposed, resulting in linear plots which were extrapolated to zero slope to give an intercept on the power axis which was in turn interpreted as the highest exercise intensity sustainable without electromyographic evidence of neuromuscular fatigue (EMG(FT)).  The Th(an) was estimated from gas exchange parameters during an incremental exercise test on the same cycle ergometer.  The mean results indicated that oxygen uptake (VO2) at Th(an) was 1.39 1.min-1, SD 0.44 and VO2 at EMG(FT) was 1.33 1.min-1, SD 0.57.  There was no significant difference between these mean values (P > 0.05) and there was a highly significant correlation between VO2 at Th(an) and VO2 at EMG(FT) (r = 0.823, P < 0.01).  These data supported the concept of Th(an) on the basis that Th(an) was associated with the highest exercise intensity that could be sustained without evidence of neuromuscular fatigue and thus suggested that EMG(FT) may provide an attractive alternative to the measurement of Th(an).

LA English
DT Article
DE FERTILIZER POLICY; WEST AFRICA; FERTILIZER SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONSTRAINTS
AB In sub-Saharan Africa, sustainable economic growth and development, food security, and fair income distribution are possible only if there is sustained growth in agricultural production.  The influx of commercially imported or donated foodgrains has helped many governments to maintain a policy of low food prices, usually for the benefit of the vocal urban dwellers.  Such practices tend to kill the incentive for increased local production of foodgrains or for the increase in the use of inputs needed to improve the productivity of the farming systems.
   High degree of state control in the handling of fertilizers, existence of subsidies which put undue strain on national treasuries, lack of good infrastuctures, relatively small markets and poorly developed research and extension systems are some of the constraints that prevent the optimal use of fertilizers in West Africa.
   Overcoming the constraints requires total commitment by governments, collaboration with the private sector as well as with the donor community and the development of carefully thought-out fertilizer policy instruments.  The various measures needed for an effective policy are interrelated and must be undertaken simultaneously to ensure success.

TI AGRICULTURAL CHANGES IN BHUTAN - SOME ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTIONS
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE BHUTAN; AGRICULTURE; ENVIRONMENT; HIGH-YIELDING VARIETIES; CASH CROPS
AB Bhutan is a developing country emerging from physical and political isolation.  Because of political and economic pressures the Government has initiated a programme of rapid agricultural development.  Owing to institutional inexperience and the lack of trained manpower this programme is uncritically based on imported ideas and technology.  Traditional sustainable agricultural systems are being influenced and Bhutan's social and physical environment is changing.  This  paper critically reviews two components of the agricultural programme:  the adoption of new high-yielding varieties of cereals which may be ill-adapted to Bhutan and which displace hardy and resistant native varieties; and the Government's policy towards two important cash crops, cardamom and potato, which may have adverse environmental effects.  The paper concludes that there are sufficient grounds to be concerned about the unintended consequences of agricultural development in Bhutan, which when undertaken without an understanding of the social and physical environment of the rural households will lead to unanticipated problems and failures.  A more holistic approach is recommended, and the establishment of a system of environmental monitoring.

SO GEOGRAPHY

DT Article
AB The role of women in environmental management is of crucial importance in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where women are major contributors to agricultural production.  Using women's horticultural projects in The Gambia as case studies, this paper contrasts the sustainability of projects with differing approaches to environmental management and technology inputs.  One top-down scheme is studied in depth with a detailed analysis of its environmental and economic viability.  The agricultural practices and irrigation technology associated with this scheme make it unsustainable in the long term.  Small-scale projects are found to make better use of women's farming skills, but involve greater use of their time and energy.  It is argued that development projects must not undermine the resource base upon which women rely for their livelihoods.

DE INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY; INPUT-OUTPUT ECONOMICS; NORTH-SOUTH RELATIONS;
   STRUCTURAL ECONOMICS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; WORLD MODEL; DATABASE
AB Structural economics can provide a framework for describing and evaluating alternative approaches to environmentally-sound economic development.  This structural approach is concerned with physical stocks and flows, including those of natural resources and waste products, and with technological choices, as well as the corresponding costs and prices which are often practically the exclusive focus of the economist's attention.  These can all be analyzed using so-called input-output models, and corresponding input-output databases, which have been built for many individual economies and for the world economy as a whole.
   Industrial ecology is an expanded version of life-cycle engineering which provides a coherent and powerful set of ideas for reducing pollution.  Industrial ecology will probably be applied first in affluent, developed countries.  Industrial ecology calls for a systematic approach to modifying economic activities in order to substantially reduce the generation of wastes at each stage of production or use.  In addition to reducing their own pollution, however, the developed countries will also have to provide assistance for economic development in the South that has a relatively low impact on the environment.  This assistance could take the form of a "Marshall Plan" for investing heavily in a package of environmentally-sound development options.  It could also take the form of substantial reform to the conventions now governing international trade in order to remove barriers to developing countries' exports of processed raw materials and manufactured goods based on these inputs.

DE SYSTEMS; THINKING; AGRICULTURE
AB Reductionist science with its positivistic philosophical roots and experimental research practices has generally served agriculture well for around 150 yr. Technological innovations based on the propositions generated through this paradigm have played a profound role in the extraordinary productivity growth that has occurred in agriculture across the globe.
   Yet with recognition of its success in this context is the realization of its inadequacies from broader perspectives. There is an increasing sense of unease about degradation of biophysical environments, distortions of socio-economic environments, and dislocations of cultural environments too often associated with agricultural practices. There are calls for a new science and praxis of complexity to deal with these problematic relationships between agriculture and the environments in which it is conducted. Systems thinking and practices are emerging as useful in this regard. Two schools are apparent within this broad movement. The first ("hard") approach comes from a pedigree that includes systems analysis, systems engineering, cybernetics, and ecosystem biology. Assuming a world of transforming systems, the "hard" systems scientists in agriculture seek to design new agro-ecosystems that are at once productive, stable, equitable, and sustainable. In the "soft" approach, with its foundation in cognitive science, the systemicity is transferred from the world to the way of investigating the world. This new paradigm presents considerable challenge to conventional methods and methodologies in research, education, and extension in contemporary agriculture.

AB Most animals cannot sustain speeds above that at which the rate of oxygen consumption reaches a maximum (V(O2max)).  Fowler's toad (Bufo woodhousii fowleri), by contrast, has a maximum aerobic speed (MAS, the speed at V(O2max)) of 0.27 km h-1 but can sustain speeds as high as 0.45 km h-1 without increasing the V(O2) above the V(O2max).  The present study investigates the discrepancy between MAS and the maximum sustainable speed (MSS).  Toads switched from walking to hopping as their speed increased.  The cost of a hop (4.1 x 10(-4) ml O2 g-1 hop-1) was greater than the cost of a walking stride (2.5 x 10(-4) ml O2 g-1 stride-1) and was independent of speed for both hopping and walking.  However, individual hops were much longer than walking strides, which more than offset the greater cost of a hop.  The calculated cost to traverse a given distance was approximately 1.9 times as much for walking as for hopping.  During natural locomotion animals used combined walking and hopping.  Individual toads that favored walking had higher locomotor costs than those that favored hopping.  The estimated cost of exclusive hopping was less than the cost of natural locomotion at all but the highest speeds.  This discrepancy may reflect the fact that the natural gait is a combination of both the less economical walking gait and the more economical hopping gait.  To achieve speeds above the MAS toads walked less and used the more economical hopping gait more, and thus did not increase energy cost above that of V(O2max).  The speed at which the estimated cost of exclusive hopping exceeded the cost of a natural gait and approached the V(O2max) was close to the MSS.  Creatine phosphate and lactate concentrations in the muscles of the thigh and calf did not change from resting levels at sustainable speeds greater than the MAS.

AB Species catch-rate data from a series of four trawl surveys of the Hecate Strait region in British Columbia, on the Pacific continental shelf of Canada were analysed using agglomerative clustering techniques. Four relatively stable fish assemblages were identified. These assemblages were dominated by flatfish species and characterized by depth and bottom type. Although the relative abundances of component species within assemblages did change seasonally, we observed little change in terms of which species were dominant. Geographical boundaries of the assemblages were also relatively stable over the four surveys completed to date. Persistent boundaries were found in the 50-60 m range and 130-140 m range. We identified both regular and seasonal components of assemblages. Arrowtooth flounder and Pacific sanddab showed remarkable stability in their overall distributions, leading us to suspect that survey catch rates for these species would be suitable for monitoring changes in abundance. We found no significant differences in either component abundance or diversity of assemblages under two widely different fishing effort regimes in different portions of the Strait.

AB Stock production modelling was used to estimate population parameters such as the carrying capacity (B infinity), as well as management parameters such as maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the instantaneous rate of fishing mortality at MSY (F(MSY)) and the sustainable biomass at MSY (B(MSY)). The input data were not catch and effort data, which usually require adjustments for changes in catchability, but biomass and catch (or fishing mortality), which are frequently available from cohort analysis or direct surveys. The model does not require the assumption of stock equilibrium for estimating parameters.
   The model was applied to data from the Alaska plaice, Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus, and yellowfin sole, Limanda aspera stocks in the eastern Bering Sea, and the Pacific halibut, Hippoglossus stenolepis, stock in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea. All three stocks are characterized by separation of nursery area and exploitable population. There are at least five age groups present in nursery areas and ten or more in the exploitable stock so that recruitment levels and exploitable stock sizes are well-buffered.
   Predictions from the surplus production model provided reasonable fits to the biomass time series for all three stocks examined, given the sources of uncertainty in the biomass estimates available. It appears that the stock dynamics for the three species can be described by a relatively simple density-dependent model assuming instantaneous responses in stock biomass via recruitment and growth.

TI THE ROLE OF INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING IN INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL
   CONSULTING
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This article aims to describe, with the aid of a number of case studies, the role consultants are playing in bringing improved environmental management to fruition in developing countries.  In spite of environmental considerations entering the political agenda in the early 1970s, global environmental deterioration continues.  Donor agencies have thus recently greatly accelerated their assistance in this area, but are themselves not equipped to deal with many of the problems and issues and so have hired consultants to undertake aspects of the work programme.  Typically consultants are undertaking sector studies, pollution control, environmental improvement studies, and project and programme assessment, and are seen as being primarily responsible for technical aspects.  It has become clear that unless technical recommendations are firmly tied into institutional and management structures, the goal of long-term sustainability of projects will not be realized.  Whilst the need for institutional strengthening in this respect is widely recognized, it often fails to materialize as a consequence of internal resistances.  Furthermore, environmental goals are still often seen as secondary and contradictory to economic development goals, and are therefore not taken adequately seriously.  The article includes four case studies, which illustrate the kinds of measures which are currently considered to be necessary to ensure the implementation of sustainable development programmes and projects.

TI EFFECTS OF TOPSOIL, RAINFALL, AND FERTILIZER ON FINGER MILLET ON AN
   ALFISOL IN INDIA
SO SOIL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB We measured effects of variations in topsoil depth on finger millet yield, without and with fertilizer application, on a continuous in situ prepared gradient on an alfisol over two seasons.  There was highly significant positive correlation between the yields and depth of topsoil under varying rainfall and fertilizer conditions.  The data and a regression analysis showed that the rainfall effect was constant while topsoil showed an interaction with fertilizer.  Rainfall effect was 67 and 53 kg/ha without and with fertilizer, respectively.  Fertilizer application compensated for 15 cm of topsoil.  Without fertilizer the rainfall dominates the topsoil effect while with fertilizer the topsoil dominates the rainfall effect in increasing the yields of this hardy crop.  Thus, for sustainable production of finger millet in the agricultural watersheds, the fertilizer application is essential to mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and aberrant rainfall.  The absolute payoff from the multiplicative technology is larger on deep than shallow topsoil.

AB Nutrient release from legume and cereal crop residue is important to N cycling and the success of conservation and sustainable farming systems.  Residue type, placement, and degree of incorporation, and soil water regimes largely control availability and loss of soil N and were evaluated in the laboratory.  Four residues, i.e., vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), corn (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) having C/N ratios ranging from 8 to 82 were applied on the soil surface or incorporated in repacked cores of a Nicollet loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Aquic Hapludoll) and incubated for 17 or 35 d at 60 and 90% water-filled pore space (WFPS) with enriched N-15-NO3 (76.7%).  Denitrification losses from all treatments were negligible at 60% WFPS.  At 90% WFPS, total denitrification losses from residue-incorporated soils represented 87 to 127% of the initial soil NO3 level (80.5 mg N kg-1); losses increased with decreasing residue C/N ratio.  Denitrification was greatest during the first 8 d, as was CO2 evolution.  Initial denitrification with surface-placed residues was less than with incorporated residues, but cumulative losses over 35 d did not differ significantly.  Substantial N immobilization occurred with incorporated or surface-placed wheat, corn, and soybean residue with wide C/N ratios at 60% WFPS, whereas, with low-C/N-ratio vetch, significant mineralization occurred.  After 35 d, 51 and 36% of N in incorporated and surface-placed vetch residue, respectively, was mineralized.  Residue C/N ratio was inversely related to initial rates of residue decomposition, and effects of residue type and placement and soil water on denitrification and mineralization were most important during early (8-10 d) decomposition.

AB As a result of a Technical Cooperation for Area Development (TAD) workshop at Kota Bangun in 1983, a 'Mulch Rotation' system proposed by von Uexkull was adopted for field trials to assess its suitability to transmigrant settlement units in the Kutai District of Kalimantan, Indonesia.  These trials confirmed the greater sustainability of the system through reduced requirements for inorganic fertilizer.  The present Paper demonstrates that the Mulch Rotation System has another major advantage over more traditional systems since its labour requirements more closely match labour availability on the settlement units.  It thus demonstrates the importance of including a systematic assessment of labour requirements and labour availability in the field trials of any new farming system.

AB A growing awareness of environmental issues in Canada has had a major influence on government policies. An initiative was launched by the government of Ontario to promote research toward the development of an integrated weed management (IWM) system. Research in IWM must take all aspects of the cropping system into consideration and evolve in a progressive manner. This approach must encompass the role of conservation tillage, knowledge of the critical period of weed interference, alternative methods of weed control, enhancement of crop competitiveness, modeling of crop-weed interference, influence of crop rotation and seed bank dynamics, and education and extension of the findings. The complexity involved in addressing these issues requires a multidisciplinary approach.

AB Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the world's largest human population growth rate, some of its poorest soils, and a high incidence of crop pests. Weeds are the major pest in virtually all of the agro-ecological zones of SSA. Parasitic and perennial weeds dominate the savanna vegetation zones whereas rapidly growing annual weeds overwhelm crops in the forest vegetation zones. High weed pressure coupled with inefficient weed control practices have tied up a disproportionate percentage of SSA's economically active population in the primary task of food production and also have kept crop yields down. In the absence of organized weed research and professional training in weed science to meet the needs of the region, improved cultivars of virtually all crops fall prey to weeds, and available arable land becomes limited to that area that can be kept free of weeds. A preponderance of annual weeds in humid parts of SSA together with hard-to-kill perennial grasses and parasitic weeds in the subhumid and arid agro-ecological zones hamper crop production and frustrate farmers throughout the region. Sustainable food production in the region can be achieved by introducing improved weed management technologies and by addressing other food production constraints of the region.

AB Upper Lupande Game Management area in Luangwa Valley, Zambia currently supports good populations of sixteen large and medium-sized herbivores.  Impala was the most abundant constituting 34% of the total population estimates, followed by buffalo (19%), zebra (12%), wildebeest (10%), warthog (8%), elephant (6%) and hippopotamus (3%).  Other species made up the remaining 8%.  The survey zone contained a herbivore biomass of 10,796.18 x 10(3) kg.  Elephants contributed 50.2% and buffalo 25.1% of the total herbivore biomass of the area.  The estimated maximum sustainable off-take potential in Upper Lupande was 1110.14 x 10(3) kg per annum.  The distribution of most of the species studied suggested favourable recruitment status.  There were species-specific distribution patterns and densities in the survey zone.

TI HIGH BED LOW DITCH SYSTEM IN THE PEARL RIVER DELTA, SOUTH CHINA
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The traditional high bed-low ditch agroecosystem in the Pearl River Delta of South China was studied by setting up research sites on farms.  The high bed-low ditch systems were used for sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), banana (Musa paradisiaca and M. paradisiaca var. sapientum) and tangerine (Citrus reticuluta var. tangerina) production.  A rice (Oryza sativa) field which was adjacent to these systems was chosen as a control.  Through the measurement of the system input, output, production and decomposition, the analysis of the N, P, K content of the samples and the setting up of a nitrogen flow model, results showed that the high bed-low ditch system has positive effects on lowering the water table, promoting root growth, reducing soil erosion and nutrient loss, preserving organic matter in the ditch and increasing the internal cycling of nutrients.  The effects of biogas digesting and animal husbandry on the sustainability of the high bed-low ditch system is discussed.

TI CHEESE, TOURISTS, AND RED PANDAS IN THE NEPAL HIMALAYAS
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Langtang National Park in the Nepal Himalayas provides resources for about 30,000 people living in and around the park.  The park is the site of two cheese factories that produce 14,000 kg of cheese per year for marketing in Kathmandu.  The factories collect about 140,000 liters of milk annually and use well over 100,000 kg of fuel wood to process the milk into cheese.  Loans and one-year advance payments encourage farmers to maintain large herds of chauri (a yak-cattle hybrid), and in many areas overgrazing has resulted.  The presence in the area of large herds of chauri, their herders, and dogs has led to the death of many red pandas, a species that is probably on the verge of extinction in Langtang.  It is estimated that there are fewer than 40 red pandas and these are isolated in four or more populations.  Their fecundity is low and mortality is high.  This problem might be solved by reducing cheese production and restricting the number of chauri while commensurately increasing the price of cheese so that farmers' income from milk could remain the same.  Current cheese prices are already too high for Nepali consumers (US $4.30/kg), but cheap by the standards of the Western tourists who are the sole market.  Thus, increasing prices would have little impact on the cheese market, but could be translated into a substantial benefit for the farmers, whose use of grazing lands must ultimately be sustainable, and for the red pandas and other wildlife that must share the mountain landscapes with the farmers.

TI MODERNIZATION VERSUS SUSTAINABILITY - DISINTEGRATING VILLAGE
   AGRO-ECOCOMPLEXES IN THE DRY ZONE OF SRI-LANKA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The agro-ecocomplexes of traditional villages in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka included four major components, namely crop cultivation, animal husbandry, fishery, and forestry. While these four components collectively provided practically all the food and other needs of the village inhabitants, the ecological interactions between these components contributed to the sustainability of the village agro-ecocomplex. Thus the livestock were used to provide draught power for farming, and were fed on crop residues and straw, their dung being used to fertilize the soil. Fishery was mainly on irrigated paddy fields and in the irrigation system, while the fish on the paddy fields consumed harmful insects and worms, and provided fertilizer in their excreta. The village forest on the catchment area, and the trees sparsely grown on the cultivated area and in the irrigation system, substantially contributed to maintain the natural productivity, yielding firewood, timber, and various foods. In this manner, the village agro-ecocomplex functioned to satisfy the needs of its human inhabitants without impairing its own sustainability.
   This village agro-ecocomplex system is now in the process of disintegration owing to structural, technological, and institutional, changes brought about by modern development. The reason is that these modern development strategies were basically designed to raise the production of the land-area rather than to preserve the productivity of the given agro-ecocomplex. For while farm mechanization displaced the draught animals, the increased population pressure of more and more humans reduced the grazing lands. Both modem development and population pressure had destructive effects on the forest cover, while increased utilization of agrochemicals adversely affected the fish culture on paddy fields. In this way, livestock, fishery, and forestry, all became insignificant or at least insufficient, and were de-linked from crop cultivation. In consequence, the village agro-ecocomplex has become de-stabilized, and dependence on external inputs has increased so greatly that self-sustainability of the village agro-ecocomplex has ceased to exist except in some remote areas.

DT Article
ID RESOURCE
AB Possible solutions to the commons problem have rarely been investigated systematically by the use of biological data on the status and sustainability of the resource. The edible White-spined Sea-urchin (Tripneustes ventricosus) resource of St Lucia, West Indies, is highly prized and vulnerable to exploitation, as is indicated by recent declines in its stocks. In the south-east of St Lucia the resource was almost entirely depleted in an area in which access was free and open. It was not depleted in the other two areas in which there were access controls. In one case, the area was under government control as a marine reserve; in the other, there was a locally practised 'closed season' and community-based management of access into a bay.
   The results of our study indicated that both government controls and informal, community-level controls can lead to successful resource-management outcomes. These findings challenge the 'conventional wisdom' that commonly-owned resources are destined to be over-exploited

   ISSUES, AND PROPOSED PLAN
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Historically, remote islands and marine resources have been free for those willing to venture into their areas. Until recent years, many such islands have been effectively managed by their remote locations and any native humans. But nowadays, under-use is turning into destructive over-fishing and plundering, because there is no surveillance. Many marine parks in South-east Asia are facing the same problems as Tubbataha (White, 1989; Arquiza, 1990). Sustainable management in these areas is a challenge, especially where there are no local authorities or communities to take immediate control.
   Field surveys at Tubbataha Reef in 1984 and 1989 have revealed a dramatic decline in the coral-reef quality from the incidence of dynamite fishing, the use of sodium cyanide for the aquarium and live-food fish trades, and the dropping of large anchors. Sea-turtles and seabirds are also endangered.
   Solutions in areas such as Tubbataha will require organization beyond the grasp of local residents in the islands, who have traditionally had little formal government. Although they are aware of the problem, they are faced with outsiders and intruders who do not respect their conservatism. National government and/or nongovernment organizations can play a role in management, while being careful not to alienate the positive force and management control of the local communities (White, 1988a). Such issues require sensitive planning and community-based approaches that are directed at education, organization, and the involvement and building of local responsibility.
   The management plan for Tubbataha Reef National Marine Park should have three thrusts and concomitant strategies: (1) to curtail immediate resource-destruction through the deployment of a team of educators, community organizers, and law-enforcement officers; (2) to articulate and implement a Park zonation plan which includes traditional fishing areas, sanctuaries, and buoys for anchoring; and (3) to implement a community development programme which will systematically integrate the adjacent fishing community into the Park management efforts and give the fishermen due responsibility in this process.

AB Questions concerning the availability of resources in tropical rain forests have given rise to the current debate centering on whether human subsistence based solely on foraging is possible in these biomes without agricultural subsidies. This paper takes the position that changing perspectives on ecological pattern and process in tropical forests and the significant variation among tropical forests on a worldwide as well as regional scale must be taken into consideration. Human disturbance is also proposed as a cause of dependence on agriculture by modem human foragers rather than as a necessary precondition for successful exploitation of the tropical forest. These issues are discussed against the background of a case study of the Yuqui, who, until very recently, were true foragers in the Bolivian Amazon. For the Yuqui, the sustainability of their subsistence system depended on a fine-grained knowledge of their environment and the freedom of movement over a large territory to access resources within it.

DE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL; NATURAL ENEMIES; AUGMENTATION; BIOPESTICIDES;
   INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT; INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION; TRAINING
AB Progress in the adoption of biological control in the 100 years since the introduction of the vedalia beetle into California is reviewed briefly as a background to examining current trends, especially in tropical countries. Recent successful classical biological control programmes have increased interest in applying biological control to other major pest problems as has increasing public appreciation of the dangers of over-reliance on chemical pesticides. Consequently, there is an unprecedented opportunity for greater use of biological control. However, the opportunities for classical biological control are limited and greater attention to other biological control techniques is necessary, especially the development of pathogens as biopesticides and techniques to increase the impact of native natural enemies. Biological control is not a panacea and can seldom be effective on its own. It must, therefore, be integrated with other pest control techniques in integrated management programmes. International collaboration is required to increase awareness of these opportunities, facilitate the procurement of biotic agents and generally to promote the adoption of biologically sound sustainable pest and vector management procedures. Support for biological control should include training of personnel who will be involved in decision-making and in implementing control. Practitioners must be prepared to promote the use of biological control by farmers, and also address legitimate public concerns about the safety of biological control so as to ensure continuing public support and appropriate regulatory procedures.

DE MARINE BIOSPHERE; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM
AB Worldwide awareness for the creation of Marine Biosphere Reserves has increased considerably due to the human depredation in many coastal areas and natural changes.  Many important and unique plant and animal species have been extinct and whatever remains, needs to be conserved and managed for posterity.  Biosphere Reserve conserves and maintains genetic diversity of plant and animal species and helps to manage the natural resources on a sustainable basis.  So far five Marine Biosphere Reserves have been declared in India and a few more are under consideration.
   The present article gives in brief the status of Marine Biosphere Reserves in India and a few other potential areas for the same reason, along the Indian coast.  An action plan has been suggested to manage the Biosphere Reserves and conservation measures to be taken.

TI INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC ACCOUNTING - FRAMEWORK FOR A SNA
   SATELLITE SYSTEM
SO REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB National accounts have provided the most widely used indicators for the assessment of economic performance, trends of economic growth and of the economic counterpart of social welfare.  However, two major drawbacks of national accounting have raised doubts about the usefulness of national accounts data for the measurement of long-term sustainable economic growth and socio-economic development.  These drawbacks are the neglect of (a) scarcities of natural resources which threaten the sustained productivity of the economy and (b) the degradation of environmental quality from pollution and its effects on human health and welfare.  In the present paper, the authors attempt to reflect environmental concerns in an accounting framework which maintains as far as possible SNA concepts and principles.  To this end, the accounting framework is used to develop a "SNA Satellite System for Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting" (SEEA).  Environmental costs of economic activities, natural asset accounts and expenditures for environmental protection and enhancement are presented in flow accounts and balance sheets in a consistent manner, i.e. maintaining the accounting identities of SNA.  Such accounting permits the definition and compilation of modified indicators of income and expenditure, product, capital and value added, allowing for the depletion of natural resources, the degradation of environmental quality and social response to these effects.  A desk study of a selected country is used to clarify the proposed approaches, to demonstrate their application in future country studies and to illustrate the quantitative effects of the use of modified concepts on the results of analysis.

TI TILLAGE AND AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
SO SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID TROPICAL ALFISOL; SOIL-MOISTURE; SYSTEMS; CONSERVATION; MAIZE
AB Agricultural sustainability implies an increasing trend in per capita productivity to meet the present needs without jeopardizing the future potential.  Soil tillage, soil surface management to alleviate soil-related constraints to crop production, is a basic and an important input with short- and long-term effects on sustainability.  An important effect of soil tillage on sustainability is through its impact on the environment e.g. soil degradation, water quality, emission of greenhouse gases from soil-related processes, etc.  The need to attain agricultural sustainability is particularly urgent in several tropical eco-regions and soils of low-carrying capacity in the tropics.
   Soil tillage influences agricultural sustainability through its effects on soil processes, soil properties, and crop growth.  However, there is no one blueprint of a universally applicable sustainable tillage system.  Appropriate tillage systems are soil- and crop-specific and their adaptation is governed by both biophysical and socio-economic factors.  In addition to increasing crop yields, tillage methods must also facilitate soil and water conservation, improve root system development, maintain a favorable level of soil organic matter content, and reverse degradative trends in the soil's life-support processes.
   Important components or sub-systems of conservation-effective tillage systems include mulch farming, no-till or reduced tillage systems, use of cover crops and planted fallows, agroforestry, raised beds or ridge-tillage, and soil inversion or deep plowing.  The ecological limits for the applicability of these components or sub-systems differ widely.  The efforts of a multi-disciplinary team (comprising soil scientists, agricultural engineers, agronomists, economists and social scientists) are needed to develop site-specific tillage methods to achieve both short- and long-term goals of agricultural sustainability.

TI TILLAGE METHODS AND SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL
SO SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The intensive tillage systems adopted in southern Brazil have accelerated soil erosion, depleted plant-available nutrients and reduced crop productivity.  These effects are better perceived in terms of farmer's land use and soil management techniques, i.e. animal- or machine-powered equipment through high and low aptitude land use classification systems.  However, these tillage systems coexist together at the level of agricultural watersheds and are not compatible for continuous and sustainable agriculture.  This article proposes a methodology for using agricultural watersheds as planning units for integrated soil conservation plans.  This methodology is based on considerations of the farmer's socioeconomic conditions, land aptitude and other biophysical factors.  The proposed methodology envisages a continuous and intensive land use for sustained production.

TI NO-TILL TECHNOLOGY AND LEGUME ROTATION FOR SUSTAINABLE CROP PRODUCTION
   IN THE DOUGLAS DALY REGION OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY, AUSTRALIA
SO SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The adoption of no till/legume rotation practices combined with low levels of fertiliser, herbicide and insecticide appear to be key elements in the development of an ecologically stable and sustainable crop production system in the Douglas Daly Region of the Northern Territory. Tillage studies involving a maize-soybean rotation system over a 4-year period have shown a 41% average increase in maize yield under no till compared with conventional till. The difference between no till and conventional till was generally highest during the drier years. In a 1-year study of a sorghum-peanut rotation, the yields of sorghum and peanut under no till were similar to those under conventional till. Application of nitrogen fertilizer increased sorghum flag leaf area by an average of 12% for no till compared with conventional till. Total nitrogen concentration in peanut leaves under no till was significantly higher than under conventional till indicating better nodulation and nitrogen fixation under no till.
   Sorghum grown following a 2-year-old Centrosema pascuorum cultivar 'Cavalcade' ley showed no significant response to applied nitrogen. In the top 60 cm of the soil the average soil nitrate nitrogen at sowing and at 8 weeks after sowing was 30 ppm, indicating a reasonable rate of mineralisation in the soil. This was further supported by the fact that the nitrogen content of sorghum stover plus grain was 112 kg ha-1 at the zero level of applied nitrogen.

AB The grazing of pasture systems has many of the elements essential to a sustainable agro-ecosystem wherein the soil resource is not degraded through time.  Unfortunately there is increasing evidence that the soils of Australian tropical grasslands are suffering serious and permanent degradation through our inability to manage grazing pressure under the highly variable climatic regime which characterizes the Australian tropics.
   This paper details the evidence of soil degradation under our current rangeland management and illustrates how far these practices are from that of a sustainable system.  The challenge to find grazing systems that are sustainable is shown to lie in recognizing that the soil-plant-animal ecosystem must be studied in an integrated way.  Focus on short term animal productivity without consideration of the consequences to all other essential components of the ecosystem is shown to be a primary cause for degradation of the soil resource.  Too often the consequences of a practice has not been considered because the components of the agricultural system have been studied in isolation.
   Both salinity and soil acidification are identified as soil resource management issues that must receive attention in the Australian tropics.  The use of tropical legumes, the clearing of woodlands, and the use of introduced grasses are all managements that can radically alter the flux of water, nutrient and salt in the soil profile.  The management of these factors is the key to control of both salinity, and soil acidification.  The place and balance of the grass, legume, shrub and tree is fundamental.  Progress in building sustainable grazing systems in the tropics requires integrated ecological studies with increasing emphasis on both the role of soil biology in the cycling of nutrients and the movement of water and solute in the system.

AB Native pastures in the Australian tropics and subtropics are augmented with legumes to increase cattle diet quality and quantity.  Approximately 50,000 ha are oversown each year and are potentially productive and sustainable.  Key features of legume adaptation and animal productivity are discussed, along with a plea for greater emphasis in legume evaluation on the mineral concentrations of plants at contrasting levels of soil fertility.  The potential of augmented pastures to add nitrogen to pastoral systems is contrasted with other, extractive practices designed to improve livestock diet, but their limitations as sustainable resources are also outlined.  Simplicity of management is suggested as a key requirement in the success of augmented pastures and it is argued that wide adaptation to climate, soil and management are vital ingredients in that simplicity.

AB Nitrogen fertilized pastures are being usea more in high rainfall areas as part of both beef and dairy production systems.  Because of their productivity at critical times of the year, they have useful roles in reducing stress on other pasture types and boosting production from groups of cattle to match specific market requirements.  On properties where cool-dry season management is critical, higher and less seasonal production can be attained by applying N fertilizer to a seasonally responsive grass on the deeper soils.  On predominantly poorly drained properties N application to grasses resistant to trampling on high country, allows stock reductions on low areas during the wet season.  The application of 200-300 kg/ha N annually gave near optimum milk and beef production per hectare in areas with annual rainfall greater than 800-1000 mm.  Disadvantages of N fertilized pastures are high capital outlays in fertilizer and stock.  However, under present economic conditions N fertilizer has a role in increasing productivity and sustainability of tropical and sub-tropical property management systems.  Use on special purpose pastures can lead to substantial gains in farm profitability.

AB Stocking rate and efficiency of production are the basics of sustainable management systems capable of responding to the severe threats of reduced prices and droughts.
   Animal management involves the integration of complicated cross-disciplinary information within the context of whole property operation.  The use of decision support packages to integrate the large amount of available biological, technical and financial information is a positive step in aiding meaninful decision-making for the short and long term.  Simulated case studies are presented which describe various strategies used in two districts of north Australia, and the predicted outcomes when the various scenarios are subjected to climatic or financial stresses.  While simulations in both districts support the argument that sustainability depends on property viability, another important factor is the greater possible flexibility in management responses which result on well developed enterprises with conservative stocking rates.
   Recognition by researchers and advisers of the complexity of the system, and the development of integrated extension and support services which result in adoption of appropriate attitudes to management, decision-making and existing technology are priorities.

AB Decision support software can assist producers to make decisions that can help to achieve economic and biological sustainability of the grazing system.  Interactions between management decisions and the physical, biological and financial attributes of a property are often complex, and thus the ability to adequately describe individual properties as pastoral systems is fundamental to effective decision support.  Our paper reviews the benefits and success of computer based decision support packages for pasture management in livestock production, and suggests how teams of process and applied researchers can be formed to provide the scientific basis for future development and transfer of this new technology to industry.

AB The benefits of introducing or maintaining a tree component in land use systems are becoming attractive for land rehabilitation and sustainable production purposes.  Increasing evidence supports the view that multiple production systems involving trees have some beneficial economic and environmental consequences in many land use programs throughout Australia.
   Coordinated research to support these approaches and to demonstrate their implementation and potential is now needed to complement fragmentary research throughout the country.  Government policy towards forestry and agroforestry requires redefinition to provide production incentives to increase the impact of the environmental thrust.
   Trees have often been included in farm planning for amenity purposes, particularly around farm houses and buildings but less frequently to provide shade and shelter for animals, crops and pastures or to reduce the harmful effects of rising watertables, especially those containing salt.  Advantages and disadvantages of including trees in multiple land use systems are listed and their role and potential discussed.  There is considerable potential to expand private timber production in agroforestry systems to offset the very large import bill for timber and forest products.

AB Fertile soil is the basis of sustainable agriculture. Continuous cultivation and cereal cropping lead to the depletion of soil fertility, low crop yield and poor grain quality. It is estimated that 1.2M ha of the total cropping area of 1.5M ha in southern sub-tropical Queensland are affected by soil fertility decline, with a consequent reduction in crop yield and grain quality valued at an output loss of $324M/yr. There is an urgent need to adopt fertility restorative practices to maintain economically viable farming enterprises.
   Legume based leys, grain legumes, fertiliser N and zero-tillage were compared for their effectiveness in restoring or maintaining soil fertility and for sustaining wheat yield and quality on a fertility-depleted brigalow soil at Warra on the western Darling Downs. Both annual N fertilizer application and zero tillage accompanied by N application maintained wheat yields although they are uncertain options for long-term fertility restoration. The grain legume, chickpea, provided a moderate level of N supply to the following wheat crop but it is also an uncertain option for fertility restoration. Pasture leys based on annual and perennial legumes, with or without grasses, provide a useful option for fertility restoration. One year medic and lucerne leys contributed to soil N to a moderate level although lucerne leys may have an adverse effect on the moisture available for following crops. Grass-legume mixed pastures increased soil fertility as measured by an increase in soil total N.
   Of these options, pastures based on annual and perennial temperate legumes and tropical grasses have the potential to increase or maintain soil fertility. Legume leys and especially grass-legume pasture leys will play a key role in future ecologically and economically sustainable farming systems.

AB During the 1990s, wheat protein and yield from many cropping soils (mainly vertisols) in the subtropical wheat belt will continue to decline as soil fertility is gradually depleted. One option for maintaining crop yield and quality is ley farming. It has had limited application when soil fertility has been adequate for crops and where the use of N fertiliser has been a viable option. Temperate legumes of the genus Medicago (lucerne and annual medics), and tropical grasses are available for use in leys, but there are currently no suitable tropical legumes.
   The increases in yield and quality of grain crops recorded after lucerne and annual medic leys in various experiments are reviewed and related to changes in soil N and other factors. Leys provide more enduring benefits to subsequent crops than does the application of fertiliser N.
   Ley farming is productive, sustainable, and provides a greater hedge against climatic and economic risks than cropping alone. However, it requires a wider range of management skills, and the challenge remains to stimulate wider adoption of this system.

AB The search for economically viable ley pastures in the Australian tropics is an attempt to emulate the successful ley farming systems, based on subclover and wheat, in regions with Mediterranean and temperate climates in southern Australia.
   The paper examines experimental legume ley pastures in the semi-arid tropics from four points of view, viz - initial establishment and re-establishment of the various ley species after a crop; the contribution of biological nitrogen from the ley to the farming system; the control of pasture species during the crop phase; and the feeding value of ley pastures and crop residues to grazing cattle.
   Management problems highlighted by the research on experimental ley pastures include:  grass dominance in the pasture; the extremely rapid decomposition of legume residues and the resultant leaching of mineral nitrogen beyond the root front of the developing crop; and the lack of sufficient crop and pasture residues in some seasons for successful crop establishment using no-till methods.
   The adequacy of existing genetic resources for ley pastures in this region, the biological and economic sustainability of tropical ley systems, and the prospects for commercial use of the experimental results, are also examined.

AB Fertility and structure of surface soil is declining throughout the marginal dryland croplands of eastern Australia.  The incorporation of a pasture phase in the cropping sequence appears to be the most promising option for developing a sustainable cropping system.  However, special problems currently restrict the use of sown pastures in these lands in sub-tropical Queensland and NSW.
   For much of the region, productive and persistent pasture species have been identified.  These include the native grasses, Astrebla lappacea and Dichanthium sericeum.  Perennial grasses are still needed on the lighter textured infertile soils and there are still no adapted summer growing legumes for frost prone areas.
   Unreliable establishment is currently the main technical constraint limiting wider use of the available pasture species.  Strategies for overcoming this constraint are discussed and include decision support packages using climatic and biological models, improving establishment by means of aerial seeding, mulches and stubbles, and management for improving the supply of soil moisture.
