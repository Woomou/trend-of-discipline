TI Effects of irrigation and application of phosphorus fertilizer on the
   yield and water use of tomato grown on a clay terrace soil of Bangladesh
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
AB A field experiment was conducted in the rabi (dry) season of 1998-99 on a clay terrace soil of Bangladesh to study the effects of irrigation and P fertilization on the yield, total water use., and water use efficiency of tomato. Five levels of irrigation and four levels of P application were involved, Irrigation, P application, and the interaction of irrigation and P application had a significant impact on the yield of tomato. In the individual effects of irrigation and P application, the yield was significantly high in the three and four irrigations and at the P level of 120 kg P2O5 ha(-1). As the interaction effect, the highest yield of 38.7 Mg ha I with the maximum net benefit was obtained under the combination of three irrigations at 15, 35, and 55 days after transplantation of seedlings and P application at the level of 120 kg P2O5 ha(-1). Its total water use was 169 mm, giving the reasonably high water use efficiency of 229 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). The highest range of water use efficiency was noted in non-irrigation treatments, but the yield and not benefit were about half of those of the highest yield. The treatment with three irrigations along with P application at the level of 120 kg P2O5 ha(-1) was concluded to be the best combination for the sustainable tomato cultivation in Shallow Red-Brown Terrace Soil of Bangladesh.

ID MODEL
AB The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate how timely investments in the ecosphere promote high level stable agricultural income. It is shown that the recovery capability of the ecosphere together with strong agricultural productivity relative to the rest of the economy may be considered as control parameters of the system. They play a crucial role for agriculture to escape from a low level trap. The scenario leading to the escape is based on an economic strategy leading to a sequence of local and global bifurcations, changing the dynamical structure of the system. The effects of globalization on the system's dynamics and stable sets are considered. Globalisation is taken into account by means of nonautonomous impulses making selected system parameters oscillate. Necessary conditions for sustainable agriculture development are established.

AB Microsatellite DNA/simple-sequence-repeat (SSR) loci were identified, isolated and characterized in white spruce (Picea glauca) by screening both a non-enriched partial genomic library and a partial genomic library enriched for (AG/TC)(n)-containing clones. Inheritance and linkage of polymorphic SSR loci were determined in F-1 progeny of four controlled crosses. We also assessed the compatibility and usefulness of the P. glauca microsatellite DNA markers in five other Picea species. Twenty-four microsatellites were identified by sequencing 32 clones selected from screens of 5400 clones from the two libraries. The (AG/TC), microsatellites were the most abundant in the non-enriched library. Eight microsatellite DNA loci were of the single-copy type, and six of these were polymorphic. A total of 87 alleles were detected at the six polymorphic SSR loci in 32 P. glauca individuals drawn from several populations. The number of alleles found at these six SSR loci ranged from 2 to 22, with an average of 14.5 alleles per locus, and the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.48 to 0.91, with a mean of 0.66 per locus. Parents of the controlled crosses were polymorphic for five of the six polymorphic SSR loci. Microsatellite DNA variants at each of these five SSR loci followed a single-locus, codominant, Mendelian inheritance pattern. Joint two-locus segregation tests indicated complete linkage between PGL13 and PGL14, and no linkage between any of the remaining SSR loci. Each of the 32 P. glauca individuals examined had unique single or two-locus genotypes. With the exception of non-amplification of PGL12 in P. sitchensis, P. mariana, and P. abies and the monomorphic nature of PGL7 in P. mariana, primer pairs for all six polymorphic SSR loci successfully amplified specific fragments from genomic DNA and resolved polymorphic microsatellites of comparable sizes in P. engelmanni, P. sitchensis, P. mariana, P. rubens, and P. abies. The closely related species P. mariana and P. rubens, and P. glauca and P. sitchensiss could be distinguished by the PGL12 SSR marker. The microsatellite DNA markers developed and reported here could be used for assisting various genetics, breeding, biotechnology, tree forensics, genome mapping, conservation, restoration, and sustainable forest management programs in spruce species.

AB Special difficulties and high costs are frequently incurred when sources of energy such as kerosene or dry-cell batteries are transported to mountain areas. Moreover, use and disposal of these sources of energy pose risks to health and the environment. On the other hand. the use of local, renewable sources of energy such as wind, water, or solar power ensures that mountain communities can enjoy both greater independence and safely with respect to energy supply. In mountain regions worldwide, local hydropower produced by small water turbines is important for irrigation, grain milling, and other purposes. Water turbines have also long been used to produce electricity to illuminate houses or operate radio and television devices, while direct solar energy has traditionally been used to dry food and clothing. Recently, however, a variety of solar energy systems including special house construction, use of cooking devices such as the well-known cooking boxes and reflector systems, and electricity supplied by photovoltaic (solar-electric) systems have been introduced. Some of these systems are especially suitable for areas with intense sunlight and low temperatures. Solar-electric stand-alone systems have proven useful in the European Alps and the Pyrenees, where there is evidence that they are an important source of sustainable energy (Figure 1).

AB In many Western European mountains, ancient irrigation practices have been the basis for sustainable subsistence-based mountain agriculture, especially up to the beginning of the 20th century. These mountain zones have proved popular sites for the development of hydroelectric power (HEP). Few attempts have been made to measure the impact of HEP on traditional indigenous irrigation systems dependent on the same resource base. This article examines the physical and socioeconomic impact of HEP development on the bisse irrigation system in the Valais, Switzerland, and discusses new water resource issues, conflicts, adaptations, and innovative responses. The study shows that a two- to three-tier consultation process has led to communes and autonomous collective irrigation institutions (consortages) signing and ratifying long-term conventions that ceded water to HEP companies at the scale of watersheds. Water supplies for irrigation are protected by these conventions at the same time as changed hydrological regimes improve water security in economically viable bisses. Conventions also improved the economic security of some consortages, while at the level of individual households, HEP development allowed diversification of income generation strategies.

AB Accelerated soil erosion is a common and environmentally destructive consequence of development, especially in mountain regions. Soil erosion is of special concern in agricultural lands, but agriculture is only one of many development activities that greatly accelerates soil erosion processes. Road building, trail use, excavation, extractive activities, and construction also can cause severe soil erosion. Soil conservation technologies are relatively simple and well known, but often they are not applied where they could be most effective because the connections between different elements of the landscape (eg, roads and cultivated fields) are not well understood. This paper reviews two previous soil erosion research projects in the Ecuadorian Andes involving field observations and small-plot rainfall simulation experiments and provides examples of erosion-related landscape connections at the drainage basin scale. In light of the important influence of roads, trails, and abandoned farmlands on soil erosion processes on Andean slopes, sustainable management of the soil resource requires both looking across and managing across conventionally delineated boundaries in the natural and altered landscapes of mountain regions.

AB The use of precautionary management actions within a fisheries context has generally been limited to reducing fishing mortality. By the use of quantitative models, overfishing thresholds can be determined and actions can be taken to reduce the probability of further population declines and to allow rebuilding. Within this context, four management approaches have been defined (i.e., preventive approach, corrective approach, precautionary approach, and precautionary principle) on the basis of levels of uncertainty in the information used to make decisions and the potential cost of errors as a result of those decisions. In this paper, I apply these approaches to developing a precautionary and adaptive habitat management framework. Fishing effort metrics are used to develop estimates of the area of seafloor impacted by fishing, and thresholds are proposed to trigger specific types of management actions. Information needs include the cumulative area impacted by all gears, the distribution of habitats and diversity of key taxa, effects of gears on habitat and patterns of diversity, and linkages between habitat and the dynamics of exploited populations. Incentives for the fishing industry that will improve the information available to make decisions and reduce the level of precaution required for managing exploitation of wild populations are discussed. This framework is a starting point for management agencies to develop precautionary and adaptive habitat management programs that promote both the sustainability of exploited populations and the maintenance of biological diversity.

AB The purpose of this study was to explain how a series of management actions facilitated the restoration of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Parry Sound of Lake Huron. Since 1988, the relative abundance of wild spawning lake trout has increased in Parry Sound. Estimates of the spawning population (1994-1997) varied between 16,000 and 29,000 individuals. This increase in abundance was achieved by controlling sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus (1960), stocking yearling lake trout derived from the remnant stock (1981-1997), creating a refuge (1987), restricting harvest by reducing both angling seasons and possession limits ( 198 1), and imposing a size limit for retention (1994). By 1997, the three criteria of successful restoration were achieved, that is, the average age of mature females was I year older than the age of first maturation, wild fish composed 50% of the spawners, and the abundance of wild lake trout had been stable or increased for three consecutive years. As a consequence, stocking of yearlings was discontinued after 1997. A stochastic simulation model was developed to assess the likelihood of realizing sustainable harvests over a range of total mortality rates. We concluded that lake trout restoration is possible if sea lampreys are controlled, the appropriate strain is stocked, and exploitation is restricted, although additional limiting factors could hinder rehabilitation success in some locations of the Great Lakes.

ID RECOVERY; STRATEGY
AB Increasing environmental concerns about the disposal of mass produced products have resulted in efforts to take back end-of-life consumer products. Legislation aimed at forcing manufacturers to take back electronics products at the end of their useful lives has either been adopted or is impending in many countries. This, along with shrinking landfill capacity and the reluctance of communities to open new waste sinks underscores the importance of developing methods and models for the management of end-of-life materials and products.
   This paper reports a study of the reverse channels for recycling of electronics products. The economics of electronics recycling are modeled from the viewpoints of the generators, recyclers, and material processors separately. A variety of mathematical programming models, representative of the many ways in which the recycling industry currently operates, have been proposed along with numerical illustrations. Models integrating disassembly and material recovery decisions are also presented, These models can be used by recyclers and processors for optimizing recycling operations and thus contribute towards the economic sustainability of electronics recycling.

AB Seed bacterization with five plant growth promoting fluorescent Pseudomonas strains isolated from Indian and Swedish soils and three Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viceae strains isolated from Swedish soils were shown to promote plant growth in Pisum sativum L. cv. Capella. Co-inoculation of the fluorescent pseudomonads and Rhizobium improved plant growth in terms of shoot height, root length and dry weight. Both the fluorescent pseudomonads and Rhizobium were shown to exhibit a wide range of antifungal activity against pathogens specific to pea. Seed bacterization with plant growth promoting strains alone and together with a rhizobial isolate, R 361-27 reduced the number of infected peas grown in Fusarium oxysporum infested soils. We found that the introduced organisms were able to colonize the roots, which was confirmed using immunofluorescence staining and drug resistant mutant strains. In a synthetic culture medium, all the plant growth promoting fluorescent pseudomonads strains produced siderophores, which shown to express antifungal and antibacterial activity. Our results suggest the potential use of these bacteria to induce plant growth and disease suppression in sustainable agriculture production systems.

AB Deficiency in phosphorus (P) can severely limit rice yields. Developing cultivars with tolerance to P deficiency may represent a more sustainable solution than sole reliance on fertilizer application. To assess genotypic variation for tolerance to P deficiency the P uptake of 30 genotypes was measured on P-deficient soil. Variation for P uptake was high, ranging from 0.6 to 12.9 mg P/plant, Traditional varieties were superior to modern varieties. A major quantitative trait locus for P uptake had previously been identified in a population developed by crossing the modern variety 'Nipponbare' with the P deficiency-tolerant landrace 'Kasalath'. This quantitative trait locus was transferred to 'Nipponbare' by three backcrosses. Under P deficiency this improved line surpassed 'Nipponbare' in P uptake by 170% and in grain yield by 250%. These results show that the genotypic variation for tolerance to P deficiency in rice can be used successfully in rice improvement. By combining high P uptake of the donor variety 'Kasalath' with a high harvest-index characteristic of modern varieties it was possible to more than triple the grain yield of 'Nipponbare' under P deficiency.

DE foundations; piles & piling; urban regeneration
AB For the past 50 years civil engineers have been filling the ground under our towns and cities with, among other things, bored concrete piles. In London Clay in particular, such piles are a quick, quiet and cost-effective method of supporting ever-taller buildings and structures. But, unlike the shallower footings of old, today's deep foundations are almost impossible to remove when the building reaches the end of its life and the site needs to be redeveloped. The easiest solution-but one that is clearly not sustainable-is to fill up the space in between with even bigger piles. This paper argues that reuse of existing piles is the real answer and discusses the changes needed in our approach to designing, building and paying for foundations in the future.

TI DStakes of animal production in Southern countries.
SO PRODUCTIONS ANIMALES
LA French
DT Article
AB In Southern countries, the place of the animal production is more and more important and requires a quantitative/qualitative improvement of the production ability quite different than previously. In contrast with stagnation of the animal production observed in Europe and North America, this progress results from an important increase of the demand linked to the human growth and, in some cases, to the change in feeding behaviour of urban people. The challenges for research and development are the improvement of the animal productivity, lower than in northern countries, the poverty alleviation still predominating in rural areas from tropical countries, and environmental preservation. In the same time, these challenges must avoid the drifts of productivist approach, common after the second world war in northern agriculture, and must ensure the sustainability of the production systems in the future. The current dynamics reveal the livestock revolution in those countries as it is recognized by international agencies.

AB Research on sustainable agriculture is underfunded in the United States. Therefore, the topical relevance and the dissemination of this research must be carefully targeted to reach farmers. This paper investigates the actual Linkages between local alternative farmers and the information dissemination efforts of publicly funded researchers who obtained grants from a federal/regional program. This analysis is based on a mail survey of twenty sustainable farmers in the Illinois Sustainable Agriculture Society, fifty farmers in the Illinois Organic Crop Improvement Association, and forty-two researchers who received grant funding from the North Central Region of the USDA's (United States Department of Agriculture) Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (USDA-SARE) program between 1958 and 1996. Appropriate statistical techniques were employed to analyze the relatively small sample sizes. Findings suggest that the local needs of farmers are not being met by the national and regional efforts of USDA-SARE, although sustainable farmers are somewhat more likely than organic farmers to receive publicity funded research information. Based on this survey research, the USDA should reconsider the focus and goals of its commitment to sustainable agricultural research.

AB Productive conservation, a sustainable development concept for the Amazon, ideally leads to economic development in rural areas with conservation of rain forest ecosystems. This study evaluates the human and environmental dynamics of productive conservation in Rondonia, Brazil, using as a case study beekeeping, which has been promoted by the World Bank-funded Rondonia Natural Resources Development Project. Promoters of beekeeping have given little attention to basic ecological or political economic issues that determine whether the practice contributes to ideals of productive conservation. While beekeeping can generate significant increases in household income, beekeeping cooperatives may become overdependent on donor funds. Once the flow of productive conservation donor funds stops, organizations may fail, making it too difficult for beekeepers to maintain their operations. Beekeeping does not lead directly toward rain forest conservation. Moreover, beekeeping almost exclusively employs introduced Africanized "killer" bees, commercially exploitable in the Amazon only because deforestation has temporarily created suitable habitats for them. Given the human and environmental configuration of beekeeping in Rondonia, the paper suggests ways to direct beekeeping toward accomplishing the goals of productive conservation.

ID POLICY
AB Why do governments tax exports at rates that are ultimately self-defeating? An answer may lie in the time-inconsistent nature of a tow-tax policy. Using a dynamic model of export taxation, I show that the sustainability of a low-tax policy depends on three variables: the ratio of sunk costs to total costs, how heavily future export revenue is discounted, and expected future export earnings. Using data on taxation, leadership duration, and profitability, I test this theory for 32 countries and six crops from Sub-Saharan Africa. These three variables are statistically and economically relevant predictors of tax regime.

AB Sustainable animal production requires a healthy production system including healthy animals producing wholesome products. Epidemiology as a discipline is concerned with the occurrence of disease or disease indicators in populations as well as with factors influencing disease occurrence. By providing this information, epidemiology contributes significantly to the development and maintenance of healthy livestock. This is illustrated with the example of the enzootic pneumonia (EP) eradication programme of Switzerland.
   A series of observational studies were conducted in order to obtain the necessary knowledge to implement an area-wide EP eradication programme. The issues of economical eradication strategies at the herd level and the risk of re-infections were addressed. Simulation modelling and economical analysis were also applied. These research projects led to the successful start of a national eradication programme.
   The example of the EP eradication programme illustrates that applied epidemiological research provides critical information for the planning, implementation and evaluation of disease control programmes and is thus a key tool in developing sustainable animal production.

AB In recent years, the thinking of practitioners and scholars from the fields of community development and public involvement has converged in supporting local, community-bared approaches for citizen participation in making decisions about the management of public lands. Community-based approaches are supported because citizens have local knowledge, understand local conditions, can practice direct democracy, and can help develop solutions to problems of integrated and sustainable forest management. However there is little information available to evaluate the effectiveness of community-based strategies. This study evaluates how well three participatory techniques-a mail survey, focused conversations with existing community groups, and community dinners-meet three key community-oriented criteria: representativeness, working toward identification of community-wide common good, and incorporation of values and beliefs into the discussion. The evaluation conducted in this study indicates that the techniques produce positive results for two of these criteria, but may not be representative of the communities as a whole.

AB This article examines recent institutional approaches that address questions of access to forest resources and issues of redistributive justice for indigenous peoples in Australia and India. For over two decades, both countries have seen the emergence of claims to forest access and ownership made by indigenous communities that have been historically disadvantaged and marginalized from the benefits of mainstream social and economic development. The analysis focuses on regional forest agreements (RFA) in Australia and joint forest management (JFM) experiments in India through a comparative analytical framework defined by three concepts-access, control, and substantive democracy-to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of institutional processes that aim to engage in sustainable management of forest resources.

AB Information on the influence of duration of cultivation on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics is needed by researchers, policy makers and farmers for assessment of global ramifications of carbon (C) sequestration and agricultural sustainability. This paper examines the changes in microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)). microfaunal populations, and C and N mineralisation to assess the effect of cultivation on SOM dynamics. Cultivation. for up to 34 years, of soils previously under permanent ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and clover (Trifolium sp.) pastures, resulted in a 30-60% decline in concentration of soil organic C and N, and had a significant influence on soil biological parameters in two New Zealand (Eutric Gleysol, Kairanga silty clay loam and Gleyic Luvisol, Marton silt loam) soil types. Cultivated soils had consistently fewer MBC and MBN contents, and higher qCO(2) than their counterparts in permanent pastures. Changes in the soil microfauna following cultivation were consistent with changes in microbial biomass. Both the amount and proportion of mineralisable N were also reduced with cultivation. In the pasture soils C mineralisation rates (under laboratory conditions) were twice those (ca. 15 mg (CO2-C) kg(-1) soil) in the 5-20 year cultivated soils (ca, 7 mg (CO2-C) kg(-1) soil), and were reduced to one-half (ca. 3.5 mg (CO2-C) kg(-1) soil) in the 34-year cultivated soil. Over 112 days, the soils lost approximately 2.4-5.0% of their total C, and 1.4-5.0% of total N was mineralised. The percentage C loss also differed with oil type, with Marton silt loam (260 g kg(-1), clay) soil losing one and half times as much percentage C as Kairanga silty clay loam (420 g kg(-1), clay) soil. Despite greater C mineralisation in soil from pasture, more C and N were conserved in it than in the cultivated soils. As annual C inputs in cultivated soils are smaller than the C decomposition. this would result in a negative soil C balance. The shifts in microbial biomass, its metabolic quotients and soil microfauna appear to be associated with differences in the quantity and 'quality' of inputs and SOM decomposition rates, and reflect the land-use change ft om pasture to continuous cultivation.

AB In this work we develop an analytical framework to examine the effects of strategic investments on the financial policy of the firm. From the resource-based approach of the firm, nontradable and difficult-to-copy assets are the basis of a sustainable competitive advantage. However, imperfections in the resource markets can also be interpreted as sources of costs and/or restrictions from a financial point of view. Specificity and opacity are the features of strategic resources that enable us to identify the financial implications of the resource-based strategy.
   We have tested our theoretical framework using a sample of Spanish nonfinancial firms. Our results show that highly specific and opaque resources limit the borrowing capacity of the firm, while other transparent strategic assets affect financial leverage positively. Our findings suggest two main implications for strategy formulation and implementation: (1) there are unobservable financial costs that must be considered for a correct evaluation of a sustainable competitive advantage based on strategic resources; and (2) the financial policy of a 'resource-driven' firm is partially determined by the features of its strategic resource bundle.

TI Sustainability indicators: The problem of integration
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY; AFRICAN AGRICULTURE; NIGERIAN SAVANNA;
   INTENSIFICATION; LABOR
AB Sustainability indicators (SIs) are increasingly seen as important tools in the implementation of sustainable development. Numerous suggested SI lists and matrices exist, but a remaining problem is how these diverse SIs are to be integrated into an answer as to whether something is sustainable or not. In some studies of sustainability workers have adopted a quantitative integration approach whereby SIs are given numerical values and integrated mathematically to produce a value for sustainability. In this paper the authors discuss SI integration by drawing upon the results of a six-year research project based in a village in Nigeria. They conclude that an element of 'qualitative integration' incorporating value judgements and subjectivity is inevitable with a concept such as sustainability, even if one begins with what may seem like sharp and quantitative SIs. It is argued that SIs are primarily a product of development intervention rather than a desire to understand, and as a result carry with them the desired characteristics, from the donor perspective, of efficiency and accountability.

ID ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK
AB Sustainable water resource management has become a critical issue for the development of cities that suffer scarce water resources. Tianjin City, located in China's Huaihe basin, one of the most polluted and water-scarce river basins in the country, is a typical example in which water is posing a major constraint to the development. This paper examines the current status of the use of water resources, and the current practices and policy measures taken for water resource management in Tianjin, with a view to drawing lessons through an evaluation of these measures. The study illustrates the role of cities and their complex interaction with their peripheries for the allocation of scarce water resources, and it suggests that a systems approach should be adopted in order to analyse and understand the complexity of the entire picture. Based on this review and evaluation of Tianjin's experience, the authors propose a framework for sustainable water resource management in cities, emphasizing the importance of taking full consideration of resource/environmental capacity and an integrated systems approach for problem solving.

TI Municipalities and industrial ecology: Reconsidering municipal
   environmental management
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In order for society to secure a healthy environment and reach sustainability, there is a need for reconsideration of municipal environmental management (MEM). Among other things, the potential roles of a municipality in regionally oriented environmental management and development planning have to be further analysed. In this paper, MEM is confronted with the concept of industrial ecology (IE). In particular, the role of a municipality in developing regional industrial ecology, and, vice versa, the role of regional industrial ecology in developing MEM, will be reflected upon. It is argued that a municipality, serving as an institutional anchor tenant, may provide the regional IE effort with the needed institutional support. In return, regional IE seems to have the potential to provide a basis for increased co-operation between public and private actors of a region as well as integration of regional environmental and development issues.

TI Steps to Natural Capitalism
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The impact of concerns about environmental degradation has prompted many initiatives to improve the environmental efficiency of businesses, such as environmental management systems and industrial ecology as well as recycling, waste reduction and energy reduction programmes. Hawken et al. (1999) argue that these kinds of change are part of processes so profound that humankind is actually participating in another industrial revolution, a revolution to Natural Capitalism. These three authors outline basic changes to the capitalist system that necessitate different mind-sets and sets of values that ultimately lead to profound differences in the ways in which businesses are managed.
   This paper considers the possibility that we are on the verge of an industrial revolution that will implement a new form of capitalism that will facilitate an easier transition to sustainable industrial development. This paper proceeds by first identifying key approaches to the management of the environment and then identifying six steps that will have to be taken if the putative revolution is to be realized.

ID THINKING
AB Our interest lies in applying the principles of critical systems thinking to human activity systems in developing countries in situations where issues of natural resource sustainability constrain the feasible set of long-term strategies. The concept of sustainable development provides an expanded domain for critical systems thinking. The fundamental values underpinning sustainable development are that both intragenerational and intergenerational equity are important. As a consequence, key stakeholders are often excluded from power-sharing within current social systems. Addressing these issues requires renewed focus on emancipatory commitment and methodologies. To date, Ulrich's critical systems heuristics is the only critical systems methodology that offers practicable tools for emancipation. A case study analysis in Tigray, northern Ethiopia, provides insights in relation to the application of critical system heuristics to issues of sustainable development and highlights the need to extend the use of critical systems heuristics beyond the design and monitoring of structured interventions.

AB Tourism based on interactions with wildlife is increasing in popularity across the world. A conceptual framework is presented which begins to classify the major components of wildlife tourism/recreation and indicates the roles of and the relationship between these components. It is suggested that the values of conservation, animal welfare, visitor satisfaction, and profitability are often in conflict in wildlife tourism (WT) and trade-offs are necessary. While there is a range of factors involved, the most germane are impact on the environment and quality of the experience. Sustainable tourism depends on encouraging the desirable and discouraging the undesirable. Such mechanisms are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A history and market analysis of tourism in Tanzania
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Tanzania; nature-based tourism; tourism management
AB Tanzania contains some of the world's greatest natural wonders. Following major reforms in its foreign tourism policies in the mid-1980s, tourism has increased to become the nation's second leading foreign exchange earner. Tanzania is a less developed nation than its East African neighbours, and seeks to offer a low-density, high-quality, and high-priced tourism experience. Numerous deficiencies, however, are present in its tourism product. A lack of infrastructure, trained staff, and legal and regulatory framework offer severe challenges for the delivery of world-class service quality. In addition to a lack of marketing and promotion, the tourism industry has failed to diversify into areas beyond wildlife, such as culture and beach tourism. Consequently, most visitors treat Tanzania as an add-on to their Kenyan safari. Tanzania however, is moving towards developing the infrastructure necessary to occupy its market niche. With careful planning and management, Tanzania has the tremendous potential to develop a diverse and sustainable tourism industry. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Entrance capacity of an automated highway system
SO TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper evaluates the entrance capacity and queueing delay for Automated Highway Systems through use of simulations and analytical modeling. Queueing statistics are also used to determine the sustainable capacity of alternative concepts, taking trip length distribution and spacing between ramps into consideration. Based on safety-spacing head-ways (produced in a separate analysis), the most promising concept utilizes platoons both on the highway and on on-ramps. However, it is unclear whether comparable capacity can be achieved on exit, when vehicles must be decoupled from their platoons, and whether it is safe for vehicles to enter the highway in closely spaced platoons. The analytical evaluation indicates that entrance/exit spacing on the order of one per 2 km or closer would be required to support highways with total capacity on the order of 20,000 vehicles per hour. Most likely, this would be achieved most efficiently if separate dedicated entrances are provided for automated vehicles, to minimize weaving on manual lanes.

AB As part of a study to assess the infectivity of gametocytes after treatment with four antimalarial regimens, the efficacy of each treatment was also determined. From September to December 1998, 598 children with uncomplicated malaria were treated; 135 received chloroquine (CQ) alone, 276 received pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine (Fansidar(C), PSD) alone, 113 received PSD with a single dose of artesunate (PSD + 1ART) and 74 received PSD combined with three doses of artesunate (PSD + 3ART). On day 28 19/63 (30.2%; 95% C.I. 19.2% to 43.1%) of children treated with CQ alone, 5/134 (3.7%; 95% C.I. 1.2% to 8.5%) treated with PSD alone, 1/71 (1.4%, 95% C.I. 0.0% to 7.9%) treated with PSD + 1ART and 0/45 (0.0%; 95% C.I. 0.0% to 7.9%) treated with PSD + 3ART were parasitaemic. The proportion of children with gametocytes on day 7 after treatment with CQ alone was 16/89 (18.0%; 95% C.I. 10.6% to 27.6%), 98/174 (56.3%; 95% C.I. 48.6% to 63.8%) after treatment with PSD alone, 8/70 (11.4%; 95% C.I. 5.1% to 21.3%) after treatment with PSD + 1ART and 4/46 (8.7%; 95% C.I., 2.4% to 20.8%) after treatment with PSD + 3ART. CQ thus has a lower efficacy than PSD or either of the PSD and artesunate combinations. Use of PSD alone as an alternative first line treatment results in a very high post-treatment gametocyte prevalence that is likely to enhance transmission. There would be greater and more sustainable benefits from using PSD and artesunate combinations.

TI MNCs and sustainable business practice: The case of the Colombian and
   Peruvian petroleum industries
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT

DE MNCs; environmental and social policy; Latin America; Colombia and Peru;
   sustainable business practice
AB Multinational corporations (MNCs) play an increasingly important role in the economic development strategies of many less developed countries (LDCs). At the same time the sustainable development of LDCs requires economic growth to be accompanied by environmental protection and greater social equity. This paper contributes to the literature concerned with MNCs' contribution to the sustainable development of LDCs. The concept of sustainable business practice (SBP) is proposed as relevant to understanding MNCs' contribution, and an analytical framework incorporating the content, context, and process of SEP is used to examine what SEP might consist of, as well as those conditions important for its widespread adoption. Results from a study examining the Colombian and Peruvian petroleum industries show that despite important contributions by MNCs to sustainable development, SEP is not yet widespread. The study also shows the importance of external institutional pressures-principally in the form of local legislation-for MNCs' contribution to the sustainable development of LDCs. Finally the paper shows how the process of change toward more SBP is closely linked to the external context in which MNCs operate, the characteristics of their internal context, and the internal and external processes linking these contexts.

AB In this article, we analyze extended periods of growth in Africa based on panel estimations from 27 African countries during 1960-96. Our main conclusion is that sustainable growth needs to be based on a balanced mix of capital accumulation, macroeconomic adjustment and structural change. In addition to more commonly used determinants of total factor productivity (TFP), we construct a measure for the effect of labor reallocation as well as an index of economic diversification and estimate the impact of the latter on long-term growth. Further we propose a framework for the analysis of extended growth periods. in view of assessing their sustainability. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Some convergence between countries may be observed in total welfare spending during the later decades, but while levels are becoming more similar, the profiles are still very different. Some welfare states are high on transfers, others on services, and among services - some give priority to institutions, others invest more heavily in community (home) care. Discussed in this article is how different family cultures are reflected in welfare systems, and conversely - how welfare systems in turn may influence families. The article argues that home care services tend to have lower priority in countries with familistic policies, and higher priority where social policies are individualistic. What model is the more sustainable for the future, given the social and demographic changes to be expected?

AB The relationships between the distribution patterns of threatened wildlife species and current land-use planning were investigated in a city of Japan to design a sustainable and land-use plan. Spatial distributions of 165 species of threatened wildlife (99 plants and 66 animals) were obtained by surveying most of the Chiba City, located in northeastern part of the Tokyo Bay area. Distribution maps were created within 334 rectangular cells, each measuring 1.1 km x 0.9 km, oriented in the cardinal directions. Four land-use zones, i.e., urbanization promotion, parkland, agricultural and urbanization control, and agricultural promotion zones were identified.
   The distribution of these threatened species was analyzed in terms of green cover and zoning categories. Few threatened wildlife species were found in the urbanization promotion or parkland zone. Most were concentrated in the surrounding arable areas with green covers of more than 50%. Areas other than those set aside for intensive agricultural development in the agricultural promotion development zone contained the greatest number of species. These areas belonged to the agricultural and urbanization control zone, where the traditional agricultural landscape still remains in and around narrow valleys called "yatsu".
   The results suggest that the regional biodiversity depends heavily on areas in which the traditional landscape remains relatively intact. Based on these results, a series of recommendations, including conservation and restoration of habitats, establishments of wildlife networks and corridors, and citizen involvement in conservation, were presented to the city studied. The data and recommendations will hopefully help the city, as well as many other areas faced with similar issues, devise future land-use plans that combine sustainable development with conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of high quality living environments.

AB The rapid urbanization taking place in Asia since 1970 has exhibited a process different from that of the developed countries in the West. This process has contributed to the emergence of a new landscape in Asia - widely known as the desakota (a combination of two Indonesian words: "desa" for village, "kota" for town) regions described in the McGee-Ginsburg model. These desakota regions are characterized by an intense mix of agricultural and non-agricultural activities that often stretch along corridors between large city cores. Although, the McGee-Ginsburg model captures the socio-demographic dimensions of the rapid urbanization process, little is known about the dynamics of landscape structures in the emerging desakota regions in Asia. By linking remote sensing, landscape characterization indices, and cellular automata modeling with geographic information systems (GIS), this paper develops a GIS-based spatial analysis and modeling approach to study the landscape dynamics of the desakota regions in southeast China. We tested our method using data between 1992 and 1996 for the city of Longhua in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone - one of the fastest growing areas in southeast China. The results not only confirm the effectiveness of GIS-based spatial analysis and modeling approach in studying the ecological impacts of human activities, but also reveal the salient features of landscape dynamics in the desakota regions. Drawing from the results of this research, we conclude that the pace of urbanization and the size of desakota regions must be controlled in order to create a sustainable future in developing countries.

AB The historical process by which a soil conservation strategy has evolved within the UK forestry industry is briefly reviewed. Particular attention is given to the development of practical and effective guidelines to prevent both soil damage and sediment entering water courses. It is concluded that the 'Forest and Water Guidelines', together with other forest industry manuals, largely provide adequate protection for aquatic habitats from pre-afforestation cultivation and from harvesting activities. The problem of soil erosion owing to ploughing of open furrows has largely been obviated by improved drainage network design coupled with the use of vegetated buffer strips and sediment catchpits. Alternative site preparation techniques, such as 'moling' or 'dolloping' of afforestation sites, are now preferred. However, the effects on slope hydrology and the improved soil conservation associated with these methods require quantifying. Additional understanding of effective buffer strip function, for example, on a variety of slope angles, soil types and vegetation associations would be beneficial. The design of forest roads and the associated network of drains, culverts and sediment catchpits is addressed in forestry guidelines. Future potential in this area may involve the use of Geographical Information Systems in the effective design of road networks which minimise adverse effects on slope hydrology, Similarly computer simulation of flow routing might aid in the design of road drain networks. At the more local scale there remains scope for further research aimed at minimising soil disturbance by machinery. Consideration should also be given to the long-term sustainability of the soil structure through second and subsequent crop rotations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The catalytic performance and characterization of Ln(1.85)A(0.15) CuO4-delta and Ln(1.85)A(0.15)CuO(4-delta)X(sigma) (Ln = La, Nd; A = Sr, Ce; X = F, Cl) for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODE) to ethene have been investigated. The hole-doped catalysts performed better than the electron-doped ones. Under the reaction conditions of temperature, 660 degreesC; C2H6/O-2/N-2 molar ratio, 2/1/3.7; and contact time, 1.67 x 10(-4) h g mL(-1); La1.85Sr0.15CuO3.930Cl0.053 showed 82.8% C2H6 conversion, 73.2% C2H4 selectivity, and 60.6% C2H4 yield; Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO3.981F0.092 showed 72.1% C2H6 conversion, 61.8.0% C2H4 selectivity, and 44.6% C2H4 yield. The sustainable performance during a period of 60 h on-stream reaction at 660 degreesC demonstrated that the F- and Cl-doped catalysts are durable. The results of X-ray powder diffraction indicated that the Sr-substituted cuprates were of T structure whereas the Ce-doped cuprates were of T' structure. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) studies revealed that there were Cu2+ and Cu3+ in the Sr-doped cuprate catalysts and Cu+ and Cu2+ in the Ce-doped cuprate catalysts. The results of the XPS, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and O-18(2)-pulsing studies demonstrated that the incorporation of halide ions into the Ln(1.85)A(0.15)CuO(4-delta) lattice promoted the activity of lattice oxygen. By comparing the results of XPS, TGA,and Oz temperature-programmed desorption with the catalytic performance of the catalysts, we conclude that (i) lattice O2- species at the surface are active for the selective oxidation of ethane; (ii) in excessive amount, O- species accommodated in oxygen vacancies are prone to induce the total oxidation of ethane; and (iii) a suitable Cu3+ or Cu+ concentration and/or oxygen nonstoichiometry in Ln(1.85)A(0.15)CuO(4-delta)X(sigma), are required for the best catalytic performance of the catalysts.

AB The effect of diseases in ecological system is an important issue from mathematical and experimental point of view. A mathematical model for the susceptible Tilapia population, infected Tilapia population and their predator Pelican birds population is proposed and its essential mathematical features are analyzed. A threshold phenomenon. 'basic reproductive ratio R-o' of epidemic theory is defined. Local and global stability of the system around the biological feasible equilibria is presented. Conditions for persistence of the system are worked out. It is observed that if the level of the search rate of predator is low, the system around the positive interior equilibrium is stable. But the instability sets in with the increase of search rate level of predator. We conclude that for sustainability of Tilapia on Pelicans in the Salton sea, reduction of Tilapia population in a considerable amount is: required. Numerical examples and computer simulations are also presented to validate our analytical findings. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Substantial ATP supply by glycolysis is thought to reflect cellular anoxia in vertebrate muscle. An alternative hypothesis is that the lactate generated during contraction reflects sustained glycolytic ATP supply under well-oxygenated conditions. We distinguished these hypotheses by comparing intracellular glycolysis during anoxia to lactate efflux from muscle during sustained, aerobic contractions. We examined the tailshaker muscle of the rattlesnake because of its uniform cell properties, exclusive blood circulation, and ability to sustain rattling for prolonged periods. Here we show that glycolysis is independent of the O-2 level and supplies one-third of the high ATP demands of sustained tailshaking, Fatigue is avoided by rapid H+ and lactate efflux resulting from blood flow rates that are among the highest reported for vertebrate muscle. These results reject the hypothesis that glycolysis necessarily reflects cellular anoxia. Instead, they demonstrate that glycolysis can provide a high and sustainable supply of ATP along with oxidative phosphorylation without muscle fatigue.

AB Mycorrhizal associations of important tree species were investigated within the research area of the Tropenbos Cameroon Programme (TCP), situated on the western portion of the Atlantic Biafrean forest of south Cameroon. Ninety-seven tree species of economic, social, and ecological importance, and three lianas were selected in three sites that differed in altitude, soil clay content, and soil pH. In each site plots were laid out in undisturbed forest. In each plot, seedlings, saplings, juvenile, and mature trees were identified to species level and counted; girth at breast height measured and basal area calculated; root samples were taken and examined for mycorrhizal type and extent of mycorrhizal colonization.
   All 100 species investigated were mycorrhizal. Tree of 74 species formed exclusively arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM); 23 trees and three Gnetum species formed ectomycorrhizas (ECM). Five of these ECM plants also harbored AM structures. Extent of mycorrhizal root colonization showed large differences for various AM trees: however, colonization of more than half of these trees was less than 25%. Colonization of ECM trees was often higher than 75%. The contribution of ECM trees to basal area varied between 19 and 35%. ECM trees often occurred in small to large clumps. In sustainable forest management plans, existing ECM forest clumps should be given special conservation value, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Estimation of the sustainable yields of boreholes in fractured rock
   formations
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English

DE aquifers; fractured; sustainable; yield; borehole
ID GROUNDWATER
AB The simplest way to derive an estimate for the sustainable yield of a borehole is to study the behaviour of drawdowns observed during a hydraulic (also known as a pumping test) of the borehole, through an appropriate conceptual model. The choice of this model is probably the most difficult choice that the analyst of such a hydraulic test has to make, since a wrong model can only lead to the wrong conclusions and failure of the borehole.
   This paper discusses a semi-analytical and two numerical methods that can be used to simplify the analyses of hydraulic tests in fractured rock formations. The first method, called the Method of Derivative Fitting (MDF), uses a new approach to identify the conceptual model needed in such analyses. This is achieved by characterizing the various flow periods in fractured rock aquifers with numerical approximations of the first logarithmic derivative of the observed drawdown (the derivative of the drawdown with respect to the logarithm of the time). Semi-analytical expressions are used to estimate the influence that boundaries may have on the observed drawdown and the sustainable yield of a borehole - the rate at which a borehole can be pumped without lowering the water level below a prescribed limit. An effort has also been made to quantify errors in the estimates introduced by uncertainties in the parameters, such as the transmissivity and storativity, through a Gaussian error propagation analysis. These approximations and the MDF, called the Flow Characteristics Method (FCM) have been implemented in a user-friendly EXCEL notebook, and used to estimate the sustainable yield of a borehole on the Campus Test Site at the University of the Orange Free State.
   The first numerical method, a two-dimensional radial flow model, is included here because it allows the user more freedom than the FCM, although it requires more information. One particular advantage of the method is that it allows one to obtain realistic estimates of the storativity and transmissivity of Karoo aquifers in particular, which is required in the estimation of the sustainable yield of a borehole.
   There is no doubt that a three-dimensional numerical model, the second numerical method discussed here, is the best method with which to analyse a hydraulic test in a fractured aquifer. The method was consequently used to evaluate the accuracy of the implementation of the MDF in the Excel notebook and its application to the borehole on the Campus Test Site. The good agreement between the sustainable yield estimated with the three-dimensional numerical model and the FCM indicates that the FCM can be used with confidence to estimate the sustainable yields of boreholes in fractured media.

ID WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; CROP PRODUCTION; RAINFALL; VELD
AB Agricultural systems in South Africa have been developed under primarily arid and semi-arid climatic conditions where droughts are common. Adoption of agricultural practices by farmers maximizes precipitation utilization, ensure production, economic and social sustainability. Precipitation use efficiency (PUE, kg produce ha(-1) mm (-1) rainfall plus the change in soil water content of the root zone) proved to be a valuable parameter for comparing the level of precipitation utilization of different production or management practices for dryland crop production or rangeland utilization. Increasing the length of the fallow period before planting increased the amount of pre-plant stored water in the soil thereby reducing the risk of drought damage to crops that resulted also in better yields. Deep drainage occurred only on sandy soils during wet seasons and values as high as 20% of the annual precipitation were measured during years of above average precipitation. In the experiments reported soil cultivation generally increased runoff. The retention of large amounts(>6 t ha(-1)) crop residue on the soil surface is required to decrease runoff from cultivated fields. Between 50 and 75% of the annual precipitation is lost through evaporation from the soil surface thus resulting in relatively low PUE-values. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sleep disturbance and obesity - Changes following surgically induced
   weigh loss
SO ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE

ID DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; MORBID-OBESITY; APNEA SYNDROME; GASTROESOPHAGEAL
   REFLUX; SEVERITY; PRESSURE; ASTHMA; SCALE
AB Background: Obesity causes sleep disturbance and is the most significant risk factor for sleep apnea. Only surgical methods provide substantial sustained weight loss for most severely obese subjects.
   Objective: To study sleep disturbance in patients undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with a commercially available product (Lap-Band).
   Methods: In this study, 313 consecutive patients with severe obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters] >35) completed a preoperative sleep questionnaire and clinical assessment. One hundred twenty-three patients completed the same assessment 12 months after surgery. The characteristics of sleep disturbance and changes in responses to weight loss have been assessed.
   Results: There was a high prevalence of significantly disturbed sleep in men (59%) and women (45%), with women less likely to have had their sleep disturbance investigated. Observed sleep apnea was more common in men, but daytime sleepiness was not affected by sex. Waist circumference was the best clinical measure predicting observed sleep apnea (R=0.36; P<.001). The group lost an average of 48% (SD, 16%) of excess weight by 12 months. There was a significant improvement in the responses to all questions at follow-up, with habitual snoring reduced to 14% (preoperative value, 82%), observed sleep apnea to 2% (preoperative value, 33%), abnormal daytime sleepiness to 4% (preoperative value, 39%), and poor sleep quality to 2% (preoperative value, 39%) (P<.001 for all).
   Conclusions: Obesity-related sleep disorders improve markedly with weight loss. Sustainable weight loss should be a primary aim in the management of severely obese patients with significant sleep disturbance, including sleep apnea. Low-risk laparoscopic obesity surgery should be considered for selected patients with this important comorbidity.

AB Important change is sweeping across villages, towns, and cities worldwide. It is taking place in rural hamlets, middle burgs, and huge metropolises. While some people are just going from foot to mechanical transport for the first time in their civilization's history, others are learning to return to their feet and to build with proper scale and proportion. We will focus on the early steps of returning towns and people to sensible, smart growth and sustainable people-focused transportation and land use practices. I will reflect on what is occurring in both urban and suburban places.

AB The distribution pattern and productivity of Maowusu sandland terrestrial ecosystem are greatly affected with the future severe global change, especially global precipitation change. Considering the predicative global precipitation change and the appropriate relevant strategy for the sustainable development of the China dry territory, the authors have investigated the response of water balance to global precipitation change by creating an artificial control of four levels of water supply treating 3 dominant plants in Mauwusu sandland. The results showed that the seasonal changes of water storage and moisture of different sandland layer depths were affected by different water supply treatments and different plants. The water storage of the three plant growing sandlands and the moisture of different sandland layer depths increased as water supply was increased. The moisture of different water supply treatments and plants increased with the increase of sandland layer depth. The water storage and moisture of the same layer depth of Hedysarum mongolicum Turcz. growing sandland were larger than that of Salix psammophila C. Wang et Ch. Y. Yang growing sandland, which were in turn higher than that of Artemisia ordosica Krasch. growing sandland in the same water supply treatment. Water supply significantly affected the seasonal changes of evaporation and transpiration of the three plant growing sandlands. With the increased levels of water supply, viz. 157.5 mm, 315.0 mm, 472.5 mm and 630.0 mm, the total evaporation was 123.66 mm, 258.68 mm, 376.30 mm, 458.57 mm, respectively, and the total transpiration of A. ordosica was 50.80 mm, 68.93 mm, 108.39 mm, 163.36 mm, respectively, and that of S. psammophila, 47.37 mm, 68.17 mm, 93.65 mm, 135.97 mm, respectively, and that of H. mongolicum 46.73 mm, 67.37 mm, 86.07 mm, 109.64 mm, respectively. Evaporation was significantly higher than transpiration in the experiment.

DE organic farming; animal health; animal welfare; food safety; diseases
AB Organic farming (or ecological agriculture) is of growing importance in the agricultural sector worldwide. In the Nordic countries, 1-10% of the arable land was in organic production in 1999. Organic farming can be seen as an approach to agriculture where the aim is to create integrated, humane, environmentally and economically sustainable agricultural production systems. Principles like nutrient recycling, prevention rather than treatment and the precautionary principle are included in aims and standards. Animal welfare is another hallmark of organic livestock production but despite this, several studies have indicated severe health problems e.g. in organic poultry production in Denmark. Also the quality of animal food products in relation to human health, particularly the risk of zoonotic infections, has been debated. For these reasons there is a need for improvement of production methods and animal health status. Vets play an important role in this development through work in clinical practice and in research. On-farm consultancy should be tailored to the individual farmers needs, and the practitioner should be willing to take up new ideas and when needed, to enter a critical dialogue in relation to animal welfare. Better base line data on animal health and food safety in organic food systems are needed.

AB In the wake of sustainable development, measurable indicators are needed to monitor land resources management. Aerial photograph interpretation, participatory research methods and logistic modelling were combined to establish indicators and to investigate their relationship with local land management systems. Land tenure and customary laws explained the differences in field characteristics at Ikem (southeastern Nigeria). A binary followed by an ordinal logistic model quantified the relationship between field characteristics and local land management. The odds for private land management increased with 102% per 100 m(2) decrease in field size and with 128% per unit increase in palm tree density. For communal land management, fallow periods were longer with increasing non-palm tree densities and field sizes; odds increased with 76 and 31%, respectively. Field size, total tree density and palm tree density are important indicators to monitor local land management. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainability is defined as the ability of a system to 'continue'. In view of this definition, several aspects of the crop protection activity in organic farming are reviewed according to their ability to 'continue'. As no absolute measure of sustainability is available, this analysis takes the form of a comparison between organic and conventional crop protection methods. Two elements of crop protection are considered: one being the source of the inputs to crop protection and the other being the environmental hazard of the chemicals used in crop protection. In addition, the sustainability of some of the wider issues related to crop protection methods in organic farming are discussed. It is concluded that organic farming systems are not sustainable in the strictest sense. Considerable amounts of energy are input to organic farming systems, the majority of the compounds utilised in crop protection are derived from non-renewable sources and incur processing and transport costs prior to application. Further, these compounds are not without toxicological hazards to ecology or humans. Despite these problems, it is concluded that organic farming is probably more sustainable than conventional farming in a bio-physical sense. However, an assessment of the overall sustainability of farming systems may depend upon the valuation given by society to their inputs and outputs, and in this sense it is extremely difficult to assess which farming system is most sustainable.

AB Steadily rising prices for timber on Mindanao in the Philippines have given an incentive to farmers to devote some of their land to fast-growing tree species. The costs and benefits of intercropping young timber trees with food crops was studied in a 1000 stem ha(-1) stand of Paraserianthes falcataria. At 2 years of age, diameter at breast height and height of intercropped trees were 33 and 21% greater, respectively, than sole trees. Management costs of intercropped trees were less than half of sole trees. Allometric equations for Mindanao falcataria were used to project future tree growth and system returns. In the base scenario (1000 trees ha(-1), 5-year rotation), the sum of biophysical and economic benefits of intercropping trees with a maize/vegetable rotation for two years were less than the costs of reduced intercrop yield, compared to sole cropping of each component. A linear relationship of crop decline to the increase in basal area of the stand was used to predict returns to intercropping under alternative tree densities and intercropping periods. Intercropping becomes more attractive as labor becomes scarcer relative to land, the need to minimize cash inputs becomes more important to farmers, and trees increase in value relative to annual crops.

AB Ecology may benefit from long term, large scale experiments on low intensity farming to test theoretical principles and convert them into practical lessons, One century of land conversion in the Argentine pampas, and its effect on critical ecological properties, were analysed and discussed. Land transformation has resulted in significant changes of land use, land cover, energy flow, nutrient dynamics, hydrology, and the trade-offs between productivity, stability and sustainability. The analytical procedure involved the complementary utilisation of different data sources and approaches. The study was focused on large geographical scales: the entire pampas and its five ecoregions. Results were interpreted under the theoretical framework of succession in ecology. The historical conversion of natural grasslands into cultivated grasslands and croplands was not homogeneous, determining a variety of land use and land cover patterns. Due to its higher productivity, much more energy, nutrients and water were mobilised in the rolling pampas than in the other ecoregions. This study provides lessons about how the energy flow, the nutrient dynamics and the hydrological process are modified by land transformation under low external-input conditions. Technical coefficients to be applied in emerging fields of environment administration such as ecological-monitoring, environmental accounting and auditing, agro-ecological certification, land evaluation and allocation, and land management, can also be supplied by this kind of studies.

AB Practices that minimize the rate of soil degradation, increase crop yields and raise farm income are key to sustaining agricultural productivity in the hills of Nepal. The use of farmland is undergoing rapid changes in response to increasing population pressure, deforestation and subsistence needs. Against this background, this study examined the impact of an agroforestry intervention project on farm income based on a sample of subsistence farm households in Dhadhing district. The project was implemented by Nepal Agroforestry Foundation in 1993/94 to increase fodder production through the promotion of agroforestry. A total of 223 households (82 'with' project and 141 'without' project) were interviewed during May-October 1998 to collect information on production and agroforestrys' impact on farm income. The benefit-cost analysis showed that the agricultural system including agroforestry was more profitable than the conventional one. The results also showed that the introduction of mulberry trees for sericulture could further enhance the profitability of an agroforestry-based system. Thus, agroforestry has great potential for enhancing food production and farmers' economic conditions in a sustainable manner through its positive contributions to household income.

AB Multistrata agroforestry systems with tree crops comprise a variety of land use systems ranging from plantations of coffee, cacao or tea with shade trees to highly diversified homegardens and multi-storey tree gardens. Research on plant-soil interactions has concentrated on the former. Tree crop- based land use systems are more efficient in maintaining soil fertility than annual cropping systems. Certain tree crop plantations have remained productive for many decades, whereas homegardens have existed in the same place for centuries. However, cases of fertility decline under tree crops, including multistrata agroforestry systems, have also been reported, and research on the causal factors (both socioeconomic and biophysical) is needed. Plantation establishment is a critical phase, during which the tree crops require inputs but do not provide economic outputs. In larger plantations, tree crops are often established together with a leguminous cover crop, whereas in smallholder agriculture, the initial association with food crops and short-lived cash crops can have both socioeconomic and biological advantages. Fertilizers applied to, and financed by, such crops can help to `recapitalize' soil fertility and improve the development conditions of the young tree crops. Favorable effects on soil fertility and crop nutrition have been observed in associations of tree crops with N-2-fixing legume trees, especially under N-deficient conditions. Depending on site conditions, the substitution of legume `service' trees with fast-growing timber trees may lead to problems of competition for nutrients and water, which may be alleviated through appropriate planting designs. The reduction of nutrient leaching and the recycling of subsoil nutrients are ways to increase the availability of nutrients in multistrata systems, and at the same time, reduce negative environmental impacts. These processes are optimized through fuller occupation of the soil volume by roots, allowing a limited amount of competition between associated species. The analysis of temporal and spatial patterns of water and nutrient availability within a system helps to optimize the use of soil resources, e.g., by showing where more plants can be added or fertilizer rates reduced. Important research topics in multistrata agroforestry include plantation establishment, plant arrangement and management for maximum complementarity of resource use in space and time, and the optimization of soil biological processes, such as soil organic matter build-up and the stabilization and improvement of soil structure by roots, fauna and microflora.

AB The Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico has shallow soils and receives low amounts of precipitation, and has therefore low agricultural potential. Lacking large-scale irrigation from rivers and adequate rainfall, the indigenous Maya groups maintain agricultural productivity by adapting a variety of practices. Multistrata homegardens, one of their agricultural systems, have provided goods for trade, sale and personal consumption for many centuries. Nevertheless, an understanding of the controlling biological factors and interactions within these systems can lead to yield improvements. Photosynthetic rates, water use and litter production for a variety of species have been studied in these gardens to determine how Maya management impacts resource flow, productivity and diversity. When irrigated, diurnal photosynthetic rates nearly doubled for Manilkara zapota and water use increased two fold for M. zapota and Cordia dodecandra. Total litter production in traditional homegardens varied from 1,000 to 4,000 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and ten arboreal species were found to contribute more than 33% of total litterfall biomass. Nutrient concentrations in the leaves of the predominant species were analyzed; Meliococcus bijugatus and Spondias purpurea were found to contribute the largest quantities of N, P and C. Our research indicates that species and structural diversity are critical to sustainability of homegardens, allowing efficient use and transfer of carbon, nutrients and water.

AB The objective of this case study was to test the effectiveness of biocontrol for the rehabilitation of abandoned, diseased (moniliasis, witches' broom and black pod) cocoa and to develop testable hypotheses regarding the effect of shade and biocontrol timing. Three trial fields differed in their shade regimes. Biocontrol was administered starting either at flowering or pod filling. Disease incidence and yield were compared with cultural control alone. Biocontrol reduced moniliasis from 49% to 25%, independent of the shading regime and application time. Witches' broom was most severe without shade and unaffected by biocontrol. No significant effects on black pod were observed. Although biocontrol increased percentage healthy fruit independent of shading and timing, only the shaded plot with biocontrol from flowering onwards responded with increased yield. Our hypothesis is: 'In the rehabilitation of abandoned cacao, only fields under sustainable shade management and early onset of biocontrol can realise their production potential.'

AB Latin American pastures usually include trees that may be important in sustaining productivity and conserving resources and biodiversity. A participatory survey of trees in seasonally dry pastures of 54 farms in the Caribbean region of Colombia, followed by cluster and correlation analyses, revealed a multistrata configuration. Trees of large stature (e.g., Tabebuia rosea, Albizia caribaea and Sterculia apelata) provided shade and produced timber. The most important fodder trees were those of medium stature (Albizia saman, Guazuma ulmifolia, and Cassia grandis) that produced fruits or pods, while other species were managed as shrubs producing green leaf fodder (e.g., Crescentia cujete and Gliricidia sepium, which was also ubiquitous as living fence posts). Trees were present on between 26 and 69% of the pastures on each farm, at densities varying from less than 3 to more than 50 trees ha(-)1. There were more trees in drier areas, of lower fertility, with extensive grazing, where milk as well as meat was produced. Most farmers planted timber trees, encouraged regeneration of fodder trees, and knew about fodder species preferences of cattle and the effects of trees on pasture and animal productivity. Their knowledge of tree phenology was less certain and varied even amongst farmers in similar locations. There is scope to develop silvopastoral systems with woody species familiar to farmers, but it is critical to determine how important different vegetation strata are for sustainability of cattle production. An experiment has been established to achieve this, with treatments based on an analysis of how trees are presently used on farms in the region.

AB The terms multistrata systems and homegardens, which are used synonymously for the purpose of discussion in this paper, represent a group of seemingly sustainable and profitable agroforestry systems in the tropics. Although practiced for a long time, the systems have been little studied, and most reported studies are descriptive and limited to the identification of plant species involved and location-specific information on their yield and management. The conventional mass-balance approach to estimating the extent of nutrient cycling in some of these systems has raised alarms about potential danger of excessive rates of soil-nutrient depletion from the systems and their consequent unsustainability. Yet, in the field, the systems seem to defy such predictions. Furthermore, these systems that provide sustenance to millions of farm families defy the market-superiority paradigm of neoclassical economics. These contradictions arise, perhaps, from our failure to understand the systems in their right perspectives. The methods and criteria that are used for assessing the productivity and profitability of market- oriented, single-species, agricultural and forestry enterprises may not be appropriate for understanding the ecological and economic 'mysteries' of the time-tested multispecies systems. These systems can contribute greatly to our efforts to develop sustainable agroforestry systems; but new initiatives are needed for accomplishing such a goal. The efforts should start with the collection of basic statistics on the area and number of people involved, and proceed by developing appropriate methodologies, in much the same way as agroforestry research was initiated more than two decades ago.

AB Frequent burning and grazing and cultivation of cash crops increasingly threaten forest patches in hilly grassland in Northeast Luzon, yet their importance as a resource with multiple environmental functions and forest products persists. The aim of this study is to identify different types of forest patches, and their condition under present land-use intensification, and discuss prospects for their integration into sustainable local farming systems. Five types of forest patches are distinguished, both natural and planted ones, including rows of trees, woody patches, gallery forests, hill-slope forests and homegarden conglomerations. Natural woody patches and gallery forests in Imperata grassland are subject to degradation and land-use conversion under conditions of agricultural intensification. Woody patches in grassland affected by frequent burning and grazing cover small areas (66% below 50 m(2) as opposed to 28% in protected grassland) and contain relatively few woody plant species (25 woody species in total as opposed to 82 where protected). Yet where well managed, they may provide a variety of products for sale and subsistence, covering emergency needs and giving off-season cash income to rural communities. Moreover they serve like the gallery forest various ecological functions, carrying valuable indigenous tree species, retaining soil base nutrients, providing a continuous supply of organic matter and intercepting fine earth soil particles removed from bare surfaces. It is suggested that forest- patch management systems may be developed, taking into account both patch diversity and the diverse needs of rural communities, and to strengthen existing and undervalued functions of forest patches as permanent elements in an agricultural landscape.

AB The cultural features, management practice, environmental sustainability, and economic profitability of smallholder cacao (Theobroma cacao) production in West and Central Africa are reviewed. The aim is to highlight factors affecting the cacao production and marketing sector and to propose appropriate strategies to ensure sustainable and profitable cacao production in the region. The cacao cultivation system causes minimum damage to soil resources. In terms of carbon sequestration and below- and above-ground bio-diversity, the cacao agroforest is superior to the alternative food crop production land use. The food crop production system is based on the practice of slash-and-burn farming, which, due to population pressure and reduced fallow cycle, is no longer sustainable. Economic profitability analysis of this system in Cameroon showed that, at current prices, even with no value assigned to the tree species, the sector could still be profitable. Based on the current review and our knowledge of West and Central Africa, there is an urgent need to: (a) rationalize and optimize arrangement of the various components in cacao agroforest, (b) domesticate high value and shade tolerant indigenous species such as Gnetum africanum and integrate into the system in order to enhance the system's diversity and profitability, (c) develop shade-tolerant and disease-resistant cacao varieties, (d) integrate small-stock production into the system, and (e) develop an enabling policy environment addressing cacao marketing, plant protection, land tenure and transformation of non-cacao primary products from the cacao agroforests.

AB The first humans entered South America during the Late Pleistocene, when the lowland tropics were less densely forested than now and sea level was lower. During subsequent millennia, they learned to accommodate to changing conditions and developed an exhaustive knowledge of the biota and their interactions that permitted them to maintain sustainable levels of long-term exploitation of the varying local resources. This attitude of accommodation contrasts with the predatory behavior of recent immigrants of European origin, which threatens not only the future of Amazonia, but of the planet as a whole.

TI International sister-cities - Bridging the global-local divide
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID WORLD
AB With the demise of the sharp urban-rural divide as a framework for urban analyses, debates have arisen regarding the utility of the city as a theoretically significant construct. Recently however, the growing emphasis on globalization has brought the analysis of global cities into sharp focus. The countervailing trend emphasizes the significance of "the local." International sister-cities provide a site of analysis which illustrates the global-local interface and yet delves deeper. Initially conceived as a post-war means of developing friendships and cultural ties, sister-cities were based on similarities such as name or economic function. More recently, greater recognition has been given to the economic foundations and benefits of these connections. Providing an extension to an integrated approach to the study of sister-cities based on the multifold relationship between culture and commerce, this paper adds a further dimension by focusing on simultaneously operating multi-level entrepreneurial partnerships necessary to sustain active sister-city relationships. Drawing on New Zealand examples of twinning arrangements, it is demonstrated that the emergence and development of embedded partnership ties is vital to deriving sustainable economic and social benefits. While the global outreach of the sister-cities phenomenon appears to transcend the geographic confines of cities, strong locality considerations and local activism nevertheless predominate. A nov el feature of this paper is the conceptualization of a hybrid form of entrepreneurialism, "municipal-community entrepreneurship," which is argued as a valuable facilitator of the economic and social vibrancy of cities.

AB Global debates surrounding the management of natural resources in protected areas advocate greater involvement of local populations in order to maintain sustainable resource use and conserve biological diversity. For this involvement to be effective, and for development to be truly participatory, a deeper understanding of people's relationships with the environment is needed. This paper explores the society-environment interactions of people in a newly established Wildlife Management Area in western Botswana, illustrating the complexity and diversity of resource use and livelihoods that must be addressed by development interventions.

AB Land use in long-settled areas outside zones especially affected by climatic change and not much or long subject to rapid economic development can be shown to reflect sustainable practice. The research reported here used terrain characteristics of such areas lover five landuse types) to establish a benchmark framework for assessing land-use suitability. The paper shows that such a framework can be used to assess the degree of sustainability of land-use changes, the latter being identified by analysis of Lime-lapse (1996-9) Landsat Thematic Mapper data. The assessment framework comprises a hybrid physically/statistically based model, suitable for deployment in sustainability assessment requiring comparatively fine spatial resolution.

AB Distributed cluster environments are becoming popular platforms for high performance computing in lieu of single-vendor supercomputers. However, the reliability and sustainable performance of a cluster are difficult to ensure since the amount of available distributed resources may vary during the application execution. To increase robustness, an application needs to have self-adaptive features that are invoked at the runtime. For a class of computationally-intensive distributed scientific applications, iterative linear system solutions, we show a benefit of the adaptations that change the amount of local computations based on the runtime performance information. A few strategies for efficient exchange of such information are discussed and tested on two cluster architectures.

AB We compared the composition and structure of the communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi associated with maize (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in a conventional (CON) and two low-input (LI) farming systems to better understand the relationship among AM fungi present in different agricultural systems. One LE system utilized animal manure (LI-AM) and the other green manure (LI-GM) as the nitrogen source. Spores were extracted from rhizosphere soil samples by wet-sieving to perform microscopic identification of the species and to assess frequency of occurrence. These data were used to calculate species richness, Shannon and Wiener index of diversity, and indices of dominance among other ecological measures. The results indicated that 15 consecutive years of farming under the three management practices did not cause many differences among the fungal communities. The majority of the 15 fungal species found throughout the site were present in all treatments. Sporulation of particular fungal species differed among farming systems and/or among hosts, but the general structure of AM fungal communities (according to most ecological measures) was similar for all treatments. Trap cultures were set up for the different treatments and grown for three cycles to try to recover species with low or no sporulation in natural conditions. These results also supported our conclusion about the homogeneity of the communities in the different farming system/plant host combinations, because only one species (Glomus constrictum) that was not found in the field samples sporulated in trap culture pots. Given that differences in sporulation may reflect differential rates of growth, three undescribed species plus Glomus mosseae and Glomus etunicatum were better established, both in the held and in trap cultures, than the other 10 species present in these soils. Also, Gigaspora gigantea accounted for more than 60% of the total volume of spores produced in each treatment, with the exception of conventional plots planted with maize where spore biovolumes were spread much more evenly among several fungal species suggesting that carbon allocation relationships were much more balanced in these plots. The focus of future studies at these sites will be a comparison of the efficacy among the communities in terms of enhancement of plant growth. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We sampled corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotations, corn monocultures, and plant successional experiments in Southwest MI over a 2-year period to study the effects of alternative management practices on microbial biomass and particulate organic matter (POM) C and N in the top 20 or 25 cm of soil. Microbial biomass was measured using the chloroform fumigation, incubation method. POM was defined as the organic C and N content of primary soil particles in the 53-2000 mum size class. Microbial C decreased during a drought in 1994, and was greater in treatments receiving compost rather than inorganic fertilizer in 1995, but was only weakly correlated with N mineralization in aerobic laboratory incubations. Microbial biomass accounted for an average of 2.6% of soil C and 4.9% of soil N in all treatments sampled in 1995. Microbial C:N ratio was lower in July and November (6.0) than in April and September (7.3), and lower in successional treatments without tillage (5.2) than in agronomic treatments (6.7). Changes in microbial N were large enough to affect short term N availability, but tended to be transitory. POM increased after compost additions, and was greater in successional plots without tillage than in tilled treatments, but did not increase immediately after the incorporation of plant residues. POM accounted for 19.7% of C and 14.8% of N in 1995. Its C:N ratio was 20.8 in a never tilled successional treatment and 16.0 in all other soils. The C:N ratio was 17.0 on average in the 250-2000 mum size fraction, compared to 15.5 in the 53-250 mum fraction. There was a strong correlation between POM and N mineralization in 70- and 150-day aerobic incubations, but there was greater N mineralization per unit POM in April and November than in September or October in both years of the study. These results suggest that POM could be used to estimate N mineralization if combined with information about recently deposited plant residues. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

ID STOCK ASSESSMENT; MODEL
AB Even when fishing effort data are not available in a developing fishery, it is often still possible to develop a simple fishery indicator to obtain information about the status of the stock. Using catch data only, Grainger and Garcia, (FAO Fish. Tech. Pap. 359, 1996) showed that the changes over time in the relative rate of catch increase (RRCI) can be used to detect when a stock reaches its over-fishing level, i.e., the year when RRCI falls to zero. The method presupposes that fishing effort increased steadily over the period concerned. We propose a generalization of this method that consists in obtaining a crude estimate of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by plotting the trend in catches against the smoothed RRCI. The yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) fishery in the Eastern Atlantic was used to show the strong relationship between MSY estimates obtained from standard equilibrium production models and from this method. Given that it is very difficult to estimate effective fishing effort for skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), we show how this simple fishery indicator can be used to obtain proxies of MSY for skipjack fisheries located in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and in the Indian Ocean.

AB Wildlife conservationists and managers must address a wide range of issues relating to bird populations including sustainable management of the wider countryside, the protection of individual sites and site networks and proper ly planned species recovery. Sound approaches to these problems need to be based on a good understanding of the population processes involved. Much of the research that provides such understanding is based on ringing, which is used to measure many aspects of avian demography, particularly survival rates, recruitment and dispersal. Ringing studies have allowed the demographic causes of population declines to be identified, providing indications and tests of their environmental causes. Spatial population modelling, supported by good empirical data on dispersal, has the potential to contribute to both species and landscape conservation. The success of rehabilitation and reintroduction programmes can often be evaluated from studies of marked birds. Descriptions of patterns of movements form an essential part of the information required to manage flyway populations and site networks. Ringing is also a key component of research into the effects of hunting because it can be used to measure both harvest and survival rates. The control of gull populations illustrates the application of population dynamics principles to reduce population size. The contribution of ringing to conservation science during the 21(st) century can be enhanced by using information technology to improve the use of existing information and data, by undertaking more long-term monitoring and through giving careful attention to the design of research projects.

AB In this paper, the possible reasons for the prevalence of hypertension in the Asia-Pacific region are examined, along with its likely dietary, nutritional and sociocultural causes. This brief survey indicates the need for more comprehensive blood pressure monitoring and surveillance throughout the region. Findings from research conducted in the region and elsewhere suggest that a variety of aetiological factors predict the occurrence of hypertension, most of which are similar to those observed in western populations. However, several lines of research suggest that obesity, abdominal obesity and a number of dietary constituents, in addition to salt, may play relatively greater roles than in western populations. It is argued that hypertension may be prevented via a combination of individual, community and governmental approaches which promote social capital, environmentally sustainable food production and the public health.

AB The achievement of nutrition security at the household level involves adequacy of food supply at the national level and equitable distribution of food among the population in accordance with their physiological needs. The emergence of globalization and market liberalization and the increasing power of some transnational corporations that are advocating pharmaceutical shortcuts have raised concerns in many developing countries. In order to achieve adequacy of food production, earlier mistakes (such as a reliance on unsustainable new technologies) need to be corrected and the resultant imbalances with respect to food production need to be reversed. Emerging new technologies, including genetic modifications, need to be effectively harnessed and adapted with due consideration to safety and sustainability. There is a need to collect convincing evidence of the efficacy and safety of genetically modified foods before they can gain general public acceptance. Information technology will play an important role in future programmes of food production and developing countries must strive to achieve access to this technology There is considerable scope and need for the expansion of agro-based industries in villages and townships. This could create job opportunities and could also lead to better production and more effective utilization of local food resources by the community and reduce the present considerable loss of perishable food items. Household nutrition security means more than avoidance of chronic starvation. Policy makers of developing countries should set, as their target in the next century, the achievement of adequate nutrition rather than mere survival.

AB The Atmospheric Nitrogen Compounds II: Emissions, Transport, Transformation, Deposition and Assessment workshop was held in Chapel Hill, NC from 7 to 9 June 1999. This international conference, which served as a follow-up to the workshop held in March 1997, was sponsored by: North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources; North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, North Carolina Office of the State Health Director; Mid-Atlantic Regional Air Management Association; North Carolina Water Resources Research Institute; Air and Waste Management Association, RTP Chapter; the US Environmental Protection Agency and the North Carolina State University (College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, and North Carolina Agricultural Research Service). The workshop was structured as an open forum at which scientists, policy makers, industry representatives and others could freely share current knowledge and ideas, and included international perspectives. The workshop commenced with international perspectives from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Denmark. This article summarizes the findings of the workshop and articulates future research needs and ways to address nitrogen/ammonia from intensively managed animal agriculture. The need for developing sustainable solutions for managing the animal waste problem is vital for shaping the future of North Carolina. As part of that process, all aspects of environmental issues (air, water, soil) must be addressed as part of a comprehensive and long-term strategy. There is an urgent need for North Carolina policy makers to create a new, independent organization that will build consensus and mobilize resources to find technologically and economically feasible solutions to this aspect of the animal waste problem.

AB Species of Phytophthora cause serious soilborne diseases of important crop plants and threaten natural ecosystems on a vast scale. Successful infection is usually initiated by motile, biflagellate zoospores that are chemotactically attracted to nearby roots. The zoospores home in at sites on the root surface that are favourable for subsequent penetration. There they encyst, secreting adhesive that glues them to the root surface. The germ tube that emerges from the cysts penetrates the root epidermis, usually growing intercellularly along the anticlinal cell walls. Intracellular growth also occurs and haustoria can develop in cortical cells. Within 2-3 days, the pathogen sporulates with the production of chlamydospores in cortical cells and multinucleate sporangia on the root surface. The sporangia undergo cytokinesis and release motile zoospores into the soil.
   A number of features of the infection cycle contribute to the rapid dissemination of infective propagules and successful disease establishment by Phytophthora pathogens. While basic aspects of the infection cycle were described 30-40 years ago, in the last decade immunocytochemical studies have helped uncover new details of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in processes such as zoospore osmoregulation, motility and adhesion, and asexual sporulation. The increase in our understanding of Phytophthora pathogenesis that has resulted has already pointed to potential targets for novel inhibitors of Phytophthora diseases. Further investigations of the cell and molecular biology of Phytophthora pathogenicity promise to be an integral part of our development of highly specific and sustainable control measures in the future.

AB Over the last 10 years, considerable progress has been made in defining and assessing soil health and soil quality. However, problems still exist in the interpretation of soil quality indicators due to the complexity and interrelatedness of soil processes. Additionally, the crop production system selected by growers affects the potential for the adoption of practices promoting soil health. Factors influencing the selection of the crop production system include the marketing strategy adopted by the grower, the commodity value, the cultural practices and inputs used to grow the crop (e.g. fertilisers, pesticides, etc.). To date, growers have had little time to consider the impact of soil health on crop production. Plant pathology, however, and related disciplines have made major contributions to the understanding of soil health, particularly in the area of the identification and verification of disease-suppressive soils and the agents responsible for this suppression. The linkage of plant health to the functional diversity of biological communities in the soil has been far more elusive, but is rapidly becoming more important as consumers and markets push for environmental sustainability. To further progress our understanding of soil health and facilitate its application to production agriculture, plant pathologists should identify and focus on crop production systems that are amenable to showing a return on investment in soil health.

AB High rates of deep drainage (water loss below the root-zone) in Western Australia are contributing to groundwater recharge and secondary salinity. However, quantifying potential drainage through measurements is hampered by the high degree of complexity of these systems as a result of diverse soil types, a range of crops, different rainfall regions, and in particular the inherent season-to-season variability. Simulation models can provide the appropriate means to extrapolate across time and space. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to analyse deep drainage under wheat crops in the Mediterranean climate of the central Western Australian wheatbelt. In addition to rigorous model testing elsewhere, comparisons between simulated and observed soil water loss, evapotranspiration, and deep drainage for different soil types and seasons confirmed the reasonable performance of the APSIM model.
   The APSIM model was run with historical weather records (70-90 years) across 2 transects from the coast (high rainfall zone) to the eastern edge of the wheatbelt (low rainfall zone). Soils were classified as 5 major types: deep sand, deep loamy sand, acid loamy sand, shallow duplex (waterlogging), and clay soil (non-waterlogging). Simulations were carried out on these soil types with historical weather records, assuming current crop management and cultivars. Soil water profiles were reset each year to the lower limit of plant-available water, assuming maximum water use in the previous crop. Results stressed the high degree of seasonal variability of deep drainage ranging from 0 to 386 mm at Moora in the high rainfall region (461 mm/year average rainfall), from 0 to 296 mm at Wongan Hills in the medium rainfall region (386 mm/year average rainfall), and from 0 to 234 mm at Merredin in the low rainfall region (310 mm/year average rainfall). The largest amounts of drainage occurred in soils with lowest extractable water-holding capacities. Estimates of annual drainage varied with soil type and location. For example, average (s.d.) annual drainage at Moora, Wongan Hills, and Merredin was 134 (73), 90 (61), and 36 (43) mm on a sand, and 57 (64), 26 (43), and 4 (18) mm on a clay soil, respectively. These values are an order of magnitude higher than drainage reported elsewhere under native vegetation. When not resetting the soil each year, carry-over of water left behind in the soil reduced the water storage capacity in the subsequent year, increasing long-term average deep drainage, depending on soil type and rainfall region. The analyses revealed the extent of the excess water problem that currently threatens the sustainability of the wheat-based farming systems in Western Australia.

AB High rates of deep drainage in Western Australia are contributing to groundwater recharge and secondary salinity. Strategies are being sought to increase water use in cropping systems and to reduce deep drainage. Quantifying potential drainage through measurements is hampered by the high degree of complexity of these systems as a result of diverse soil types, a range of crops, and in particular the inherent seasonal variability. Simulation models can provide the appropriate means to extrapolate across time and space. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) was used to explore the effect of alternative agronomic practices on wheat production and deep drainage for representative soils and rainfall regions of the central wheatbelt of Western Australia. Soil water profiles were reset each year to the lower limit of plant-available water, assuming maximum water use in the previous crop. The long-term simulation studies showed that management practices with N fertiliser directed at yield increase were most effective in achieving these aims in the medium to high rainfall regions. The corresponding effect for drainage reduction was marginal. The small effect on drainage control associated with production increase can be traced to the effect of rainfall distribution with major occurrences of both rainfall and drainage during winter (June-August) coinciding with the lowest potential atmospheric demand for evapotranspiration, in combination with low water-holding capacity soils. Nitrogen-induced increases in crop transpiration were in conjunction with reduced soil evaporation, which increased water use efficiency and occurred mostly after the main drainage period, but had little effect on deep drainage within the season. Similar outcomes of enhanced productivity with minor impact on deep drainage were noted with crops sown at different times and with a hypothetical wheat crop having a deeper rooting system.
   Simulations without resetting soil water each year enabled the quantification of potential carryover effects on long-term average deep drainage. The carry-over of soil water left behind at crop harvest reduced the water storage capacity of the soil in a subsequent year and could increase long-term deep drainage substantially, depending on soil type. Improved management increased late water use in the high rainfall region, in particular on better water-holding soils, and could largely reduce this carry-over effect.
   The current wheat-based cropping systems, even with alternative management practices, continue to be a major threat to sustainability on the low water-holding soils in the wheatbelt of Western Australia, as a main cause of secondary salinity.

AB Pastures on 126 properties on the central, southern, and Monaro tablelands were surveyed to determine their botanical composition. Data on climate, soils, pasture sowing, fertiliser history, and stock management were collected to relate current composition to environmental factors and previous management. Native grass-based pastures were found to be widespread, and in many cases, pastures were dominated by native grasses, despite many decades of pasture improvement. Seventeen genera of native perennial grasses comprising over 35 species were identified. The most common species on the central tablelands were Austrodanthonia spp., Bothriochloa macra, and Microlaena stipoides; on the southern tablelands, Austrodanthonia spp. and M. stipoides; and on the Monaro, Poa spp., Austrodanthonia spp., Themeda australis, and Austrostipa spp. Soil type was the most important factor affecting species distribution, and other soil attributes such as texture, pH, P, and N were also important. Environmental (rainfall) and management (superphosphate application, stock type, stocking rate) factors also influenced distribution. The significant areas of native grass pastures that were found suggest a decline in sown species and a recolonisation of sown pastures with native grasses. The potential for manipulation of botanical composition of these grasslands is discussed, together with their value for production and sustainability.

TI Regeneration of Wet Forest flora a decade after clear-felling or

AB There is increasing recognition of the importance of ecologically sustainable forest management, including forest biodiversity conservation. Knowledge of the effects of forest practices on flora values can be gained by comparing the floristics of natural and harvested forest stands at the same stage of development. This paper presents the results from a comparative study of natural and managed forest regeneration in Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell dominated forests in the Victorian Central Highlands. The vascular floristics about a decade after clear-fell harvesting operations differed significantly from the floristics of similarly aged forest regenerating after wildfire. In clear-felled areas, weed and sedge species occurred more frequently than on wildfire sites and Acacia dealbata Link was much more abundant, whereas resprouting shrubs, tree ferns and most ground-fern species were more abundant in wildfire regeneration. The low survival rate of resprouting species reported in an increasing number of studies suggests that soil disturbance is likely to be a major contributor to differences.
   The floristics of sites burned by intense wildfire differed significantly from those subjected to less intense wildfire, indicating that considerable variation in floristics can occur under a natural disturbance regime. The failure of the clear-fell regeneration to fit within this broad natural variability suggests that clear-fell harvesting alters the natural regeneration processes. As species composition in these forests is largely determined by the initial floristic composition after disturbance, this paper provides evidence that some clear-felled regrowth forests may remain different in structure and composition to forests regenerating after natural disturbances.

AB A no-tillage, direct-sown, unfertilised, wheat-rice relaying cropping system has major advantages over a conventional transplanted-rice system. For example, when rice is sown simultaneously with the wheal harvest, there are savings in labor and costs as a result of eliminating the tillage required to prepare the seedbed and for transplanting. A field experiment was conducted between 1996 and 1998 at Hadong, Korea. The experiment compared the soil microbial-N status, the soil physical and chemical characteristics, and rice growth and yield in a long-term conventional rice system with those in a no-tillage, unfertilised direct-sown, wheat-rice, relay cropping system. The wheat-rice system was imposed for 2, 4 and 7 years to identify the time course of responses in the soil and crop. Agricultural chemicals including fertilisers were not applied in the wheat-rice cropping system. Rice crop yields after 2, 4 and 7 years of a direct-sown, wheat-rice cropping system were similar to those in the conventional rice system. Rice yields were high, ranging from 4.7 to 6.9 t/ha. Since 110 kg Nka was applied to the conventional I-ice system, a large amount of N was mineralised during the wheat-rice system. The pattern of rice growth and yield formation, however, differed between the 2 systems. Rice in the wheat-rice system generally had more panicles, fewer spikelets per panicle and heavier grains. These responses reflected temporal changes in the N content and greenness of the rice leaf and were related to soluble N levels in the soil. Generally the soil was fertile with a high initial organic matter content. Organic matter increased by 30% during the 7 years of wheat-rice cropping. Other soil physical measures, bulk density and permeability to air and water, indicated that soil structure improved in response to wheat-rice cropping. Problems of pathogens and perennial weeds associated with new cultural practices in the wheat-rice cropping were minor; however, a higher rate of seeding was necessary to achieve satisfactory seedling establishment. Benefits to weed control and soil moisture conditions during crop establishment were derived from the increased level of crop mulch. The wheat-rice cropping system was found to be high yielding and sustainable over the 7-year period of experimentation.

AB Direct sowing of rice into drained soil is a relatively new farming practice, replacing transplanting, being developed for use in External Low Input Sustainable Agriculture in Korea. Field experiments were conducted to investigate the importance of tillage, sowing rate, and top-dressing of fertiliser nitrogen (N) to rice growth and grain yield in a direct-sown, rice-vetch cropping system.
   From 1993 to 1997, Chinese milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L. Vetch) was grown during the winter season (October-May) at Uiryong, Korea. Until 1995 transplanted rice (Oryza sativa L.) was grown during the summer season, but in 1996 and 1997 the direct-sowing method was used. In 1996, the treatments applied to rice were either tillage or no-tillage of the paddy before the rice crop was sown, combined with 2 rates (0 or 2 g/m(2)) of fertiliser N top-dressed onto the paddy just after the panicle initiation stage. In 1997, the treatments were either tillage or no-tillage of the paddy before the rice crop, combined with 2 rice sowing rates (400 or 800 seeds/m(2)), and 3 rates (0, 2 or 4 g/m(2)) of fertiliser N top-dressed just after the panicle initiation stage.
   Rice yielded 243-435 g/m(2) in 1996 and 493-678 g/m(2) in 1997, the lower yield in 1996 was attributed to fewer established seedlings and productive panicles. There was no effect of tillage treatment. Across years, yield was correlated with shoot N content, and grain N-use efficiency exceeded 50 g grain/g shoot N content. Rice residues contained about 5 g N/m(2) and vetch residues released 6-8 g N/m(2) during the 4 weeks after submergence, therefore the release of N from residues was potentially sufficient to supply the rice crop demand. In both years, however, the yield of unfertilised rice was N limited so increasing the shoot N content appeared to be the most important issue to be resolved in sustaining yield in External Low Input Sustainable Agriculture. A low rate of top-dressed fertiliser N (2-4 g N/m(2)) increased yield by increasing the number of panicles and spikelets, and to a lesser extent, 1 000-grain weight. Growing rice using no-tillage practices did not limit the yield of rice, except in 1996 when no fertiliser N was applied and the N uptake by rice was low. A high sowing rate combined with top-dressed fertiliser N in 1997 reduced yield through crop lodging and an increase in the number of unproductive tillers. This problem may be overcome by the use of a variety less susceptible to lodging.

AB The removal of nitrogen (N) in grain cereal and canola crops in Australia exceeds 0.3 million t N/year and is increasing with improvements in average crop yields. Although N fertiliser applications to cereals are also rising, N-2-fixing legumes still play a pivotal role through inputs of biologically fixed N in crop and pasture systems. This review collates Australian data on the effects of grain legume N-2 fixation, the net N balance of legume cropping, summarises trends in the soil N balance in grain legume-cereal rotations, and evaluates the direct contribution of grain legume stubble and root N to wheat production in southern Australia.
   The net effect of grain legume N-2 fixation on the soil N balance, i.e. the difference between fixed N and N harvested in legume grain (Nadd) ranges widely, viz. lupin -29-247 kg N/ha (mean 80), pea -46-181 kg N/ha (mean 40), chickpea -67-102 kg N/ha (mean 6), and faba bean 8-271 kg N/ha (mean 113). Nadd is found to be related to the amount (Nfix) and proportion (Pfix) of crop N derived from N-2 fixation, but not to legume grain yield (GY). When Nfix exceeded 30 (lupin), 39 (pea) and 49 (chickpea) kg N/ha the N balance was frequently positive, averaging 0.60 kg N/kg of N fixed. Since Nfix increased with shoot dry matter (SDM) (21 kg N fixed/t SDM; pea and lupin) and Pfix (pea, lupin and chickpea), increases in SDM and Pfix usually increased the legume's effect on soil N balance.
   Additive effects of SDM, Pfix and GY explained most (R-2 = 0.87) of the variation in Nadd. Using crop-specific models based on these parameters the average effects of grain legumes on soil N balance across Australia were estimated to be 88 (lupin), 44 (pea) and 18 (chickpea) kg N/ha. Values of Nadd for the combined legumes were 47 kg N/ha in south-eastern Australia and 90 kg N/ha in south-western Australia. The average net N input from lupin crops was estimated to increase from 61 to 79 kg N/ha as annual rainfall rose from 445 to 627 mm across 3 shires in the south-east. The comparative average input from pea was 37 to 47 kg N/ha with least input in the higher rainfall shires. When the effects of legumes on soil N balance in south-eastern Australia were compared with average amounts of N removed in wheat grain, pea-wheat (1:1) sequences were considered less sustainable for N than lupin-wheat (1:1) sequences, while in south-western Australia the latter were considered sustainable.
   Nitrogen mineralised from lupin residues was estimated to contribute 40% of the N in the average grain yield of a following wheat crop, and that from pea residues, 15-30%; respectively, about 25 and 15 kg N/ha. Therefore, it was concluded that the majority of wheat N must be obtained from pre-existing soil sources. As the amounts above represented only 25-35% of the total N added to soil by grain legumes, the residual amount of N in legume residues is likely to be important in sustaining those pre-existing soil sources of N.

TI Genesis of the Cooperative Research Centre for the Cattle and Beef
   Industry: Integration of resources for beef quality research (1993-2000)
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The Cooperative Research Centre for the Cattle and Beef Industry (Meat Quality) was formulated in 1992 by CSIRO, the University of New England (UNE), NSW Agriculture and Queensland Department of Primary Industries (QDPI) to address the emerging beef quality issue facing the Australian beef industry at that time: the demand from domestic and export consumers for beef of consistent eating quality. An integrated program of research involving meat science, molecular and quantitative genetics and growth and nutrition was developed. To meet the expectations of the Commonwealth of Australia, additional projects dealing with animal health and welfare and environmental waste generated by feedlot cattle were included. The program targeted both grain- and grass-finished cattle from temperate and tropical Australian environments. Integration of research on this scale could not have been achieved by any of the participating institutions working alone.
   This paper describes the financial and physical resources needed to implement the program and the management expertise necessary for its completion. The experience of developing and running the Cooperative Research Centre confirms the complexity and cost of taking large numbers of pedigreed cattle through to carcass and meat quality evaluation. Because of the need to capture the commercial value of the carcass, it was necessary to work within the commercial abattoir system. During the life of the Cooperative Research Centre, abattoir closure and/or their willingness to tolerate the Research Centre's experimental requirements saw the Cooperative Research Centre operations move to 6 different abattoirs in 2 states, each time losing some precision and considerable revenue. This type of constraint explains why bovine meat science investigations on this scale have not previously been attempted.
   The Cooperative Research Centre project demonstrates the importance of generous industry participation, particularly in cattle breeding initiatives. Such involvement, together with the leadership provided by an industry-driven Board guarantees early uptake of results by beef industry end-users. The Cooperative Research Centre results now provide the blueprint for genetic improvement of beef quality traits in Australian cattle herds. Heritabilities of beef tenderness, eating quality, marbling, fatness and retail beef yields are now recorded. Genetic correlations between these traits and growth traits are also available. Outstanding sires for beef quality have been identified. Linked genetic markers for some traits have been described and commercialised. Non-genetic effects on beef quality have been quantified. Australian vaccines against bovine respiratory disease have been developed and commercialised, leading to a reduction in antibiotic use and better cattle performance. Sustainable re-use of feedlot waste has been devised.

AB A 4-year field experiment was carried out in south-western Victoria to determine whether tactical stocking might improve perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) persistence and prime lamb production, compared with the more common practice of year-around continuous stocking. Tactical stocking consisted of variable length summer, autumn and winter rotations and continuous stocking in spring. The 2 grazing strategies were compared on 2 contrasting pastures: an upgraded pasture, sown with newer cultivars of perennial ryegrass and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) with 26 kg phosphorus/ha. year, and a more typical naturalised perennial ryegrass pasture receiving 6 kg phosphorus/ha. year. Paddocks were grazed by Border Leicester x Merino ewes, which were mated to a terminal sire to lamb in September. The effects of the grazing systems and pasture treatments on herbage production and stocking rate are presented in this paper. Herbage production was similar between the treatments, but tactical stocking significantly increased herbage mass during the growing season (P<0.05) compared with continuous stocking. In spring each year, the herbage mass generally exceeded 3000 kg dry matter/ha in tactically stocked paddocks and averaged 500-900 kg dry matter/ha higher than the mass on continuously stocked paddocks. This enabled the year-round stocking rate to be increased by an average of 9% over the 4 years of the experiment. We considered that the stocking rates could not be further increased, despite the higher herbage mass in spring, as stock reduced the dry herbage to a low residual mass by the opening rains in autumn. In contrast, stocking rates averaged 51% higher on the upgraded pasture compared with the typical pasture over the 4 years of the experiment. This indicates that pasture improvement and soil fertility status have a much greater impact on productivity than changes to grazing method. However, tactical stocking was able to increase the sustainability of prime lamb production on upgraded pastures in a dry summer climate, by maintaining herbage cover on the paddocks over the summer-autumn period.

AB A 4-year grazing experiment was carried out in south-western Victoria to compare the effect of tactical stocking with continuous stocking on the persistence of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and the productivity of sheep used for prime lamb production. Tactical stocking consisted of variable length summer, autumn and winter rotations and continuous stocking in spring. The 2 grazing strategies were compared on 2 contrasting pastures: an upgraded pasture, sown with newer cultivars of perennial ryegrass and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) with 26 kg phosphorus/ha. year, and a naturalised perennial ryegrass pasture receiving 6 kg phosphorus/ha. year. Paddocks were grazed by Border Leicester x Merino ewes, which were mated to a terminal sire to lamb in September. In this final paper of the series, the effects of the grazing systems and pasture treatments on animal production and herbage quality are presented.
   The liveweights of the ewes were similar across all treatments during autumn and winter, but the tactically stocked ewes were 3-6 kg lighter than continuously stocked ewes during spring and summer. The lower liveweight was attributed to the lower (P< 0.001) herbage quality on the tactically stocked pastures in spring (P< 0.001). Both digestibility and crude protein concentration were about 4 percentage units lower with tactical stocking in spring. This lower quality was associated with the higher herbage mass (by 500-900 kg dry matter/ha) on the tactically stocked pastures, which presumably had a higher stem: leaf ratio and showed reproductive growth earlier than the continuously stocked pastures. Although there were differences in ewe liveweight, this did not affect individual lamb weaning weight or ewe fleece weight. There were significant increases in production per hectare from tactically stocked or upgraded pasture treatments due to the higher stocking rates that could be carried, 9 and 51%, respectively. In 1998, 544 kilograms of lamb per hectare was weaned from continuously stocked paddocks and 607 kg/ha from tactically stocked paddocks (P< 0.05), and 449 and 702 kg/ha from the typical and upgraded pastures, respectively.
   This study reinforces the view that soil fertility and pasture improvement have a much greater impact on animal productivity than changes to grazing method with little effect on per head productivity. The negative impact of rotational stocking on herbage quality reinforces the need to use these systems strategically when benefits from increased herbage mass are expected to increase animal production or overcome sustainability or pasture persistence problems.

AB This paper summarizes a multinational collaborative project to search for natural, intimate associations between rhizobia and rice (Oryza sativa L.), assess their impact on plant growth, and exploit those combinations that can enhance grain yield with less dependence on inputs of nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Diverse, indigenous populations of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii (the clover root-nodule endosymbiont) intimately colonize rice roots in the Egyptian Nile delta where this cereal has been rotated successfully with berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) since antiquity. Laboratory and greenhouse studies have shown with certain rhizobial strain-rice variety combinations that the association promotes root and shoot growth thereby significantly improving seedling vigour that carries over to significant increases in grain yield at maturity. Three field inoculation trials in the Nile delta indicated that a few strain-variety combinations significantly increased rice grain yield, agronomic fertilizer N-use efficiency and harvest index. The benefits of this association leading to greater production of vegetative and reproductive biomass more likely involve rhizobial modulation of the plant's root architecture for more efficient acquisition of certain soil nutrients [e.g. N, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), sodium (Na) and molybdenum (Mo)] rather than biological N(2) fixation. Inoculation increased total protein quantity per hectare in field-grown grain, thereby increasing its nutritional value without altering the ratios of nutritionally important proteins. Studies using a selected rhizobial strain (E11) indicated that it produced auxin (indoleacetic acid) and gibberellin [tentatively identified as gibberellin (GA(7))] phytohormones representing two major classes of plant growth regulators. Axenically collected rice root exudate significantly enhanced E11's production of this auxin. This strain extensively colonized the rice root surface under gnotobiotic culture conditions, producing distributions of spatial patchiness that would favour their localized erosion of the epidermal surface, colonization of small crevices at epidermal junctions as a possible portal to enter into the root, and quorum sensing of diffusible signal molecules indicating that their nearest bacterial neighbours are in close proximity in situ. Studies of selected rhizobial endophytes of rice indicated that they produced cell-bound cellulase and polygalacturonase enzymes that can hydrolyze glycosidic bonds in plant cell walls, and non-trifolitoxin bacteriocin(s) that can inhibit other strains of clover rhizobia. Strain E11 was able to endophytically colonize rice roots of varieties commonly used by Filipino peasant farmers, and also to stimulate genotype-specific growth-promotion of corn (Zea mays, maize) under field conditions. An amalgam of these results indicate some rhizobia have evolved an additional ecological niche enabling them to form a three-component life cycle including a free-living heterotrophic phase in soil, a N(2)-fixing endosymbiont phase within legume root nodules, and a beneficial growth-promoting endocolonizer phase within cereal roots in the same crop rotation. Our results further indicate the potential opportunity to exploit this newly described, plant-rhizobia association by developing biofertilizer inoculants that may assist low-income farmers in increasing cereal production (especially rice) with less fertilizer N inputs, fully consistent with both sustainable agriculture and environmental safety.

AB Nitrogen (N-2)-fixing cyanobacteria are a dominant microflora in rice fields and are currently being used sporadically as a supplement to chemical nitrogen fertilizers for rice cultivation in rice-growing countries, including India and Bangladesh. This technology suffers from serious drawbacks and its use at the farm level is not gaining universal acceptance due to some major problems, which include development of a suitable production technology of biofertilizer for field use, establishment of the applied biofertilizer in the rice field and the sustainability of the technology. In order to significantly improve the efficient use of cyanobacteria as a N-based biofertilizer for rice cultivation, experiments were carried out in different dimensions both in the laboratory and field. Cyanobacterial strains were isolated, identified and quantified from a wide range of distinctively different types of soils, viz. acid, calcareous, saline, red and neutral soils under different agro-ecological zones (AEZ) of Bangladesh. The isolated strains were tested for their N-2-fixing capacity and growth rate under various stress conditions prevailing in the rice field e.g. pH, combined N, pesticides, salinity and nutrient availability in order to select suitable strains for use as biofertilizer. Large-scale cyanobacterial biofertilizer was produced with the strains showing high rates of growth and N-2 fixation both in liquid cultures under laboratory conditions and in soils of their habitats and non-habitats under open air. To assess the effectiveness of the produced biofertilizer, field trials at the selected locations were carried out on rice. Results of the field trials showed that cyanobacterial biofertilizer may reclaim the problem soils such as acid soils and saline soils, improve the fertility status and may supplement 25-35% N for rice cultivation in these soils. This biofertilizer may be used in improving the soil environment.

AB Effects of low concentrations of HgCl2 on water transport in excised maize (Zea mays L.) roots have been monitored using a reliable system that permits continuous measurement of xylem flux variations. The sap flow of exuding roots treated with 11 muM HgCl2 decreased by 80-90% in 10 min at 25 degreesC. Reversal of this inhibition was obtained using a sulfhydryl [beta -mercaptoethanol (beta -ME)], or non-sulfhydryl [ethylenediaminetetraacetate disodium salt (EDTA) and ferricyanide (FeCy)] reagents. The time course of reversal was not the same in the three cases. beta -ME reversed quickly but not sustainably, whereas EDTA or FeCy reversed slowly and sustainably. Using a cell pressure probe, turgor was measured in the epidermis, and the first layer of cells in the cortex. Turgor was considerably decreased in root epidermal cells after HgCl2 treatment, suggesting that a normal root water-transfer required an optimal turgor in these cells. Recovery of cell turgor, was obtained satisfactorily with FeCy. In parallel with flux measurements, histochemical analyses revealed a localization of Hg only in peripheral root cells, suggesting that Hg targets are localized in the first root cell layers. Involvement of water channels and/or ion transport in the regulation of root water transport is discussed in the light of our data.

AB Wheel traffic can lead to compaction and degradation of soil physical properties. This study, as part of a study of controlled traffic farming, assessed the impact of compaction from wheel traffic on soil that had not been trafficked for 5 years. A tractor of 40 kN rear axle weight was used to apply traffic at varying wheelslip on a clay soil with varying residue cover to simulate effects of traffic typical of grain production operations in the northern Australian grain belt. A rainfall simulator was used to determine infiltration characteristics.
   Wheel traffic significantly reduced time to ponding, steady infiltration rate, and total infiltration compared with non-wheeled soil, with or without residue cover. Non-wheeled soil had 4-5 times greater steady infiltration rate than wheeled soil, irrespective of residue cover. Wheelslip greater than 10% further reduced steady infiltration rate and total infiltration compared with that measured for self-propulsion wheeling (3% wheelslip) under residue-protected conditions. Where there was no compaction from wheel traffic, residue cover had a greater effect on infiltration capacity, with steady infiltration rate increasing proportionally with residue cover (R-2 = 0.98). Residue cover, however, had much less effect on infiltration when wheeling was imposed.
   These results demonstrated that the infiltration rate for the non-wheeled soil under a controlled traffic zero-till system was similar to that of virgin soil. However, when the soil was wheeled by a medium tractor wheel, infiltration rate was reduced to that of long-term cropped soil. These results suggest that wheel traffic, rather than tillage and cropping, might be the major factor governing infiltration. The exclusion of wheel traffic under a controlled traffic farming system, combined with conservation tillage, provides a way to enhance the sustainability of cropping this soil for improved infiltration, increased plant-available water, and reduced runoff-driven soil erosion.

ID ADSORPTION; TRANSPORT; ANDISOL; CHARGE
AB Recent research on the fate of applied fertiliser N in the Ferrosols of the wet tropics of Far North Queensland (FNQ) has shown that the nitrate leaching below the crop root-zone is a major pathway of N loss from paddocks. Information on the fate of this nitrate is essential to develop best N fertiliser management practices and for the long-term sustainability of land and water resources. Because of the ability of Ferrosols to adsorb anions in the soil matrix, it was speculated that the leached nitrate may be accumulating at depth in the Ferrosol profiles. The objectives of this study were to (i) verify whether the leached nitrate has been accumulating in the Ferrosols under the major cropping systems in the Johnstone River Catchment (JRC) of FNQ, and (ii) provide preliminary estimates for nitrate retention capacity of the Ferrosols. Soil cores to a depth of 10 m were taken from under sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum-S), banana (Musa (AAA group, Cavendish subgroup) cv. Williams), dairy pasture, and rainforest in JRC during August 1995. The cores were segmented at 0.5-m depth increments and soil samples were analysed for nitrate-and ammonium-N, cation-(CEC) and anion-(AEC) exchange capacities, pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, and Cl-. Nitrate-N concentration under sugarcane was as high as 33 mg/kg, compared with 6.9 mg/kg for banana, 0.3 mg/kg under rainforest, and that under pasture was below detection limit. Nitrate-N load in the top 10 m of the profiles under sugarcane ranged from 345 to 1875 kg nitrate-N/ha compared with 145kg/ha for banana, and 21 kg/ha under rainforest. Most of the nitrate accumulation was found between 2 and 8 m, i.e. well below the crop root-zone. From 7% to 70% of the nitrate that leached below crop root-zone was retained at depths >1 m. In general, Cl- and total cation (TC = sum of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na (+)) concentrations in the profiles under cropping were higher than those under rainforest, and the pH under sugarcane was more acidic. Simple correlation analysis indicated associations existed between the accumulated nitrate and Cl-, pH, AEC, or TC. The estimated nitrate holding capacity of the Ferrosols ranged from 17 to 32 t N/ha. The results show that large quantities of the nitrate that leached below crop root-zone have accumulated at depth under long-term sugarcane and banana cropping in the Ferrosols of FNQ.

AB Attributes of 25 Tasmanian sodosols were assessed using field and laboratory techniques to determine changes associated with 4 typical forms of agricultural management [long-term pasture, cropping with shallow tillage using discs and tines, cropping (including potatoes) with more rigorous and deeper tillage including deep ripping and powered implements, and cropping (including potatoes) where the potatoes were harvested when the soil was wet]. Soil organic carbon in the top 150 mm was 2.7% under long-term pasture compared with 1.8% in rigorously tilled cropping paddocks, and microbial biomass C values were 194 and 129 mg/kg, respectively. Readily oxidisable organic C concentrations were 1.8 mg/g and 1.3 mg/g, respectively. Infiltration rate was greater in paddocks with shallow tillage cropping than longterm pasture but was 43% less in paddocks which had grown potatoes and 70% less after a wet potato harvest. Dry aggregate-size showed no change under shallow tillage cropping compared with long-term pasture but decreased significantly in more rigorously tilled potato cropping paddocks. Aggregate stability in all cropped paddocks was nearly 50% less than in long-term pasture paddocks, with values in intensively tilled potato cropping paddocks approaching relatively low levels. Colwell extractable phosphorus (P) increased with all cropping, particularly after potatoes. Lower organic carbon and poorer physical properties were associated with paddocks which had grown potatoes, which adds weight to the view that cropping rotation and associated soil management practices are critical for sustainable management of Tasmanian sodosols. Farmers were surveyed about their views of the condition of their paddocks. They identified more healthy than unhealthy soil attributes under all management histories but reported more unhealthy soil attributes when potatoes were included in their rotation.

TI Explaining groundwater hydrographs: separating atypical rainfall events
   from time trends
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE salinity; monitoring; sustainability indicators
AB By 1994, an estimated 1.8 million hectares of cleared land in Western Australia was affected by secondary dryland salinity to some extent. The area affected is likely to double in the coming 20 years. The cause of this salinity is excessive recharge under traditional agriculture, leading to rising groundwater levels. Monitoring changes in groundwater levels is helpful in indicating the degree of threat to agricultural land and public assets. Many researchers have studied groundwater level rises and attempted to explain them statistically.
   We present an approach for statistically estimating trends in groundwater levels. The approach separates the effect of atypical rainfall events from the underlying time trend and the lag between rainfall and its impact on groundwater is explicitly represented. Rainfall is represented as an accumulation of deviations from average rainfall. Application of the approach is demonstrated using data from 49 bores in Jerramungup Shire, Western Australia. The approach provides high explanatory power, particularly for deeper bores.

AB Declining soil organic matter levels because of cropping have been shown to reduce crop growth and yield, but the effects of changing infiltration and soil hydraulic properties on crop productivity have not been widely evaluated. Cropping systems in south-eastern Queensland have, in the past, involved intense tillage, trafficking with heavy machinery, and changed organic matter cycling, affecting soil aggregation, permeability, water-holding characteristics, and organic matter. The aim of this paper is to determine how important infiltration and soil hydraulic condition has been to the water balance, crop growth, and yield in the past, and may be in the future if management is not changed. Change in physical and chemical condition of the 5 most commonly cropped soils in south-east Queensland (Sodosols, Vertosols with less than or equal to 55% clay, Vertosols with >55% clay, Red Ferrosols and Red Chromosols/Kandosols) was measured over 0-70 years of cropping and estimated up to 200 years. The APSIM model was used to predict effects of changing soil condition in a rain-fed, fertilised, wheat-summer fallow cropping system with intense tillage. Decline in infiltration, restricted internal redistribution of water, and increased evaporation reduced water supply to the crop, causing simulated yield to decline by 29, 38, 25, 17, and 13% for the 5 soils, respectively, after 50 years of cropping. Gross margin declined at a faster rate, falling by 36, 50, 40, 20, and 21%, respectively after 50 years because of increasing fertiliser requirement to compensate for declining soil fertility. Crop productivity on most soils continued to steadily decline as period of cropping increased to 200 years. To arrest or reverse this downward trend, it is likely that substantial changes to current cropping systems will be needed, including reducing tillage and trafficking, and improving organic matter levels.

AB The FILTER (Filtration and Irrigated cropping for Land Treatment and Effluent Reuse) technique was developed to provide a sustainable system for treatment of saline sewage effluent on naturally occurring saline and/or sodic soils. Potentially, it can also be used to ameliorate soils that are salinised by inappropriate application of saline effluent on soils with impeded drainage. The FILTER technique involves using the nutrient-rich effluent for irrigated cropping combined with removal of excess water from the root-zone through a subsurface drainage system, during wet weather and winter periods when evapotranspiration demand is low.
   This paper describes the changes in salinity and sodicity in FILTER plots used for land application of saline sewage effluent on a heavy clay soil with restricted drainage, at the Griffith City Council sewage works site. The field experiments consist of trials conducted on four 1-ha plots, over an 18-month period. The pre-FILTER soil chemical characteristics and their changes with FILTER operations were measured. In addition, the volumes and the chemical properties of the effluent applied and subsurface drainage water passing through the soil were monitored. These data are used to explain the salinity and sodicity changes within the FILTER soils, and their potential effects on soil stability. Management options to minimise salinity and sodicity to provide a sustainable system are suggested.

AB The adequate protection and sustainable management of a tropical rain forest requires a good knowledge of its biodiversity. Although considerable parts of Guyana's North-West District have been allocated as logging concessions, little has been published on the forest types present in this region. The present paper reviews the floristic composition, vegetation structure, and diversity of well-drained mixed and secondary forests in northwest Guyana. Trees, shrubs, lianas, herbs and hemi-epiphytes were inventoried in four hectare plots: two in primary forests, one in a 20-year-old secondary forest and one in a 60-year-old secondary forest. The primary forests largely corresponded with the Eschweilera-Licania association described by Fanshawe, although there were substantial variations in the floristic composition and densities of dominant species. The late-succession forest contained the highest number species and was not yet dominated by Lecythidaceae and Chrysobalanaceae. There is a need for updating the existing vegetation maps of northwest Guyana, as they were based on limited information. Large-scale forest inventories may provide a fair indication of species dominance and forest composition, but do not give a reliable insight in floristic diversity. Although previous reports predicted a general low diversity for the North-West District, the forests plots of this research were among the most diverse studied in Guyana so far. These results will hopefully influence the planning of protected areas in Guyana.

AB A survey was undertaken in the Maputo Elephant Reserve to establish the level of people's dependence on wildlife, and their perceptions of the extant Forest and Wildlife Policy and the associated legislation, including the new Land law. The underlying assumption was that the local communities residing in the Reserve may not have been involved, or consulted in the process of formulating the policy and legislation. Results overwhelmingly confirmed this hypothesis - as 65% of the community members interviewed were unaware of the approved Forest and Wildlife Policy, and associated Legislation. 74% had never even heard of the new Land Law, 88% indicated they were not involved in any management of natural resources in the Reserve, and the majority, 53% had never even heard of any community-based natural resource management programme. The widespread unawareness of the various enabling mechanisms established by the Mozambican Government to ensure that rural people actively participate in, and sustainably and tangibly benefit from the management of natural resources is of great concern. More particularly so, as the frameworks, and strategies for achieving this have been developed under the Transfrontier Conservation Areas Project (TFCA). This study recommends, inter alia: (i) that the Directorate for Forestry and Wildlife establishes a Community Education and Public Relations Unit (CEPRU) in the Maputo TFCA in order to improve community awareness of the opportunities, and various enabling policies and legislation, especially with respect to communities' rights vis-a-vis ownership of land and the associated natural resources; (ii) the introduction of community-based tourism as a means of diversifying communities' income base. Currently nearly 82% of community members in the Reserve depend on consumptive use of wildlife, and as the human population grows the pressure may overwhelm the resource base. Generation of revenues through community-based tourism may be an incentive for communities to adopt biodiversity conservation based market economy as an alternative to their subsistence livelihood styles.

AB The Abe Bailey Nature Reserve, South Africa has been identified as a potential community resource reserve compatible with biodiversity conservation. As part of the planning and public participation phase this study investigated the potential for sustainably harvesting medicinal plants. Medicinal plant use data on local species, parts used and harvesting techniques, in collaboration with neighbouring traditional healers were collected. A census of these plants was conducted in the reserve and frequency, density and abundance were calculated. A medicinal plant rating system for assessing conservation priorities was used to combine both social-qualitative and ecological-quantitative data. Five medicinal species suitable for high impact harvesting were identified. Thirty-four species have potential to be set up as harvesting trials to determine sustainable quotas. Thirty-one medicinal species including Boophane disticha, Dicoma anomala, Eucomis autumnalis, Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Pentanisia prunelloides and Indigofera daleoides are considered to be site-specific sensitive species and should not be harvested from the reserve. Following this research an on site nursery has been started at the reserve. A multi-pronged approach involving harvesting trials, propagation and plant rescue from developments to cope with escalating demand and dwindling natural populations needs to be implemented.

AB Human activities, like logging, modify the dynamics and composition of virgin forest, affecting the equilibrium between the natural species. Nothofagus forests sustain an entomofauna that is endemic, and includes relict species of significant conservation importance. The aim of this work was to evaluate the changes in insect diversity and abundance of a Nothofagus pumilio forest managed by a shelterwood cut system. Insect capture was carried out using a set of traps along a horizontal and vertical gradient. Sampling was taken in day and night conditions, in post-harvesting situations and different phases of stand development. The diversity and abundance of insects varied significantly during the forest cycle (defined as 100-200 years according to site quality). One morphospecies was lost every 11 years until the end of the forest cycle. It may be necessary to modify the current silvicultural system to one that conserves insect diversity through a reduction in disturbance.

AB Human activities, such as logging, modify the forest structure and the microenvironments of the original Nothofagus forests. The aims of this work were to evaluate changes in the diversity and relative abundance of birds and to analyze their trophic relationships with insect and plant communities along the Nothofagus pumilio forest management cycle. Data was collected using a point sampling method along transects located in different forest structures during the summer season, by direct (sight) and indirect (hearing) recognition following sunrise. Bird diversity and abundance significantly varied along the forest management cycle. Seven new species appeared after harvest, but the total number did not vary by the end of the forest management cycle, and there was no significant loss of species. Bird abundance was directly related to the insect abundance and plant biomass. Relationship between groups (lower plants, monocotyledons and dicotyledonous) is also discussed. Major studies in bird ecology are necessary to develop new silvicultural alternatives based on the more sensitive species to harvest. Forest management strategies and mitigation alternatives must be incorporated into forest planning in order to maintain the original structure of bird communities and the equilibrium with other forest species.

AB SCUBA ecotourism provides economic support for local human communities and for conservation. Such support should be sustainable and as ecologically non-destructive as possible to its coral reef foundation. In recent years, the major increase in SCUBA activity has become a significant consideration at some locations. Among these are the South African coral reefs at Sodwana Bay, which receive 80 000 dives per year. Between May 1998 and January 1999, assessments using line-intercept and belt transects showed that 5.9% of hard corals and 4.0% of soft corals were damaged from various causes, while only 0.02% of the hard corals were dead. Of the 222 diver contacts observed, only 1.63% produced instant and visually-clear damage, with no measurable decline in overall coral reef health. Direct observations on 89 recreational divers showed that photographers made damaging contacts on nine out of ten dives, while novice divers made one such contact per six dives, moderately experienced divers about once every 14 dives, and very experienced divers about once every 123 dives. Increased time lapsed since the last dive increased diver damage by novices. We calculated that the 80 000 dives were equivalent to 1 m(2) of reef receiving 2.3 diver contacts per year. Acropora austera was by far the most significantly damaged coral, with one out of four branches broken per year. But as this species accounted for only 0.2% of reef benthos cover, this impact was not representative of overall reef health. This heavy species-specific impact makes A. austera a good bio-monitor.

AB A five year field experiment was conducted to obtain information which will facilitate the scientific development of tree mixtures in an agroforestry system with two fruit trees, mango (Mangifera indica L.) and sapora (Achrus sapota L.) and three fast growing forest trees eucalyptus (Eucalyptus tereticornis L.). casuarina (Casuarina equisertifolia J.R. & G. Forst) and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) de Wit). Observations on biometrics and edaphic parameters were recorded, The results revealed that growth of sapora can he enhanced by 17% when grown in mixture with leucaena while co-planting of casuarina had no influence on sapota. A reduction of 12% in the growth of mango was observed when co-planted with casuarina or leucaena. Eucalyptus was incompatible with mango and sapota. which were suppressed by the former. The present investigation identified two tree mixtures sapora + leucaena and sapota + casuarina for raising in tropical alfisol for a sustainable income.

AB In total, seven green manure crops of legumes and non-legumes were tested and compared with bare soil for their ability to supply nitrogen to two organically grown vegetable crops: onion with a shallow root system and white cabbage with a deep root system. The tests were carried out in two contrasting years: the first year with high precipitation during the autumn and winter months, the second year with low precipitation and almost no leaching. The green manure crops comprised narrow-leaved lupin, hairy vetch, common vetch, winter rye, clover-grass, and a mix of winter rye and hairy vetch incorporated into the soil in November or March/April. The green manure crops of legumes facilitated a substantial biological nitrogen fixation which increased the amount of mineral N (N-min) available for the subsequent vegetable crop. Hairy vetch was the most effective green manure in this respect. By November, all green manure crops were able to reduce the amount of leachable N by between 50 and 85%. The winter-persistent green manure crops reduced the risk of N losses to the environment more than the green manure crops that were killed prior to or during winter. However, pre-emptive competition from the winter-persistent green manure crops winter rye and clover-grass reduced the yield of deep rooted white cabbage, but not that of the shallow rooted onions. Generally, N-min was low to moderate and under these circumstances nitrogen uptake by the vegetable crops, their dry matter production and yield were linearly related to N-min determined in June. The risk of nitrogen leaching after whits cabbage was low, irrespective of green manure treatment prior to the crop, but differed significantly with differences in precipitation and green manure treatment after the shallow-rooted onion crop. It is suggested that organic vegetable farming should include green manure crops whenever possible, as part of a sustainable rotation system, and legumes are to be recommended when little N is available.

AB Aquilaria spp. are the main source of gaharu, one of the most valuable non-timber products harvested from tropical forests. In order to assess the impact of gaharu harvesting on populations of Aquilaria spp. in Indonesia, the activities of gaharu collectors were assessed by accompanying them on collecting expeditions. Gaharu harvesting generally involved felling the tree, with 31-92% of trees encountered being felled. The quantity of gaharu obtained from each felling was extremely low, mean values ranging from 0.10-0.18 kg tree(-1) to 0.19-2.13 kg tree(-1) for high and low grade gaharu respectively. A combination of these values with gaharu trade figures for the early 1990s enabled the number of Aquilaria spp. trees harvested annually in Indonesia to be estimated. Values ranged from less than 30,000 to more than 100,000 trees felled, depending on the year. Field assessments of two populations of Aguilaria spp. were used to parameterize a matrix model, which was used to predict the impact of different harvesting regimes on population dynamics of the species. Values of the dominant latent root (lambda) were 1.22 and 1.20 for A. malaccensis in West Kalimantan and A microcarpa in East Kalimantan respectively, indicating that both populations are self-sustaining in the absence of harvesting. Analysis of lambda under different harvesting scenarios indicated that for A. malaccensis, population expansion will continue if harvesting is set at a minimum diameter at breast height (dbh) of above 10 cm, but for A. microcarpa, a population decline will occur if trees with a dbh of less than 30 cm are harvested. Given current harvesting practices, it is, therefore, unlikely that gaharu is being sustainably harvested at present. These results suggest that the gaharu trade may have had a substantial impact on the population size of Aquilaria spp. in Indonesia, and their implications are discussed in the context of setting harvest quotas for regulation of trade, as required by CITES.

AB Estimates of world regional potentials of the sustainable use of biomass for energy uses through the year 2050 are presented. The estimated potentials are consistent with scenarios of agricultural production and land use developed at the International institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Austria. They thus avoid inconsistent land use, in particular conflicts between the agricultural and bioenergy land use. As an illustration of the circumstances under which a large part of this potential could be used in practice, a global energy scenario with high economic growth and low greenhouse gas emissions, developed by IIASA and the World Energy Council is summarised. In that scenario, bioenergy supplies 15% of global primary energy by 2050. Our estimation method is transparent and reproducible. A computer program to repeat the calculation of the estimates with possibly changed assumptions is available on request. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since the German reunification in 1990 lignite: production in the Lusatian milling region has significantly been decreased as a result of substantial economic and structural changes. This development coincides with efforts of the government of the state of Brandenburg to enhance the production of biomass for energy use on arable set-aside and post-mining land. In this context, the goal is to obtain a share of 3% of the primary energy consumption from biomass. As a part of the ongoing recultivation activities in the post-mining landscapes, short-rotation tree plantations as a special form of energy forests have recently come into focus. Thus, in 1995 a 2.5 ha short-rotation plantation was established on clayey-sandy, nutrient-poor substrates in the Lusatian mining area Welzow-Sud in order to study the yield potential of fast-growing tree species under the prevailing site conditions. Even under unfavourable soil conditions with a low N and P supply, above-ground biomass production after 4 years ranged from 5.3 to 19.6 tons dry matter (DM) per hectare. 4-year-old plants of fast-growing tree species like clones of poplar and willow and aspen progenies were marked by low mean N - ( 4.9 mg g(-1) DM), Cl - (113 mug g(-1) DM), Cd - (0.8 mug g(-1) DM) and Pb - (0.5 mug g(-1) DM) concentrations and a high ash softening temperature point of about 1680 degreesC. Fur the biomass accumulated within this 4 year period, a calorific Value of 42.000 MJ ha(-1) a(-1) has been calculated. The ash content of 2.4% allows this material to be used for amelioration purposes. This recycling approach guarantees balanced phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium supply. To maintain adequate site productivity only for nitrogen a compensatory fertilization is required. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The development of short-rotation intensive cultural (SRIC) willow systems as a source of bioenergy and bioproducts is growing in the northeastern and midwestern United States. Important data for sustainable management such as nutrient removal and nutrient use efficiency in willow bioenergy plantations is lacking. This study reports wood biomass production, annual removal of nutrients, and nutrient use efficiency in experimental plantings of SRIC willow and poplar at Tully, New York. Effects of clone, fertilization, irrigation, planting density, and harvest cycle were analyzed.
   Annual biomass production of 15-22 dry Mg/ha removed 75-86, 10-11, 27-32, 52-79 and 4-5 kg/ha/year of N, P, K, Ca and Mg, respectively. For all the variables studied, the responses depended on clone. Fertilization and irrigation increased rates of nutrient removal by means of increased biomass production. Unlike planting density, harvest cycle significantly affected rates of nutrient removal and nutrient use efficiency. For clone SV1 (Salix dasyclados), an irrigated and fertilized planting with a density of 36,960 trees/ha harvested on a 3-year rotation had the highest biomass production and nutrient use efficiency, and the lowest rates of nutrient removal. The annual harvest cycle had the lowest nutrient use efficiency and the highest annual removal of nutrients suggesting that this choice would be most appropriate for biomass crops that are to be used as buffer ships to manage nutrient runoff from agricultural fields. An appropriate choice of clone, planting density, and harvest cycle could tailor the rates of nutrient removal and nutrient use efficiency to match the objective of the planting.

AB A vertical flat-plate photobioreactor was developed for the outdoor culture of microalgae using sunlight as the light source. The ability for biomass production and CO2 fixation was evaluated by using a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis aquatilis SI-2. The average areal productivity was 31 g biomass m(-2) d(-1), which corresponded to a CO2 fixation rate of 51 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1), sustainable in the northern region of Japan during the winter time (January and February). The relationships between the efficiency of solar energy utilization of the reactor and its effect factors (cell concentration and irradiation) were investigated.

   energy efficiency; offices; regulations; sustainability; UK
AB The rate of growth in UK commercial energy consumption since the early 1970s has been approximately three times greater than in the domestic sector. Consumption is projected to continue growing faster than in all other sectors except transport. Increasing floor space has been accompanied by rising energy intensity in many commercial buildings. In the office sector, demand for air conditioning has grown rapidly, and this is associated with a dramatic increase in CO2 emissions. Significant cost-effective CO2 savings have been identified in the sector, using readily available technologies. The Climate Change Levy, and questions of comfort, health and productivity among workers, are pushing energy issues up the agenda for many businesses. However positive action is impeded by barriers in the commercial property sector, such as conflicts of interest between landlords and tenants, poor information and professional conservatism. These barriers act to limit energy efficiency investment, to the detriment of building occupants and wider society for generations to come. These problems will limit the efficacy of existing initiatives that aim to curb commercial sector energy use. The Association for the Conservation of Energy considers that new legislation is needed. This would require freeholders to improve the energy efficiency of their new and existing buildings, in consultation with occupiers and/or unions. Further research is needed on options for sharing the costs and benefits with occupiers and/or energy service companies.

All but one building (which paradoxically used the least energy of Probe's air-conditioned offices) claimed to be energy efficient, but achieved performance ranged from excellent to below average. Across the sample, there was a factor of six in carbon dioxide emissions per unit floor area, and even more per occupant. The air-conditioned buildings tended to use the most energy: they usually contained more equipment, were more intensively occupied, but also usually ran more liberally and wastefully - as did more complex systems generally. Often complication seemed to have been added before the fundamentals had been made efficient. Design objectives were also frustrated by poor airtightness, control problems, unintended consequences, a dearth of energy management, and a tendency for systems to default to 'on' - also a pathological trend for information technology and its associated cooling demands. Solutions include load reduction, 'gentle engineering', better matches between demand and supply, and predictions based on a better understanding of in-use performance.

   factors; factors for success; feedback; innovation; productivity
AB The implications of the Probe post-occupancy survey project are discussed (methods and findings have been discussed in papers 1 to 4). Recent pressures to improve the UK building industry and its products have so far focused on production and not performance in use. Feedback, however, reveals successes which are not immediately apparent even to experts (when newly completed, the best all-round performer in Probe did not make the shortlist for an environmental award), and that innovations can easily have unintended consequences. Meanwhile, persistent chronic low-level problems need to be tackled if we are to move towards the triple bottom line of more sustainable practice and create a base of sound practice upon which innovations can flourish. Factors for success include making sure essential features are in place; seeking simplicity, usability, manageability and responsiveness; identifying and managing downside risks; a culture of feedback with better benchmarking and constant review against client and design intentions; and more involvement of the supply side in improving and learning from the performance of buildings in use. Seven main themes are explored and initial actions suggested for the key industry players, clients and government.

AB This paper provides a historical context for the Probe studies reported in this special issue by describing the stalled development of post-occupancy evaluation (POE) in Britain since the 1960s. It charts 40 years of continuing academic, professional and commercial neglect of POE as a mainstream activity in the procurement of buildings in Britain. It notes the current resurgence of interest in the 'customer care' focus of the Egan Report. And it closes by identifying a re-emerging research agenda for POE in Britain. This could include its use for benchmarking progress in the transition towards more sustainable production and consumption of the built environment.

AB Post-occupancy evaluation (POE) is examined within a North American perspective. Benefits from using POE are examined and include: a feedback loop to enhance continuous improvement processes, improved fit between occupants and their buildings, the optimization of services to suit occupants, the reduction of waste of space and energy, validation of occupants' real needs, reduced ownership/operational expenses, improved competitive advantage in the marketplace. The barriers to implementing POE are found to include: fragmented incentives and benefits within the procurement and operation processes, lack of agreed and reliable indicators, potential liability for owners, exclusion from current delivery expectations, exclusion from professional curricula. Recommendations for overcoming these barriers are made at governmental, institutional, corporate and project levels.

AB This work analyzes the evolution of catch efforts and productions during the period of 1980 to 1997 in the gulf of Gabes (south-cast Tunisia), the main zone of concentration of the Tunisian fishing fleet. A stock assessment, by species, has been established.
   The study of the conjointly evolution of productions and annual fishing efforts using the synthetic approaches of SCHAEFER (1954) and FOX (1970) shows that the fish group is over-fished. The fishing is exceeded by 33%. For the cephalopod group, the optimal effort and maximum sustainable yield have been attained since 1994, Productions are in net regression in spite of an observed effort superior of the optimal effort of about 30%. On the other hand, the stock of Royal Shrimp Penaens kerathurus does not present indices of overfishing.

ID SUSTAINABLE-YIELD; BIOMASS
AB The abundance, distribution, size, structure, nutritional quality and feasibility of exploitation of a sea cucumber population, an alternative fishery resource for Banco Chinchorro (Mexican Caribbean) were evaluated. Sampling was conduced during the three main climatic seasons: rainy (September 1998), cold front (December 1998) and dry(April 1999). Five sampling sites were chosen to cover the three major habitats: seagrass (north, central), reef patches (north, south), and shallow sandy-bottoms. Three species and a hybrid were identified: Holothuria thomasi, H. mexicana, H, floridana, and H. floridana x H. mexicana. H. floridana was the most abundant (mean density = 0.12 ind m(-2)). Growth and natural mortality parameters, and maximum sustainable yield (MSY), were estimated using simplified protocols commonly predicated for the assessment of tropical fisheries, all assuming equilibrium conditions. Banco Chinchorro was hit by Hurricane Mitch following the first survey; estimated abundance during the second survey (after the hurricane) was only 14% of the pre-hurricane survey. Based on this study case we discuss (1) the shortcomings of methods assuming equilibrium, (2) the need for specific life-history data, and (3) the research opportunities provided by the response of populations to natural disturbances or to harvesting.

ID INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; DISTRICT LEVEL
AB Objective To study a novel surveillance system introduced in Mpumalanga Province, a rural area in the north-east of South Africa, in an attempt to address deficiences in the system of notification for infectious conditions that have the potential for causing outbreaks.
   Methods Hospital-based infection control nurses in all of Mpumalanga's 32 public and private hospitals were trained to recognize, report, and respond to nine clinical syndromes that require immediate action. Sustainability of the system was assured through a schedule of regular training and networking, and by providing feedback to the nurses. The system was evaluated by formal review of hospital records, evidence of the effective containment of a cholera outbreak, and assessment of the speed and appropriateness of responses to other syndromes.
   Findings Rapid detection, reporting and response to six imported cholera cases resulted in effective containment, with only 19 proven secondary cholera cases, during the two-year review period. No secondary cases followed detection and prompt response to 14 patients with meningococcal disease. By the end of the first year of implementation, all facilities were providing weekly zero-reports on the nine syndromes before the designated time. Formal hospital record review for cases of acute flaccid paralysis endorsed the value of the system.
   Conclusion The primary goal of an outbreak surveillance system is to ensure timely recognition of syndromes requiring an immediate response. Infection control nurses in Mpumalanga hospitals have excelled in timely weekly zero-reporting, participation at monthly training and feedback sessions, detection of priority clinical syndromes, and prompt appropriate response. This review provides support for the role of hospital-based nurses as valuable sentinel surveillance agents providing timely data for action.

AB Objective To improve the use and dosage of antibiotics prescribed at Commune Health Stations in Viet Nam, and in so doing find out whether antibiotic dosage can be easily and reliably measured as a drug-use indicator.
   Methods All commune health workers from the 217 commune health stations in Hai Phong Province, Viet Nam, were enlisted over an 18-month study period during 1994-96, The study design was a longitudinal time series, with each new district baseline acting as a rolling control. Each health station was monitored monthly by district supervisors, Two formal evaluations by doctors external to the study were compared with the supervisors' results. Basic medical equipment was provided three times over nine months, conditional on improvements in prescribing practices and adequate supervision of prescribing practices.
   Findings The supervisors' data showed that the percentage of encounters in which a patient was prescribed an antibiotic decreased from over 65% to around 45%, When antibiotics were given, the percentage of patients who received an adequate dose increased from under 30% to 98%. These changes were stable for 17 months after the intervention stopped.
   Conclusions Such initiatives require the active collaboration of health personnel and civic leaders at every level. Conditional equipment donation was shown to be effective. A simple indicator measuring adequacy of antibiotic dose can be an effective tool to improve the use of antibiotics in a sustainable way.

AB Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological disorder and is one of the world's most prevalent noncommunicable diseases. As the understanding of its physical and social burden has increased it has moved higher up the world health agenda. Over four-fifths of the 50 million people with epilepsy are thought to be in developing countries; much of this condition results from preventable causes. Around 90% of people with epilepsy in developing countries are not receiving appropriate treatment. Consequently, people with epilepsy continue to be stigmatized and have a lower quality of life than people with other chronic illnesses. However, bridging the treatment gap and reducing the burden of epilepsy is not straightforward and faces many constraints, Cultural attitudes, a lack of prioritization, poor health system infrastructure, and inadequate supplies of antiepileptic drugs all conspire to hinder appropriate treatment. Nevertheless, there have been successful attempts to provide treatment, which have shown the importance of community-based approaches and also indicate that provision for sustained intervention over the long term is necessary in any treatment programme. Approaches being adopted in the demonstration projects of the Global Campaign Against Epilepsy - implemented by the International League Against Epilepsy, the International Bureau for Epilepsy, and the World Health Organization - may provide further advances. Much remains to be done but it is hoped that current efforts will lead to better treatment of people with epilepsy in developing countries.

AB Objective To evaluate the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension among elderly individuals in Bangladesh and India.
   Method A community-based sample of 1203 elderly individuals (670 women; mean age, 70 years) was selected using a multistage cluster sampling technique from two sites in Bangladesh and three sites in India.
   Findings The overall prevalence of hypertension (WHO-International Society for Hypertension criteria) was 65% (95% confidence interval = 62-67%). The prevalence was higher in urban than rural areas, but did not differ significantly between the sexes. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified a higher body mass index, higher education status and prevalent diabetes mellitus as important correlates of the prevalence of hypertension. Physical activity, rural residence, and current smoking were inversely related to the prevalence of hypertension. Among study subjects who had hypertension, 45% were aware of their condition, 40% were taking anti-hypertensive medications, but only 10% achieved the level established by the US Sixth Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VI)/WHO criteria. A visit to a physician in the previous year, higher educational attainment and being female emerged as important correlates of hypertension awareness.
   Conclusions Our findings emphasize the need to implement effective and low cost management regimens based on absolute levels of cardiovascular risk appropriate for the economic context. From a public health perspective, the only sustainable approach to the high prevalence of hypertension in the Indian subcontinent is through a strategy to reduce the average blood pressure in the population.

AB We examined recent special health initiatives to control HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, and make four policy recommendations for improving the sustainability of such initiatives. First, international cooperation on health should be seen as an issue of global public goods that concerns both poor and rich countries. Second, national health and other sector budgets should be tapped to ensure that global health concerns are fully and reliably funded; industrialized countries should lead the way. Third, a global research council should be established to foster more efficient health-related knowledge management. Fourth, managers for specific disease issues should be appointed, to facilitate policy partnerships. Policy changes in these areas have already begun and can provide a basis for further reform.

AB Recent collapses of some important fisheries in Atlantic Canada have created a strong public concern regarding management policies for marine resources. Consequently, a precautionary approach has been urged for these resources. Previously marine plant management was either 'laissez faire' or based only on single species resource sustainability. A new approach was applied to the management of the fucoid Ascophyllum nodosum (Rockweed) as this resource plays a role as a habitat for invertebrates and vertebrates. In 1995, under a four-year pilot plan, the A. nodosum harvest expanded from Nova Scotia to the unexploited area of southern New Brunswick. A new joint federal/provincial management strategy for Rockweed was implemented after reviewing existing biological information and 30 years of harvesting history and experience in Nova Scotia. Maximum exploitation rate, cutting height, gear restrictions, and protected areas were management measures within a precautionary pilot harvest plan. A research and monitoring program involving the industry, universities and the provincial and federal government was simultaneously initiated to evaluate the effect of the harvest on the resource and associated species and to provide information to improve the management of rockweed. A scientific peer committee carried out a review of this information in April 1998 and 1999. The consensus was that the harvest impact on the habitat architecture was minimal and of short duration, therefore, it was advised to continue the harvest but to maintain the precautionary approach to management.

AB The 1997 collapse of the Albanian economy caused by the collapse of economy-wide Ponzi schemes contrasts sharply to its success status as a post-Socialist transition country in the years 1992-96. In this paper, an attempt is made to explain this 'Albanian Paradox'. The specific Albanian conditions for the growth of Ponzi schemes are identified. Theoretically, the Albanian Paradox can be interpreted as one version of the 'Financial Instability Hypothesis' suggested by Minsky. Investigation of the underlying factors that render financial markets fragile suggests that the Albanian case is extreme but not unique in the region. It is emphasised that sustainable growth is predicated on the quality of government, on proper financial-sector regulation, on actual microeconomic restructuring and on the development of market institutions through which adequate market information is disseminated.

AB The dynamics of epiphytic bryophyte communities following natural and human disturbance have rarely been quantified. We describe the response of bryophyte communities on bigleaf maple trees (Acer macrophyllum Pursh) in Olympia, Washington, following their experimental removal. Approximately 8% of the exposed area was recolonized by bryophytes 1 year after clearing, and 27% after 3 years. Lateral encroachment from bryophytes on the sides of the 20-cm-long plots accounted for 75% of this recolonization, with growth from residual plant parts or aerially dispersed diaspores accounting for the remaining 25%. Though it was not possible to distinguish between the latter two sources of cover, the number of clear de novo colonization events over the course of the year was low (0.18 dm(-2)). Disturbance appeared to reduce bryophyte diversity at this successional stage, as alpha and gamma diversity remained low after 1 year and had not recovered after 3 years. Reflecting the preponderance of lateral encroachment as the mechanism for recolonization, disturbance size may significantly affect the time needed to recolonize disturbed branch substrates. In addition to contributing to ecologists' understanding of processes of succession, these experiments may help to develop sustainable practices for moss-harvesting in the Pacific Northwest.

AB Environmental engineering is one of the most complex and fastest-growing disciplines in engineering. The scope of the field includes issues from public health protection to aesthetics, and from the impact on business development to the development of legislation, standards, regulations, and guidelines, to their enforcement and environmental protection. The issues include contaminants in gases, liquids, and solids and the phase transfers of the contaminants. The sub-specialties of environmental engineering address all these areas including the treatment of water, liquid waste, solid waste, and gaseous materials, protection of the environment through proactive measures, and the development of effective regulations. Environmental engineers have the necessary skills to address these issues and improve the quality of life of humans and other living things in an effective, sustainable, and economical manner. This paper outlines the evolvement of environmental engineering and identifies many of the exciting new directions of environmental engineering profession.

AB Monitoring, analysis, and modelling are essential elements of an air quality management plan. It is beneficial to deal with them as an integrated whole. The paper describes Ciudad Chihuahua, Mexico, the development of a new, user friendly, integrated air quality management system (SIMON), and an example of the use of SIMON to examine "good" and "poor" mitigation strategies that could be applied to reduce high pollutant concentrations. The system design and architecture are documented. The five major parts of SIMON are described: an emission inventory module, the meteorological data module, an air quality monitoring module, a modelling-planning module, and a reporting module. The practical use of SIMON is demonstrated through its application to mitigate high concentrations of particulates in one area of the city.

TI Fishing down Canadian aquatic food webs
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES

DT Article
ID FISHERIES; HISTORY; DIET
AB The mean trophic level (TL) of fish landed in fisheries on the east and west coasts of Canada is declining by 0.03-0.10.decade(-1), similar to global trends. This finding is based on data from United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans and other Canadian sources for the period 1873-1997. Significant rates of decline in mean TL were obtained even when key species - Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) on the east coast and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) and Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) on the west coast - were omitted from the analysis. Fish taken in inland water fisheries did not exhibit a decline in mean TL. Two models were developed, based on length and age, respectively, for correcting TL estimates of individual species for the effects of changes in body size due to changes in fishing mortality. Both produced corrections that were small relative to changes in mean TL that resulted from changes in species composition of the catch over time. Overall, these results suggest that the mean TL of fish landed can be used as an index of sustainability in multispecies fisheries and that its reliability will depend on the quality of the data and length of the time series available for analysis.

TI The Precautionary Approach and risk management: can they increase the
   probability of successes in fishery management?
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID STOCK ASSESSMENT; RESOURCES; SCIENCE
AB Considerable progress has been made in the implementation of the Precautionary Approach to the protection of fish stocks, but applying the Precautionary Approach to the protection of fishing communities lags considerably. The principle of intergenerational equity, one of the main tenets of the Precautionary Approach, and the principle of sustainable utilization both imply that the Precautionary Approach should explicitly incorporate the protection of fishing communities, not only the resources they depend on. Risk assessment aims primarily at evaluating the consequences of various harvest strategies in terms of probabilistic statements about future trends in yields, biomass, and dangers to the stock, while risk management involves finding and implementing management policies, strategies, and tactics that reduce the risk to the communities exploiting them. Not all fishery management approaches deal equally well with risk, with some compounding rather than reducing risk. Portfolio management, whereby fishing enterprises have the ability to choose among a diverse portfolio of harvestable resources, would mitigate against the risk of fluctuations in the abundance, availability, or price of individual species. Although much remains to be achieved in better assessing risk, fishery management agencies should immediately implement risk management.

ID HEALTH PROMOTION; ORGANIZATION; PROGRAM
AB Lifestyle exposures account for the greatest proportion of risk factors for cancer, yet these exposures have proven mast difficult to alter. Despite intensive intervention efforts, many behaviour change programs are in suited to the community. This research was undertaken to increase our understanding of prevention activities of interest to a sample of residents in two Ontario communities. 248 (62.3%) adult residents responded to a semi-structured self-administered questionnaire including open-ended questions on health issues, exposures and prevention activities of interest, While some of the beliefs expressed by respondents might have been anticipated (e.g., cigarette smoking and family history increase risk of cancer), others were not (e.g., only between 40 and 75% of respondents thought a high fat diet increased risk). Furthermore, many of those with personal health concerns expressed an interest in prevention. This process is proposed as a first step in launching more appropriate and sustainable community-based health promotion programs for cancer prevention.

AB Industrialized societies are responsible for increasing environmental pollution by trace metals, and pathogenic micro-organisms associated with products and wastes of industrial processes and agricultural production, as well as household activities. The objective of this paper is to discuss the effect of composting on the behavior of trace metals and pathogenic micro-organisms, and to present the latest finding on sanitizing and stabilizing organic fractions and trace metals in composted biosolids. Evidence provided by long-term scientific studies in North America and Europe on toxic effects of trace metals on soil micro-organisms and on pathogenic micro-organisms suggests that revisions of the current guidelines on sludge applications on agricultural soils are needed to protect long-term soil fertility. In addition, the antagonism between harmful characteristics of biosolids and their usefulness for agriculture and land reclaiming purposes could be mitigated by using efficient composting treatments. The production and use of harmless organic wastes should be one of our highest priorities in order to protect our health and environment, and to hand over a sustainable agriculture to future generations.

AB A solid phase crystallization (spc) method was applied for the preparation of SrTiO3-supported Ni catalysis and compared to the impregnation (imp) method. spc-Ni-0.2/SrTiO3 has highly dispersed and stable Ni metal particles resulting in higher activity and higher sustainability against coking than imp-Ni-0.2/SrTiO3 in the partial oxidation of CH4. Both catalysts were tested for the CH4 pyrolysis in order to elucidate the catalytic nature against coking of spc-Ni-0.2/SrTiO3. The amount of carbon and the rate of H-2 formation were similar over both catalysts at both 773 and 1073 K. On both catalysts, CH4 continuously decomposed at 773 K, while the rate of CH4 pyrolysis quickly decreased at 1073 K. Fibrous carbons grew up with a Ni metal particle on the tip of the fiber at 773 K, while carbon balls and short carbon fibers with a Ni metal particle encapsulated inside formed and no sufficient growth of the fiber was observed at 1073 K. The carbon species formed at 773 K was hydrogenated completely to CH4 around 873 K, while the hydrogenation of that formed at 1073 K needed higher temperature around 1073 K. However, the carbon species formed on both the catalysts at either 773 or 1073 K was completely oxidized around 773 K. Thus, judging from the anti-coking nature, the behaviors in the CH4 pyrolysis are similar over both catalysts, nonetheless spc-Ni-0.2/SrTiO3 was far superior to imp-Ni-0.2/SrTiO3 in the CH4 oxidation. It is likely that the high sustainability against coking of spc-Ni-0.2/SrTiO3 is not due to its intrinsic nature suppressing the coking but due to its high activity of reforming which can quickly eliminate the carbon formed on the catalyst surface.

AB The design of the CCAMLR-2000 Krill Synoptic Survey (CCAMLR-2000 Survey) is described. The primary objective of the survey was to improve estimates of the pre-exploitation biomass of krill which are used in models to estimate sustainable yield in Area 48. The survey design includes two large-scale oceanic strata: one in the southwest Atlantic located in the Scotia Sea, and the other to the north of the Antarctic Peninsula (CCAMLR Statistical Subareas 48.1, 48.2, 48.3 and 48.4). Within these large-scale strata, four mesoscale strata were included in the survey design; these were located close to the South Sandwich Islands, north of South Georgia, north of the South Orkney Islands and north of the South Shetland Islands. The rationale underlying the selection of the strata and survey boundaries is described. The methods used for selecting the location of each survey transect are explained and the planned cruise tracks for each of the four vessels participating in the survey are shown. Details are also described for adaptively modifying the survey during its execution. This includes information how net haul stations should be selected and how transects should be modified if the planned survey tracks cannot be completed.
   The survey took place in January-February 2000 and involved ships from Japan, Russia, UK and the USA. Scientists from many more CCAMLR Member States and the International Whaling Commission (IWC) took part. The survey is by far the biggest single exercise ever carried out by Members in support of the Convention. Full analysis of the results of the CCAMLR-2000 Survey will take several years and will result in a significant increase in the knowledge of krill length frequencies, biomass and distribution in the area studied.

TI Effects of lupine green and root manure on yield of subsequent rye
SO CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS

DT Article
DE lupine green manure; organic matter management; sustainable agriculture
AB Sustainable agriculture aims to avoid or minimise the use of non-renewable production inputs. To achieve these objectives, farmers employ a variety of alternative production and management practices and try to maximise the use of (i) on-farm resources such as legumes and manure to provide plants with nutrients, (ii) crop residues, covering crops and conservation tillage to control soil erosion and nutrient leaching, (iii) crop rotation to control weeds, insects and diseases, (iv) energy conserving tillage system to save energy and reduce operation costs. This way, farmers seek to minimise their dependence on costly off-farm resources. Lupine can fix enough atmospheric nitrogen to meet or slightly exceed their own nitrogen requirements. One important aim of the research has been to investigate the benefit of lupine to the following rye crop in the treatments of Westsik's crop rotation experiment.

DE low-molecular-weight DNA; blood plasma; irradiation
AB Low-molecular-weight DNA (180 bp) appears in blood plasma of irradiated rats. Its amount correlates directly with the irradiation dose. The cloned low-molecular-weight DNA is enriched with G/C pairs (48% compared with 40% in the rodent genome). Computer search against EMBL data showed that the sequence of these clones is homologous to various genomic repetitive elements. The program for identification of nucleosome-positioning sequences in eukaryotic nuclear DNA has shown that low-molecular-weight DNA fragments are able to form rather sustainable nucleosomes and have some peculiarity. The difference in the composition of low-molecular-weight DNA isolated from blood plasma of rats after irradiation at doses of 8 and 100 Gy consisted of the change in the levels of two dinucleotides (CpG and CpT). The DNA in question originates from different types of cells.

DT Article
DE vulnerability; risk; sustainability; systems; process evidence
AB The risks to a system must necessarily be well managed for it to be sustainable. In this paper risk, opportunity and vulnerability are clearly distinguished. Managing them for sustainable systems is a set of 'wicked' problems with interlocking issues and constraints which can only be solved through a social process. This process can also identify new opportunities to add value. There is a strong need to integrate our understanding and ability to manage 'hard' and 'soft' systems and this may be done through a way of systems thinking about processes introduced recently (Blockley and Godfrey, 2000). The methodology enables appropriate attributes of processes to be chosen and defined so that evidence can be collected from the past, present and future to steer a 'wicked' process to success. This includes a proper consideration of hazards, risks and vulnerabilities and the incorporation of the basic ethical values of sustainability. An example of a (partial) set of processes for sustaining a water supply is given based on an actual case history.

SO CLIMATE POLICY

   Mitigation; Technology development; Energy modelling
ID EMISSIONS; REDUCTIONS; ABATEMENT
AB Two different mitigation scenarios for stabilising carbon dioxide concentration at 450 ppmv by 2100 have been developed, based on the recently developed B1 baseline scenario (part of the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios). In both mitigation scenarios, a global uniform carbon tax has been applied as a proxy of pressure on the system to induce a variety of mitigation measures-assuming the presence of some international mechanism for globally cost-efficient implementation of such measures. The two scenarios differ in the timing of mitigation action: early action versus delayed response. Analysis of the scenarios has led to the following findings. First, stabilisation at a carbon dioxide concentration of 450 ppmv from the B1 baseline scenario is technically feasible. In the first quarter/second quarter of this century most of the reduction will come from energy-efficiency and fuel switching options; later on the introduction of carbon-free supply options will account for the bulk of the required reductions. Second, postponing measures foregoes the benefits of learning-by-doing, and, as a result, an early action strategy will at low discount rates lead to reduced mitigation costs compared to delayed response. The most difficult period for the mitigation scenarios is the 2010-2040 period (exact timing depends on early action or delayed response), when 'bending the curve' towards a lower carbon emission system will have to be initiated. Finally, while overall costs seems to be limited, there are large differences in costs and benefits for individual regions and sectors for instance in terms of redirection of investments, changing fuel trade patterns and changing energy expenditures.

DE Climate change; Targets; Developing countries
AB This paper assesses five options for targets that could be taken by all countries to meet the ultimate objective of the climate change convention: fixed, binding targets; dynamic targets; non-binding targets; sectoral targets; policies and measures. Each is evaluated according to criteria of environmental effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, contribution to economic growth and sustainable development, and equity. While fixed, binding targets continue to be viable for industrialised countries, they do not seem suitable for many developing countries in the near future. Dynamic targets could alleviate developing countries' concerns about constraining their development as well as broader concerns about possible introduction of "hot air" in a world trading regime; they could also be considered for some or all industrialised countries. Non-binding targets could be politically appealing to developing countries, alleviate fears about development and/or hot air, but might only allow conditional participation in emissions trading by developing countries. Sectoral targets could offer a pragmatic first step - although their cost-effectiveness might be questioned. Finally, targets based on commitments to implement specific policies and measures might drive mitigation action and be part of negotiated packages including financial and technological co-operation. All these options may coexist in the future.

AB The paper investigates the role that the clean development mechanism (CDM) could play in enhancing the effectiveness of north-south technology transfer. This is done by first exploring the issue of technology transfer in the context of existing north-south experiences to bring out the basis for the poor and unsatisfactory performance. This is followed by bringing out the intrinsic relevance of appropriate technology transfer for combating the global climate change issue.
   The paper then analyses the potential for such an appropriate and sustainable transfer, as well as effective diffusion and deployment of technologies under the CDM. Various aspects of the evolving design of the CDM are investigated to analyze the potential for overcoming the historical barriers across the north-south divide.
   Any potential for technology transfer under the CDM would need to be supported by an effective framework in the developed countries as well as a conducive environment in developing countries. In searching for such a cooperative and complementary model, the paper analyses the current Dutch strategy to bringforth certain salient features that could be applicable for other countries.
   Finally, a Japanese model for technology transfer is developed which can build upon domestic strengths as adopt applicable features of the Dutch strategy in order to capitalize any latent potential under the CDM. This is done by first investigating the effectiveness of the existing Japanese technology transfer framework and then extending recommendations for adapting it to reflect the shifting resource flow paradigms under the climate change regime.

AB It is generally recognized that in order for arable farming systems to remain sustainable in the long term, they need to be productive and their soil fertility must be maintained to continue to provide viable yields with minimum detrimental effects on soil and environmental quality. The use of biological nitrogen fixation (DNF) as the main source of nitrogen (N) for crops is an important sustainable management strategy. Amounts of BNF in four pairs of conventional and organic mixed cropping farms, each with three stages of pasture establishment in Canterbury, New Zealand were compared under farmers' field conditions over a period of one year using the N-15 isotope dilution technique. Composite topsoil (0-75 mm) samples were taken from all sites Lit the beginning and end of the trials. These were analyzed for soil pH and available nutrients according to New Zealand "MAF Quick Test" methods. In addition, at the end of the trials, soil samples at four depths (0-50, 50 -100, 100 - 150, 150 -200 mm) were taken from inside and outside the experimental plots in pastures of three different ages in one of the pairs of conventional and organic farms and analyzed for total soil N. Results obtained showed that the amounts of biologically-fixed N varied from 19 to 68 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Then were no significant differences between paired conventional and organic farms or between pastures of different ages. This was attributed to the large variability present and the possibility that the farms studied were at a steady state condition in terms of BNF as supported by total soil N and available soil nutrient data. The BNF was significantly correlated with clover biomass and was also affected significantly by seasons.

AB Invariably, many agricultural soils of the world are deficient in one or more of the essential nutrients needed to support healthy plants. Acidity, alkalinity, salinity, anthropogenic processes, nature of farming, and erosion can lead to soil degradation. Additions of fertilizers and/or amendments are essential for a proper nutrient supply and maximum yields. Estimates of overall efficiency of applied fertilizer have been reported to be about or lower than 50% for N, less than 10% for P, and about 40% for K. Plants that are efficient in absorption and utilization of nutrients greatly enhance the efficiency of applied fertilizers, reducing cost of inputs, and preventing, losses of nutrients to ecosystems. Inter- and intra-specific variation for plant growth and mineral nutrient use efficiency (NUE) are known to be under genetic and physiological control and are modified by plant interactions with environmental variables. There is need for breeding programs to focus on developing cultivars with high NUE. Identification of traits such as nutrient absorption, transport, utilization, and mobilization in plant cultivars should greatly enhance fertilizer use efficiency. The development of new cultivars with higher NUE, coupled with best management practices (BMPs) will contribute to sustainable agricultural systems that protect and promote soil, water and air quality.

AB Agriculture is a contributor of nitrate to natural waters and there is concern about the excess nitrogen burden loadings from agriculture on natural waters. Agricultural practices that reduce nitrate leaching from arable land are needed. It is postulated by certain groups that organic farming practices reduce nitrate leaching among other environmental benefits. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to compile, summarize and critically analyse information about NO3-N leaching from farming systems that were managed according to organic farming principles; (2) to compare NO3-N leaching from organic farming systems with that from conventional systems. This review consists of several parts. The available literature on leaching of NO3-N from organic farming and conventional farming systems was analysed. Leachable amounts of NO3-N in soils from two types of farming systems were compared. Finally NO3-N leaching from animal manure versus inorganic fertilizer was examined.
   In all studies we found in the literature, both the sequence and type of crops grown, and the input intensity of N was different in organic and conventional systems. Organic farming systems had on average a lower N input and more legumes in rotation. Average leaching of NO3-N from organic farming systems over a crop rotation period was somewhat lower than in conventional agriculture.
   If the different input intensities of N between organic and conventional systems were taken into account and corrected for, no differences in leaching losses between systems were found. However, a proper comparison of leaching between the two types of systems should take the yield into account. Attempting to do this in this review, we found only two studies which provided data for this. In both studies, specific conditions of the soil-a high organic matter content resulting in a high N mineralization at one site and a heavy clay texture resulting in very small leaching losses at the other site-did not enable us to come up with a clear-cut answer. Nevertheless, we could not find any evidence that nitrate leaching will be reduced by the introduction of organic farming practices, if the goal is to maintain the same crop yield levels as in conventional farming systems. Reduction of nitrate leaching is not a question of organic or conventional farming, but rather of introduction and use of appropriate counter- measures. This insight should guide our thinking when developing environmentally friendly and sustainable cropping systems.

AB In tropical acid soils, acidity is an important constraint for availability and uptake of nutrients by annual crops, and this leads to lower crop yields. Factors that contribute to low nutrient uptake efficiencies in these soils are low natural levels of most essential plant nutrients and unfavorable soil and plant environments. High P fixation capacity, Al, Mn and H toxicity, low activities of beneficial microorganisms, soil compaction, infestation of weeds, diseases and insects, drought and intensive monoculture are some of the major factors that contribute to the unfavorable soil and plant environments. Improving nutrient use efficiency in these soils demand adoption of special management practices. These practices include timely application of adequate levels of lime, gypsum and fertilizers to meet crop demand, use of proper crop rotation, improvement of organic matter content, control of soil erosion and use of acid tolerant crop species and cultivars within species.

AB Upland rice also known as aerobic rice is mainly grown in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Brazil is the largest producer of upland rice in the world. At world level, average yield of this crop is less than 2000 kg ha(-1). The important yield limiting factors are water stress, mineral stress, diseases, insects and weeds. To improve and/or stabilize yield, these yield limiting factors should be alleviated. Research data related to yield limiting factors are scarce and much work is needed to improve upland rice yield under different agroecosystems. In this paper some basic principles to improve yield of this important crop with special reference to water and nutrient management, control of diseases, insects, weeds, and erosion, maintenance of organic matter and crop rotation are suggested. The basic principles to increase yield are similar for different ecosystems, although the technological packages based on these principles vary depending on local specific constraints and socio-economic considerations.

TI Response of radish to varying levels of irrigation water and fertilizer
   potassium on clay terrace soil of Bangladesh
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB A field experiment was conducted in the rabi (dry) season of 1998-99 on a clay terrace soil of Bangladesh, in order to study the effects of irrigation and potassium (K) fertilization on the yield, total water use, and water use efficiency of radish. Both irrigation and K application were found to be indispensable for increasing the yield of radish, due to their individually significant impact on the yield. The interaction effect of irrigation and K application was insignificant, but the highest yield of 30.1 Mg ha(-1) was obtained under the highest levels of irrigation and K application (four irrigations with 160 kg K2O ha(-1)) as the positive effects of both treatments on the radish yield. From the economic viewpoint, the yield of 29.9 Mg ha(-1) under four irrigation levels with 120 kg K2O ha(-1) gave the highest net benefit. The total water use in this case was 101 mm, having the water use efficiency 297 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). Based on the acceptable economic yield, high water use efficiency, and the maintenance of proper soil fertility, four irrigation levels and K application at the level of 120 kg K2O ha(-1) proved to be the best combination for the sustainable radish cultivation in Shallow Red-Brown Terrace Soil of Bangladesh.

TI Shareholder versus stakeholder - is there a governance dilemma?
SO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB All directors are faced with real, or imagined, conflicts of interest or competing demands for time and resources, between shareholders and stakeholders. This has always been the case, but the contemporary emphasis on stakeholders has brought this to a head. Although astute organisations and directors maintain a suitable balance between the various demands placed upon them, and there are systematic ways to do this, there are a few voices opposed to stakeholding in any shape or form. In order to suggest that stakeholding is the viable and sustainable way for companies to proceed, the article considers and criticises one anti-stakeholder, together with other antagonists, before bringing in endorsements from different quarters, and introducing three categories of stakeholding of, which the normative holds most promise. Practical approaches to discriminating among the claims of various stakeholders are indicated.

AB Genetic erosion of domestic animal diversity has placed 30% of the world's breeds at risk of extinction, often as a result of government policy/programmes. Conservation and sustainable development of animal genetic resources (AnGR) require a broad focus that includes the many 'adaptive' breeds that survive well in the low external input agriculture typical of developing countries. Environmental economic valuation methodologies have an important role to play in supporting decisions regarding which breeds should be conserved and how this should be done. However, AnGR, in general, and valuation methods in particular, have received very little attention. This paper provides a survey of the methods available for the valuation of AnGR and the steps that must be taken in order to test some of the more promising methodologies in practice.

AB There is a need to accurately account for the contributions of environmental assets to the overall economy. Such accounting would permit policies that allow protection of important natural resources and aid the analytic process to determine an accurate basis for a sustainable economy. The aim is to develop an accounting framework for ecology that is sufficiently consistent with the economic framework that the two can be fruitfully combined. With appropriate definitions of the flows, the two systems can be connected into a common framework. No single measure of the system productivity and efficiency can be given for the combined system, however, until the ecosystem metabolism can be converted into economic terms. This could be done with a series of economic valuation techniques. Ecological prices could then be estimated and a single measure of ecological economic output could be given. With the net combined system input and output now in common terms, a technical system efficiency measure can logically be proposed. Because human activity inevitably involves dissipation, such emissions would now have a monetary price. Because such emissions are irrecoverable, the total output of the combined system is greater than it is under the current definition, giving rise to a technical system-wide efficiency measure.

AB In tropical and subtropical countries a social gradient can be observed in mountainous regions between small-scale farmers on fragile ecosystems associated with human poverty, and the fertile plains and broad valleys with large-scale cash crop productions and industrial centers associated with relative economic welfare. Sustainable community development paths have to be identified in these less privileged regions. The objective of this study was to make a contribution for defining and assessing development indicators at community level, including ecological, economic and social dimensions, to elicit the conflicting objectives in development and to discuss some practical implications. The study was performed in a typical watershed in central Honduras and special attention was given to autochthonous and qualitative indicators for development. Using the pressure-state-response model as a framework, a series of indicators were identified and assessed, which were also used by the local population and grouped into landscape structure, soil fertility, water availability and quality, production system and extractive activities, economic and social performance, and institutions. The development path in this specific case illustrated the transition from an expansive forest conversion agriculture to an intensified and diversified agriculture. This was made possible through technology transfer and improved market access. However, this development path, while increasing economic welfare, generated increasing negative environmental impacts caused by pesticide residues, soil erosion and less regular water supply. As the watershed carrying capacity for traditional shifting cultivation (used as a system indicator) reached its ecological limit, new sustainable development strategies had to be identified. The implications of the study for policy design are that tools need to be provided for natural and environmental resource monitoring, which may consist of sustainability goal definitions, a minimal set of indicators and simple maps for planning land use at local level.

   rebound effect?

AB Sustainability concepts that rest on the idea of resource- or energy-efficiency improvements due to technological progress tend to overestimate the potential saving effects because they frequently ignore the behavioral responses evoked by technological improvements. Efficiency improvements also affect the demand for resources and energy, and often an increase in efficiency by 1% will cause a reduction in resource use that is far below 1% or, sometimes, it can even cause an increase in resource use. This phenomenon is commonly labeled the rebound effect, which is well-known among energy economists, but never attracted much attention in ecological economics. The paper starts with the traditional neoclassical analysis of the rebound effect in a partial equilibrium framework that concentrates on the demand of one particular energy service such as mobility or room temperature. II also provides an overview of some of the main empirical studies based on this model that mostly confirm the existence of the rebound effect, but are controversial about its actual importance. However, we have to go beyond the neoclassical single-service model in order to take care of the variety of possible feedback affecting energy use. The paper presents two important expansions of the single-service model in order to show the potential relevance of the rebound effect to ecological economics. First, it is shown that in a multi-services model it proves to be difficult to make general statements about the relevance of the rebound effect. In this case, the overall effect of an increase in energy efficiency on total energy use depends on the on the assumptions about the substitutability between the services considered and the direction of the income effect. Second, the paper also tries to take care of the fact that changes in resource use or energy use are frequently just 'side-effects' of other forms of technological progress. Especially technological change of a lime-saving nature can have a large influence on energy use as many time-saving devices (for example, faster modes of transport) require an increase in energy consumption that is frequently reinforced by a 'rebound effect with respect to time'. This effect will be especially strong when wages are high and, at the same time, energy prices are low, as is currently the case in most industrialized countries. Consequently, the paper also provides a strong argument for the introduction of energy taxes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Eco-certified forestry (ECF) is defined as forest management that incorporates ecological concerns into commercial timber production. In this paper, we link the adoption of ECF practices to shifts in the timber supply function. We use a spatially disaggregated model of southeastern US timber supply to simulate the empirical relationship between variations in the price premium offered for timber produced under ECF regimes and producer surplus-maximizing rates of ECF. The simulation results suggest that a large share of nonindustrial private timber suppliers in the region may have relatively small compensation requirements, but complete adoption by the sector would require a large premium.

AB This paper is a contribution to the discussion on the relation between thermodynamics and economic theory. With respect to thermodynamic constraints on the economy, there are two diametrically opposite positions in this discussion. One claims that the constraints are insignificant ('of no immediate practical importance for modelling') and in the intermediate run, do not limit economic activity and, therefore, need not be incorporated in the economic theory. The other holds that thermodynamics tells us that there are practical limits to materials recycling, which already puts bounds on the economy and, therefore, must be included in the economic models. Using the thermodynamic concept of entropy, we show here that there are fundamental problems with both positions. Even in the long run. entropy production associated with material dissipation need not be a limiting factor for economic development. Abundant energy resources from solar radiation may be used to recover dissipated elements. With simple, quantitative analysis we show that the rate of entropy production caused by human economic activities is very small compared to the continuous natural entropy production in the atmosphere and on the Earth's surface. Further, the societal entropy production is well within the range of natural variation. It is possible to replace part of the natural entropy production with societal entropy production by making use of solar energy. Society consumes resources otherwise available for coming generations. However, future generations need not have less resources available to them than the present generation. Human industrial activities could be transformed into a sustainable system where the more abundant elements are industrially used and recycled, using solar energy as the driving resource. An economic theory, fit to guide industrial society in that development, must not disregard thermodynamics nor must it overstate the consequences of the laws of thermodynamics.

ID CLIMATE; ECOLOGY; SCALES
AB This Article discusses the challenges and opportunities facing efforts to shape a transition toward more sustainable relations between humans and their planet. It begins with a review of international goals for human development and environmental conservation, past trends in interactions between the Earth's social and natural systems that set the stage for contemporary efforts to meet those goals, and some of the foreseeable problems that will have to be addressed in the years ahead. Arguing that the successful strategies for navigating a sustainability transition will necessarily be knowledge intensive, the Article discusses strategies for social learning about sustainability. It closes with a review of the institutional reforms that will be necessary to implement such strategies.

AB Decisionmakers disregard scientific findings regarding environmental conditions, despite recommendations of the 1992 "Earth Summit" in Agenda 21 that science should provide a foundation for sustainable development. Although environmental degradation trends continue to exacerbate, decisionmakers address only selected issues. This Article examines an analytic paradigm for evaluating when decisionmakers are ready to address a problem and describes the catalytic role that scientific information can serve in prompting remedial action. Unless systematic procedures require evaluation of environmental scientific findings in the normal course of decisionmaking, science will continue to be ignored. One hallmark of Environmental Law has been to fashion such procedures, as illustrated by integrative systems developed in international environmental law institutions, environmental impact assessment processes, licensing procedures for nuclear electrical generating facilities, and corporate environmental management.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL-PROTECTION; ECOLOGY; LAW
AB Sustainable development (SD) is premised on the inescapable and integral role played by humans in shaping and impacting the natural world and has been recognized as a foundational norm of international environmental law and policy. Ecologicalism-an outlook that embraces a comprehensive approach to interdependent natural and human systems-provides the conceptual underpinnings for a creative and integrated environmental management philosophy for implementing SD, This Article argues that the daunting task of defining and applying such an integrated approach and philosophy to the multiple interacting changes affecting planetary life support systems can benefit from the U.S. experience in addressing the need for integrated pollution control (IPC). It also contends that the relatively new discipline of Industrial Ecology (IE) that pairs industry with ecology offers a promising new system paradigm for analyzing human activity within the biophysical environment, By entwining humans and their needs with ecosystems, IE does in fact aspire to become the "science of sustainability."

AB Field and herbarium studies on wild flowering plant of Ethiopia furnished 203 species consumed by the community. These account for about 3% of the higher plant species in the country and comprise herbs (37%), shrubs (32%), and trees (31%). Species with edible fruits contributed to 61.6%, leaves 27.7%, stems 14.4%, roots 13.3%. and seeds 10.3%. About 15% are considered famine foods. Forest habitats gave 102 species, woodlands 99, grassland 83, bushlands 52, rocky and dry areas 47, cultivated places 41, riverbanks 31, and roadsides/disturbed areas 25. The altitudinal distribution gave 148 species between 1500-2400 m, 144 below 1500 m and 81 above 2400 m a.s.l. Some species are wild-semiwild- domesticated continuum. Full-scale ethnobotanical studies, implementing appropriate conservation measures and domesticating and integrating promising taxa into existing crops are favored for the purpose of diversification of food sources, ensuring food security, and maintenance of biodiversity and environmental integrity.

ID MULTICRITERIA
AB The native palm flora of Ecuador consists of 129 taxa, including at least 69 species used by rural people, 19 of which are exploited commercially. This paper integrates bioclimatic modeling of palm distribution and quantitative ranking through pair-wise comparisons of species as a tool to evaluate and map the importance of 14 taxa of commercially exploited palms in Ecuador based on criteria of harvest values, sustainability, vegetation cover and population density. The ranking procedure could find broad application within ethnobotany and economic botany. Results show that extraction of palm products, economically speaking, is most important in the heavily deforested and populated coastal lowland.

DT Article
DE Astrocaryum standleyanum; Embera; fiber; palm basketry; Panama; Wounaan
AB This study examines the use of Astrocaryum standleyanum for basketry by Wounaan and Embera artisans in Panama. Fibers from the palm are a traditional source of material for baskets, which have become commercial art items within the last fifteen years. Data on palm use were collected over two years, largely from Darien Province. Results indicate that the palm is destructively harvested, usually for a single spear leaf. Artisans remove the fibers from the pinnae and color them with dye plants. Astrocaryum standleyanum strands are sewn around a foundation of Carludovica palmata to make coiled baskets. Wounaan weavers are considered the better artisans, perhaps because of cultural traditions or a longer history with art vendors. The sale of A. standleyanum baskets is an important source of cash income, with both domestic and international sales. The destructive harvesting of palms threatens the industry and suggestions are made for sustainable harvest.

ID TRANSITION
AB Many of the states of the former Soviet Union have experienced a dramatic collapse of output during transition, which has not yet been reversed in a sustainable way. The economics of disorganization, proposed by Blanchard (1997) and tested empirically by Blanchard and Kremer (1997), reasons that this phenomenon can be explained by specificity of inputs and the breakdown of traditional domestic supply linkages. We replicate the Blanchard-Kremer study for Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and also find that longer and more complex domestic supply chains are associated with greater reductions in output. When we extend their analysis to incorporate measures of the complexity of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) trade and non-CIS trade however, we find that complexity of non-CIS trade is the significant factor in explaining the output collapse. We therefore argue that the disintegration of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the requirement of hard currency trade, are equally, if not more, significant in explaining the output declines experienced by Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

AB In this study, we take an ecosystem approach to examine the degree of biological self-organization at the ecosystem level. An integrated set of indicators is derived from a theoretical framework and tested by field data from an ecosystem research project focusing on the Bornhoved Lake district in northern Germany. This field test is based on a comparison of the self-organized phenomena that comprise the carbon, water, and energy budgets of two adjacent edaphically and climatically similar ecosystems, that have vastly different levels of human interference-a crop field and a beech forest. fn terms of biomass storage, biologically incorporated nitrogen and phosphorus, species number, total ecosystem respiration per total biomass (qCO(2)), total ecosystem assimilation per available nutrients, and transpiration per total evapotranspiration, we found clear differences between the systems. Ecosystem surface temperature and R-n/K* were found to be of limited utility in characterizing the two systems. The study is rooted in the concept of ecological integrity, an influential idea at the interface of ecological and environmental debate that has acquired a number of different meanings. Among other interpretations, it can be viewed as a guiding principle for sustainable land use that aims at long-term protection of ecological life-support systems. Effective use of any interpretation of this concept requires a theoretically consistent and applicable set of indicators. Therefore, we also discuss the integration of the indicator set and its potential use in monitoring programs.

AB This paper provides a baseline geographic characterization of the mangrove ecosystem of the Braganrinian coastal region in the Stare of Para, northern Brazil, which is the research area of the joint Brazilian-German Mangrove Dynamics and Management (MADAM) project. The paper looks at the natural environmental conditions, the status of the coastal resources, the socio-economic situation of the rural population and the sustainability of existing human activities based on stock-taking between the years 1997 and 2000. Human use of this mangrove ecosystem is characterized by about 15 products, which have either subsistence value or generate monetary income for the local rural population. The importance of these functions for the rural household increases with the distance from the urban center. In the primary production sector, agriculture and artisanal fisheries are the main sources of income in the wider Braganrinian region. Both industries are characterized by many small operators. The industrial sector is very underrepresented throughout the region. In the service sector, especially coastal tourism is gaining increasing importance. It was found that the ecology of the ecosystem of Cacti River estuary as a whole can still be considered as rather undisturbed by human activities, but there is evidence of considerable and increasing remote and local interference by humans. This includes increased sedimentation by land clearance in the catchment area of the estuary, intensification of fisheries due to population growth and lack of alternative livelihoods, changes in the hydrological regime of the mangrove ecosystem by improvements to the network of roads, and development of tourism along the beaches. Presently the control of the allocation of resources within this region rests predominantly in the hands of local individuals. An overall plan for a sustainable management of the coastal zone is still lacking.

TI Powerful actors versus compelling actions
SO EDUCATIONAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB The term interest group is closely associated with the idea that politics is fundamentally about "power over" in the form of a struggle among contending collectivities. The word interest implies something fixed. An alternative view of politics emphasizes "power to" and treats understandings of interest (or preferences) as something malleable. In the latter view, actors are empowered by the relationships they form and these relationships help shape preferences. Because the interactions accompanying some relationships are less cumbersome than others, some relationships and the practices they support are more sustainable than others. These might be called compelling action. Sustainable relationships shape preferences, and a rule of viability appears to work in such a way that the policy mandates emanating from group struggles may not necessarily take hold Lasting school reform ultimately depends on sustainable relationships as a basis for desirable practices.

AB Long-term data are now recognized as crucial to our understanding of environmental change and management. Historically, these studies have been difficult to maintain because of the dominance of short term funding programs, a misconception that long-term studies are merely monitoring, and emphasis on short term experimentation or hypothesis testing of specific interactions or processes under the assumption of equilibrium conditions. The complexity of the environment and the dynamic nature of environmental conditions require additional research efforts that are not only long-term, but also address questions of scale dependency, complex assemblages of species and their interactions, and the role of humans in the environment. Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites offer this important complement to the more traditional types of ecological research. These sites also provide the opportunities for interdisciplinary research that is fundamental to understanding the environment. Such collaborations are essential for the development of sustainable management of our natural resources.

AB The complex approach to the megasystem landculture was on the margin of attention. Some of producents or its environmental conditions, and the majority of instruments for biomass production attract attention of agrarian and forestry specialists. The idea of producents and its surroundings as a part landscape supersystem was absent. The optimal and diverse biomass production came true only in sustainable developed landscape supersystem. The ecological optimal relationship between the natural and man made landscape elements are necessary for secure this landscape function. In this case is also important the continuity and mutual connection between the autoregulated ecosystems and agroecosystems. Landculture (agriculture, gardening, forestry) like complex system initiate the necessity to include the landscape planning in the governmental priorities.

AB Landscape-ecological parameters characterising the landscape structure. function and changes (dynamics) play an important role as the indicators of sustainable development. In respect to their detailed elaboration and sensibility, they are very suitable for the regional and local levels and they have at present still greater application in testing the implementation of Agenda 21 in rural and urban settlements or regions.
   The introduction of the article is devoted to the European Landscape Convention and further international activities relating to the issues of landscape analysis, evaluation and utilisation on local level. Some proposed methodological procedures are illustrated by the example of the Dunajska Luzna municipality that currently prepares its Local Agenda 21, Here is presented a proposal for a set of indicators - utilisable to monitor the direction of the municipality towards sustainable development, based on landscape-ecological parameters, This set is divided into the indicators of influence/driving force, those of state, and those of response.

AB The network of UNESCO-MAB Biosphere Reserves is found as an excellent place for research and monitoring. Because of their relative administrative and ecological stability the chosen sample and monitoring plots can be utilised for scientific and educational activities for many years. The long-term research performed in biosphere reserves provides the scientific information in time series, what enables to observe the trends and tendencies in various aspects of ecosystems stability, biodiversity of ecosystems and landscapes and also in successional changes in areas where the land-use was changed substantially. Innovative and interdisciplinary research, performed with the international research programmes deals with biological diversity, water and nutrient cycles and global change.
   The zonation of biosphere reserves provides opportunity to focus the research in core areas with preserved and close-to nature ecosystems with relatively small impact of Man, while in the other two zones impacts of more or less intensive interventions by Man can be studied.
   The Biosphere Reserves in Carpathian arch served in recent years for numerous scientific projects, including inter alia, the ones focused on ozone air pollution and its phytotoxic potential, on effect of forest health on biodiversity with emphasis on air pollution, on changes of vegetation in abandoned areas. The landscape-ecological research, monitoring and other scientific activities are utilised in silvicultural, agricultural and other practices with aim to prepare the conditions for wise use and sustainability on natural resources in biosphere reserves and their vicinity.

ID TERRITORY
AB The biosphere reserves (BR) are not only areas for nature conservation, but they arc the territory on which a model programme of the sustainable development should be realized. Zonation of the BR surface should be aimed to achievement of this goal, Slovak BR have a high forest percentage and they lic mostly in mountain areas. Uplands, highlands and even high-mountain landscapes (in the Tatry Biosphere Reserve) are common there. That fact also determinates an orientation of landscape-ecological research. A survey in the latest 30 years was focused on a basic inventory and on a stationary research of nature conservation, respectively,
   Only during the latest decade also floristically and zoologically orientated ecosystem analyses were done and the first complete landscape-ecological and forest-ecological projects were established (on the territory of BR East Carpathians, BR Tatry Mts and BR Pol'ana Mts).
   A final goal of the landscape-ecological research on the territory of BR should be to evaluate and to quantify of natural and social potentials of landscape, its carrying capacity and to load some types of landscape with those man activities which should not destroy any ecosystems and so any irreversible changes should not be recorded in landscapes.

AB The problems associated with the environment have long been looked upon and processed as the problems of natural science and technologies. The measures of technical character served as strategies for lowering the effect of the identified harmful influences on the environment. The growing and better understanding of the connections in the environment has brought and supports the thesis that "the global environmental crisis" is actually "the crisis of society" (Kruse-Graumann, 1998), This crisis is evident in relation to man and his environment, i.e. in various types of behaviour, actions of individuals and groups, communities and countries, and their cumulative effect leads to significant changes even to the destruction of the existential foundations for life (animals, plants, people) on the Earth, The object of current efforts is, not only in science, the change of the relation man - the environment and the development of the new forms of social activity, which would finally lead to the sustainability of life conditions.

AB The concept of long-term ecological research in the Tatra National Park (TANAP) has its roots in the late Fiftieth. In remnants of natural forest were established plots of 0.5 ha area. Besides detailed forest inventory data were collected on ground vegetation, soil, geology, climate and biotic and abiotic factors determining forest status. Fast forest disintegration, especially those natural, in the Eightieth required systematic research and monitoring of forest health. Regular network of 2x2 km was derived from National ICP Forest network. As a consequence of long-term pollution pressure on mountain forest and warm and dry summers in the early Ninetieth insect outbreaks caused large-scale dieback especially in nature reserves. Management of National Park accepted strategy to act. Philosophy of managing forest ecosystems is to reduce future potential environmental risks. New management strategy stressing forest sustainability, biodiversity protection, and stability improvement requires new role of research and monitoring. Quickly and easily gathered and analyzed data should serve also as a planning and control tool to verify mostly ecological and environmental functioning of the Tatra's forest. Our paper describes methods of collecting and interpretation of results on the example of larch - spruce forest community gained from both long term and current research plots.

AB Landscape structure of Slovakia was assessed by application of CORINE land cover database. Inner heterogeneity of the individual land cover classes was analyzed by representation and nature of vegetation formations. This indicator along with natural, and especially geo-relief conditions made possible to estimate eco-stabilizing properties of the individual types of landscape structure in the context of their harmonious functioning. Landscape structure was divided by share of self-regulating properties and demand of societal regulation to three basic groups. Comparison of satellite data from the 1970's and 1990's brought information about landscape changes. Analysis of changes of landscape structure presented the the development and assessment of key landscape types in the context of sustainability. From the viewpoint of strategic decision-making and planning it is necessary to control the landscape changes and to plan the inputs into the environment and regeneration of renewable resources. This contribution was part of the information source for the preparation of the National Strategy of Sustainable Development in the Slovak Republic.

AB High-mountain environment becomes gradually the attractive place for various forms of the investments. Naturally, that is not a new (neither unexpected) trend. The specific, and simultaneously the weak feature of the Tatra Mts is their insular position, since they have no equivalent from north, cast, and even from west. Among the adverse factors belongs also a relatively small area of the mountains, especially the valley systems that arc generally the most attacked by humans, due to their accessibility and hiking possibilities. The Tatra Mts lie in the field of view and interest of two gradually developing post-socialist countries (Poland and Slovakia). They have already prepared plans and particular projects for an intensive development of tourism in this area. Business and political lobby groups both latently and clearly manifest their interest in commercial utilisation of the Tatra Mts. In the paper we mention the significance of geomorphologic research and its applications for more worthwhile landscape-ecological analysis, synthesis, planning, and control of the landscape environment utilisation. Especially in the high-mountain landscape, close to timberline, the georelief attributes (static and dynamic) belong to the main limiting factors for human activity. A natural hazard assessment of actual or potential processes requires existing knowledge about the activity (intensity) of the process, procured either by direct observations (measurements) or by using simplified models combined with aerial or space photograph analysis. The measured (or calculated) parameters should be processed into a database information system. The evaluating process includes analyse of defined spatial units (morphodynamic systems), which is based on two types of criteria: criteria resulting from the human demands and interests (and conversely impacts, influences etc.), and criteria resulting from the proper dynamics of natural processes (and influences of natural conditions on each process). The hazard assessment in high-mountain area is often complicated by the risks related with the concrete estimation of losses and also casualties. Nevertheless, it becomes a component of the indicators for sustainable utilisation of natural resources.

AB The sustainable development of countryside requires an interconnection of the interests concerning social and economic development with the interests of environmental protection. At the same time, we may suppose that the current way of management in the landscape leading to environmental degradation and to the decrease in natural resources can hardly be a basis for sustainable economic development. In the Slovak conditions, mountain and submountain landscape ecosystems provide more cases of unsuitable management with natural resources. Regards rural areas, there exists a significant interrelation between economic activities and the quality of the environment. This interrelation should be reflected also with the creation of plans for the development of countryside. As an example of the inter-relation between the development of the country and the creation of plans we used a concrete model territory of the Sobotiste which is a wonderful example of the white-carpatian "kopanitsee" settlement.

AB Soil carbon is a major determinant of sustainability of agricultural systems and changes can occur in both total and active or labile C pools. The measurements of soil organic matter (SOM) changes under various forms of land use are needed for the development of sustainable systems. Soil organic matter quality was assessed by HA:FA ratios determined by two fractional methods (Tyurin's in modification Ponomareva-Plotnikova and by Kononova-Belchikova method) and by the calculation of Carbon Pool Index (CPI) and Lability Index (LI), these were used to calculate a Carbon Management Index (CMI). These parameters were determined and assessed in arable soil (two sites - on upland and colluvial foot slope) and in forest soil (National Nature Reserve) in locality Bab. Analyses of paired samples (cropped and uncropped soil) have shown high difference in total and labile carbon content, and in quality of SOM caused by intensive cultivation. We observed a decline in CPI as influence of erosion processes and cultivation, a greater decline in LI and hence a decline in CMI. Labile carbon and the CMI can be used effectively to monitor the rate of change in soil carbon.

AB The Aggtelek National Park is situated in Northern Hungary. Thus, from the North, the National Park has joint border with the Slovak Karst Protected Landscape Area in the Slovak Republic. Considering the geology, landscape geography and cultural history of the region, these two protected areas form an integral unit and both were declared as biosphere reserves in 1979 (UNESCO's Man and Biosphere Program). The area of the Aggtelck National Park has being protected by law since 1978 and was declared as a National Park in 1985. The caves of the Slovak Karst and the Aggtelck Karst were inscribed in the UNESCO's World Heritage List in 1995. In our presentation we investigate the problems of the land use types of the Aggtelck National Park with special regard to the sustainable silviculture. The presentation shows a planning method which is based on forestry as well as ecological factors, and applies Arc/Info GIS software.

AB The paper deals with the issue of sustainable development in three territories with important natural-landscape and cultural landscape values (Lower Morava river region, Tatras region, and Eastern Carpathians region). In all three cases the protected areas constitute parts of the regions studied. Reflections about the social and economic dimension of sustainable development resulted in the analysis and comparison of recent situation on the basis of subjective estimates by its population. The research (questionnaire technique) was focused on perception of environmental problems, perception of community's milieu, estimation of the social infrastructure accessibility and quality, willingness of inhabitants to contribute to sustainable development, and on the evaluation of the opinion about the programme of economically, socially and environmentally balanced (i.e. sustainable) development of the community,
   The analysis of perception, evaluation and expectations shows some similarities and numerous dissimilarities. Partly they reflect objective situation and needs in the regions, On the other hand they are also influenced by the level of environmental awareness, diffusion of innovation and experiences in the field of community life participation. The paper is concluded with the list of the most important challenges for protected areas from the sustainability perspective.

AB In rural development in the Slovak Republic there arc common issues and development possibilities. In rural settlements we can find out strong rural areas with a high potential for recreational activities and high potential of human resources with good educational level. On the other hand there is a lack of local employment opportunities. Many of jobs in the primary sector have been lost and the same is happening in the secondary sector. It is very necessary to start with the local business activities, connected with the rural development plan. To elaborate the plan of development is one of the assumptions for social and economic development in rural environment. This plan involves many measures, one of them should be regaagriculture enterpriseed as a development of tourism potential with activities as eco-tourism and rural-tourism development and social infrastructure improvement.

AB Pesticides have a role in public health as part of sustainable integrated mosquito management. Other components of such management include surveillance, source reduction or prevention, biological control, repellents, traps, and pesticide-resistance management. We assess the future use of mosquito control pesticides in view of niche markets, incentives for new product development, Environmental Protection Agency registration, the Food Quality Protection Act, and improved pest management strategies for mosquito control.

AB Six U.S. trends are explored that may change how transportation systems and resources are used: changing demographics; questions about the future of highway infrastructure and maintenance; greater interest in alternative means of transportation; growth of telecommunications technologies; movement toward "access to services" rather than "ownership of goods"; and renewed interest in urban living. It is believed that shared, small, battery-powered electric cars can provide high-quality, cost-effective mobility to replace trips made in conventional cars, offer a viable alternative for changing lifestyles resulting from these trends, and move our global transportation systems toward sustainability. Although this paper is primarily intended to stimulate discussion and suggest future avenues for research, descriptions and examples of shared-car systems using small electric cars that complement the six trends are included. Although the current effort has focused on North America, thinking is beginning to expand internationally because a sustainable transportation system is a global necessity. Any two of the six trends could well cause an evolution in the U.S. transportation system, but all six combined certainly will. Similar trends can be found in other developed countries. Developing countries face even more severe transportation problems due to lack of resources to solve these problems as they arise.

AB The paper discusses the suitability of the sunken courtyard concept in the desert climate using Kuwait as a case study. It investigates three issues related to the concept: its ability to modify the harsh climate and to reduce the energy consumption, its construction costs compared to aboveground building, and the occupants' attitude towards living underground. The results are shown to be all positive and will be significant to the policy-makers, designers, and homeowners. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Turkey is an energy importing country, more than half of the energy requirement has been supplied by imports. Domestic oil and lignite reserves are limited and lignites are characterised by high ash, sulfur and moisture content. Due to increasing energy consumption, air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern for future in the country. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions for sustainable energy development and environmental pollution prevention in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. Because of this and the fact that it has limited fossil fuel resources, a gradual shift from fossil fuels to renewables seems to be serious and the sole alternative for Turkey. This article presents a review of the present energy situation and sustainability, technical and economical potential of renewable energy sources and future policies for energy sector in Turkey. Throughout the paper several problems relating to energy sources, environment and sustainable development are discussed from both current and future perspectives.

AB By the end of the 21st century, according to United Nations projections, the number of people on the earth is likely to have approximately doubled. How can a world of 10 to 12 billion people be provided with adequate supplies of energy, cleanly, safely and substantially? There is a growing consensus that renewable energy sources will be a very important part of the answer. The growing interest in "renewables" has been prompted in part, by increasing concern over the pollution, resource depletion and possible climate change implications of our continuing use of conventional fossil and nuclear fuels. But recent technological developments have also improved the cost-effectiveness of many of the renewables. making their economic prospects look increasingly attractive. it describes the achievement and progress made in hydropower, biomass conversion, geothermal, solar thermal technology, wind energy conversion and the increasing usage of photovoltaics. It is evident that global warming is setting in and is going to change the climate as well as the terrain of many countries unless drastic measures are taken. The Kyoto meeting emphasized the importance of limiting CO, emissions and to abide by some form of agreement to reduce emissions. Present study concludes that renewable energy penetration into the energy market is much faster than was expected in recent years and by 2030, 15-20 percent of our prime energy will be met by renewable energy.

DE liberalisation of the electricity market; sustainable development
AB In Switzerland like in many other countries, political decision makers face the two-fold challenge to adapt current electricity market regulation to achieve different goals at the same time: market liberalisation and sustainable development. The general trend of the liberalisation of the electricity markets implies radical structural changes of the electricity industry as well as of the institutional rules for its regulation. But how can the overall goal of sustainable development be brought in line with the ongoing discussion on market (de)regulation? After reflecting on the objectives of the liberalisation process, we analyse the political acceptance of different instruments to achieve environmental goals in a liberalised electricity market; the analysis is based on empirical data from an inquiry among 250 key players of Swiss energy policy. We compare these outcomes to theoretical (economic) insights on 'first-best', 'second-best' and 'third-best' solutions, and we conclude with a closer look at perspectives for a future energy supply structure in Switzerland.

SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English

DE China; energy; urban form; urban planning
AB Chinese cities are experiencing major environmental effects from fossil fuel-based energy consumption for mainly residential and, increasingly, urban transportation uses. Community energy management (CEM) is a sustainable energy strategy which looks at how purposely shaping the built environment and designing urban services in consideration of energy production, distribution and use could affect both the long-term demand for energy and the type of energy supplied. This study explores what CEM is in a Chinese context by analysing trends in land-use planning, urban transportation and residential energy, and then suggests CEM strategies that would be appropriate in directing urban development towards a more sustainable energy path. A spreadsheet model is used to evaluate aggregate energy-related emissions in the year 2015 that result from two alternative scenarios of urban growth throughout China. The model focuses on how energy demand, residential energy technology penetration and transportation mode choices are affected by factors of density and mix of use in neighbourhood development. Results from this exercise suggest that China can achieve urban residential and transportation emissions reductions of approximately 14% for CO2, 10% for SO2, 40% for NOx and 14% for particulate emissions in 2015 by adopting certain aspects of GEM. Issues around the implementation of CEM are also addressed in this study by examining key institutional and policy issues involved in land-use planning, site and building design, alternative energy supply and transportation management. Recommendations and implementation strategies are suggested. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB 'Energy auditing' as a technique for obtaining a 'snapshot' of the energy flows in a city or urban conurbation is discussed in the context of meeting national and international targets for CO2 emissions abatement. An audit methodology is presented which addresses the key questions: Who needs to be involved in the audit? How should the city or conurbation be divided? What data are required? How might these data be obtained and then analysed? Which are the areas of significant consumption? A basis for setting local targets for reducing future energy consumption and CO2 emissions is presented. The scope for auditing major cities and conurbations in the United Kingdom is identified with reference to implementing Local Agenda 21 and satisfying CO2 emissions reduction targets.

DE coastal zone management; fluid inversions; interface structure; Mahanadi
   delta; saline/freshwater
AB Saline/fresh water interface structure is one of the most important and basic hydrogeological parameter that needs to be estimated for studies related to coastal zone management, well-field design and understanding saline water intrusion mechanism/processes. The success and stability of a groundwater structure in a coastal region depend upon an accurate estimate of interface structure between saline and fresh water zones, aquifer-aqui-clude boundaries and their lateral continuities and the interstitial water qualities of aquifers. Self-potential and resistivity logs provide a reasonably good basis for such estimates and for sustainable development of fresh groundwater resources. The interface depth structure for the Mahanadi delta region, as obtained and interpreted through self-potential and resistivity logs, provides a fairly clear picture of the regional extensions and boundaries of aquifers, aquicludes and interstitial water quality; patterns. Aquifers in the northern sector of the basin and within the framework of Birupa and Mahanadi are characterized by an interface depth range that varies between 40 and 280 m below ground level (bgl) with brackish water on the top underlain by freshwater aquifers. The aquifers in the southern sector within the framework of Khatjori/Devi and Koyakhai/Daya/Kushbhadra/Bhargavi are characterised by an interface depth range that varies from 10 to 120 m with freshwater aquifers near the surface face underlain by saline, brackish water aquifers. The inversion of these major fluid systems appears to have taken place over a narrow zone between : Mahanadi and Khatjori tributaries, possibly over a wide subsurface ridge with separate basin characteristics.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Multistakeholder collaboration in the environmental realm has been increasing steadily over the past decade. This trend is responding to several stimuli, including dissatisfaction with current regulatory regimes, a liberal economic climate emphasizing global competitiveness and short-term returns, and the growing roles of the business and nongovernmental organization sectors in the environmental policy arena. This paper grows out of ethnographic research conducted between 1994 and 1998 with four environmental partnerships in Europe and the United States. The research found all of these partnerships to be marked by practices of conflict minimization and diffusion. Drawing upon illustrative data from one of these case studies, a European Union level initiative aimed at enabling sustainable development in Europe, the paper asks why this was the case, especially given the diverse political and economic interests at stake and the history of contentious relations between the sectors in other venues. Employing a theoretical perspective highlighting the sociohistoric factors involved in these processes, the paper suggests that this proclivity toward nonconfrontational behavior stems in part from two sources: a prominent cultural model that conceptualizes the partnership process as fundamentally nonconflictual in nature, and the promotion of the discourse of ecological modernization over other competing discourses. The paper explores some of the implications of this finding and concludes that environmental partnerships characterized by such nonconfrontational practices risk inadvertently encouraging the delegitimization of conflictual approaches to environmental action and engendering a retreat from radical thinking and innovative environmental solutions.

AB Initiatives in the Neponset, Ipswich, and Sudbury-Assabet-Concord watersheds highlight how watershed-scale innovation in engaging nongovernment participants is influenced, but not dominated, by the statewide program, the Massachusetts Watershed Initiative. The presence or absence of three elements-external support, process, and issue-and the order in which they occur, shape the viability of collaborative watershed-scale management initiatives. External support includes providing personnel or funding from outside an initiative. Process is the interaction among individuals undertaking watershed-wide policy development and/or implementation. An issue is an attention-requiring concern, Vital to a watershed, that can most effectively be addressed by a coordinated strategy among different parties. A process generated by an issue is sustainable and amenable to enhancement through external support. The contribution of external support is most apparent when outside assistance is provided after an issue has crystallized into clear problem needs that can be addressed through specific research projects or implementation activities. Process is central in shaping issues, utilizing external support, and generating management results. The outcomes of voluntary processes in the three watershed initiatives highlight how the evolution of the Massachusetts Watershed initiative leads to, and depends upon, the development of watershed-scale initiatives.

AB Land use and land cover changes are a major source of environmental degradation and therefore a serious issue in sustainable development studies and in the integrated assessment of environmental problems. In an attempt to understand part of the complexity of land use change we here aim to explore the ways in which economists deals with the land use issue. we argue that space is one of the forgotten items in economics. Economists often seem to ignore high-resolution spatial dynamics either because they are not considered as an important feature of the problem or out of habit. It seems as though there is a trade-off between spatial resolution and human behaviour in current applications. Certain types of models are capable of capturing the spatial complexity of urban and regional areas, for instance, by using cellular automata. Other types of land use models clearly have shortcomings where it concerns spatial detail. Dynamic modelling approaches do not guarantee a high spatial resolution.
   We propose to give more attention to agent based modelling as this type of modelling provides aspecific connection between processes on micro level and macro-level spatial structures.

AB Effluent irrigation systems are engineering systems that have been identified as an attractive option for effluent disposal in Australia for environmental pollution control and resource reuse. As engineering systems, they should be designed based on established engineering procedures. At the moment, the systems are designed mainly on the guidelines issued by individual states in Australia, which are general engineering practices. However, the guidelines are quite different in different states. There are no generalised and commonly acceptable design procedures available for reference. This paper reports a generic calculation model for effluent irrigation design, and a decision support system called Computer-Aided Design of Effluent (CAD-Effluent) that was developed based on the model. The model can accommodate different methods of estimating sustainable effluent loading rates such as the methods specified in guidelines, simulation models that describe the pollutant transformation processes in soils, or other empirical methods. The application of CAD-Effluent is demonstrated using Queensland guidelines and climate data from thirty-one locations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A simple dynamic model (CBUDGET) was developed to quantify long-term carbon (C) dynamics in croplands. By using independent datasets (on continuous wheat) from the Waite Permanent Rotation Trial (Australia) and from Northwest Ohio, the tests of its performance resulted in R-2 values of 0.85 and 0.80, respectively, between observed and simulated values. Our model suggests that the rate of residual C addition into the soil is the primary factor that controls soil organic carbon (SOC) storage for Ohio croplands under continuous corn, wheat and oats for the period 1866-1996 and continuous soybean for the period of 1924-1996. The interaction of CO2-fertilization and a temperature increase of 0.5 degreesC decreased mean SOC levels for the selected crops over the same periods. A multiple linear regression model (MLR) relating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to population growth, affluence and energy intensity with an R-2 of 0.99 indicates the significance of underlying causes of anticipated climate change. The MLR model thus serves to capture a more complete picture of anthropogenic sources of global climate change than considering agricultural activities only in exploring locally and regionally mitigative and preventive measures towards global climatic stability.

AB The on-site and off-site impacts of land degradation, particularly in the form of soil erosion, pose a serious problem in many developing countries. In Sri Lanka, the implementation of wide-ranging policy reforms and institutional changes designed to move the country toward an outward oriented market economy, have strengthened concerns about environmental degradation and the sustainability of the country's natural resource base. The environmental impact of many of the policy reforms and economic changes are deter-mined by complex economy-wide, inter-sectoral interactions. A computable general equilibrium model incorporating soil erosion is developed to analyse the impacts of various policy reforms in Sri Lanka. Our analysis establishes three important results. First, economic losses from soil erosion in Sri Lanka are substantial. Second. trade liberalisation reforms increase national income and marginally reduce soil erosion. Third, while trade liberalisation has a positive impact on soil erosion, complementary policies which directly target soil erosion, such as tax/subsidy incentives, are needed to minimise social losses from soil erosion, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper discusses alternative approaches to modelling economy-environment systems from the perspective of sustainable development. We distinguish between systems' dynamic methods and economic approaches, including input-output (I/O) models. We then discuss the structure of two models constructed for Scotland. Firstly, a hierarchical, dynamic model is used to look at long-term trends in population, resource use and pollution. Secondly, an environmentally extended I/O model is used to estimate the effects of economic policy and structural change on pollution levels and output. We conclude with some comments on the possible future developments in modelling sustainable development. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The United States Department of Energy environmental restoration program faces difficult decisions about the levels of cleanup to be achieved at its many contaminated sites and has acknowledged the need for considering intergenerational equity in its decision making. Intergenerational equity refers to the fairness of access to resources across generations. Environmental restoration cleanup levels can have unintended and unfair consequences for future generations' access to resources. The potentially higher costs associated with using low, non-risk-based cleanup levels for remediation may divert funding from other activities that could have a greater beneficial impact on future generations. Low, non-risk-based cleanup levels could also result in more damage to the nation's resources than would occur if a higher cleanup level were used. The loss or impairment of these resources could have an inequitable effect on future generations. However, intergenerational inequity could arise if sites are not completely restored and if access to and use of natural and cultural resources are unfairly limited as a result of residual contamination.
   In addition to concerns about creating possible intergenerational inequities related to selected cleanup levels, the tremendous uncertainties associated with sites and their restoration can lead site planners to rely on stewardship by default. An ill-conceived stewardship program can contribute to intergenerational inequity by limiting access to resources while passing on risks to future generations and not preparing them for those risks. This paper presents a basic model and process for designing stewardship programs that can achieve equity among generations.

   and collective identity in Britain
SO ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE black women; difference; collective identity; social movements
ID SOCIAL-MOVEMENT THEORY; RESOURCE MOBILIZATION
AB This article analyses the (re) construction of black identity as a multiracial signifier(1) shared by African, Asian and Caribbean women in Britain, from the framework of recent social movement theory. The collective identity approach calls attention to naming as a strategic element of collective action, but has overlooked the experiences of black women at the intersection of multiple systems of oppression. A focus on the process of constructing black womanhood allows us to move beyond static and unidimensional notions of identity to question how and why gendered racialized boundaries are created and maintained. I argue that multiracial blackness should be viewed as an oppositional identity, strategically invoked by black women activists in order to mobilize collective action. Drawing on everyday theorizing by black women, the article examines the shift from the policing of authenticity claims, to a more open and fluid collectivity, and suggests that explicit interrogations of identity are a prerequisite for effective and sustainable alliances between diverse movement participants.

AB Microspore response of three- way cross maize hybrid genotype 3AL/95 ( Zea mays L.) was studied under simplified isolation and culture conditions. Fertile plant production was achieved through abundant plant regeneration. As a total, microspores of 160 tassels were inoculated and five sustainable microspore derived callus cultures (SMC) were obtained. Hybrid seeds (ML SC), which were produced by crossing of regenerates from two SMCs, gave rise to subsequent vigorous and fertile progeny. The response of the 3AL/95 and ML SC microspores was studied in three liquid culture media in order to improve the early viability of microspores. The mN6M medium provided better survival of cultured microspores (p = 5%) than the ppN6M/89 and the YPM-G media. The pH 5.8 in mN6M medium revealed significant increase (p = 1%) in microspore viability as compared to pH 3.0. The ML SC microspores showed higher viability (30%) on the first day of culture in the mN(6)M than those of the 3AL/95 (19%) but without improved rate of callus formation and plant regeneration.

AB Common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.), an important food crop in Europe, America, Africa and Asia, is thought to fix only small amounts of atmospheric nitrogen. It contributes significantly to the sustainability of traditional cropping systems because of the predominance of small-scale farmers who cultivate beans in those areas. The objectives of this work were to evaluate bush bean varieties under common agronomic cropping systems and to evaluate breeding lines under low N-fertility sole cropping and intercropping systems. The purpose of the study was to characterize the genotype and cropping system's variability in symbiotic and plant characters and to identify the most suitable genotypes to establish an effective symbiosis with indigenous strains of Rhizobium. No significant differences among the bush bean varieties evaluated under typical fertilization practices were observed for N-2-fixation and plant traits except for seed nitrogen. Significant differences among the bean lines studied under low N-fertilization conditions were detected for plant growth, plant component and N-2-fixation traits. A significant interaction of bean genotype x cropping system was found for number of nodules per plant and nodule moisture on the bush bean varieties studied, and for days to emergence, days to flowering, end of flowering, shoot length, root dry weight and shoot nitrogen on the bean lines evaluated. Nodulation parameters were correlated positively with the yield components, shoot and root parts and duration of flowering, and correlated negatively with seed crude protein, pod and seed dimensions and seed dry weight. These observations indicate that it may be possible to increase both the symbiotic N-2-fixation and seed yield through plant breeding.

AB The procedures required to produce genetically transformed cassava were developed and are now in place in three laboratories in the USA and Europe. Future implementation and sustainability of transgenic technologies for the agronomic improvement of cassava will depend, however, on transferring these capabilities to locations where cassava has an important socioeconomic niche. If successful, such countries can apply the technology towards their particular needs. Training scientists from the developing countries in the transgenic biotechnologies is of primary importance in this effort. There are, however, many other factors including the availability of laboratory supplies, equipment, suitably experienced support staff, sufficient funding levels and biosafety considerations, which must be addressed and put in place before a transgenic program can be fully implemented in a given country. A transgenic capability is being transferred from the International Laboratory for Tropical Agricultural Biotechnology (ILTAB), USA, to the University of Zimbabwe. Three southern African cassava varieties were induced to form embryogenic suspension cultures at ILTAB and have been transferred to Zimbabwe. These tissues are presently being used as the basis of genetic transformation programs in both laboratories. Problems encountered in the transfer process as well as possible solutions aimed at adapting the available protocols will be presented.

AB Because of the explosive increase in world population, a sufficient food supply must be achieved by varietal improvement in the major cereal crops including rice. It is expected that new in vitro techniques in combination with conventional breeding methods may effectively raise the yield potential. On the other hand, there are many environmental problems to be solved world-wide such as, global warming, environmental pollution, ecological destruction, reduction in water supplies and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to rapidly develop new varieties for the future combining of higher yield potential with excellent grain quality, and resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses for the promotion of sustainable agriculture. Although many efforts have been made to introduce useful traits from wild species to cultivated rice via hybridization, it is still difficult to overcome breeding barriers such as cross incompatibility and hybrid sterility and inviability in practical breeding. Now in vitro techniques are going to make it possible to use genetic manipulation and cell culture and fusion techniques to speed up the breeding process. For sustainable agriculture, it is important to utilize the useful genes from alien species. For this purpose, asymmetric protoplast fusions have already been used successfully to transfer disease resistance in Brassica napus. In this experiment, a high level of resistance to the rice blast disease was transferred from wild species through asymmetric fusions. It is also noted that manipulation of cytoplasmic genomes is possible through asymmetric fusions as shown in the induction of new cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS).

AB Many spontaneous and a large number of induced mutants that show altered nodulation pattern have been isolated in pea, soybean, common bean, faba bean, chickpea, groundnut and pigeonpea. Available information on nodulation mutants in these crops is summarised. The importance of nodulation mutants in basic studies on plant-microbe symbiotic interactions, nitrogen fixation and breeding of cultivars with higher yield and nitrogen fixation rate are examined. The nodulation mutants, after inoculation with specific bacterial strains or a number of different strains, show either: no nodulation (nod-), few nodules (nod+/-), ineffective nodulation (fix-), hyper nodulation (nod++) or hypernodulation even in the presence of otherwise inhibitory nitrate levels (nts). No spontaneous hypernodulation or nts mutants have been found, all have been induced in independent experiments using different cultivars of pea, soybean and common bean after mutagenising seeds. Most nodulation mutants show monogenic recessive inheritance, though semi-dominant and dominant inheritance is also reported. Nodule number is controlled by a process known as autoregulation; hypernodulating mutants show relaxed autoregulation. By grafting shoots of hypernodulating soybean mutant on normal nodulating soybean, mungbean and hyacinth bean, presence of a common, translocatable signal has been shown. Nodulation mutants have contributed to the understanding of the genetic regulation of host-symbiont interactions, nodule development and N fixation. Initially, the hypernodulating mutants were found to be poor in yield. Using the induced hypernodulating mutant, a new soybean cultivar `Nitrobean 60', has been released in Australia. This cultivar is reported to have given 15% higher yield over cv. `Bragg,' and contributed a higher amount of fixed N to the following cereal crop in rotation. Prospects of using the nodulation mutants in developing grain legume cultivars that combine high yield with high residual N, within the bioenergetic constraints, for developing sustainable cropping systems are examined.

AB Increased use of forest resources and a shrinking forestland base threaten the sustainability of forest genetic resources and highlight the importance of conservation and sustainable management of these resources. As forest trees are normally the keystone species of forest ecosystems, their continued existence is essential for many floral and faunal associations of these ecosystems. Major concepts, challenges and opportunities for conservation of forest genetic resources are briefly discussed in this paper. The major challenges include population decline and population structure changes due to forest removal and conversion of forest land to other uses, forest fragmentation, forestry practices, climate change, disease conditions, introduced pests, atmospheric pollution, and introgressive hybridization. Developing scientifically sound conservation strategies, maintaining minimum viable population sizes, and deployment of genetically engineered organisms represent other important challenges in conservation. The usefulness of various biochemical and molecular genetic markers, adaptive traits, and genetic diversity measures for developing conservation strategies for in situ and ex situ genetic resource conservation are also discussed. Major opportunities for conservation of forest genetic resources include: use of molecular genetic markers and adaptive traits for developing conservation strategies; in situ conservation through natural reserves, protected areas, and sustainable forest management practices; ex situ conservation through germplasm banks, common garden archives, seed banks, DNA banks, and tissue culture and cryopreservation; incorporation of disease, pest, and stress tolerance traits through genetic transformation; plantation forestry; and ecological restoration of rare or declining tree species and populations. Forest genetic resource conservation and resource use should be considered complementary rather than contradictory to each other.

AB The Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, is an introduced pest on Terceira, one of nine islands in the Azorean Archipelago. Research conducted on Terceira indicates that entomopathogenic nematodes in the families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae provide good to excellent control of Japanese beetle larvae, but the species that have been evaluated are not native to the Azores. An efficacious species that is native to the archipelago might provide increased capabilities for persisting and recycling in Azorean soil and weather conditions. Surveys on the islands of Terceira and Santa Maria resulted in the isolation of two Heterorhabditis strains (Sao Mateus and Praia Formosa) with good larvicidal activity for P. japonica. Initial bioassays conducted with Steinernema glaseri (Steiner) originally from North Carolina against P. japonica third instar larvae and pupae produced LC50 values of 3.2 x 10(5) infective juveniles (lJs)/m(2) and 0.9 x 10(5) IJs/m(2), respectively. Comparative bioassays of the native isolates and S. glaseri against P. japonica revealed similar larvicidal activity. The LC(50)s of the Sao Mateus and Praia Formosa isolates against third instar larvae were 3.64 x 10(5) and 4.44 x 10(5) IJs/m(2), respectively. The LC50 of S. glaseri ranged from 3.2 to 5.5 x 10(5) IJs/m(2). The higher larvicidal activity of the Azorean Heterorhabditis isolates for P. japonica indicates that native nematodes are as effective as S. glaseri. Heterorhabditid species also have demonstrated ability for persistence and apparent recycling under conditions where sustainable control of this introduced pest is needed. Studies comparing the dispersal behavior of the Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar Sao Mateus isolate with that of S. glaseri and native and exotic strains of Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) revealed that the H. bacteriophora isolate demonstrated a greater propensity to disperse than other strains in the presence or absence of P. japonica larvae. In the presence of a host, a greater proportion of H. bacteriophora and S. glaseri dispersed than either of the two S. carpocapsae strains.

AB A computer simulation model was developed to investigate strategies for control of the parasitic weed species of Orobanche. The model makes use of data from published literature and predicts infestation levels in a dynamic and deterministic way. It is predicted that sustainable control of the parasite can only be achieved by reducing the soil seed bank to levels of 1000-2000 seeds m(-2) and maintaining it at that level in subsequent years. When cultural control methods such as hand weeding, trap/lcatch cropping, delayed planting, resistant cultivars and solarization were considered individually, a relatively high level of effectiveness was required to contain the soil seed bank. An integrated approach with a selection of appropriate cultural methods is therefore recommended for further testing and validation in the field. The simulations demonstrate the importance of preventing new seeds entering the soil seed bank and that although reducing the soil seed bank may not increase yield for the first few years, it will ultimately increase production.

   transition experience of the Czech Republic and Hungary
SO FINANCE A UVER

DT Article
DE transition; macroeconomic stabilization; corporate restructuring
AB The author highlights the striking difference between the economic transition of the Czech Republic and Hungary. These two countries, roughly of the same size and same level of development, have traveled on markedly diverging paths toward relative prosperity. After the velvet revolution of 1989, the Czech Republic began to introduce a comprehensive and consistent package of macroeconomic stabilization coupled with voucher privatization. Hungary - not having experienced a revolution, rather a change of the ruling elite - was not ready to make substantial macroeconomic adjustment, but did implement a supply-side shock therapy toward corporate restructuring. The strategy of the. Czech government was widely regarded as successful, while the Hungarian one was considered as flamed. The situation had changed by the mid-1990s, however, when Hungary was forced to undertake comprehensive macro-financial stabilization, which, in turn, has paved the way for high-level, sustainable, and export-led growth since. The Czech Republic paid its Dries for postponing corporate restructuring, but there have been important reforms since 1997 directed at accelerating modernization in both the real and the financial sectors. The pattern of macro versus micro adjustment was, therefore, quite the opposite in the two countries.

DE European Union; convergence; real exchange rate; price level; transition
AB The paper provides an introduction to essays published in this volume, which focus on nominal and real convergence in transition countries. The paper is based on the idea that the process of convergence can, to a large extent, be viewed via developments in real exchange rates. Key issues associated with real exchange rate developments in transition countries are defined and the consequent challenges for policy makers are discussed. A trend towards real appreciation has been observed in the data since the outset of transition, though it has slowed in the past two years. Now it appears that the most economically successful transition countries are turning away from the trend via the inflation differential and toward a stronger reliance on nominal exchange rate changes. Policy makers will be challenged by the issue as to what level of real appreciation is sustainable, i.e., compatible with sufficient external competitiveness and macroeconomic stability.

For the purpose of this analysis, fisheries may be defined flexibly as entities with a broad scope. such as all the fisheries in a lake, or with narrower scope, such as those in a single jurisdiction, target species, gear type or vessel. A set of fisheries may be compared, or the time trajectories of individual fisheries may be plotted. Attributes are chosen to reflect sustainability within each discipline, and although intended to remain tired Fur all analyses, may be refined or substituted as improved information becomes available. Ordinations of sets of attributes are performed using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) followed by scaling and rotation. Ordinations are anchored by fixed reference points that simulate the best and worst possible fisheries using extremes of the attribute scores, while other anchors secure the ordination in a second axis normal to the first. Randomly scored reference points act as anchors and define significant differences. Separate RAPFISH ordinations may be performed in ecological, economic, ethical, social and technological disciplines: a further evaluation field expresses compliance with the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to estimate errors, while the leverage of each attribute on scores can be estimated with a stepwise procedure. Status results may be expressed on a scale from 0 to 100%, and scores from several fields may be combined in kite diagrams to facilitate comparison of fisheries or fisheries constructed to represent alternative policies. Some validations of the methodology are presented. using simulated fishery data. Results from published work using RAPFISH are reviewed briefly, along with prospects for fut ther improvements to the technique. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The intensification of muscle growth in domestic animal species - especially in turkey and swine - is accompanied by increasing problems with meat quality. Thus, research activities are required dealing with physiological processes of muscle growth to provide a basis for quality assurement in breeding and meat production. This is one important way to reduce the deteriorating effects of stress susceptibility on meat quality, reproductive traits and losses. The elimination of undesired traits of product quality is very time consuming even in modern breeding systems. Therefore, genotypic effects on meat quality should rapidly be obeyed in the context of sustainable animal breeding.

AB Recent studies point to the promise of rain forest extraction for more sustainable rural development in Amazonia but often overlook important differences,within traditional communities in terms of relative economic reliance upon specific forest resources. This paper reports on a study of charcoal production among forest peasants in an Amazonian river community, near Iquitos, Peru. In-depth household interviews (n=36) provided information on household economic activity, demographic composition, and access to land, labor and capital as well as on the nature, role and economic importance of charcoal in the household economy. Our results indicate that peasant charcoal production - often cast as a rapacious, wasteful use of the forest - can provide significant cash income for forest peoples and high returns per hectare, particularly when integrated into swidden-fallow agroforestry systems, without causing notable forest destruction. Low returns to labor, however, limit prospects for peasants to prosper by charcoal production. Variations in household output of charcoal are explained by differential access to intra- and extra-household labor. Among those households most reliant upon charcoal, two subgroups are found - 'charcoal-dependent' households and 'charcoal-specialized' households - both of which rely on charcoal production, but for different reasons and with distinct outcomes. These two sub-groups are divided by differences in nonmarket mediated access to local land and labor. Clearly, to be successful, initiatives aimed at promoting rain forest conservation and management among 'resource-reliant' households must be informed by careful attention to the underlying conditions that give rise to differential rain forest reliance.

AB The goal of this study was to develop a method for analyzing and assessing multiple forest use from a forest conservation perspective and to test this method as a case study at a local forest management unit (Haliburton Forest & Wild Life Reserve Ltd., Ontario, Canada).
   The method adopts a model concept and consists of the definition of a target system for forest conservation, the design of a set of criteria and indicators, the assessment of indicator performance, and the formulation of action plans. Implementation of the method, the state of the forest, and the impact of multiple forest use are analyzed and assessed.
   The formulated target system for forest conservation contains the goal of integrated, sustainable and natural forest management; the objectives of protection of natural processes, naturalness and natural diversity; and operational targets. The development of the set of criteria and indicators including measurement units is mainly based on the concept of protection of natural processes, but is modified and extended.
   The examined forest management unit shows good to very good performance for most of the indicators. Overall, the state of the forest can be assessed as good to very good, with only minimal impact caused by the multiple forest use operation. The method is suitable for analyzing and assessing multiple forest use. It contributes to the evaluation of new forest management concepts and forest conservation assessment methods, and supports approaches of certification and criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management at the local level.

AB Improved utilization of underutilized timber species may offer increased opportunities on a global scale for both needed products and healthy, sustainable forests. Their effective use is an integral element in forest conservation. Processing of such species is a key factor and both processing technology and marketing are more important than is generally considered to bring adequate supplies into the product mix. The unused, or underutilized, part of the resource is usually larger and more extensive than that commonly used, amounting to as much as 90 percent of the forest by some estimates. The resource is highly diverse and processing will need to accommodate that diversity. Productivity and profitability are as essential as for the more commonly used resource. Sustainability of the forest is a pervasive criterion for species use. Advances in technology for using diverse species, groups of species, and mixtures of species provide new options to broaden the resource base. Marketing is a critical element in relating consumer needs to producer output. Achieving increased use of underutilized species means overcoming many obstacles. Chief among those is the fact that this woody biomass is generally not of the size, species, and quality currently being used in the industry. Also, there is usually no assured supply around which to develop economical conversion processes and marketing systems. Effective processing and use will require careful attention to productivity and profitability if it is also to maintain forest diversity and sustainability.

AB The present paper examines the efficiency of the current established criteria and indicators for sustainable development of the for est sector. The current system of criteria and indicators concentrates on the management aspects instead of objective setting. The current system is too complicated to be implemented and neglects the fact that sustainability cannot be achieved by a top-down approach but only by the people working on the ground at the local level. This paper presents a number of guidelines on the necessary steps to be taken in order to move towards what we call "a forest sector for sustainable development.".

AB Achieving a goal of sustainable forestry will probably take time as people agree on what sustainability means at the global, subcontinental, national, and regional scales. Comparing seven criteria of sustainable forestry with information at different scales suggests that the world could practice sustainable forestry, but there are currently imbalances in economic development, forest area change, harvesting and wood-use rates and purposes, and other factors that are impeding it. Different countries could adopt different policies and practices to help correct these imbalances. Until a globally agreed-upon set of policies and practices is established, each country will probably define its best efforts toward sustaining its "fair share" of the criteria. Managing large areas of forests for many values with some areas reserved in each forest type will probably be more ecologically, socially, and financially effective than having small areas of plantations supply the world's wood - and the rest of the world's forests set aside as reserves. Disseminating accurate information, addressing sustainability at different scales, addressing rural/urban lifestyles, increasing uses for the very abundant, environmentally sound wood, incorporating the other values into the economic system, and avoiding central planning are primary issues and challenges to sustainability. Technology, policies, and various organizations can be marshalled, and each organization can play a constructive, rewarding role.

TI From fur to fir: Lessons for the BC forest industry from the anti-fur
   campaign
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
DE boycotts; resource use
AB BC's forest industry is feeling internal and international pressure to change its practices, and there is an increasing move to certification, amidst debates about preferred certification modes. This reflects changes in the economies of many of Canada's rural and northern communities, which have traditionally been dependent upon natural resources, but are now coming under pressure from the global community - not only in economic terms, but in terms of social values. As demography changes, and with it, social and economic values, this pressure is Likely to continue. The Canadian North first felt such pressure as a result of the European boycott of the Newfoundland seal hunt, and then anti-trapping boycotts that have occurred periodically since then. These campaigns have had a profound effect on the lifestyles, cultures and sustainability of the northern communities. Over almost three decades, the government, non-government organizations and people of the North have had to learn to deal with and respond to these external campaigns that threaten them. The lessons they have learned about the nature of these campaigns could be useful to the province of British Columbia, which is now coming under increasing pressure from Europe and the US regarding its forestry practices. This paper outlines the evolution and characteristics of the international campaigns against sealing and trapping, as well as the experiences of northerners in dealing with them. It goes on to apply these lessons to the BC situation, with some recommendations for appropriate responses. Fundamentally, these campaigns reflect changing demographic and social characteristics and values in North America and Europe, and the changing relationship of people to natural resources, but they also raise questions about fair reflection of the variety of stakeholder interests in resource decision-making, and the limits on definition of "stakeholders.".

ID ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT
AB Adaptive management presupposes stronger links between scientists and forest managers in order to adapt research processes and findings to production activities. Partnerships between these two groups are starting to emerge in the forest sector in Quebec. However, local forest managers have not always had the occasion in the past to contribute to research processes. Moreover, scientists have not always had the opportunity to harmonize all their respective research projects at the local level. This research project was thus aimed at establishing a link between local forest managers and scientists in order to direct research projects towards local needs and concerns. The purpose of establishing this contact between local forest managers and scientists was to create opportunities for inter-disciplinary research projects. This experiment demonstrated that the roles and attitudes of scientists and forest managers still need to evolve in order to increase the chances for successful partnerships between these two groups. On the one hand, forest managers need to view research (1) as part of their daily activities and (2) as bringing benefit in the long-term. On the other hand scientists must (1) invest time in understanding what the forest managers are doing and (2) consider forest managers as equal partners with useful knowledge and skills in developing the research questions and protocols.

TI Developing financial autonomy in public hospitals in India: Rajasthan's

SO HEALTH POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE hospital autonomy; alternative financing schemes; India
AB In India's state-administered health care system, many government decision-makers are exploring the introduction or expansion of hospital autonomy as a means of improving the efficiency and financial sustainability of the overall public health care system. One initiative that has recently received a considerable amount of attention is the introduction of Medicare Relief Societies (MRS) in the state of Rajasthan. The societies are autonomous organizations that are formed with the objective of complementing and supplementing existing service provision in public hospitals. The state has provided incentives for the formation of MRS by relaxing state-imposed restrictions on the collection and use of revenue by hospitals, thereby encouraging the use of alternative financing mechanisms such as user-fee schemes and in-hospital pharmacies. The purpose of this article is to describe and critically evaluate Rajasthan's experience with MRS. Emphasis is placed on whether and how the introduction of these societies have influenced two key aspects of hospital autonomy - operations and management, and financing. Data for the study come from a survey of representatives from each of the 69 hospitals in Rajasthan that contain 100 or more beds. Information was collected on whether a society was operating within the hospital, the management of the society, the range of activities carried out, and the revenue and expenditures of each activity. The results are used to identify key strengths and weakness of the MRS initiative in Rajasthan, and how future hospital autonomy efforts can be strengthened. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Agricultural biodiversity adds value to crop, induces resistance, contributes enormously to human foodstuff, removes fear of genetic uniformity and ensure food security of the world. For these reasons, NIAB initiated a programme on collection, evaluation, and utilisation of agro-biodiversity related with wheat and wheat wild relatives. The focus of the programme was on the addition of stress tolerance from wild species to cultivated wheat. The objectives were if to have a permanent source of stress tolerant germplasm, ii) to facilitate availability of such germplasm for environment friendly, profitable and sustainable agriculture on stressed lands and iii) to ensure safety of biodiversity (through gene conservation) for the stability of future agriculture. During 1998-2001, we tested wheat lines developed by using biodiversity residing in the Aegilops species. The material was tested in an area that required stress tolerant germplasm. Planting was done ill fields where cotton was already growing up to the stage of second picking. The inputs included only half the amount of recommended dose of fertiliser, approximately half of the normal irrigation, no herbicide and two applications of compost. Two of the lines tested in these trials out-yielded all existing wheat cultivars traditionally grown in this area and convinced the farmers that biodiversity does play a role in adding value to the existing material, making it Suitable for specific requirement. This paper describes, in detail, the significance of the plant material for the area, practical achievements, acceptance by the farmers and economic feasibility of the stress tolerant material developed at NIAB.

DE Australian universities; case studies; entrepreneurialism; international
   education; strategic management; strategies
AB Universities around the world are increasingly focusing on entrepreneurial activities (Slaughter and Lesley 1997; Clark 1998). In Australia, the growth of international entrepreneurial activities has resulted in the creation of a significant export-oriented sector. These activities include the recruitment of international students to Australian campuses, the development of Australian university campuses in offshore locations, and the delivery of Australian degree programs at both onshore and offshore locations in partnership with universities, professional associations and private corporations. In 2000, Australian universities received A$770 million from international student fees (Maslen 2000a, p. 10). Australian universities currently receive on average around eight percent of revenues from these sources, with some depending on international entrepreneurialism for as much as one-third of revenues (DETYA 1998a). Managing these activities in an efficient, effective and sustainable manner has thus become critically important to virtually every institution in the Australian higher education sector. As is the case when businesses become international, universities are faced with the need to manage the complexities, risks and challenges associated with international operations. To date, little empirical work has been undertaken which explores and examines how Australian universities are managing their international entrepreneurial business operations. The aim of this study is thus to respond to this research gap by exploring how Australian universities, particularly in terms of their Faculties of Business, organise and manage international entrepreneurial activities. The research examines management approaches, practices and processes at five Australian universities. A Strategic Advantage Model of Internationalisation is presented representing a theoretical and conceptual synthesis of the findings.

TI Artificial recharge of aquifers: application examples in France
SO HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU
LA French
DT Article
AB In this paper, authors present two examples of artificial recharge operation, including technical and historical factors that have given birth to aquifer recharge facilities to better manage groundwater resources. An analysis of these tow schemes shows the key success factors and a global water treatment and water quality approach including pre-treatment potabilisation treatment and natural aquifer treatment during infiltration.
   These experiences have shown their reliability and sustainability over several decades and can contribute to design a regulatory framework for artificial recharge. They also demonstrate that rigid and unified water quality standards for water prior to infiltration regardless of the local context would not be adequate.

SO HOUSING POLICY DEBATE

DE low-income housing; mortgages; neighborhood
ID GENTRIFICATION
AB This article presents an interpretive progress report on the neighborhood-level effects of homeownership policy. The expansion of targeted lending initiatives has created unprecedented opportunities for ownership among low- to moderate-income (LMI) families, racial and ethnic minorities, and other populations once excluded from the nation's mainstream housing finance system. The article uses a two-stage strategy to provide a more accurate progress report on efforts to expand LMI homeownership.
   First, it uses home-purchase data for the 40 largest metropolitan regions to identify a set of "best-case" neighborhoods that experienced the greatest quantitative increase in LMI lending during the middle 1990s. Second, it assesses the nature of these places qualitatively. The approach allows one to evaluate the degree to which increased LMI lending provides genuine opportunities for affordable homeownership-or unleashes other processes that conflict with the goals of affordability and sustainable neighborhood development.

SO HOUSING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE environmentalism; neo-classical economics; Weberian sociology; Marxism
AB Housing studies have much to contribute to the debate about sustainable futures and yet there has been a lack of critical engagement with environmentalism. This paper sets out to show how the environmental debate can be enhanced by three traditional perspectives found within housing studies; these are: neo-classical economics, Weberian sociology and Marxism. It is suggested that housing researchers have begun to incorporate environmental issues into housing analysis, but we need to go further and engage in the environmental debate through the development of an eco-sensitive housing concept. The paper is a contribution towards an environmental understanding of the housing process.

AB Following a number of years in incremental improvements in eco-design, it is now frequently hypothesised that step changes in environmental impact are required via the generation of innovative new products or a transition to services. The paper begins by addressing the definition of needs and functionalities as important precursors to product creation. The generation of innovative environmentally friendly solutions via TRIZ models, based on the theory of inventive problem solving by Altshuller, are assessed for their ability to systematise this approach. The principles of TRIZ, derived from the study of patents and observed trends in the evolution of technical systems, will also be explored in terms of its applicability to provide an eco-centered service solution, Four product service combinations has been outlined as a basis to establish the operational characteristics of infrastructural based services. These concepts are further illustrated via service centered scenarios including those from telecommunications, car sharing and launderette facilities.

AB This paper reviews a range of studies that examine differences in growth performance among transition countries. There is a consensus in the literature about the core elements of transition and the policies necessary for sustainable growth, although Considerable differences remain about how to implement these policies and about their proper sequencing. The empirical work identifies stabilization and structural reforms (e.g., market liberalization, private ownership) as important determinants of growth, but underlines the role of initial conditions and institutions. There is divergent evidence, however, on the importance of specific reforms. Traditional factor inputs have as yet no role in axplaining growth.

AB This paper examines the role and impact of taxation on sustainable forest management. It is shown that fiscal instruments neither reinforce nor substitute for traditional regulatory approaches and can actually undermine sustainability. The paper uses the reasoning at the root of the Faustmann solution to draw conclusions on the incentives for sustainable tropical forest exploitation. It proposes a bond mechanism as an alternative market-based instrument to encourage sustainable forest logging while reducing monitoring costs.

ID PERFORMANCE; PARADIGM
AB As we begin the twenty-first century it appears that for a growing number of industries environmental issues are emerging with increasing frequency as strategic problems. If human economic activity is to be sustainable, then strategic behaviour of companies must take account of the structural elements. Researchers in the western societies are trying to understand how the companies integrate the sustainability issues into their strategies. No such study has been reported on companies operating in the ASEAN countries. This paper reports the findings of a case study research on this issue which was conducted on seven global companies operating in Singapore. Two frameworks were applied to analyse the nature and extent of integration of environmental management practices into the organizational strategic planning process. The study reveals that the majority of the sample companies have well-developed environmental management systems in place which satisfies the requirements of the strategic planning criterion of the (Singapore) business excellence framework. These companies are also found to be actively engaged in at least four of the five best practices of environmental leadership framework suggested by Dechant and Altman.

AB The first national survey data on interest-based bargaining (IBB) in labor relations reveal broad awareness of IBB, contrasting union and management views, and variation by negotiator experience and gender. A majority of negotiators are aware of IBB, and approximately one-third of management negotiators and nearly one-half of union negotiators report using IBB in prior negotiations. An exploratory analysis of the relationships between IBB preferences and contract outcomes suggests that the process is producing more than a simple "mutual gains" pattern of outcomes. Based on these initial results, two hypotheses are suggested as the focus for future studies of the diffusion and sustainability of IBB in collective bargaining.

AB Greece was relatively tardy in implementing a national rail network. The Greek Railways Organization (OSE) was formed in 1970 and united a number of regional railroads, some dating back to 1884. The current rail network in Greece has a length of approximately 2500 km with standard- and metric-gage tracks. Disadvantages of the network include a high percentage of single-line track, lack of homogeneity of track gage, inefficient alignment, absence of intermodal connections, and many at-grade intersections. Advantages include double tracks in a significant part of the Athens-Thessalonica axis that serves more than half of Greece's population, improved operational controls, and popular intercity trains offering speedy service. Factors that affect railroad passenger and freight volumes include competition from airlines and motor carriers, gas prices, inflation, and the gross national product. These factors were used to estimate time-series models. Forecasts indicate increasing passenger demand and decreasing freight demand. OSE could provide a valuable and viable passenger service if cost-effective expenditures for improving it are possible. The future of freight operations is not hopeful. Additional emphasis may be placed on lines with historical and cultural significance, Further study is needed to assess the sustainability of forecasts vis-a-vis actual market shares and costs.

DT Article
AB During the 1990s, the precautionary principle and transparency in decision processes have become internationally recognised environmental standards, This article discusses whether and to which extent the Russian-Norwegian fishery regime in the Barents Sea has implemented these modem principles for resource management. By the beginning of the 1990s, the north-east Atlantic cod stock - and the coastal communities depending on it - suffered heavily after overfishing. After this experience, the authorities promised a fishery management based on the principles of sustainability. The stock was after a short time rebuilt, and Norway promoted itself as "the world's best fishery manager". In 1998, the Norwegian parliament and the Barents Sea fishery regime took the first steps to implement the precautionary approach to fishers, management. After this, the risks in quota decisions and the fishing pressure, nevertheless, reached the highest levels ever. By 2001, the cod stock has been below biologically safe limits for three years in a row. The new environmental standards were doubtlessly met with resistance in the Barents fishery regime. This can have various explanations - institutional, economical and technological - that all seem to interact in the same direction: Toward an increasing will to take risks.

SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB The failure at Seattle to agree the mandate for a new round of trade negotiations represents a dual crisis, not only for the trade community, but also for those supporting a shift to sustainable development, Ae the root of the crisis Lies the North-South faultline, with an embedded sense of inequity keeping developing countries forever wary of the industrialized countries, not least on linkages between trade and the environment. But Seattle also showed that the South's current non-strategy towards trade and environment-opposing any formal linkage within the WTO, for example-is flawed. As a result, the South is now seen as the global scapegoat for inaction on trade and environment, and has shut itself out of opportunities to shape the direction of the debate. Furthermore, trade and environmental factors are being progressively linked in the marketplace-not because of the WTO, but in spite of it.
   The challenge for the South is to take a more proactive approach, generating a positive agenda for change based on issues of sustainable livelihoods, environmental justice and sustainable development more broadly. One starting point is to test current policy positions against the alternative visions of the future-for example, through scenario planning-and to develop a robust 'no regrets' programme for engagement. The South has the most to gain from a world structured around the norms of sustainable development, and, as a result, it has the primary responsibility for reorienting the goals of trade away from the Limited agenda of 'free trade', towards the more inclusive programme of 'sustainable trade'. Whether this reorientation takes place, and whether the South takes a hand in shaping this process, will be one of the central questions for the years ahead.

TI A multi-objective methodology for evaluating product end-of-life options
   and disassembly
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE eco-indicator; end-of-life; environmental impact; disassembly; life
   cycle assessment
AB In recent years, sustainable manufacturing has become important all over the world. Manufacturers have begun to realise the need for the responsible use and management of resources in the life cycle of a manufactured product, especially the planning for product retirement. The common end-of-life options are reuse, remanufacture, recycle, landfill, and incineration.
   This paper discusses a multi-objective methodology for determining appropriate end-of-life options for manufactured products, set against the often conflicting objectives of minimising environmental impact and minimising deficit (or sometimes maximising surplus). Guidelines for determining feasible end-of-life options (including the economic value of products and their components) are discussed. A numerical index of the environmental impact of a material or process - the eco-indicator - is adopted.
   Except for landfill and incineration, components of economic value destined for reuse, remanufacture, or recycling have first to be extracted from the product. It is therefore necessary to determine the optimal stage of disassembly, when all economically valuable components are retrieved. In order to determine the extent to which a product should be disassembled during its retirement, one may consider minimising environmental impact or associated costs or maximising the rate of return.
   Two end-of-life disassembly charts are introduced showing the impact on the environment and cumulative costs incurred as a product is disassembled. One of the charts can be used to assist in product design or redesign, whereas the other can be used to determine the optimal stage of end-of-life disassembly of the product. An end-of-life disassembly chart for a telecommunication pager revealed that if the pager is disassembled and its components reused, remanufactured, or recycled, the costs incurred will be very high. The pager is not designed for end-of-life retirement. It is best landfilled.
   The end-of-life options of a coffee maker were investigated using the methodology. It is concluded that the coffee maker is designed for end-of-life retirement. Complete product disassembly is always mandatory. If the coffee maker were completely disassembled and all components processed, the total disassembly time is 97 s, and a surplus of US$0.1918 is even realisable. The coffee maker was found to be designed for end-of-life retirement.

TI Toward a universal declaration of the rule of law: Implications for
   criminal justice and sustainable development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Since its inception, the U.N. has provided a forum for the elaboration and promotion of general principles of social, economic, and political life. In the context of crime prevention and criminal justice, several standards, norms, and guidelines have been created. Perhaps the most widely stated yet least understood general principle at the core of criminal justice has been the notion of the "rule of law." Persons, agencies, and governments from disparate regional, cultural, and legal backgrounds seem to acknowledge the concept positively. indeed, it is often referred to as an essential foundational element of a just society and as a prerequisite for sustainable development. This paper first attempts to chart the history of the "rule of law" in terms of its definition and international promotion. Second, it outlines the development in the U.N. of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The link between the rule of law and human rights is then discussed with a view to determining the strengths and weaknesses of each as tools in assisting governments with sustainable development. The paper concludes by suggesting that the U.N. develop a Universal Declaration of the Rule of Law, potentially a more effective mechanism for development.

   University of Perugia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH

DE cogeneration; internal combustion engine; CO2 emission
AB In this work the CO2 emissions due to the University of Perugia's energy needs have been evaluated. Perugia is a city set in the middle of Italy, in the 'Umbria' region, with a population of about 1 400 000 people. The University of this city was founded in 1260 and nowadays consists of eleven Faculties with 30 000 students and about 1200 teachers. The energy needs of the University are mainly due to thermal and electrical users. In particular, the thermal consumption is strictly connected to building heating in the autumn-winter months.
   The reduction of CO2 emissions is one of the main goals that developed countries have established to be achieved in the next few years, not only related to the Kyoto treated goals, but also for increasing economical and industrial production with a sustainable development concept. Carbon dioxide is not strictly a toxic substance, but makes a large contribution to the 'greenhouse effect' with negative repercussions for the environment.
   For these reasons the possibility of satisfying the University of Perugia's energy needs by the adoption of one, or more, cogeneration power plant fuelled by natural gas, opportunely located at the University, has been evaluated both in terms of energy production and of CO2 emission reduction.
   This study also takes into account the experiences of the cogeneration power plant that is in operation at the Engineering Facility of Perugia University.
   The results have been compared with the Regional Energetic Development Planning for evaluating the influence of the University's energy needs and emissions on the whole Region. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DE costs; environmental functions; scarcity; sustainability; valuation
AB When valuing environmental functions in a neo-classical framework, both data on opportunity costs, reflected on a elimination costs or supply curve, and data on preferences, reflected on a revealed preferences or demand curve, are indispensable. It is, in principle, always possible to estimate the opportunity costs, be it sometimes with great uncertainty margins. This is not the case with data on preferences, such as expenditure on compensation resulting from losses of function (compensation costs). Therefore, making assumptions about preferences is inevitable. Consequently, there are as many values for functions and green national incomes as (reasonable) assumptions can be made. In the latter case, a comparative static general equilibrium model has to be used, because of the major changes occurring. Preliminary results of the elaboration of the Sustainable National Income according to Hueting make it plausible that the distance to sustainability is substantial. Carpenters and economists should be judged in the same way.

AB We discuss the recent institutional history of water resources governance in Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands, as a case of a real social process of environmental valuation. Emphasis is placed on the institutional and cultural factors for the emergence, and change over time, of collective understandings about co-evolution possibilities between natural and socio-economic processes. Tenerife aquifer water resources could be exploited sustainably. At present, however, a set of interests and collective perceptions dominates that treats water as a commodity to be appropriated privately, and that puts faith in new technologies of water production (e.g. desalination) to overcome scarcity. Yet, there is sufficient scientific and economic evidence to support a more precautionary approach based on avoidance of irreversible deterioration of the aquifer resource.

AB A multidisciplinary computer-based field study among 393 Dutch households examined how people judge the 'social' sustainability (quality-of-life effects) of 'environmentally' sustainable household consumption patterns (less energy-use demanding) and associated policy options. The study revealed that about two-thirds of the households had to reduce their direct and indirect energy use within the next five years in order to move towards environmentally sustainable consumption patterns. The least sustainable consumption patterns were found among high income groups and young couples. Overall, respondents did not believe that their quality of life will be affected as long as the necessary reduction of energy use stays below 30 gigajoules (24% of their total household energy use). Moreover, respondents were willing to accept almost all energy-saving policy measures. However, respondents did appear to be more willing to pay for sustaining their comfort, freedom and pleasure while reducing the environmental impact of their consumption than they were to give up some of their quality of life.

AB Households consume direct energy, using natural gas, heating oil, gasoline and electricity, and consume indirect energy, the energy related to the production of goods and the delivery of services for the households. Past trends and present-day household energy use (direct and indirect) are analysed and described. A comparison of these findings with objectives concerning ecological sustainability demonstrates that present-day household energy use is not sustainable. A scenario towards sustainable household energy use is designed containing far-reaching measures with regard to direct energy use. Scenario evaluation shows a substantial reduction of direct energy use; however, this is not enough to meet the sustainability objectives. Based on these results, the possibilities and the limitations are discussed to enable households to make their direct and indirect energy use sustainable on the long run.

AB This paper examines the implications of alternative approaches to intertemporal social choice in a numerically calibrated model of interactions between global climate change and the world economy. Under cost-benefit analysis, relatively modest steps towards greenhouse gas emissions abatement are justified as economically efficient. Under classical utilitarianism and the precautionary principle. in contrast, aggressive steps towards climate stabilization emerge as socially optimal. The paper reviews the value judgements that support each of these normative approaches, arguing that the precautionary principle is most closely tied to the goals and objectives of the Framework Convention on Climate Change.

AB This paper describes the main features of the study 'Natural Resources and Environmental Accounting in the Czech Republic' (NREACR), carried out under the Phare programme during 1998-1999. Within the project, five major methodological areas were specified: (1) NAMEA-type accounting; (2) land cover/land use (LC/LU) accounting; (3) abatement cost curves (air energy, transport and industry; water - agriculture, industry, housing); (4) economic (monetary) appraisal of natural assets; and (5) dynamic modelling and scenario development. The results of the first four modules can be thought of as elements of a policy support databank that can have many uses, including the information inputs needed for national economy scenario modelling aimed at exploring the potentials, constraints and trade-offs in the setting and evaluation of Czech Republic economic and environmental policy. In this paper, an overview is given of the modular approach adopted for economy-environment accounting and of the main results, followed by discussion of the outlook for further work in the field in the Czech Republic and also potentially for other EU Accession countries.

ID HYDROGEN-SULFIDE; SULFUR
AB A H2S-O-2 electrochemical cell has been operated for periods up to 10 days using mixtures of H2S with hydrocarbons as anode feed, without loss of activity. The anode catalysts include supported metals, such as Pd/C and Pt/C, and metal sulfides, including MoS2, CoS2 and WS2 admired with teflonized carbon. When the feed is a mixture of H2S with methane and ethane, the hydrocarbons are nor oxidized. The performance of a MoS2-C anode catalyst is unaffected by either hydrocarbons or CO2 in the feed. In contrast, Pd/C anode catalyst gradually loses activity when the feed is a mixture of H2S with both hydrocarbons and CO2. Sustainable power generation of 250 muW/cm(2) has been attained using 3% H2S/97% CH4. Sulfur is recovered as liquid product at 120-145 degreesC and 235-510 kPa.

AB LCA practice focuses on impacts resulting from the release of chemicals into the environment, but consideration of 'non-chemical impacts' is as important for LCA, particularly as it relates to sustainability. Methodologies and philosophies exist for addressing non-chemical impacts, particularly in the area of resource depletion and land use, but the problem of comparing or integrating chemical and non-chemical impacts remains. A new approach for identifying and integrating impacts involves the use of an object-oriented modeling and simulation platform, such as Department of Energy Argonne National Laboratory's Dynamic Information Architecture System (DIAS). LCA and impact categories can be described as 'objects' (at any level of detail or specificity) and any combination of objects and behaviors can be brought into a DIAS analysis frame. Related models that address objects' behavior characteristics are linked only to their respective objects, not to each other. Thus, maximum flexibility and speed is possible. The process of dividing LCA and impact assessment into a hierarchy of objects provides new insights into the complex mixture of dynamic things, activities, and relationships inherent in LCA and sustainability. Ultimately, embracing the complexity of LCA may be the way to simplify it.

AB In literature, many models (qualitatively as well as quantitatively) can be found to cope with the problem of communicating results of LCA analyses with decision takers. In a previous article of this journal, an LCA-based single indicator for emissions is proposed: the 'virtual pollution prevention costs '99' (Vogtlander et al. 2000a).
   In this article, a single LCA-based indicator for sustainability is proposed. It builds on the virtual pollution prevention costs '99 for emissions, and adds the other two main aspects of sustainability: material depletion and energy consumption. This single indicator, the 'virtual eco-costs '99', is the sum of the marginal prevention costs of:
   Material depletion, applying 'material depletion costs', to be reduced by recycling
   Energy consumption, applying 'eco-costs of energy' being the price of renewable energy
   Toxic emissions, applying the 'virtual pollution prevention costs '99'
   The calculation model includes 'direct' as well as 'indirect' environmental impacts. The main groups of 'indirect' components in the life cycle of products and services are:
   Labour (the environmental impacts of office heating, lighting, computers, commuting, etc.)
   production assets (equipment, buildings, transport vehicles, etc.)
   To overcome allocation problems of the indirect components of complex product-service systems, a methodology of economic allocation has been developed, based on the so called Eco-costs/ Value Ratio (EVR) model.
   This EVR calculation model appears to be a practical and powerful tool to assess the sustainability of a product, a service, or a product-service combination.

AB Goal. This research aims to assess the environmental effects of integrated strategies in a municipal waste management system. In particular, analysis is focused on a waste stream in Palermo, where landfill involves the prompt disposal of the most waste after collection. The current local management system is compared with two integrated waste management alternatives. Both the options comply with Italian regulations, but each one predicts adopting the available technologies in different ways.
   Methods and objectives. Energetic and environmental balances are carried out in each management system referring to local waste composition in order to quantify energy consumption, the recovery of material and energy, and the environmental releases. Impact assessment is carried out to define the environmental profile of each option. Impact categories are defined and inventory data, by means of a suitable aggregation, can be used to evaluate the potential contribution that system inputs and outputs could bring to the relative category.
   Results. In opposition to the current management, which involves energy balance at a loss, the mass and energy balances outcomes in both of the two hypothetical management systems show the capability to obtain energy and material recovery to a substantial extent. Sorted collection plays a remarkable role in the improvement of environmental performance of management systems. In particular, the thermal treatment of waste associated with energy recovery, and the concomitant material recycling, increase the saving of energy.
   Conclusions. Environmental pressure factors of the management system are assessed depending on the relevant consumption of raw materials and energy, and on the emission of pollutants. The resulting figures reflect the two different integrated management options as being sustainable solutions for achieving an improvement in environmental performance, which is based on increasing the value of waste, as an alternative to resources, and the reduction of environmental releases. Life Cycle Assessment of municipal waste management systems can be usefully applied to define synthetic indices of environmental impact. These indices could single out possible alternatives in multi-criteria analysis, together with economic and technical parameters.

TI Allocation in recycling systems - An integrated model for the analyses
   of environmental impact and market value

AB 'Design for Recycling' and dematerialization by enhancing the durability of products are major aspects of the quest for sustainable products. This article presents an LCA-based model for the integrated analyses of the product chain, its recycling systems, and its waste treatment systems at the 'End of Life' stage. The model is an extension of the EVR (Eco-costs/Value Ratio) model which has been published in this journal (Vogtlander et al. 2001), but can also be applied to other life cycle interpretation models, since the model as such is not restricted to the use of the eco-costs as a single indicator.
   The model has been developed to evaluate the design alternatives of complex products like buildings and cars. These products comprise several subsystems, each with its own special solution at the End of Life stage: Extending of the product life, object renovation, re-use of components, re-use of materials, useful application of waste materials, immobilization with and without useful applications, incineration with and without energy recovery, land fill.
   Since complex product systems always comprise a combination of these design alternatives, a methodology is given to calculate and allocate the eco-costs of the total system in order to select the best solution for sustainability. The methodology is characterized by:
   A main allocation model of the recycling flow based on physical relationships,
   a strict separation of the market value, the costs and the eco-costs in the system,
   a main allocation model for extension of lifetime based on 'depreciation of eco-costs', parallel to economic depreciation.

TI Consensus in the German labour market - Economic consequences and the
   implications for reform
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER
LA English
DT Article
DE Germany; labour market; productivity; employment
ID SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; VIEWS
AB Characteristic successes of Germany's social market economy include both stability and productivity growth, yet mass unemployment indicates the need for reform. The conventional reform agenda emphasises Germany's restrictive labour market. However, many targets for reform are elements of an institutional system in the labour market that promotes Germany's culture of consensus. A model is outlined that synthesises insights from X-efficiency and business strategy theory to highlight the positive effects of consensus on business performance. The model together with accompanying empirical data suggests that Germany's consensus culture not only gives rise to negative outcomes associated with labour market inflexibility - in particular, sluggish employment growth - but also helps firms to generate innovation, productivity growth and sustainable competitive advantage. This implies the need for a renewed "social contract", in which consensus not only generates productivity growth but also sustains a corporatist bias towards employment. Finally, a corporatist reform process consistent with Germany's cultural and institutional environment is likely to be more effective than top-down liberalisation in accelerating job creation while maintaining cultural sources of global competitiveness.

AB This paper focuses on the terms of reference of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was drafted to support environmental sustainability through the mitigation of global warming. The paper provides information oil the main features of the protocol, especially the commercial incentives for companies in industrialised countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Particular attention is paid to the role of the operations manager and strategist in the selection of processes, plant and equipment to meet these commercial incentives, and the location of industrial facilities under conditions of political and economic uncertainty. The paper demonstrates the importance of the political and economic factors influencing environmental investment decisions, particularly those factors which often lie outside the usual terms of reference of operations managers.

TI Impediments to consumer adoption of sustainable transportation -
   Alternative fuel vehicles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE stakeholders; sustainable development; transport
AB There are a number of impediments to consumer adoption of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs), including regulatory, barriers, resources, infrastructure and vehicle characteristics themselves. These impediments also impact on other stakeholders, such as government, producers (i.e. corporations), suppliers (collaborators), competition (i.e. alternative products) and activist groups. The inter-relationships amongst all stakeholders are complex, as one group may initiate actions that serve as impediments for others. Developing systems-based sustainable alternatives to traditional, environmentally-harmful automobiles requires the network of relationships between stakeholders and impediments to be considered. This paper looks at the various impediments as well as how they can affect various stakeholders. It then posits a broad based integrative approach to provide the most favourable environment for consumers to consider AFVs.

AB Currently, many businesses are implementing a proactive, strategic tool known as an environmental management system (EMS) to gain a competitive advantage. Companies can no longer simply use compliance plans to deal with environmental concerns; consumer demands for greener products and services, and operational efficiencies require long term strategic and sustainable approaches for environmental management. An EMS includes documentation of commitment and policy; planning; implementation; measurement and evaluation; and review and improvement. Establishment and maintenance of an EMS can be costly and time consuming, therefore implementation should be carefully structured to assure success. This paper identifies human resource (HR) factors such as top management support, environmental training, employee empowerment, teamwork, and rewards systems as key elements of the implementation process of an EMS. Furthermore, the interaction of these factors is examined in terms of the five categories of an EMS mentioned above. Finally, a conceptual model of the EMS-HR factors is proposed to assist in Proper facilitation of the environmental management Program.

AB The traditional approach of operations management has evaluated an organisation's performance based on four main areas: cost, quality, time and service. However, the necessity to introduce environmental protection measures in firms so as to achieve sustainable development has forced a redefinition of the operations function. This paper reviews the literature on operations management and environmental issues, in order to determine the role of operations in sustainability. We justify the need to include environmental performance as a new, dimension of operations performance. Finally, we analyse environmental performance as an operations objective and present certain aspects that should be taken into account when measuring it.

AB While there exists a growing literature on corporate "green" strategies, there is a research gap about which corporate architectures and organizational change processes enable "green" strategies. This article addresses the research gap in an interdisciplinary manner by focusing on two questions: What conditions characterize ecological and humanly sustainable corporations? What alternative architectures can generate and institutionalize corporate sustainability? Three alternative architectures for sustainability are treated and three research propositions are identified to further future empirical research on specific architectures that link organization design and corporate sustainability.

   Caribbean; Virgin Islands; Leeward Islands
AB Changes in the subsistence economies during the 2000-year colonization of the Leeward and Virgin islands are discussed. The colonists migrated from northern South America with traditions for producing ceramics, engaging in horticulture, fishing, gathering, and managing captive animals. Based on analysis of pairs of faunal samples from four islands, I am able to show some consistent changes in the relative abundances of some species, the sizes of individual animals, and the mean trophic levels of the aquatic components of the faunas. The changes that take place through time are: decline in the relative abundance of land crabs; a relative increase in the abundance of molluscs; decline in the mean trophic level of reef fishes; a subsequent increase or decrease in the mean trophic level of inshore and pelagic fishes. In those sites where the mean trophic level of inshore and pelagic fishes occurs it is dominated by tuna and other large predators, increased dependence upon herrings and other small fishes reduced the mean trophic level. These changes accompanied a human population increase and intensification of the horticultural enterprise. The root cause of many of these changes is overexploitation. Compensation for the decline in some resources is accomplished through changes in fishing technology. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Understanding the science of environmental issues: development of a
   subject knowledge guide for primary teacher education
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

DT Article
ID PRIMARY-SCHOOL
AB In the light of an increased concern for environmental education (especially in the context of sustainable development) in the UK, this study used questionnaire surveys to explore the understanding of 170 practising primary school teachers, 120 primary trainees and 88 secondary science trainees in four areas: biodiversity, the carbon cycle, ozone and global warming. A methodological innovation in this research was the prior identification of basic scientific explanations of each area for a primary teacher and the use of these as benchmarks for judging understanding. Knowledge of the component parts of these explanations was tested in the questionnaires. Hence the study was able to identify those underpinning science concepts which were well understood, and those which were not so well understood. The frequencies of several misconceptions, uncovered in earlier interviews and also included in the questionnaires, are also reported. It is suggested that both the basic explanations and the difficulties of understanding displayed by the teachers in some areas can usefully inform programmes of professional development for sustainable development and environmental education. An outline of a guide for teachers adopting this approach is provided.

AB Business process innovation capability is a source for sustainable competitiveness. Business process innovations create value added in the enterprise, and can trigger strategic renewal. The management of business process innovation requires empowering mechanisms for knowledge sharing and creation, and a dynamic umbrella strategy to give direction to the innovations. Lessons from product innovation should be applied: strategic project portfolio management and an aggregate project plan help to manage a balanced mix of projects and to allocate resources, and systematic project management shortens the lead time of change. Business process simulation, and learning from one development project to the next help to create a continuously improving business process innovation capability.
   At the end, the contents of each article in the Issue are briefly presented, divided in three main areas: Conceptual analysis of the implementation problem, Organizational learning and knowledge creation in innovation processes, and Specific methods and tools for business process innovation.

DE oganizational capability; continuous improvement; knowledge capture;
   operational effectiveness; decision making; engineering process; new
   product introduction; wealth creation
AB The term 'knowledge economy' is now widely used to signify the growth of a new industrial era, encompassing the capture and exploitation of global knowledge, to create new, or improved, processes or products which, in turn, give rise to wealth creation. But how does knowledge arise and how is it part of the enabling process that leads to new processes or products? How are raw data turned into wealth creation? And what is the role of engineering in this process?
   This paper describes a Capability Framework, which shows how the collective operational competence of any organization is driven by the procedures regulating its activity, the information availability and the human skills applied. It further shows how the learning and experience that support the decision making are fundamental in determining the quality and effectiveness of the process through which the activity is directed.
   The Capability Framework also shows the linkages with creativity and innovation which, applied through the transformation mechanism provided by engineering, can harness collective capability and with the Business Strategy establish wealth creation through technology introduction and new product development.
   This approach identifies the basis for the controlled management of business performance improvement by channelling effort through the three fundamental segments, (Staff development, information systems and operating processes) to provide a platform for the implementation of continuous improvement initiatives in a self-sustaining environment. Additionally, it highlights the importance of knowledge capture as a means of improving the decision making process, particularly in recognition of the increasing proliferation of basic technology that is the unavoidable by-product of specialization.
   The importance of culture change, as the essential catalyst for sustainable improvement, is presented in the context of repositioning the field of engineering to reignite creativity and innovation as the drivers of wealth creation.

AB The economic turmoil in Southeast Asia, occurring just before the dawning of the new millennium, highlights the lack of sustainability of the development paths of many countries in this region. While much of the blame can be laid on the weak financial infrastructure and poor corporate governance, one of the root causes for development unsustainability is the lack of competitiveness of their economies, in turn resulting from lack of innovative capability based on science and technology. This is required in order for these countries to make economic transitions necessary for advanced developing economies. The future of these countries is therefore intimately linked with the future of their science and technology. A balanced development is required, with emphasis placed on niche areas where these countries have strategic advantages.

AB This paper presents a methodology for the assessment of the external costs of air pollution caused by road traffic in the Brussels urban area. This methodology is applied to assess different alternative measures towards sustainable mobility. The general approach follows the sequence: human activity --> emissions --> concentrations --> physical impact --> external costs. The methodology developed in terms of this sequence consists of three specific modules. Of these, the first module involves the assessment of air pollutant emissions from road traffic and indoor heating, which are the main urban sources of pollution. The second module establishes the relationship between previously calculated emissions and the concentrations of pollutants in the surrounding atmosphere. The third module assesses the damage in physical and monetary terms on the basis of suitable exposure-response functions. The principal effects covered by the evaluation involve the impact on public health and damage to buildings. The external costs caused by road traffic in the Brussels-Capital Region have been calculated for the reference year 1996. The possible benefits of policy options in favour of sustainable transport are also presented.

AB The basic question is whether rural America is sustainable in its present form America's hegemonic position in world agricultural commodity trade is eroding. The lessons from urban America suggest that structural transformation is both painful and necessary Improving rural infrastructure will be an important objective, bur the benefits maybe smaller than similar investments in metropolitan areas. Expanding agricultural opportunities will be important, through value-added processing and new specialized crops. Lifting rural human capital will be an essential ingredient in spurring new rural business formation. Finally, improving rural economic networks will be an important step in harnessing the potential of small businesses that typify the rural economic landscape. There will not be one way to address the myriad problems in rural America, bur any new rural policies must recognize that not all rural communities may be viable in the future.

AB The paper analyses the reforms of the Italian mandatory pension scheme for employees legislated in the 1990s. To assess the effects of the reforms, a microsimulation model calibrated on cross-section data is developed. The model is aimed at estimating the average income of a member of a cohort, as well as the average per capita income of all individuals alive in a given year. The long-run effects of the reform are analysed, comparing the characteristics of alternative financing schemes. A substantial improvement of the equity as well as the long-run sustainability of the Italian public pension schemes emerges. However, the dreary demographic scenario calls for further tightening of eligibility rules sometime in the next decades if long-run sustainability of public debt is to be achieved. On the basis of sensitivity analysis, some changes aimed at hedging the system against unexpected shocks are suggested.

AB As vegetables are often gl own under continuous cropping in Japan, injury associated with continuous cropping is frequently observed. Although the methods of control are based on the use of chemicals, the importance of promoting sustainable cultivation and environment-friendly technologies is being increasingly recognized. Plant diseases caused by fungi or bacteria, such as clubroot, yellows are major problems. To address these problems, crop rotation with sweet corn, introduction of resistant radish varieties as trap crops or inoculation with endophytes have been applied. Injury caused by nematodes is also a serious problem. Practical methods using antagonistic plants such as marigold have been developed, because only one season is required to introduce these plants with only minor changes in the cropping systems. Selection of crop combinations is essential. Tare (Colocasia esculenta Schott.) is severely damaged by a root lesion nematode (Pratylenchus coffeae). By examining the degree of suppression of this nematode by many kinds of crops, determination of crop sequence efficiency became possible for the control of nematodes and offers a wider range of selection of crop combinations. Tare is injured by P. coffeae and by the root knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita), while radish (Raphanus sativus L.) is attacked by the root lesion nematode (Pratylenchus penetrans). The combination of these 2 vegetable crops with a third one, such as vegetable soybean (Glycine max), can minimize the injury caused by these 3 nematodes.

TI Assessing the consequences of converting to organic agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB In the wake of the public controversy over genetically modified crops, organic production is sometimes hailed as the true "sustainable agriculture". Its advocates claim that it enriches biodiversity, increases soil "health" and provides more nutritious foods. This paper summarises the results of a three year; multi-disciplinary study of one major unit undergoing transition from non-organic to full organic status. Researchers examined whole farm nutrient budgets, insect diversity and the wider environmental economics of organic production compared with non-organic management. The result was a mid-term example of multi-disciplinary science, though some way short of interdisciplinary science. The evidence suggests that organic production can result in measurable environmental gains, which can be valued in economic terms. The full environmental account, however, remains elusive. Yet its significance could prove vital for the future of diversified rural economics in the UK. Interdisciplinary minded agricultural and environmental economists are encouraged to extend this pilot initiative in the light of the important policy contribution that such additional research could provide for the improved valuation of sustainable agriculture. The authors conclude that there is a plausible case for an Organic Stewardship Scheme attached to the Rural Development Regulation.

AB The issue of regularly feeding low levels of antibiotics to farm animals in order to increase productivity is often portrayed as a dilemma. On the one hand, such antibiotic use is depicted as a necessary condition for producing cheap and plentiful food, such that were such use to stop, food prices would rise significantly and our ability to feed people in developing nations would decrease. On the other hand, such antibiotic use seems to breed antibiotic resistance into pathogens affecting human health. Resolving this dilemma, it is alleged, will require great amounts of research into risk/benefit assessment. Contrary to this claim, we will argue that society has all the data it needs to make a reasonable ethical decision, which would be curtailing such use. Such curtailment will not harm consumers significantly, will not harm developing nations' evolving agriculture, and could produce hitherto unnoticed benefits, namely restoring the possibility of a more husbandry-based, sustainable agriculture to replace the high-tech agriculture that has hurt animals, the environment, small farms, and sustainability.

AB The paper describes the design and implementation of a plant biodiversity conservation program that was developed under funding and time constraints for diverse ecological, social, and institutional environments. The biodiversity program for alpine meadows and pastures located in the Swiss Canton of the Grisons is used as an example. The design of the sustainable program relied on existing legislation, accounted for limited ecological knowledge and expertise, and considered biodiversity as a common-pool resource. The trend to intensified cultivation of restricted areas required fast action, while the sustainability of the program design had to take into account institutional diversity. Fifteen habitats and plant communities worth conserving were known, and 57 plant species were identified as indicator species for establishing an inventory and for monitoring purposes. A small subset of 16 well known plant species was presented to the farming communities. They were invited to notify the areas in which they observed the presence of these plants. In different regions of the Canton a total number of 39 paraecologists were trained to inspect the areas notified by farmers and to recommend possible incorporation into the Cantonal inventory. This was done once the farmers signed a contract in which they agreed to follow adequate management practices. The farmers received subsidies to compensate for their losses. Communal authorities controlled the fertilizer input and cutting dates, while the paraecologists were trained to monitor plant biodiversity. The program started in 1992 and the initial phase of the inventory was terminated in 1996. At the beginning of 1996, an inventory of 2617.19 ha, most of which are meadows, was taken and managed according to the rules specified in the contract. The program was considered successful because (i) of the size of the area in the inventory, (ii) about 30% of the farmers participated, and (iii) farmers started cultivating previously abandoned farmland.

AB Debates over the future of agriculture in North America establish a dialectical opposition between conventional, industrial agriculture and alternative, sustainable agriculture. This opposition has roots that extend back to the 18th century in the United States, but the debate has taken a number of surprising turns in the 20th century. Originally articulated as a philosophy of the left, industrial agriculture has utilitarian moral foundations. In the US and Canada, the articulation of an alternative to industrial agriculture has drawn upon three central themes: the belief that agriculture is, in some way, tied to democracy; the belief that complex bureaucratic organizations are inherently opposed to human interests; and the belief that the family farms characteristic of 19th century North America tend to produce people of superior moral character. It has proved difficult to weave these themes into a coherent vision of agriculture for the 21st century. Often, risk and health-based concerns are the basis for public criticism of conventional agriculture, but these do not conflict with the utilitarian orientation of the industrial model, and are easily incorporated into it. If there is to be a philosophical debate over the future of agriculture, we must find some way to rehabilitate the quasi-Aristotelean view of agriculture that emerges from the three critical themes noted above.

   farming; organic livestock production; systemic approach
ID PARTURIENT SOWS; AGRICULTURE; INTEGRITY; BEHAVIOR; ETHICS
AB The concept of animal welfare refers to the animal's quality of life. The choice of definition always reflects some basic valuation. This makes a particular conception of welfare value-dependent. Also, the animal husbandry system reflects certain values or aims. The values reflected in the chosen conception of animal welfare ought to correspond to values aimed for in the husbandry system. The IFOAM Basic Standards and other writings dealing with organic animal husbandry should be taken as a departure point for a discussion of how to interpret the conception of welfare in organic farming systems. The conception of welfare is related to two core values in the organic agriculture movement. These core values should be considered in terms of (1) aim for holistic view and (2) aim for sustainability. A third, implicit core value, based on bio- and ecocentric views: (3) respect for nature is needed as a supplement to these two core values. There are important implications of these core values for an ``organic'' conception of animal welfare and for confronting two dilemmas due to conflicting interests. Comparisons among the three commonly used welfare definitions will show the superiority of the third approach, which can provide an outline for a conception of animal welfare more suitable for organic farming systems. This outline combines a holistic ecocentric approach with respect for the individual animal, and it can be used as the basis for a complex definition with emphasis on natural behavior. Such a systemic approach considers welfare in relation to different systemic levels. The systemic view also offers possibilities for resolving the dilemmas in new ways.

AB This article shows the actual situation in the air transport liberalization process of Germany and the potential way of how it may develop into an extensively liberalized airline market. The starting point is the liberalization of the European and the north atlantic air transport market. These markets show positive results so that further liberalization of other markets is desirable. In an extensively liberalized airline market the role of the state is limited to set parameters for competition to become sustainable without affecting safety, social or environmental standards. For this a competition concept on the base of the model of contestable markets is proposed as well as further liberalization of the fifth and sixth freedom markets. Finally, a continuous market observation system seems to be appropriate to hinder anticompetitive behaviour. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The cultivation of hillslopes in pre-Columbian times caused considerable soil erosion in the landscapes of the semi-arid Tehuacan Valley, south-central Mexico. A very severe episode of erosion of cultivated uplands occurred approximately 900 years ago in one drainage basin. The magnitude of soil erosion has left behind a degraded landscape with greatly decreased agricultural productivity and locally impoverished native flora. Hillslope soils in the basins studied are highly susceptible to erosion and neither pre-Columbian nor modem agricultural practices have proven to be sustainable in these upland environments. Severe soil loss that precedes agricultural collapse and land abandonment may impair the recovery of diverse and productive ecosystems for many hundreds to thousands of years, as this is the time required for the formation of a new, substantial soil mantle.

AB The authors identify the challenge of holding contemporary business leaders accountable for enhancing the intangible strategic asset of integrity capacity in organizations. After defining integrity capacity and framing it as part of a strategic resource model of sustainable global competitive advantage, the stakeholder costs of integrity capacity neglect are delineated. To address this neglect issue, the authors focus on the cultivation of judgment integrity to handle behavioral, moral and hypothesized economic complexities as key dimensions of integrity capacity. Finally, the authors recommend two leadership practices to build competence in business leaders to enhance integrity capacity as an organizational strategic asset.

DT Article
DE medication self-administration; practice development; sustained change
AB Change in nursing practice has been dogged by factors which have been perceived to be outside the autonomy of nurses. Consequently, projects have been initiated which have then faltered or even ceased altogether.
   This paper reports on an action research study that was carried out in Newcastle from 1997 to 1999 and used the process within a focus group setting to rekindle and sustain an innovative change.
   The aim of the study was to look at staff perceptions surrounding development of the practice of self-administration of medication for patients. The findings support the view that all disciplines need to be involved in health service change.
   Health service employees should have a knowledge of the theory associated with the change process and be open about their views of proposed alterations in practice.
   They also need to have a sense of dissatisfaction with the present, a clear outline of what the problem is and the direction which they intend to take.
   Change involves many complex issues. It should be worked through from a bottom-up approach and consist of repeated evaluation exercises which are akin to a cyclical strategy and include a reflective process.

TI CITYWORK: Application of collaborative technologies for infrastructure

SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes a collaborative maintenance management application called CITYWORK being developed for the Public Works Department at the Fort Gordon Army Installation in Augusta, Ga. The work described in this paper is being carried out in the context of project "CITY" (Civil Infostructure TechnologY-National Science Foundation Grant No. ECS94-22730) to support the sustainable management of civil infrastructure. Infrastructure management requires the coordination of a variety of efforts and integration of information across a range of facilities. CITYWORK addresses coordination, collaboration, and integration in the maintenance management process in a context of sound organizational behavior. The project involves an interdisciplinary team including engineers and social scientists from the IMPACT laboratory at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories, Champaign, Ill. CITYWORK supports the maintenance workflow process by providing private, persistent workspaces for each participant to work on the specific aspects of their interests (e.g., estimators work on generating cost estimates) and share the work with others in an asynchronous manner.

ID ECONOMIC-GROWTH; EMPIRICS
AB The aim of this paper is to analyze the role that aggregate R&D-expenditure plays in economic growth. We introduce a technology of innovation based on expenditure that generates endogenous sustainable growth in absence of any scale effect. This R&D-model permits us to study the effects of some fiscal policies. In particular, we analyze how subsidies to R&D-investment and physical capital accumulation affect the long-run growth rate. For the empirical cross-country analysis we directly derive a structural econometric model.

AB The spatial relationships between land uses and river-water quality measured with biological, water chemistry, and habitat indicators were analyzed in the Little Miami River watershed, OH, USA. Data obtained from various federal and slate agencies were integrated with Geographic Information System spatial analysis functions. After statistically analyzing the spatial patterns of the wafer qualify in receiving rivers and land uses and other point pollution sources in the watershed, the results showed that the water biotic qualify did not degrade significantly below wastewater treatment plants. However, significantly lower water quality was found in areas downstream from high human impact areas where urban land was dominated or near point pollution sources. The study exhibits the importance of integrating water-quality management and land-use planning. Planners and policy-makers at different levels should bring stakeholders together, based on the understanding of land-water relationship in a watershed to prevent pollution from happening and to plan for a sustainable future.

AB Wise and sustainable uses of water resources are essential for an effective river-basin-management planning. Recent management strategy further addresses the fact that quantity and qualify of water are closely interrelated, and both must be considered simultaneously for all wafer resources and water quality management practices. The aim of this paper is to explore the impacts of wafer resources redistribution and pollution prevention actions between and within river basins simultaneously in South Taiwan. Much emphasis will be placed on assessing the impacts of wafer transfer over natural boundary to satisfy the needs of industrial development in the Tseng-Wen River system and its resultant influence on the water qualify in the downstream area of the Kao-Ping River system where the pollution prevention program is to be implemented. The Kao-Ping River was further characterized hydraulically and environmentally, based on a full investigation of discharges and withdrawals in the river reaches. QUAL2E was successfully calibrated and validated using data collected between 1998 and 1999 and the model was capable of predicting the concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, total phosphate-phosphorus, and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) for the entire river system. With the aid of QUAL2E simulation model, it shows eliminating the pig farming activities and constructing the sewer systems in the upstream area of Kao-Ping River cannot guarantee the full compliance with water qualify standards in the downstream area and wafer transfer in the upstream area further increases negative impacts on the water quality in the wet season. The predicted situation of wafer quality in the dry season may even present worse condition. Additional wafer pollution control policy, such as the use of economic instruments for controlling and reducing the waste-load of biochemical oxygen demand and ammonia-nitrogen is needed in the Kao-Ping River system in the long run.

AB In recent years, water-quality deterioration associated with rapid socio-economic development in the Lake Erhai Basin, China, has acquired more and more attention from the public and the government. An effective planning for the basin's environmental management system is desired for sustainable regional development In this study, an environmental system dynamics model, named ErhaiSD, is developed for supporting this planning task. The ErhaiSD consists of dynamic simulation models that explicitly consider information feedback that governs interactions in the system. Such models are capable of synthesizing component-level knowledge into system behaviour simulation at an integrated level. This capability is very useful in analyzing and recommending policy decisions. For the study case, interactions among a umber of system components within a time frame of 15 years are examined dynamically. Four planning alternatives are considered. The base run is based on an assumption that the existing pattern of human activities will prevail in the entire planning horizon, and the other alternatives are based on previous planning studies. The contributions of various nonpoint pollution sources to the lake's eutrophication problems, and the effects of industrial activities and wastewater treatment processes on pollution problems in the Xier River are analyzed through the developed modeling system. The exercise draws attention to the implications of different alternatives to the system's environmental and socio-economic objectives. The modeling results are directly useful for simulating and evaluating a variety of decision actions and their dynamic consequences, and answering questions such as 'What should I do?', 'What if I do?' and 'What are the expected consequences?'.

AB When dealing with large-scale environmental contamination, as following the Chernobyl accident, changed land use such that the products of the land are radiologically acceptable and sustain an economic return from the land is a potentially sustainable remediation option. In this paper, willow short rotation coppice (SRC) is evaluated on radiological, technical and economic grounds for W. European and Belarus site conditions. Radiocaesium uptake was studied in a newly established and existing SRC. Only for light-texture soils with low soil potassium should cultivation be restricted to soils with contamination levels below 100 370 kBq m(-2) given the TFs on these soils (5 x 10(-4) and 2 x 10(-3) m(2) kg(-1)) and considering the Belarus exemption limit for firewood (740 Bq kg(-1)). In the case of high wood contamination levels ( > 1000 Bq kg(-1)). power plant personnel working in the vicinity of ash conveyers should be subjected to radiation protection measures. For appropriate soil conditions, potential SRC yields are high. In Belarus, most soils are sandy with a low water retention, for which yield estimates are too low to make production profitable without irrigation. The economic viability should be thoroughly calculated for the prevailing conditions. In W. Europe, SRC production or conversion is not profitable without price incentives. For Belarus, the profitability of SRC on the production side largely depends on crop yield and price of the delivered bio-fuel. Large-scale heat conversion systems seem the most profitable and revenue may be considerable. Electricity routes are usually unprofitable. It could be concluded that energy production from SRC is potentially a radiologically and economically sustainable land use option for contaminated agricultural land. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Contamination by gasoline and diesel fuels is a threat to groundwater resources. Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which can represent up to 60% of volume in diesel fuels are of particular concern because many of them are carcinogenic and they are persistent, especially in oxygen-limited environment. Despite the development of alternative approaches, pump and treat continues to be the leading technology for the remediation of groundwater contaminated by gasoline and diesel fuels. The efficiency of this technology is however limited by the low solubility of the aromatic hydrocarbons. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of humic acids on the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons from petroleum products in groundwater aquifers and to evaluate the potential use of humic acids, as a cost effective additive, in groundwater and soil remediation. In order to prove the feasibility of using humic acid in the field, a pilot scale experiment was conducted in a model aquifer with a very dense monitoring network, providing controlled conditions only possible in a semi-artificial system. In addition, different sources of humic acids were compared with surfactants for their ability to bind PAHs.

AB Land productivity can decline when top soil is lost. In Kentucky, limited resource farmers often produce vegetable crops on erodible lands. The objectives of this study were 1) to quantify the impact of three soil management practices (SMPs) on quantity of potato produced on erodible land, 2) to evaluate the impact of pyrethrin and azadirachtin insecticides on potato tuber quality, and 3) to assess the impact of yard waste compost on the chemical composition (ascorbic acid, free sugars, phenol contents) of potato tubers. Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Kennebec) were grown in a silty loam soil of 10% slope. Plots (n = 18) were 3.7 m wide and 22 m long (10% slope), with metal borders of 20 cm above ground level. Two botanical insecticides, Multi-Purpose Insecticide (containing pyrethrin 0.2%) and Neemix 4EC (containing 0.25% azadirachtin) were sprayed twice on potato foliage during, each of two growing seasons (1997 and 1999) at the recommended rates of 6 lbs and 2 gallons.acre(-1), respectively. The SMPs were tall fescue strips (FS) intercropped between each two potato rows, soil mixed with yard waste compost (COM) and no-mulch (NM) treatment (roto-tilled bare soil). The experimental design was a 2 x 3 x 3 factorial with main factors of two insecticides and three SMPs replicated three times. Average potato yield was lowest in NM and FS and highest in COM treatments. Yield obtained from the bottom of the plots was greater than that obtained from the top of plots. Tuber defects (rot, scab, sun green, hollow heart, necrosis, and vascular discoloration) were significantly different between the two growing seasons. The two insecticidal treatments did not have much influence on potato yield or tuber defects. Tubers obtained from tall fescue treatments had low levels of ascorbic acid and reducing sugars compared to compost treatments.

AB This article reports the main results of a four-country comparative analysis of the relationship between social exclusion and environmental attitudes and behaviour. Five socially excluded groups were studied through secondary data analysis and case studies. Norms of environmental behaviour tended to be universalized in Germany and Switzerland with much greater differentiation of the socially excluded in Britain and Greece. There were also significant differences between the socially excluded groups with lone parents likely to be particularly receptive to appropriate policy measures. Policy measures are reviewed in relation to the concept of empowerment. Environmental policy could be more effective if it was sensitized to the differential effect of measures on social groups.

AB The paper presents a robot prototype designed for the autonomous fuelling of vehicles, with attention on users safety and surrounding impact. The overall duty is analysed and proper suggestions are developed to organise the operation cycle in view of regulatory schemes, most likely, soon issued by Authorities for development sustainability rules. The manipulation architecture appears to be central requirement for the effectiveness of any feasible fixture and the main characteristics of the purposely selected solution are shortly summarised. For the related overseeing arrangement, the project moves from an analysis of prototypal fixtures, already built and tested in the USA and EU, and looks about opportunities in standardising subsets of vehicles devices to simplify the fuelling tasks.

AB The long-held precept of equating entry barriers with sustainable incumbent advantage increasingly is met with skepticism as incidents of innovative late entrants leapfrogging over market incumbents become more pervasive across industries. Ostensibly, the reassessment of the traditional assumptions underlying entry barrier strategy has become imperative; to this end, the authors present a framework that investigates the contingent effects of incumbents' barrier building on their own performance. Specifically, the authors examine five types of entry barriers (capital requirements, cost advantages, switching costs, distribution access; and proprietary assets) for the nature of their impact in the following presupposed yet unresolved roles: (1) as effectual versus ineffectual entry deterrents and (2) as enablers versus inhibitors of incumbents' innovativeness. In addition, the authors take other variables into account (i.e., competitors' innovativeness and incumbents' market and technological orientation to identify the contingencies of the framework. Using data from Korean consumer product industries, the authors empirically test and substantiate the variable (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) impact of entry barriers on incumbents' performance.

SO JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND PHILOSOPHY

DE dependency; equity; Medicare; need; sustainability
AB There are two puzzles about health care for children that need explanation. Why is it the sentimentality Americans express about children has not been backed by solid health care programs? If children are to have good health care, how can a case for their high priority be made, particularly in light of the fact that their health is the best of all age groups in the country? The first question is explored, but the second question is the focus of this paper. A priority system for health care is proposed, and at the same time an argument is presented for why children should have a high priority despite their generally good health.

ID INFORMATION
AB Business to consumer electronic commerce has been growing at a rapid pace over the last few years. This growth is only sustainable in the future if consumers feel they are receiving a good value. In this article, I explore the costs to the consumer of participating in electronic markets and compare those costs with traditional retail outlets. Empirical data were collected and analyzed. The results show that there is no significant difference in the price of goods sold via electronic markets versus traditional markets. The results also indicate that consumers perceive electronic commerce as more risky (as measured by concern over credit card and personal data) than traditional markets. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Aim: The aim of the study was to investigate the most frequent causes of perinatal mortality in Bosnia and Herzegovina
   Methods: We analyzed in a retrospective study over a one year period (1999) the folloving cantons: Sarajevo, Mostar, Tuzla, Bihac, Gorazde, Travnik, Zenica, which represent about one half of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
   Results: Perinatal mortality in the analyzed regions within Bosnia and Herzegovina was 19.55 parts per thousand, which is unacceptable in comparison with developed countries. Early neonatal mortality (9 parts per thousand) was lower than late fetal mortality 10.55 parts per thousand. The most frequent causes of death were: premature birth, 6.32% of all deliveries; EPH gestosis with a rate of 9% of all deliveries and fetal anomalies with 0.68% of all deliveries. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, prematurity is the cause of early neonatal mortality in 78.5% of cases, while fetal anomalies are the cause in the early new-born period in 10.70% of cases.
   Conclusion: The results of perinatal mortality analyses in Bosnia and Herzegovina confirm that perinatal mortality directly depends on the development of the health care system, economic sustainability, and living conditions. Our results show that Bosnia and Herzegovina fall into the category of developing country with a perinatal mortality rate of 19.55 parts per thousand.

TI Effects of silicate materials on growth and grain yield of rice plants
   grown in clay loam and sandy loam soils
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
LA English
DT Article
ID NITROGEN
AB The usefulness of silicate materials in rice cultivation has been reported by a number of authors. However, very little has been done to study recycling of silicon (Si)-rich plant residues, such as the use of rice chaffs as soil amendments. Pot experiments were conducted in a green-house at Gifu University in 1997. In this investigation, powdered rice chaff (Cp) and normal rice chaff (Ch) were mixed in a fertile clay loam soil and an infertile sandy loam soil, with or without a biodecomposer (Wara soil). Calcium silicate was also applied to the soils for comparison. For both types of soils, six treatments were replicated four times giving 48 pots (24 x 2) in total with a randomized complete block design. Rice plants (Oryza sativa L. cv. Hatsushimo) were grown in pots filled with the soils as treated above, and the growth and Si and nitrogen (N) contents in the plants and grain yield were determined. Application of rice chaffs had little effect on plant height, but slightly increased the number of tillers per pot. The total N content of the plants was decreased in the clay loam soil but not in the sandy loam soil, but the Si content in the plants, grown in both soils, was increased. The effect of Cp and Ch on the Si content of plants was significantly enhanced by the addition of the biodecomposer. Both organic and inorganic silicate materials increased the number of grains and the dry weights of grains. The application of Cp together with the biodecomposer was the most effective. Cp could be used instead of inorganic Si fertilizer, providing a sustainable Si recycle system in rice cultivation.

ID ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES
AB This paper describes the current status of sustainable development in civil engineering. The discussion covers economy along with "global village" needs, and is supported by information about technology standards combined with notions of ethics, environment, aesthetics, and heritage-the philosophical understanding of the cultural landscape of the society. It is recognized that "true development" cannot be limited to purely technical problems; "human ecology" should be taken into account. The concepts of sustainable development require input from all mankind, but civil engineering professionals can play a particular role here; their spiritual motivation can often be a decisive argument for their material handling. This means that "true development," referred to as the dignity of man, must be based on the priority of spirit versus matter, of person versus object, of ethics versus technology.

TI Water pressure: irrigation, governance and land use intensification in
   Maungatapere, New Zealand
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE New Zealand; irrigation; horticulture; governance; land use
   intensification
AB This paper considers the ways in which state-supported proposals for an irrigation scheme contributed to reorienting land use and community dynamics in Maungatapere, a semi-rural locality in Northland, New Zealand. This scheme was first proposed in the early 1980s - a time when key preoccupations of the state included protecting primary industry and promoting land-based production. Soon after, however, such intervention was seriously challenged by free-market philosophies, and state ownership and maintenance of irrigation schemes gave way to user pays and privatisation. At Maungatapere, these changes resulted in delays in approval for the irrigation scheme, a reduction in its area, and the eventual development of an infrastructure which was rapidly sold to private interests. We draw on historical evidence and 1997 survey data to explore land-owner decision-making and perceptions. Our analysis incorporates contemporary concerns for land use intensification, governance and community sustainability. We interpret the irrigation scheme as always having been an object of governance, from its initial conception as a community scheme in the context of assisted agriculture, through to its subsequent metamorphosis into a proprietary scheme reflecting a more market-oriented government vision. We conclude that a focus on one specific place offers insights into the processes whereby policy is translated into practices. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   environment
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Coal washery effluents contain large amounts of suspended solids and high COD values and they create serious water pollution problem in which they are discharged. The solids in suspension are colloidal in nature and possess high coking value. Thus in addition to water pollution and siltation on the river bed, good quality of coking coal is being lost. It shows the ineffectiveness of the present effluent treatment system. One large coal washery has been surveyed and the characteristics of the effluent have been evaluated. Treatability study for the removal of suspended solids has been conducted. The effectiveness of the use of. different conventional and synthetic polymeric flocculates for the removal of suspended solids have been evaluated. Studies also involved the identification of a suitable flocculent and to develop a methodology for the effective removal of suspended solids from the effluent. A treatment scheme has been suggested which will make it feasible to design a cost-effective treatment plant for coal washery and the supernatant liquid can be recycled or safely discharged without causing surface water pollution. it would maintain the acceptable balance between environmental management and sustainable development of coal washeries in the region.

AB The effect of management practices associated with livestock grazing on soil properties are largely unknown. Several physical, chemical and biological soil properties were compared for soil from a native vegetation exclosure, a moderately grazed native vegetation pasture stocked at 2.6 ha (6.4 ac) steer(-1), a heavily grazed native vegetation pasture stocked at 0.9 ha steer(-1), and and a fertilized crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L. Gaertn.) pasture stocked at 0.9 ha steer(-1) near Mandan, North Dakota. The three native vegetation pastures were established in 1916 and the crested wheatgrass pasture was seeded in 1932. Soil properties varied in sensitivity to the management practices. Measures of vegetation and animal production, combined with assessment of soil properties suggest that moderate grazing and fertilization of crested wheatgrass are viable management options that appear to be sustainable while providing good and services needed by society. Range and pasture assessment should include soil assessment to more completely determine management effects on pastoral ecosystems.

AB Farmers and scientists are using topographic maps resulting from data collected by differentially corrected global positioning systems (DGPS) to identify management zones and characterize the influence of conservation practices and landscape position on soil productivity, erosion, and agricultural sustainability. To develop accurate topographic maps, watershed managers must know positional errors associated with the different types of differentially corrected global positioning systems (DGPS). The objective of this study was to determine under field conditions, the vertical errors associated with real time kinematic (RTK) and real time stop-and-go (RTSG) sampling approaches using a single frequency carrier phase DGPS and RTK using CIA code DGPS. Research was conducted with and without selective availability. This experiment showed that elevation information determined by: 1.) a single frequency carrier phase DGPS receiver using RTK and RTSG sampling approaches, measured prior and post selective availability, had consistent results with standard deviations of less than 3.5 cm; 2.) a CIA code DGPS receiver, measured prior and post selective availability, had inconsistent results with relatively large standard deviations (83-100 cm); and 3.) GPS, measured post selective availability, had inconsistent results with relatively large standard deviations (100-200 cm). Results suggest that caution should he used in using elevation information collected from CIA code DGPS or GPS.

AB Increasing population pressure in Niger has increased demand for arable land leading to expansion of cropping into marginal land resulting in soil erosion anti diminishing pasture, woodland and forest area which threatens ecosystem sustainability. Highly variable: rainfall adds risk to crop production. Intensification of agriculture with adoption of sustainable, yield enhancing technologies is critical to the future development of all agroecological regions in Niger. Farm constraints analysis of crop productivity conducted in rainfed areas of the Niger by farmer surveys and on-farm experiments revealed that the major limitations to increased productivity were (1) low soil fertility and lack of fertilizer use, (2) limited organic manure availability, (3) low mineral nutrient use efficiency of crops when fertilizers were applied during soil moisture stress, (4.) lack of high yielding varieties resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses, (5) practice of using low plant densities, (6) limited access to farm inputs, (7) lack of a marketing strategy, and (8) lack of adequate extension service to farmers. The use of improved technologies, such as fertilizer, improved varieties or hybrids, optimum plant density and water conservation technologies were shown to increase yields more than two-fold at the farm level. Key elements in a strategy to increase total crop production in Niger must include support from both the private and public sectors to promote more rapid acceptance of improved production technologies. This will require institutional modifications that enhance technology transfer, development of input delivery systems, improved policies of land tenure, availability of fertilizer, and improved policies that affect the input and output pricing structure.

AB Since 1997. the Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander (UFPS), Cucuta, Colombia, the Universidad de la Republica (UDELAR), Uruguay, and the Nova Scotia Agricultural College (NSAC), Nova Scotia, Canada, have been working to develop a new curriculum at UFPS with a locus on sustainable agriculture. The department of Norte de Santander is primarily agricultural with the majority of its rural population practising subsistence agriculture. The situation of peasant farmers has deteriorated over the past years, due in part to the introduction of high volume crops. High volume export crops have appropriated some of the lest land, thus reducing available land for peasant farmers. The rural population is growing at a rate of 1.8% p.a., thus placing increased pressure on a smaller land base. Those pressures have resulted in the deterioration of the land farmed by the smallholder and the degradation of the surrounding environment. Compounding the circumstances of the family farm is the migration of males to urban areas. The curriculum is being developed to address the issues facing rural Partners, with a focus on soil and plant conservation, production optimization, soil amendment alternatives, low-input agriculture systems and marketing practices. Special attention is being paid to the situation of women farmers, including their training needs. The activities focus on three areas: curriculum development in sustainable agriculture; extension module development; and training for UFPS and NGO extension agents. The new courses being developed are flexible and are to be used within the university program, but also are being used in an upgrading for the UMATAs-Agrarian Technical Assistance Municipal Units-which work directly with peasant farmers, the majority of whom are women. This paper provides some background on the university, the area, and the North-South and South-South linkages that have been developed. The project is ending its second year and a summary of the progress and learnings are discussed.

ID ZEA-MAYS
AB With increasing concerns about the environment, better use of the natural resource base, less use of chemicals and efficient use of irrigation water have become increasingly important goals of sustainable agriculture in Egypt. A field trial was conducted for two years to evaluate the effect of biofertilizers on maize yield in rotation with wheat as affected by irrigation regime. Fertilization treatments were: control, full N fertilizer application rate (288 kg N/ha), fertilization with Azospirillum brasilense, Azospirillum brasilense + half the full rate (144 kg N/ha), commercial biofertilizer Cerealin and Cerealin + half the full rate (144 kg N/ha). The two irrigation treatments were I-1 (100%) and I-2, (75%) of depth of water determined using the Class A Pan method. An economic partial budget analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of different treatments on maize yield. Data obtained revealed that using Azospirillum brasilense or commercial biofertilizer Cerealin with half N rate (144 kg N/ha) resulted in a significant increase in yield. Class A Pan can be used as a prediction method for maize water requirements. Economically Cerealin with half the normal N application had an average higher net benefit, benefit/cost ratios and marginal rate of return values when compared to the other types of N-fertilizers, indicating the possibility of saving half of the N fertilizer applied to maize. Use of biofertilizers offers agronomic and environmental benefits for intensive agricultural systems such as those used in Egypt. (C) 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Model social processes useful in facilitating sustainable development are advanced from our team experiences with a case study. The processes are: learn how to learn as a team and community, use a model process that reveals shared interests anti leverageable points, and then facilitate local stakeholders in developmental action. The case provided the team the opportunity to learn to describe and comprehend the case agroecosystem as a whole-natural elements and social relationships. Dialogue among stakeholders created an awareness and clarity of leverageable issues. Team engagement with local stakeholders facilitated efforts to organize, integrate information and motivate developmental action. Case issue lessons were: farmers need information to transition to more sustainable forms of agriculture, institutional mechanisms are needed to support the development of new markets, consumers need information on the benefits of using agricultural products that enhance their environment, and the public needs to share responsibility for food safety and health rather than generating more governmental regulation. This sustainable development model process is presented to inform other farm-community change efforts.

AB The Schoharie County Local Agri-Preneurship Project for Next Generation Farmers (hereafter, the SCHOCO-LOCA project) was initiated to determine the opportunities and harriers facing that locale's new agriculturists. Using data collected from a series of focus groups including area high school students, farmers, and agricultural, financial, educational and human service professionals, the study identifies a set of barriers named by the acronym TAGS (Technical problems, Assumptions, Community concerns and Social issues) that is threatening the health and future of Schoharie County's agricultural industry.
   After examining the changing structure of U.S. agriculture and the concomitant impact on Schoharie County, the study explains the problems that collectively create the barrier of TACS. Technical problems included a lack of custom services, lack of knowledge about farm transfers, an unfulfilled demand for information about alternative agriculture, and a need for improved business management skills. Observed assumptions included feelings that the state's land grant school was not concerned with the county's agricultural future, impressions that new farmers were destined for a life of poverty, and that new agricultural businesses were necessarily part of a conventional, input-intensive agricultural paradigm. Community concerns expressed by focus groups included a lack of cooperation and communication between different agencies, an impression within the education system that agricultural courses arc generally meant for students who are incapable of handling traditional classroom instruction, a community-wide perception that the local state agricultural college is not a respected post-secondary education institution, conflicts among the agricultural and non-agricultural community members, and confusion among the agricultural service industry regarding who is a farmer deserving of support services, and who is not. Social issues facing the farmers included relationship strife amongst themselves, an independent mindset that prevents farmers from seeking assistance, isolation, apathy and depression, and a need to organize the agricultural sector for political purposes. Recommendations include suggestions for helping farmers work together, capitalizing on new agricultural trends for diversification and niche marketing, and acknowledging the importance of local agriculture on a community-wide basis. While this study addresses the specific concerns of one rural community, practitioners in the yield of sustainable agriculture development may find some of the concepts insightful as they reflect on their own situations and experiences.

TI Land use practices in Lesotho: Implications for sustainability in
   agricultural production
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE Lesotho; agriculture; land-use; sustainable production
AB The Kingdom of Lesotho is a small mountainous country that is completely surrounded by South Africa. With an estimated land area of 30,358 km(2) only about 13% is suitable for arable production with agriculture contributing about 14% of the Gross National Product (GNP).
   In the past, the country was able to feed itself and in good years surpluses were produced and exported to other countries. However, during the 1920's, food production in the country began to decline and by 1930 Lesotho has become a net importer of food grains.
   The central theme of this paper is to examine the land use practices in Lesotho and how these have affected Food production and their implications: for sustainable agriculture in the country.
   The land use practices adopted in Lesotho include the extensive extractive cultivation system that leads to over-exploitation of the soil with serious land depletion and soil erosion problem. This system has contributed to massive land loss that the country has witnessed in the last decades.
   Also, the unplanned and uncoordinated use of the range lands by farmers has led to serious overstocking of the grazing land. The communal land tenure system discourages long-term investment on the land for soil conservation and regeneration. The aftermath is that the number of rural households that are landless has steadily increased over the years.
   To sustain productivity, the stock of natural resources like land should remain non-declining to meet the criterion for sustainability. It is therefore recommended that efforts be made to reverse this trend of soil and land loss in Lesotho. This would significantly expand agricultural growth, ensure food security and above all conserve land for future generation.

DE cost efficiency analysis; conventional farming; sustainable farming
AB This study compares the scale efficiency scores of conventional and sustainable farms. The analysis includes four different input- and output-oriented efficiency calculations by Constant Return to Scale (CRS) and by Variable Return to Scale (VRS). It was found that sustainable farms have a more profitable input/output relationship than conventional farms. According to an input-oriented scale efficiency analysis, conventional farms have a scale efficiency score of 0.896, while sustainable farms have a score of 0.977. There are, however, certain possibilities to increase the level of farm income in an input-oriented efficiency analysis by reducing present level of chemical fertilizers and pesticide application on both conventional and sustainable farms. For example, a conventional farm with a low efficiency score may increase its level of income by up to 73.2%. with a 18.2% reduction in the cost of pesticide. At the same time, a sustainable farm may also increase its level of income by up to 27.69% by reducing the cost of pesticide. Conventional farms with pesticide application have the lowest efficiency score, though it is certainly possible to increase the level of farm income, according to output-oriented CRS and VRS, by reducing chemical fertilizer and pesticide applications. On conventional rice farms, cost efficiency is highest with application rates of 30 kg of chemical fertilizers, 411 ml of herbicide, and 114 g of pesticide per 0.1 ha. On sustainable farms, cost efficiency is highest with application rates of 5 kg of chemical fertilizers per 0.1 ha and no herbicide or pesticide at all. Farm efficiency is highest in rice farms where raising ducks precludes the application of pesticide.

AB On behalf of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, research has been carried out on how to make Swedish agriculture sustainable with regard to production capacity, environment and profitability. A future development of conventional agriculture (FC) and a future development of organic agriculture (FO) were studied. FC achieves the production and profitability goals as well as the goal of less nitrogen pollution, but not the goals for landscape management, bio-diversity and reduced pesticide use. FO achieves the three later goals, but not the goals for reduced nitrogen pollution and increased production capacity. The optimal solution is a "unified vision" consisting of most cereal, oil seed, root crop, pig and poultry production with FC technology and most hay, milk and beef production with FO technology.

DE Brazil; irrigation; sustainability
AB The planned economic development, under conditions of rapid urbanization and demographic pressure led to the implementation of the PROVARZEAS-KFW Irrigation program in the Espirito Santo state, Brazil, in order to face the challenge of food security (supply) and of related social problems. To determine whether or not the sustainability of this modernization process is feasible, an effort was made to evaluate this program both technically and socio-economically. The results showed, in general terms, the use of an un-sustainable cycle in irrigated production, as much from an agronomic as from an socio-economic perspective. The "extractive" nature of continuous cultivation, to recover investments (production costs), tends to reduce the efficiency of technological options, narrowing the production expansion cycle and disturbing the ecological equilibrium. This situation, derived from inadequate macro-economic and agricultural policies, raised unitary costs, reduced liquid income and induced de-capitalization and farmers' insolvency. In conclusion, the PROVARZEAS-KFW Irrigation program has not offered an intrinsically sustainable production system because of lack of synchronization with the producers' needs and demands, from a holistic, systemic and endogenous perspective.

AB In recent years, especially in the context of sustainable agriculture, Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS), which deals with the farmers' adaptive strategies to the natural, physical and socio-economic environments of an agro-ecosystem, has gained prominence.
   In this paper, an attempt has been made to systematically document the local innovations of traditional rice farmers of the southern most part of India, Kerala. The thirty indigenous practices identified were documented by classifying them into rational and irrational practices based on the evaluation of a group of scientists and agricultural extension officials working in the area. The rational practices were again grouped as those which were evaluated through earlier, reported scientific works and those which had apparent rationality based on the existing scientific theory but needed further research to prove conclusively. It was striking to find that among the thirty resource conserving and risk reducing practices identified it was just to three practices that the scientists and extension officials could not attach any scientific rationality.

AB Education in sustainable agriculture is an increasing priority for farmers and others in the food system. For Cooperative Extension, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and other information providers to give useful advice, it is essential that their educators have relevant recommendations and up-to-date teaching methods. Everyone a Teacher, Everyone a Learner was the title fur two workshops in 1995 designed using the criteria that training in sustainable agriculture (1) must be viewed in a complex framework of social, economic, and environmental factors, and (2) must be inclusive in terms of trainers and audience. Workshops in Nebraska and Indiana, planning and evaluation workshops in Iowa and Illinois, and national distribution of comprehensive training materials, reached more than 750 people in 50 states and several countries. From more than 1,000 individual evaluations of training sessions, we found that the most important topics were planning learning activities, economics of sustainable systems, constraints to adoption of sustainable practices, and resource materials. The most effective learning methods were one-on-one evaluations at the conclusion of the workshops, farm tours, decision cases, and panel discussions or farmer listening sessions. We learned to involve all participants in the program, through discussions, small group work, or presenting and leading sessions. It was essential to make learning goals explicit, design programs to meet people's expectations, and establish an environment of trust. Educators appreciated moving beyond the normal lecture and slide-show format and welcomed innovative learning methods. Training events on farms provided context and added immensely to the learning process. People need to he challenged, have fun, and help others have a positive learning experience. Time for individual discussions and reflection were highly valued, as well as topics that explored natural history or socially-oriented projects in the workshop area. We concluded that evalution should be an integral and ongoing part of the training sessions, and that more emphasis on leadership models was needed in future workshops.

AB The paper reports on the major changes observed in the farming systems of the Harar Highlands of southeastern Ethiopia, with special emphasis on the shift towards trees and shrubs. The study was undertaken during two time periods, 1985-1987 and 1997-1998 with the objectives of characterizing the production systems and their trends, and utilizing information so gained to guide research and extension activities in the study area. It was observed that the farming population had increased, land and large stock holding had decreased slightly, and that crop production was under increasing threats from various scourges, notably pests, weeds, and diseases. In the face of these changes, farmers continued to search for alternative strategies, and the major trend noted was the shift towards naturally growing and cultivated tree and shrub species in general and khat (Chata edulis (Vahl) Forsk. ex Endl.) in particular. This shift increased farm income and promoted crop-livestock integration, thereby improving household food security and enhancing sustainability of smallholder mixed farm systems. The importance of khat to the regional economy was also found to be growing both in the livelihood systems of the people in the study area, and in terms of foreign currency earnings. Despite the critics against the ever-increasing culture of khat, it is argued that the shift towards a khat-based farm economy was unavoidable, and, in the absence of other feasible alternatives, khat production and marketing would remain important to the livelihood systems of people in the study area. In view of this, the roles of the tree component in the farming systems should be duly considered in planning research and extension undertakings in the smallholder farms of the Harar Highlands or Ethiopia.

ID FACULTY
AB This paper extends and improves upon Thomas A. Lyson's (1998) analysis of the environmental, economic, and social components of sustainable agriculture in American land-grant universities. Lyson failed to consider the relationship between two very important variables-the percentage of total time devoted to basic research and communication frequency with farmers-and the orientations of agricultural scientists toward sustainable agriculture and its underlying dimensions. Through the use of multiple classification analysis, we show that these two variables are more important than the independent variables Lyson examined in predicting scientists' allegiance to agricultural sustainability. In addition, Lyson uncritically accepted the notion that sustainable agriculture is the polar opposite of "conventional" agriculture. Our findings indicate that agricultural sustainability is not the epistemological break with productionist research that Lyson makes it out to be. A larger divide appears to exist between land-grant agricultural scientists committed to applied research and direct client service and scientists who conduct basic research with no interaction with farmers.

DE water management; semi-arid and arid lands
AB With the population explosion in Nigeria, water requirements have been expanded resulting in competition between agricultural municipal and industrial users for a finite water supply. Water is the major limiting factor in arid land agriculture. Crop yields in the regions are low due to the temporal and spatial variations in rainfall and the lack of appropriate soil, water and crop technology. This has resulted in Frequent shortfalls in food production and a deterioration of the resource base in many areas. Efforts to alleviate those problems through research are discussed. This paper gives an extensive review of the various water conservation options that may be adopted in arid land agriculture especially in the serni-arid and arid Northern Nigeria. Some of the reviewed water conservation options that are considered feasible for immediate adoption are proposed. In addition, those conservation options that require additional research prior to being considered for adoption are also high-lighted. (C) 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ten early- and 10 medium-maturing sorghum genotypes were evaluated for individual and multiple resistance to anthracnose and grey leaf spot in field trials carried out at Ajiwa (Sahel savanna) and Bagauda (Sudan savanna), Nigeria in the 1995, 1996 and 1997 wet seasons. Among the early-maturing genotypes, five were resistant to anthracnose and two resistant to grey leaf spot, while one genotype ICSV 901 NG had resistance to both. Among the medium-maturing, five genotypes were resistant to anthracnose and grey leaf spot while four of these genotypes, CGM 19/9-1-1, CEM 328/2-1-1-3, Sariasso 10 and Gaya early (local) had low disease scores for both diseases. Further, local landraces had low disease susceptibility and comparable high yields indicating the need to promote their use in areas where they are adapted to ensure sustainable sorghum production. The study shows the availability of sorghum genotypes with stable resistance to anthracnose and grey leaf spot within Nigeria. (C) 2001 by The Haworth Press. Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Producers in the semiarid Canadian prairies have begun to extend and diversify their cropping systems. These newer cropping systems are often considered to be more sustainable. We examine the agronomic, environmental, and economic effects of reducing summer fallow use and including grain lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) in rotation with spring wheat(Triticum aestivum L.). Data from a long-term crop rotation experiment conducted on a medium texture soil at Swift Current, Saskatchewan were analyzed. Four cropping systems were evaluated over the 1979 to 1997 period; namely, fallow-wheat (F-W), fallow-wheat-wheat (F-W-W), continuous wheat (W), and wheat-lentil(W-l). Nitrate leaching below the 120 cm rooting depth of wheat was lower under continuously cropped systems than under fellow-based rotations, and was lowest overall for W-L. Wheat, whether grown on fallow or stubble, used almost all of the available water in the 0-120 cm depth soil profile, but lentil extracted about 1.5 cm less water than wheat. On average, wheat yield was unaffected by inclusion of lentil in the rotation; however, grain protein content was higher in 11 of 18 years. The incidence of leaf spotting diseases in wheat was lowest for wheal grown after lentil and highest for wheat grown on Fallow. Soil quality (soil organic carbon, mineralizable N and C, light fraction organic C, and water stable aggregates) increased with cropping intensity in the order of W-L greater than or equal to W > F-W-W > F-W. Although inputs of non-renewable energy and CO2 emissions were higher Ibr the continuous compared to fallow-based rotations, including lentil in the rotation lowered the energy requirements for N fertilizer and provided an overall 19%, reduction in CO2 emissions. The economics favored the W-L system whenever lentil price was above $350 t(-1). The level of financial risk was lowest for F-W and F-W-W, intermediate for W-L. and highest for W. Our findings confirm the recent changes in land use practices being adopted by producers, and clearly show that extending and diversifying crop rotations by reducing fallow and including pulse crops in the rotation will improve the overall sustainability of agricultural production in this semiarid region.

TI Is sustainable agriculture in Thailand feasible?
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable agriculture; Asian financial crisis; environmentalism; WTO
   and Agreement on Agriculture; Thailand
AB Thailand has pursued a conventional, but rapid economic development model, based on extraction of labour and economic surplus from the agricultural sector. This has happened to a degree where agriculture has been absorbed into the urban economy, producing Tor urban based agribusiness companies and with a majority of rural households dependent on migrant work. The conventional development model was successful from an economic point of view, making Thailand the world's fifth largest exporter of agricultural commodities. The development model, however, has left a significant portion of Thai farmers outside the mainstream of economic success and social development. When the financial crisis doomed on Thailand in 1997 due to overheating of the economy, unwise short-term investments and financial mismanagement, the Thai population had an opportunity to review the development model. The maldevelopment in terms of degradation of natural resources and human values following the rapid economic growth and urbanization, together with many years of authoritarian government rule, triggered an ideological debate among the rapidly growing urban middle class on the direction of development.
   As environmental issues increasingly legitimize a discourse for social protests and for protection of vested interests by grassroots, government agencies and elite social forces alike, it becomes pertinent to analyze these issues in a socio-economic and political context. The Eight Development Plan introduced the concept of "Sustainable Agriculture" as a tribute to those not benefiting from conventional agricultural development. Hence it becomes essential to include economic, socio-cultural, institutional and political analyses along with biophysical resources and production methods. We raise a number of questions as to whether Sustainable Agriculture is economically viable, whether it is socially acceptable and whether it is politically feasible. There is need of a holistic approach integrating biophysical analyses in a framework of social science analyses of the enabling policies and socio-cultural studies of development.

AB Sound rural development strategies must consider the delicate tradeoffs necessary between economic, environmental, and social goals or run the risk of unintended long-term effects, such as sprawl at the expense of the environment. This paper introduces Community-Business Matching, a step toward the creation of a more holistic methodology for identifying appropriate economic development opportunities for rural communities and small towns. This paper presents the CBM framework and describes its application in a pilot case, where a small preservation land trust used CBM to identify development opportunities that would help them ensure the long-term preservation of three historic barns. The pilot study found, contrary to the land trust's expectations, that wood products would be more promising businesses for the site than traditional agricultural firms.

AB This study examines the farming systems in southeastern Nigeria. Using a structured questionnaire, 300 farmers were selected through multistage random sampling techniques. The data collected were subjected to descriptive analysis of simple proportions and percentages. Findings from the study revealed that 72% of the respondents engaged in both crop and livestock production. Intercropping was the dominant cropping system with cassava, yam, and maize as the principal arable crops, while cocoa, kolanut, oil palm, rubber, cashew, banana/ plantain and citrus were the main permanent crops. The dominant fallow period was found to be three to four years and most farm sizes were less than 2 hectares. The study also showed that 88% of the respondents knew of fertilizer, 61% knew of other agrochemicals, while 56% and 16% utilized them, respectively. Findings generally point to inefficiencies in some of the existing farming practices. Addressing the constraints identified in this study may improve the farming systems in the study area and thus increase agricultural production on a sustainable basis.

ID AGRICULTURE; DEFINITIONS
AB Sustainable agriculture is the development of technology and practices that maintain the production of a safe: nutritious food that is sustainable at a long term both economically and physically. In Lebanon, sustainable agriculture is still a new approach due to the impact of the civil war on this sector leading to the degradation of natural resources. The main objective of this paper is to study the economic sustainability of a transition from a traditional agropastural system to a rainfed fruit production system in the dry land of Irsal, northeast of Lebanon. Economic and financial analyses for livestock and cherry productions were conducted under different operational scale (small, medium, and large) to estimate systems profitability, and thus justify the economic motivation for such changes. The cherry crop was used in this study since it is the most dominant crop in the current changes that are taking place. The results indicate that, the transition from the agropastoral system to fruit production is justifiable given the economic motivations and the increase in the returns due to such changes. Fruit tree production is more profitable and less demanding for time and labor as compared to the old system. However, the continuous existence of the ruminant flocks is due to the fact that they represent a cash stock that can be liquidated in times of need. (C) 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB The Rural and Remote Mental Health Service (RRMHS) has delivered telepsychiatry services through the use of videoconferencing to South Australian communities since May 1994. The survivability of the service results from a combination of factors that have seen the RRMHS expand to 48 centres and deliver an average of 100 clinical sessions a month. The key factors responsible for the success of the service lie in the model of service delivery, management support, and the implementation of a system for the scheduling and reporting of videoconference activity. The current model of service delivery has evolved over the past seven years and is fundamentally different to the infrastructure established at the implementation stage of the project. A retrospective analysis shows the shift in service delivery models necessary for the sustainability of telepsychiatry services in South Australia.

AB Women's Health Queensland Wide began delivery of community education programmes for rural women via videoconferencing in the year 2000, A series of three, 90 min videoconference sessions from Brisbane were delivered to 13 sites in northern Queensland. The sessions related to health issues for women at midlife. The sessions were delivered by health experts in Brisbane, who provided a short presentation on their topic; the majority of the videoconference was dedicated to questions from the participants. Each site was supported by a technical coordinator, who ensured that the equipment functioned properly, and a local health worker, who facilitated women's participation in the videoconference as well as providing a local services perspective. Women's Health Queensland Wide was responsible for overall planning and promotion of the sessions. Feedback from these programmes demonstrated women's and health-care professionals' acceptance of videoconferencing as a mechanism for receiving health information. Sustainability of these programmes depends upon the following issues: cost, delivery model, and the availability of appropriate technology and women-friendly sites.

AB Canada has taken important steps towards establishing telehealth within its health-rare system. However, in many areas telehealth in Canada has yet to progress beyond the stage of testing feasibility. A recent survey of eight Canadian telehealth programmes that are using videoconferencing indicated that there is little evidence of either clinical or economic benefits compared with conventional care. There are examples of sustainable, routine telehealth services in Canada. However, overall, the number of patients seen by telehealth is still very small in comparison with the number of face-to-face visits. 'People-related' factors seem dominant in determining the degree of success of telehealth applications.

TI Evaluation of a routine telepsychiatry service

DT Article
ID RURAL TELEPSYCHIATRY; TELEMEDICINE; CHILD
AB An assessment was undertaken of a routine telepsychiatry service in rural areas of a Canadian province as a follow-up to a pilot telepsychiatry project. Over two years, there were 546 consultations at the five participating general hospitals, although the level of use varied considerably between them. Health professionals expressed high satisfaction with the service. While there were equipment problems in 17% of all consultations in the second year, they did not seem to affect acceptance of the technique. A cost analysis comparing consultations provided by a visiting psychiatrist and telepsychiatry found a break-even point of 348 consultations a year. However, when use of the videoconferencing network for administrative meetings was considered, the break-even point was 224 consultations a year, substantially below the actual utilization of telepsychiatry. Telepsychiatry appeared to result in increased access to community mental health services, suggesting future increased demand for these. From the perspective of health authorities and health professionals, telepsychiatry proved to be a useful and sustainable addition to existing mental health services.

ID ECOLOGICAL LAND CLASSIFICATION; LONGLEAF PINE; MICHIGAN; USA
AB The most common forestland classification techniques applied in the southeastern United States are vegetation-based. While not completely ignored, the application of multifactor, hierarchical ecosystem classifications are limited despite their widespread use in other regions of the eastern United States. We present one of the few truly integrated ecosystem classifications for the southeastern Coastal Plain. Our approach is iterative, including reconnaissance, plot sampling, and multivariate analysis. Each ecosystem is distinguished by differences in physiographic setting, landform, topographic relief, soils, and vegetation. The ecosystem classification is ground-based, incorporating easily observed and measured factors of landform, soil texture, and vegetative cover associated into ecological species groups identified by two-way indicator species analysis. Canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) that measure the degree of distinctness among ecosystems using different combinations of physiographic, soil, and vegetation datasets are used to verify the classification. The hierarchical ecosystem classification provides a framework for sustainable resource management of our study landscape as an alternative to traditional cover-type or vegetation-based classifications in the southeastern Coastal Plain. This ecosystem classification provides a structural framework that mimics biological organization, by physical drivers, ensuring that information on various ecosystem components are available to assist management decisions made at the ecosystem level.

AB The continuously increasing demand for electric power together with the demand of environmental friendly technologies require a deep acknowledgement of the directions to give to electric power production in order to satisfy both necessities.
   The aim of this work is to evaluate the sustainability of Italian electric system by using the emergy function, a methodology developed in the early 80s by Odum, and its correlated indices. Emergy is a thermodynamic based function that calculates all the fluxes of energy requested to obtain a product going backward to the solar energy invested.
   We analyzed all the inputs concurring to the yield of electricity taking into account not only the final phases of the production but also all the sources and materials that had been necessary for the system to operate. We have performed a wide analysis of all the different types of production focusing on thermoelectric sector.
   We have obtained not only a thermodynamic analysis of electricity production but also an evaluation of the sustainability of the entire process and a scenario for a correct exploitation of resources.

AB We present a thermodynamic analysis of the sustainable use of resources in the province of Modena, focusing the attention on the district of Sassuolo. The methodology that is used is the emergy evaluation. The analysis shows that the Sassuolo district represents the peak of non-sustainability of the whole area, with a huge consumption of non-renewable primary resources, both imported and local. The role of the ceramic tile industry is relevant in the consumption of energy and materials. Different types of factories for ceramics production are compared, representing a good sample of different methods of production. Emergy analysis shows which of these has higher levels of sustainability with respect to the others.

AB The rapid emergence of a global knowledge economy both shortens the timetable for progress on sustainable development and also offers a potential "win-win" alternative to the traditional trade-off between growth and environmental sustainability.
   The Lisbon Strategy and e-Europe initiative to accelerate development of the knowledge economy in Europe already addresses several aspects of social and economic sustainability. However, the trends in most resource-use and environmental impact indicators are still worsening, and much more needs to be done to realise the potential benefits of structural change in business and employment, notably in the service sector.
   The Stockholm and Goteborg EU Summits, and the subsequent Rio+10 conference give a timely and unique opportunity to establish European coherence and leadership in seeking sustainable development in the knowledge economy.
   However, we also need a new clarification of individual and business-level responsibilities for lifestyle and business organisation changes, and a much wider take-up of innovative "win-win" solutions for growth with reductions in resource use and impacts.

AB This paper discusses changes in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems caused by land use. It presents an empirical analysis of changes in land use, agricultural productivity, and socio-economic biomass metabolism in Austria during the 19th and 20th centuries, related to the process of "industrial modernization", i.e. the transition from a society relying entirely on solar energy to the industrial society of today based on fossil fuel use. The development of "human appropriation of net primary production" in connection with the changes in the socio-economic energy system are discussed for the period 1830-1995.

AB Tuna longline effort declined from 23-26 million hooks per year in 1979-82 to 2-4 million hooks per year in 1995-98. Scientific observer coverage averaged 7.5% since 1988-89, but increased in 1992-93 ( mean 23%). Observed catch per unit effort (CPUE) and the numbers of hooks set were used to estimate shark catches. Between 1988-89 and 1997-98, about 450 000 blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 65 000 porbeagles (Lamna nasus) and 25 000 shortfin makos (Isurus oxyrinchus) were caught. In 1997-98, about 45 000 blue sharks, 4000 porbeagles and 3000 makos were caught. Corresponding weight estimates were 1400 t, 150 t and 200 t. CPUE varied between foreign and domestic vessels, between north and south regions and among years, but there were no consistent temporal trends. Most males and females were immature, and most sharks were alive when recovered. Most sharks were processed, but usually only the fins were retained. The New Zealand tuna longline fishery is probably not seriously affecting pelagic shark stocks, but adequate assessment is not currently feasible. Accurate monitoring of Pacific Ocean catches is an important first step towards ensuring sustainability of their populations.

AB A summary is given of allozyme, mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite data for commercially important species (13 fish and 7 shellfish) in Australia's South East Fishery, including contiguous waters and the Tasman Sea. For most fish species, genetic population differentiation was limited and in about half the studies was non-detectable. Striking population differentiation was recorded for gemfish. For fish species, on average only 2-3% of the total genetic variation could be attributed to population differentiation within southern Australian waters. In shellfish, similar to5% of variation arose from population differences. The reduced differentiation of fish populations may be due to a longer larval period and greater adult mobility. Although there was evidence that the Tasman Sea acts as a barrier to gene flow, with most fish species showing significant differences between Australia and New Zealand, the degree of differentiation was small (only similar to2%). The limited genetic differentiation observed for most species is attributable to the lack of major oceanographic and environmental barriers to gene flow, together with influential current systems; it necessitates large sample sizes for good genetic tests. However, significant genetic stock structuring is apparent for several fish and shellfish species-particularly for coastal species, where isolation by distance may explain some of the data. Any evidence for genetic stock structure must be factored into plans for sustainable management.

AB Monthly samples of commercial catches of S. brama were collected between May 1996 and December 1997 in three regions of the fishery: off the east coast of Victoria; eastern Tasmania; and western Bass Strait. Sex ratio, gonadosomatic index, macroscopic and histological development, size at maturity and fecundity were estimated and combined with data on growth and mortality to perform per-recruit analyses. The main spawning period was during winter-spring and there was evidence of spawning in each of the three regions. Blue warehou reach maturity at 30-40 cm fork length. They have a determinate annual fecundity and spawn around three batches of eggs during a season. Eggs-per-recruit analyses revealed maximum egg production at similar to 40 cm (4-5 years) in an unfished population. Gill-net fishing, which targets fish >45 cm, was less likely to affect the relative eggs-per-recruit in a population than trawl fishing, which catches a wider range of smaller fish. These results are discussed in light of the current management arrangements in the fishery and will be used in models to assess the effect of fishing on the long-term sustainability of blue warehou.

AB A spatially disaggregated, length-based, age-structured model for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the western and central Pacific Ocean is described. Catch, effort, length-frequency and tagging data stratified by quarter (for the period 1962-99), seven model regions and 16 fisheries are used in the analysis. The model structure includes quarterly recruitment in each region, 20 quarterly age classes, independent growth patterns for juveniles and adults, structural time-series variation in catchability for all non-longline fisheries, age-specific natural mortality, and age-specific movement among the model regions. Acceptable fits to each component data set comprising the log-likelihood function were obtained. The model results suggest that declines in recruitment, and as a consequence, population biomass, have occurred in recent years. Although not obviously related to overexploitation, the recruitment decline suggests that the productivity of the yellowfin tuna stock may currently be lower than it has been previously. Recent catch levels appear to have been maintained by increases in fishing mortality, possibly related to increased use of fish aggregation devices in the purse-seine fishery. A yield analysis indicates that average catches over the past three years may have slightly exceeded the maximum sustainable yield. The model results also reveal strong regional differences in the impact of fishing. Such heterogeneity in the fisheries and the impacts on them will need to be considered when future management measures are designed.

AB The Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus is widely distributed in the western central Atlantic and supports important fisheries in many of the countries within this area. Total reported landings have been between 27000 and 30000 tonnes per annum over the last decade. However, recent assessments undertaken under the auspices of the Western Central Atlantic Fisheries Commission (WECAFC) have indicated that the resource is being fully or over-exploited over much of its range. The results also revealed widespread deficiencies in the data available, which create problems in undertaking reliable assessments and in the subsequent provision of management advice. The studies, undertaken with full regional participation, suggested that in most countries the need is urgent to control and frequently to reduce fishing effort for the species and that in some countries both spawner biomass and potential yield would benefit from increases in the minimum size of the lobsters caught. This paper describes the fisheries for Caribbean spiny lobster, including their socio-economic importance in the region. It provides an over-view of the results of the 1997 and 1998 WECAFC workshops on the species and of the implications of those results for management for sustainable use. Finally, the need for regional, or, at least, subregional, management of the fisheries is discussed, with reference to the conclusions of the WECAFC 2000 workshop.

AB Individual transferable quotas were successfully introduced into the Tasmanian rock-lobster fishery in 1998. In the two years since, significant industry restructuring has occurred. The move to quota management was intended to meet two key objectives: to reduce the catch to a sustainable level, allowing the stock to rebuild, and to provide a mechanism whereby the industry could achieve economic sustainability. The quota system has achieved early results on both the sustainability and restructuring objectives and is now well accepted and supported by the vast majority of fishers and licence holders. Its effect has been to reduce fishing effort by 29% and number of fishing vessels by 23%, and the reduction in catch has resulted in a 6% increase in the estimated biomass and substantial increases in egg production after one year. Fishers now spend fewer days at sea, and catch rates are improving. These changes are reducing fishing costs, which in time should increase profitability. Social costs of introducing quotas are that fewer fishers are employed on vessels and that fishers now find it harder and more expensive to lease a fishing licence. These costs must be factored into any assessment of the industry.

AB A central issue in gene delivery systems is choosing promoters that will direct defined and sustainable levels of gene expression. Pantropic retroviral vectors provide a means to insert genes into either somatic or germline cells. In this study, we focused on somatic cell infection by evaluating the activity of 3 promoters inserted by vectors into fish cell lines and fish skin using pantropic retroviruses. In bluegill and zebrafish cell lines, the highest levels of luciferase expression were observed from the 5 ' murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat of the retroviral vector. The Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat and cytomegalovirus early promoter, as internal promoters, generated lower levels of luciferase. Luciferase reporter vectors infected zebrafish skin, as measured by the presence of viral DNA, and expressed luciferase. We infected developing walleye dermal sarcomas with retroviral vectors to provide an environment with enhanced cell proliferation, a condition necessary for integration of the provirus into the host genome. We demonstrated a 4-fold to 7-fold increase in luciferase gene expression in tumor tissue over infections in normal walleye skin.

AB Settlement and recruitment of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus was determined by a series of field and laboratory experiments on the South Island of New Zealand. Using settlement samplers, we monitored settlement of larvae at 1 to 2 mo intervals during 1992, 1993 and 1994. Recruitment over the same period was monitored from 3 to 8 mo intervals by quantifying both the density and percentage in the population of recruits (juveniles < 20 mm test diameter). Settlement and recruitment were higher in Doubtful Sound (SE South Island) than in Tory Channel (NE South Island). For Doubtful Sound, a large settlement between August 1992 and February 1993 (up to 1.14 settlers sampler(-1) d(-1)) was followed by an increase in recruit density from 2.1 to 13.8 recruits 20 m(-2) during the subsequent 9 mo (November 1992 to August 1993). Settlement during the following 2 yr was lower (<0.12 sampler(-1) d(-1)), during which time the density of recruits decreased from 13.18 to 2.1 recruits 20 m(-2). A similar pattern was found in Tory Channel where a lower settlement intensity was observed in 1992 (<0.05 sampler(-1) d(-1)) and the density of recruits over the following year was less than 0.6 individuals 20 m(-2), In 1993, settlement was up 10-fold to 0.54 recruits sampler(-1) d(-1), and the density of recruits increased from 0.3 to 5.0 juveniles 20 m(-2) during the following 5 mo, The correlation between settlement and recruitment is described by the linear relationship, y = 1.4 + 0.14x(,) where y = annual recruitment (individuals < 20 mm TD 20 m(-2)) and x = annual settlement (total number of settlers on samplers). Settlement and metamorphosis behavior of competent larvae was examined in the laboratory, Larvae show a preference for natural substrates (i.e. Coralline algae > oyster shell > aged rock > aged plastic) and for surfaces with older biofilms. Given the findings of the current research, settlement samplers may be one tool that can increase our understanding of relative settlement intensity and other recruitment processes in E. chloroticus, and aid in the sustainable management of this species.

AB Macquarie Island is a small subantarctic island that supports a variety of breeding seabird and marine mammal populations, A fishery targeting the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus elegenoides was established around the island in 1994. For ecological sustainable development (ESD) of the fishery, this study investigated the trophic interactions based on diet composition and annual consumption between Patagonian tooth-fish, its fishery, and seals and seabirds within the Macquarie Island Exclusive Economic Zone (MI-EEZ). Annual consumption rates for each predator were estimated from dietary data (mostly published sources), energetic budgets, prey energy content, and population size. Results indicated little predation on toothfish by seals or seabirds, or prey competition between toothfish and other marine predators. The greatest dietary overlap with toothfish was with gentoo penguins (21 % dietary overlap) and southern elephant seals (19 %). These overlaps in diet were small relative to those among fur seals (3 species, greater than or equal to 90 %), giant petrels (84 %), royal and rockhopper penguins (65 %), and king and royal penguins and fur seals (> 60 %). The total annual prey biomass consumed by seabirds, seals, toothfish and the fishery within the MI-EEZ was estimated to be 419 774 t, with the greatest consumption in January, at 2779 t d(-1). Pelagic fish (61 %, mostly myctophids), followed by pelagic crustaceans (28 %, mostly euphausids) and cephalopods (7 %) were the major prey, Most prey biomass was consumed by penguins (88 %), with comparatively small amounts by toothfish (8 %), seals (3 %) other seabirds (<1 %) and the fishery (0.1 %). These results indicate weak trophic linkages between the toothfish, its fishery, and seabirds and seals around Macquarie Island.

AB To describe patterns of gene flow for the fished holothurian species Holothuria scabra 17 to 141 individuals were collected from 8 populations from north-east Australia, the Torres Strait, and the Solomon Islands. Samples were investigated by allozyme electrophoresis of 7 polymorphic loci. Cluster analyses using Rogers' genetic distance identified 3 distinct groups of populations from the north-east coast of Australia, representing samples from the 3 regions Hervey Bay, Upstart Bay and Torres Strait. Populations in the latter region were closely connected to those from the Solomon Islands. F-statistics indicated restrictions in gene flow (average genetic variation between populations, F-ST = 0.088). Hierarchical analyses revealed that 94.7 % of the variation was within sampling locations. Approximately 77 % of the variance among populations was due to differences between regions, and 23 % within regions (most of the latter caused by differences between the 2 Solomon Island populations), Mantel's tests indicated that a high proportion of the variation in genetic distances along the north-east coast of Australia was explained by isolation by distance (Mantel's normalised Z = 0.88). This proportion reduced when the Solomon Islands were included (Z = 0.65). The detection of separate stocks along the north-east coast of Australia is an important finding that has significant consequences for the development of sustainable management plans for this species. Low dispersal may significantly reduce recovery of overfished areas if no local refugia are provided.

AB Eight alien freshwater snail species were introduced into Martinique Island during the last 50 years. The introduced snails include four planorbids (Biomphalaria straminea, Helisoma duryi, Amerianna carinata and Gyraulus sp.), three thiarids (Melanoides tuberculata, M. amabilis and Tarebia granifera) and one ampullarid (Marisa comuarietis). Four of these species rapidly colonized the whole Martinican hydrograph ic system whereas the other four remained restricted to some particular sites. The invasion processes were documented during the last 20 years and showed (i) a rapid invasion of the island by several morphs of M. tuberculata at the beginning of the 80; (ii) the introduction of T. granifera in 1991 and M. amabilis in 1997; and (iii) the rapid spread of these last two species throughout the island. In the Years following its introduction, M. tuberculata was used in biological control experiments against the snail hosts of schistosomiasis, B. glabrata and B. straminea. Experiments were conducted with success in several groups of water-cress beds which constituted the latest transmission sites for schistosomiasis at the beginning of the 80. A malacological survey carried out in 2000 all over the island showed the absence of B. glabrata but the presence of some residual populations of B. straminea. Long-term studies carried out in Martinique have shown that the thiarids are able to maintain relatively stable populations over a long period of time, thus preventing recolonization by the snail hosts. Within this context the invasion of the hydrographic system of Martinique by thiarid snails has resulted in an efficient and sustainable control of the intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis.

AB Demands on modern copper base materials are still growing. Problems to be solved do not only address technological properties and global availability. Compatibility of new products with environment, health, safety and sustainability is required more and more. This has a strong impact on the development of materials and products. Some common alloy constituents are identified as potentially hazardous. Replacements for the functionality of those thought to be hazardous elements appear to become increasingly, interesting. Constraints, limitations and chances of modern state-of-the-art product development are illustrated. Selected examples are given.

DT Article
AB After 1991, when Slovenia became independent, there was a transitional phase with many uncertainties about its future development in general and specially regarding the rural areas. Among experts, two alternative views about the future population and distribution of jobs within the territory of Slovenia could be identified:
   1. concentration in the vicinity of the main highway and railway network,
   2. polycentric development with rather similar conditions for work and life in all Slovenian regions
   Planned development should conform to the diversified development potentials of individual geographic regions. An efficient intersectoral coordination is needed in order to realise a sustainable development.
   The concentration of economic activities and population in urban areas triggered man), problems in spite of growing living standards. Genuine well-being and quality, of life require much more than material life standard, and therefore could not be measured by statistical indicators only.
   Chances for life and work in different Slovenian regions differ very much. Besides preserving the identity and characteristics of individual areas ill Slovenia it is also necessary to safeguard as much as possible "equitable" conditions for life and work, especially for young people.
   One of the important conditions for preserving at least a minimum population in the mountainous areas throughout the year is the cultivation of agricultural land. Only, a permanent population in these areas will ensure the maintenance of the basic infrastructure (transport network, health care and shopping facilities). Without this tourism could not be developed. The preservation of a permanent population in the mountainous and less developed areas should, therefore, be promoted also from the point of view of the national economy.
   In order to create "equitable" chances for work in different geographic areas of Slovenia, we also need a suitable administrative organisation with a proper network of central places. Appropriate coordination between the state administration and local government on the intermediate (regional) level between communes and the state should be introduced.

AB We present agent-based modelling and social simulation in particular application to ecosystem management. The steps in designing and building an agent-based model are discussed, as are the methodological problems typically encountered. Examples of relevant agent-based models are given. The task of integrated ecosystem management is considered and examples are given of agent-based modelling in this context. As a further illustration, consideration is given to a possible agent-based model of the Fraser River watershed in British Columbia, and to particular difficulties that it presents.

AB A framework is presented for analysis of the long-term sustainability of freight trucking in the context of the intermodal freight transportation system. The role of the trucking industry among other transportation modes is described, including an explanation of transportation system sustainability. Topics include the present view of issues surrounding the trucking industry in a sustainable transportation system; views of students, academia, and industry on freight trucking in a sustainable transportation system; and a framework to use in analyzing the role of government and industry in moving toward sustainability. This framework brings into perspective the conditions of transportation system sustainability and freight trucking factors affecting it. The findings are based on data collected through a literature search, a set of focused discussions, and a survey of freight trucking company executives.

AB Many soils of the lowland humid tropics are thought to be too infertile to support sustainable agriculture. However; there is strong evidence that permanent or semi-pennanent agriculture can itself create sustainably fertile soils known as 'Terra Preta' soils. These soils not only contain higher concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium, but also greater amounts of stable soil organic matter. Frequent findings of charcoal and highly aromatic humic substances suggest that residues of incomplete combustion of organic material (black carbon) are a key factor in the persistence of soil organic matter in these soils. Our investigations showed that 'Terra Preta' soils contained up to 70 times more black carbon than the surrounding soils. Due to its polycyclic aromatic structure, black carbon is chemically and microbially stable and persists in the environment over centuries. Oxidation during this time produces carboxylic groups on the edges of the aromatic backbone, which increases its nutrient-holding capacity. We conclude that black carbon can act as a significant carbon sink and is a key factor for sustainable acid fertile soils, especially in the humid tropics.

AB Many changes have taken place in Amazonas Province of Venezuela, since Alexander von Humboldt's trip to the region. The most important changes today are in the way that land, which is inhabited by indigenous peoples, is being developed. There is an emphasis on small-scale., non-exploitative, sustainable agriculture, and on forest industries that are locally owned and operated. Cooperation with and protection of indigenous peoples and their environment, as opposed to the devastation caused by large-scale corporate industry, is of the utmost importance. This is very much in keeping with the legacy of Alexander von Humboldt.

TI Low cost, proliferation resistant, uranium-thorium dioxide fuels for
   light water reactors
SO NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB Our objective is to develop a fuel for the existing light water reactors (LWRs) that, (a) is less expensive to fabricate than the current uranium-dioxide (UO2) fuel: (b) allows longer refueling cycles and higher sustainable plant capacity factors: (c) is very resistant to nuclear weapon-material proliferation: (d) results in a more stable and insoluble waste form; and (e) generates less high level waste. This paper presents the results of our initial investigation of a LWR fuel consisting of mixed thorium dioxide and uranium dioxide (ThO2-UO2). Our calculations using the SCALE 4.4 and MOCUP code systems indicate that the mixed ThO2-UO2 fuel, with about 6 wt.% of the total heavy metal U-235, could be burned to 72 MW day kg(-1) (megawatt thermal days per kilogram) using 30 wt.%, UO2 and the balance ThO2. The ThO2-UO2 cores can also be burned to about 87 MW day kg(-1) using 35 wt.% UO2 and 65% ThO2 with an initial enrichment of about 7 wt.% of the total heavy metal fissile material. Economic analyses indicate that the ThO2-UO2 fuel will require less separative work and less total heavy metal (thorium and uranium) feedstock. At reasonable future costs for raw materials and separative work. the cost of the ThO2-UO2 fuel is about 9%, less than uranium fuel burned to 72 MW day kg(-1). Because ThO2-UO2 fuel will operate somewhat cooler, and retain within the fuel more of the fission products, especially the gasses. ThO2-UO2 fuel can probably be operated successfully to higher burnups than UO2 fuel. This will allow for longer refueling cycles and better plant capacity factors. The uranium in our calculations remained below 20 wt.% total fissile fraction throughout the cycle, making it unusable for weapons. Total plutonium production per MW day was a factor of 3.2 less in the ThO2-UO2 fuel than in the conventional UO2 fuel burned to 45 MW day kg(-1). Pu-239 production per MW day was a factor of about 4 less in the ThO2-UO2 fuel than in the conventional fuel. The plutonium produced was high in Pu-238, leading to a decay heat about three times greater than that from plutonium derived from conventional fuel burned to 45 MW day kg(-1) and 20 times greater than weapons grade plutonium. This will make fabrication of a weapon more difficult. Spontaneous neutron production from the plutonium in the ThO2-UO2 fuel was about 50% greater than that from conventional fuel and ten times greater than that from weapons grade plutonium. High spontaneous neutron production drastically limits the probable yield of a crude weapon. Because ThO2 is the highest oxide of thorium while UO2 can be oxidized further to U3O8 or UO3, ThO2-UO2 fuel appears to be a superior waste form if the spent fuel is to be exposed ever to air or oxygenated water. And, finally, use of higher burnup fuel will result in proportionally fewer spent fuel bundles to handle, store, ship, and permanently dispose of. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) has many functions, the relative importance of which differ with soil type, climate, and land use. Commonly the most important function of OM in soil is as a reserve of the nitrogen and other nutrients required by plants, and ultimately by the human population. Other important functions include: the formation of stable aggregates and soil surface protection; maintenance of the vast array of biological functions, including the immobilization and release of nutrients; provision of ion exchange capacity; and storage of terrestrial carbon (C). This paper considers the quantity and quality of SOM of soils in the tropics, which are estimated to contain one quarter of the C in the global pool in terrestrial soils, and supports strongly the use of analytical methods to characterizing labile SOM to develop valuable insights into C dynamics. As in other regions, the transformation of tropical lands for agriculture exploits SOM, and in particular nutrient reserves. The process of exploitation is accelerated in the tropics by the necessity to increase agricultural production, largely through agricultural intensification, to overcome inadequate nutrition, to satisfy population growth, and to cope with the limited reserves of arable land. Poverty has an overriding influence on the exploitation and degradation processes. Areas at greatest risk of land degradation are the infertile acid soils of the tropics, which, invariably, are cultivated by the poor. Soil organic matter has a central role in sustainable land management, but perspectives on the roles of SOM differ widely between farmers, consumers, scientists and policy-makers. Some consider SOM as a source of nutrients to be exploited, whereas others can afford to utilize it as a key component in the management of the chemical, biological, and physical fertility of soils. Still others see SOM as a dumping ground for excess nutrients and toxins, or as a convenient store for fossil fuel emissions, particularly CO(2). Farmers need sustainable land management systems that maintain OM and nutrient reserves. Nevertheless, many available practices, whether based on indigenous or scientific knowledge, do not meet social and economic criteria that govern farmer behaviour. Much scientific knowledge about the various roles of SOM does not reach farmers and other decision-makers in a form that can be used easily. The biggest challenge to researchers is to engage with clients to pinpoint gaps in knowledge and utilize new and existing information to devise decision support Systems tailored to their needs.

AB Soil is a large sink for organic carbon within the terrestrial biosphere. Practices which cause a decline in soil organic matter cause CO2 release, in addition to damaging soil resilience and, often, agricultural productivity. The soil micro-organisms (collectively the soil microbial biomass) are the agents of transformation of soil organic matter, nutrients and of most key soil processes. Their activities are much influenced by soil physico-chemical and ecological interactions. This paper addresses two key issues. Firstly, ways of managing, and the extent to which it is possible to manage, soil biological functions. Secondly, the methodologies currently available for studying soil micro-organisms, and the functions they mediate, are discussed. It is concluded that, as the world population develops in this new millennium, there will be an increased dependence upon biological processes in soil to provide adequate crop nutrition for the majority of the world's farmers. Although a major increase in the use of artificial fertilisers will be necessary on a global scale, this will not be an option for large numbers of farmers due to their poverty. Instead they will rely on recycling of nutrients from animal and vegetable composts and urban wastes, and biological cycling from nitrogen fixation and mycorrhizae. The challenge is to select the most appropriate topics for further research. Not all aspects are likely to lead to significantly improved agricultural productivity, or sustainability within the foreseeable future.

AB Organic matter is the life of soil. It enables a soil to perform efficiently its primary function of supporting plant growth. Its endemic deficiency in tropical soils, particularly those under the influence of arid, semiarid and sub-humid climates, is a major factor contributing to their low productivity. Research over the past 30 years, formatted as long-term experiments, has conclusively proven that those treatments and practices that supported organic matter build-up, also favored sustainable productivity. Since sustenance of organic matter necessitates regular additions, bolstering its supplies in sufficient quantities is a strategy suggested for the future. While in-situ cultivation and non-competitive use are the common elements of an overall scheme on reinforcing an organic matter reservoir, traversal routes for harnessing, however, vary with the kind of organic resource being aimed at. For instance: with cattle dung and human excrements, conversion into biogas is considered necessary; farmer participatory appraisal and emphasis on dual purpose legumes are found to be essential in spreading green manures, and non-palatability to cattle with a pre-composting step seem vital to succeed with crop residues. Possible research, development and policy initiatives are outlined to enlarge supply and efficient use of different types of organic resources.

AB Soil organic matter plays a major role in sustainable agricultural development in Vietnam. A general soil evaluation shows that the content of organic matter in most soil units in Vietnam ranges between 0.5 to 3.0% soil organic matter (in the A and B horizon only) with lower levels especially on sloping land. Most upland soils (70% that contain less than or equal to 2% soil organic matter) are in danger due to imminent soil erosion. Soil organic matter is lost very quickly due to erosion, lack of organic manure and poor farming techniques in these areas. Using green hedgerows along contour lines and intercropping with legume species to cover the soil are technological options to control soil erosion and improve soil organic matter content on sloping land. Green hedgerows significantly reduce soil and organic matter loss by 50-70%, compared to sloping land without hedgerows. Intercropping with legume species reduces soil loss by 40-50%, and can provide the soil with 2.5-12 tons of green manure/ha/year. However, more studies are needed to identify the best technologies for managing soil organic matter in upland areas.

AB The storage and release of nutrients by soil organic matter (SOM) is the primary determinant of soil fertility in low-input agriculture of semiarid NE Brazil. Traditional shifting cultivation systems have utilised the SOM built up during the fallow phase to supply nutrients for a cultivation phase of some 4-6 years. In this paper we analyse the turnover, stabilisation and quality of organic matter in landuse systems of NE Brazil. This analysis relies on a review of our own and literature data as well as farmers' perceptions recorded in a survey of 240 farms. Components critical for the understanding of SOM balances and transformations are residue inputs under native and agricultural vegetation, rates and controls of SOM mineralisation under cultivation, controls on SOM accretion under fallow vegetation, and the quality of SOM with respect to nutrient supply. While all these factors are known in outline, the detail of understanding that would be required for fine tuning management systems to be sustainable under present (and increasing) production pressure is still lacking. In particular quantity and quality of organic matter inputs from different vegetation types, controls on SOM stabilisation under different cultivation regimes, and the rates and synchrony with plant demand of nutrient release from mineralising organic matter need to be investigated in further detail.

AB Ensuring sustainable agriculture in semiarid Africa requires the implementation of methods to balance nutrients and to conserve soil organic matter (SOM). There is an urgent need to improve the management of all types of SOM input. In this paper; the authors review a wide range of agricultural practices and discuss their advantages, limitations and feasibility. They distinguish `traditional systems' such as traditional fallow, parkland and manuring from `improved systems' such as `improved fallow', forest fallow, alley cropping, cover crops and application of composted manure. Biomass production (BMP) for `improved systems' is mainly linked: (i) for agroforestry, to the tree species used in forest fallow, to the synchronization of nutrient supply by the soil with the cereal demand in alley cropping, and generally to the efficiency of the root system and its development with the depth; (ii) for cover crops, BMP is mainly linked to the initial soil fertility and to the ecological zone: establishment and management of cover crops are not yet fully mastered under some conditions such as an annual rainfall below 800 mm and/or on very clayey soils; (iii) for manure, BMP is mainly linked to the improvement of fallow in order to ensure sufficient forage resources. Because semiarid Africa is mainly a livestock zone, the authors emphasise manure: constraints, quality indicators and tools used to encourage its production, are analysed. Thus it was concluded that the intensification of manure production and its rational use in semiarid African regions, threatened by drought and malnutrition, is very important: this cannot be separated from the production of plant biomass, whose possibilities have been examined above.

AB Judged by their negative nutrient balances, low soil cover and low productivity, the predominant agro-pastoral farming systems in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa are highly unsustainable for crop production intensification. With kaolinite as the main clay type, the cation exchange capacity of the soils in this region, often less than 1 cmol(c) kg(-1)soil, depends heavily on the organic carbon (Corg) content. However, due to low carbon sequestration and to the microbe, termite and temperature-induced rapid turnover rates of organic material in the present land-use systems, Corg contents of the topsoil are very low, ranging between 1 and 8 g kg(-1) in most soils. For sustainable food production, the availability of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) has to be increased considerably in combination with an improvement in soil physical properties. Therefore, the adoption of innovative management options that help to stop or even reverse the decline in Corg typically observed after cultivating bush or rangeland is of utmost importance. To maintain food production for a rapidly growing population, targeted applications of mineral fertilisers and the effective recycling of organic amendments as crop residues and manure are essential. Any increase in soil cover has large effects in reducing topsoil erosion by wind and water and favours the accumulation of wind-blown dust high in bases which in turn improves P availability. In the future decision support systems, based on GIS, modelling and simulation should be used to combine (i) available fertiliser response data from on-station and on-farm research, (ii) results on soil productivity restoration with the application of mineral and organic amendments and (iii) our present understanding of the cause-effect relationships governing the prevailing soil degradation processes. This will help to predict the effectiveness of regionally differentiated soil fertility management approaches to maintain or even increase soil Corg levels.

AB In Eastern and Southern Africa, the shifting from the no-external input agriculture (shifting cultivation through slash and burn) to intensified agricultural systems has resulted in widespread agro-ecosystems with high soil organic carbon and nutrient depletion. This is quite evident in farming systems with reduced fallow period or those that practice continuous cropping without or with little inputs. Long-term experiments indicate that losses of up to 0.69 t carbon ha(-1) yr(-1) in the soil surface layers are common. Such losses are commonly reported by farmers engaged in participatory community-based research development projects. This calls for judicious strategies for recapitalization or replacement of these depletions. Such strategies include direct SOC replenishment through addition of organic materials, notably manures, wastes, residues and plant litter; biomass transfer; incorporation of improved fallows in the farming systems. Indirect contribution to SOM replenishment or recapitalization may be achieved through inorganic fertilizations and amendments; legume integration in the production system; and combined inorganic and organic inputs. Research is required to identify inputs that help meet both nutrients availability while contributing to SOC build up at the same time.

SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS

AB In recent years and in some situations the status of soil organic matter (SOM) has deteriorated considerably due to long periods of continuous cultivation and limited external inputs in the form of mineral fertilizers. Deterioration of SOM varies by agro-ecological zones, by soil types and by cropping patterns. It is more intense in East Africa, followed by coastal West Africa and Southern Africa and least intensive in the Sahel and Central Africa. It is also more serious in areas under low-input agriculture irrespective of the prevailing cropping system. The major consequence of the decrease in SOM in the tropics is lower agricultural productivity with a direct negative effect on food security. While biophysical dynamics of SOM have been extensively covered in the literature, social considerations have not received similar attention. This paper examines the social, economic and policy factors associated with the management of tropical soil organic matter. Empirical data from a range of environments in Africa show that SOM improvement options yield a positive return to land as well as labour. However, there are a number of constraints. Social constraints are related to the large quantities of organic matter that are required (case of farmyard manure), the competitive uses for the material (case of crop residues), land and labour requirements, and gender-related issues. From a policy stand point, unsecured tenure rights together with price distortions and other market failures may be important constraints. Challenges for sustainable management of SOM are identified. These include management conflicts, land tenure arrangements, the divergence in goals between individuals and society, land and labour requirements, inadequate support systems for land users, profitability issues, the role of subsidies, and the absence of national action plans. A number of opportunities are identified that could enhance the improvement or maintenance of SOM. These include: exploring the need and potential role of community-based SOM management practices; development of an integrated plant nutrient management strategy involving both organic and inorganic inputs; and development of concrete national action plans. It is argued that because externalities of SOM improvement or maintenance extend beyond the farmer's fields, SOM investment may require cost sharing between individuals and the society. Policies on subsidies need to be reconsidered. Research priorities are identified that require closer collaboration between scientists from a variety of disciplines.

AB Bangladesh is an agricultural country. About 80% of the total population live in rural areas. The contribution of agriculture to the gross domestic product is 30%. Rice is the major food crop while jute, sugarcane and tea are the main cash crops. Other important crops are wheat, tobacco, pulses, vegetables and fruits. Overall productivity in Bangladesh is stagnating or declining. The implication of yield stagnation or declining productivity is severe, since these trends have occurred despite rapid growth in the use of chemical fertilisers. Depletion of soil organic matter is the main cause of low productivity, which is considered one of the most serious threats to the sustainability of agriculture in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, most soils have less than 17 g/kg and some soils have less than 10 g/kg organic matter. Farmers realise that there is a problem with soil fertility related to organic matter depletion. Farmers say that organic matter increases yield, reduces the production cost, improves crop growth and the economy, increases water-holding capacity and improves the soil structure. They recognise soil with higher organic matter content by darker brownish to black in colour. Some farmers are using fast-growing trees such as Flemingia macrophyla, Ipilipil (Leucaen leucophala), Glyricidia sepium, Boga Medula (Tephrosia candida), Dhol Kolmi (Ipomoea fistulosa), etc., as living fences, which can be used as fuel, fertiliser and fodder. To increase the soil organic matter, farmers use green manure crops, compost, quick compost, cow dung, azolla, etc. However, fuel for cooking purposes is limited and cow dung and crop residues are largely used as fuel. Crop residues are also used as fodder for livestock. Farmers expressed the wish to learn more about organic fertilizer management. However, sufficient food should be produced to keep pace with population growth. To alleviate the hunger and poverty is to increase the intensity of agricultural production and maintain favorable ecological conditions. Therefore, more organic matter should be used in the farmers' fields to sustain the soil fertility in an intensive farming system.

AB The gases methane (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) contribute to global warming, while N(2)O also affects the ozone layer. Sources of greenhouse gas emissions in animal husbandry include animals, animal houses (indoor storage of animal excreta), outdoor storage, manure and slurry treatment (e.g., composting, anaerobic treatment), land application and chemical fertilisers. Although in many countries emphasis is put on reduction of environmental pollution by nutrients, ammonia emission and odour nuisance, reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases will become equally important in the near future to meet integrated sustainability criteria (1997 Kyoto protocol). Emissions of greenhouse gases differ in origin. Methane from animal husbandry is for a large part endogenous, and may be hard to reduce in intensive animal production. Methane emission reduction strategies should focus on its use as fuel or preventing its formation, mainly during on-farm storage (indoor, outside) or treatment through control of critical processes (degradation of organic matter) and critical factors (e.g., temperature). Nitrous oxide is mainly produced during the aerobic storage and treatment of animal excreta, as well as after land spreading. As N(2)O basically is an intermediate product of complex biochemical processes (nitrification, denitrification), optimal process conditions are the key issues in N(2)O emission reduction strategies from animal husbandry.

AB Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from agricultural soils contribute significantly to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. Numerous studies have been conducted during the last three decades to improve the understanding of the processes involved in the release of N2O from agricultural soils. This enabled the creation of process based models on site and field scale. In addition, a growing number of N2O emission data are available for different soil-land-use-systems from various climates. The integration of these data in global and national N2O budgets leads to more improved estimations. Surprisingly, N2O-emission calculations are rare on regional meso and macro scales. The spatial identification of areas with a high efflux of N2O on regional meso and macro scales is essential for the implementation of N2O emission mitigation strategies, thus leading to an increased sustainability of land use. On the basis of the ecosystem approach of Matson and Vitousek (1990), we introduce a new method to estimate regional N2O emissions from agricultural soils on meso and macro scales. This method considers spatial environmental information from available spatial and statistical data as well as quantitative and qualitative expertise by using the tools of a geographic information system (GIS). An environmental information system (EIS) was built up for a dairy farm region in Southern Germany which includes soil, land use, topography, N2O emission and farm management data. Using all information in the EIS, it was possible (i) to identify different spatial soil-land-use-systems, (ii) to link emission data and process knowledge to these soil-land-use-systems and (iii) to visualize spatial emission potentials. On this basis, N2O emission potentials for each of the communities in the study region and the whole region were estimated. The estimated annual N2O emission potential from agricultural soils for the examined dairy farm region in Southern Germany covering around 775 km(2) is about 3.0 kg N2O-N ha(-1).

AB This overview paper concentrates on carbon dioxide, discussing its agricultural sources and the possibilities to minimize their respective emissions. Besides such source-related emissions reductions, agriculture is also expected to help slowing down the CO2 increase in the atmosphere by sequestering part of it in soil organic matter, and by producing suitable biomass as a substitute for fossil fuel.
   The share of agriculture in the consumption of fossil fuel is comparatively low. Even the high-intensity farming of industrialized countries does not consume more than about 3-4.5% of their total energy budget, at least as far as the fuel inputs into primary farm production are concerned. Possible savings are e.g. reduced soil tillage, optimized fertilizer efficiency, improved irrigation techniques and enhanced solar drying. The pertinent literature comes to the optimistic conclusion that by exploiting all these possibilities a 10-40% reduction of the present agricultural energy requirements might be achieved. Accordingly, theoretical fuel savings might be in the order of 0.01-0.05 Gt C yr(-1). Although this should be aimed at for many reasons, it unfortunately corresponds to less than 1% of the present overall CO2 release from fossil fuel.
   Between 0.25 and 1 Gt fossil fuel carbon could theoretically be substituted per year by agricultural biofuels, and 0.06-0.25 Gt yr(-1) by shelterbelts and agroforestry. Together with 25% of the crop residues, this comes to a potential fossil fuel offset of somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5 Gt C yr(-1). This would be an impressive figure, suggesting a potential saving of 10-25%, while providing the same amount of energy without enriching the atmosphere with much additional CO2. In reality, however, there remain lots of questions as yet unsolved, in addition to many environmental problems which one would have to expect. As an example, a concomitant increase of non-CO2 greenhouse gases can not be ruled out. Furthermore, the use of crop residues as biofuels, even though it is customary in many developing countries, could have deleterious effects on soil fertility.
   Land use changes from forest or grassland to arable agriculture have been and still are a significant source for the release of former plant and soil carbon into the atmosphere. The reasons for decreasing soil carbon contents are a reduced input of plant biomass into cropland on the one hand, and an accelerated decomposition of the existing organic matter in agricultural soils on the other. The combined losses from the earth's native biomass and from soils due to cultivation between the year 1700 and today amount to about 170 Gt carbon, which is now largely in the atmosphere. A further CO2 emission in the range of 1.2 Gt C per year is still going on due to additional land clearing for agriculture in the tropics. The only way to escape from this forest conversion is a more sustainable use and improved productivity of the already existing farmland.
   Soil organic matter of cropland increases only if either the additions can be enhanced or the decomposition rates be reduced. There are opportunities by which such improvements can be achieved. Taking the global historical loss of about 42 Gt former soil C from mineral soils as a reference, and assuming a practically feasible restoration by one half to two thirds, this would correspond to somewhere between 20 and 30 Gt C altogether, or to an average CO2 offset of 0.4-0.6 Gt C yr(-1). The drawback, however, is that this carbon-sink option is of limited duration only. The humus enrichment in crop soil always follows a saturation curve, approaching a new equilibrium level after not more than 50-100 years. Furthermore, this new soil carbon level drops rapidly again, as soon as the required most careful management can no longer be sustained.

AB The sustainability of cropping systems is closely related to the judicious use of fertilizers. Little research has been conducted on the management of P in rotations in Morocco. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of direct, cumulative, and residual P on wheat (Triticum aestivum) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) yields under field conditions in two cropping systems: continuous wheat (W-W) and chickpea-wheat (CP-W). Experiments were conducted in 1994-96 at two locations in the arid and semiarid regions of Morocco. Phosphorus was applied the first year at rates of 0, 9, 18, and 27 kg P ha(-1) on both wheat and chickpea. The second year, plots were split into treatments with P and without P fertilizer. The changes in NaHCO3-P in soil showed that after two years of cropping, P rates of 9 and 18 kg P ha(-1) were needed to increase and maintain soil test P level in the range where a third successive crop could be grown without fertilization at locations 1 and 2, respectively. Also, soils with the same initial NaHCO3-P soil test levels required different amounts of fertilizer P to produce maximum yields. Inclusion of chickpea in the rotation resulted in a greater response to residual P by wheat at location 2. Differences in wheat grain yield between rotations were not significant. The maximum increase in yields above the nil-P treatment due to the highest amount applied in the the previous year was 1.3 t ha(-1), obtained for continuous wheat at location 2. Though the residual P effect was evident in this study, it did not produce maximum yields. Yields (GY, DM) could be predicted by the inclusion of both P applied in previous year (PR) and P applied in the current year (CP) by the following model: GY or DM = a + b*Ln(RP+1) + c*Ln(CP+1). Based on the range of P rates used in this study, a single P application for a 2-year rotation is not a suitable practice in these soils. The application of 18 kg P ha(-1) each year is recommended for continuous wheat, and 9 kg P ha(-1) the first year plus 18 kg P ha(-1) the second year is recommended for chickpea-wheat rotations. We suggest that either using single large applications of P or performing repeated applications should take into account the range of targeted application rates.

AB Increased demand for land is forcing many farmers to intensify their upland rice-based systems with a gradual shift from bush fallow rotation towards sedentary agricultural production. However, farmers are not adapting appropriate management practices to the intensified land use, which may threaten sustainability. Diagnostic field trials were conducted at four sites in during 1994 and 1997, comparing 228 farmers' fields with diverse cropping histories. The objective was to improve future research priority setting and to guide site and systems-specific targeting of available technical options. Soil samples (0-20 ) were analyzed for pH, organic matter quantity and quality, and the potential soil N supplying capacity. Weed species and dry biomass and rice grain yield were determined under farmers' management and in three super-imposed researcher-managed subplots (hand weeding at 28, 56, and 84 days, 30 mineral fertilizer N application, and a combination of both). Yield gaps were attributed to weeds and nitrogen, based on yield response to researchers' management in intensified systems. Increased cropping intensity and reduced fallow duration were associated with yield reduction, which was largest at the sites in the derived savanna (1.48 vs. 1.15 ) and the bimodal forest zones (1.55 vs. 1.02 ). Intensification-induced yield loss was about 25% and appeared to be related mainly to increased weed infestation (72% more weed biomass) and declining soil quality (about 20% less soil organic C content and N supply). Weeds were the dominant factor responsible for rice yield loss in the forest area (explaining 65% of the yield gap) and appeared to play a lesser role in the savanna. The reduction in soil organic carbon and N supplying capacity was strongest in the derived savanna zone where N supply explained 35% of the yield gap. In the two savanna environments, a large share of the intensifiaction-related yield reduction could not be ascribed to either weeds or N (probably related to changes in soil physical parameters or pests). Long-term upland rice productivity can thus not be sustained at current intensification practices. Improved management strategies should aim primarily at reducing weed pressure and improving soil organic matter content and N supply. Technical options are likely to vary with agro-ecological zones.

TI Fertiliser use and definition of farmer domains for impact-oriented

AB One of the options to alleviate soil fertility constraints for sustainable agriculture in the savannas of West Africa is to develop soil nutrient management technologies from an adequate supply and feasible share of organic and mineral inputs. This paper makes a diagnosis of farm-level use of organic and inorganic inputs, as a basis for the development of technologies. The results from the diagnosis are then used to develop a framework for characterizing farmers for impact-oriented research on soil nutrient management systems. The survey was carried out with 200 farmers carefully selected in two villages in the northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria. The results showed that more than 90% of farmers in both villages used chemical fertilizers. This is contrary to a general belief that they are not widely applied to food crops by smallholders in African agriculture. However, up to 81% of the fields received less than half of the recommended 120 because of high costs due, probably to removal of subsidies and inefficient marketing systems. Organic inputs such as animal manure were applied in very small quantities (about 8% of the requirements). However there is evidence of integrated use of inorganic fertilizers and organic manure on some (24%) of the fields. The problem to be addressed is that of the production (and efficient utilisation) of organic inputs in the northern Guinea savanna. Nitrogen deficiency is the most limiting soil nutrient in the cereal-dominated systems of study area. On this basis, farmers were classified into two a-priori groups using a threshold of 30 , and multiple quantitative variables were fitted in a discriminant analysis to validate the typology. Results indicated that more than 75% of farmers were well classified into two groups that had the characteristics of the a-priori groups. Two others were atypical and included the remaining 25% of farmers. Thus, there are a total of four groups of farmers referred to as farmer domains in this paper. The two domains with 75% of well-classified individuals are suitable for the selection of farmers with whom to conduct applied research or for development activities because they represent the general patterns in the supply and use of soil nutrients in the study area. Although basic research can be done in the four domains, the two atypical groups are most suited for process-level studies to improve the understanding of factors that make the systems either more efficient or less efficient than the two other farmer domains. In either case, representative farmers were easily identified by their highest probability of belonging to a specific domain from the model results. Multivariate models constitute a good framework to make a typology of, and to select farmers for, participatory research and extrapolation of results in the northern Guinea savanna.

TI Nitrogen-15 balance as affected by rice straw management in a rice-wheat

AB The sustainability of the productive rice-wheat systems of Northwest India is being questioned due to the complete removal of straw for animal consumption and fuel, or the burning of straw which has reduced the soil organic matter contents. However, straw incorporation at planting can temporarily reduce the availability of fertilizer-N and reduce crop yields. In a field study on a loamy sand soil, the effect of 6 mg ha(-1) rice straw incorporated into the soil 20 or 40 days before sowing (DBS) the wheat was compared with removal or burning of rice straw on the fate and balance of 120 kg ha(-1) of 5 atom% N-15-urea applied to wheat and to a following crop of rice. Wheat grain yield and agronomic efficiency (AE) of applied N (kg grain/kg N applied) were not influenced by rice straw management. However. N uptake (NU), and recovery efficiency (RE) of N by the difference method were lower with rice straw incorporation than with burning. Nitrogen-15 recovery by wheat was highest (41%) when the rice straw was removed or burned and lowest (30.4%) when 30 of the 120 kg N ha(-1) was applied at the time of straw incorporation at 20 DBS of wheat. However, this strategy of adding 25% of the urea-N dose at the time of straw incorporation resulted in the highest N-15 losses (45.2%). Inorganic N remaining at harvest in the 0 to 60 cm soil profile, mostly NO3-, was 5.5% after wheat and 4.2% after rice. Rice grain yields, NU, and RE were not influenced by rice straw management. Nitrogen-15 losses were similar in rice and wheat (31% with straw removed) despite total irrigation and rainfall inputs of 340 and 32 cm to rice and wheat, respectively. These results suggest to the farmers of northwest India that straw incorporation does not necessarily hurt grain yields, and indicates to researchers that work is still needed to improve N use efficiency in rice and wheat.

TI Towards wise coastal management practice in a tropical megacity -

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Jakarta Metropolitan Area (JMA) or Jabotabek is one of the most dynamic regions of Indonesia. At present. the JMA is the largest concentration of urban population in Indonesia and seventh largest urban agglomeration in the world. The massive demographic and economic growth taking place in the region have gone hand in hand with environmental destruction and poverty concentration. Jabotabek is experiencing a number of problems related to its coastal location: coastal littering, water Pollution. saltwater intrusion, land subsidence. seafood contamination and the loss of habitat for birds, fish and other wild life. Poverty alleviation and the preservation of the coastal environment for sustainable development are becoming critical issues facing the Jabotabek. This is where the concept of wise coastal management practice becomes pertinent, where scientists and managers and local stakeholders co-operate in finding solutions to these various inter-related problems. A multiple-prong approach is employed to improve coastal environmental management among other: scientific campaign on coastal resources management, community-based development for sustainable coastal management including community-based waste management and recycling, social empowerment, and environmental education. The paper also proposes the strategy to strengthen the existing community-based environmental management activities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Urban waterfront facing integrated coastal management
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Essentially. this paper aims Lit discussing the trend, of waterfront development in the context or the urbanised coastal areas. and the possible integration between waterfront organisation and integrated management of the coastal area. To deal with this subject, first the external environment influencing waterfront evolution is considered, focusing on global change, the globalisation of economic systems, and geopolitical change. The diffusion of waterfront re-vitalisation programmes is considered in the context of the urban growth of, attention on the numerical increase of megacities and protocoastal areas concentrating a megacities. The Ekistics theory, according to which urban growth will lead to the creation of the ecumenopolis (planetary urban system) including the marine ecumenopolis (urbanisation of all the coastal belts), is considered with the aim or foreshadowing the possible role which could be played by maritime waterfronts in the course of the 21st century. The focus then shifts to the waterfront itself considering the historical triggers for waterfront revitalisation plans. In this context the waterfront functions are incorporated into the coastal use structure by adopting a matrix-based representation. The expanding basis for conflicts between the waterfront functions is emphasised.
   A framework or options occurring in waterfront development is presented with the aim of responding to two questions: (i) how the waterfront may be designed to be consistent with sustainable development, in that acting as a top rank spatial system conforming to integrated management of the coastal areas (ii) whether and how the waterfront could act as a leading spatial system to carry out integrated management of the coastal area within which it is located. Discussion of the former question leads to designing the optimum choice among the possible objectives of waterfront management, while discussion of the latter question leads to considering the waterfront as the central subsystem of the coastal system. and to reckoning its organisation as including high-rank functions of the coastal area.
   Reasoning leads to focusing on the design of waterfronts able to optimise their integration into the coastal system, and their development within coastal management. To realise this prospect an international discussion on the waterfront-coastal area integration may be desirable in order to pursue two basic goals: (i) to explore how coastal area management and waterfront planning may usefully interact generating a long-term positive feedback; (ii) to design the optimum waterfront organisation. intended as a planning and management model to be used as a reference basis for integrating the waterfront functions with coastal management strategies.

AB This paper propose, an integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) framework in the context of the current pressures and management problems of the coastal zone in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. The main issues in the coastal zone caused by human activities are addressed and the drawbacks Of the present coastal zone management are identified. The proposed ICZM framework is developed in view of the existing situation in this coastal zone which lies at the mouth of the Yangze estuary, Besides providing a general framework, the paper lays particular emphasis on discussing the implementation of cross-sectoral management, strategic environmental assessment. systematic scientific research and public involvement in this ICZM system. The innovation of management approaches at the local level will hopefully be conducive to the achievement Of Sustainable development in the coastal zone of the most developed area in China whose wetland areas are also of international importance.

   PATTERNS
AB After considering the early history of fish as food the paper places fish and fisheries within the context of the second millenium, with particular reference to the impact on European and N. American development. In the 20th century in nutritional terms, fish is seen more as an important source of micro-nutrients, minerals and essential fatty acids than protein, Per capita consumption of fish has risen on a global basis to 15kg/head/year but projected population growth and mismanaged resources will make this difficult to sustain. Fish consumption, even in limited quantities, has been shown to protect against coronary heart disease and also tends to reduce low birth-weight
   After decades of production, growth capture fisheries are levelling off, with future increases likely to come from aquaculture. However, up to 25% of marine catches are discarded and almost 30% is used for the production of fish meal and oil. International trade in fish has risen to US $50 000 million/year, representing 37% of fish for human consumption and tending to stimulate distribution of fresh and value-added products. Sustainable fish supplies for the future will be expected to be safer and traceable to their source. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Predicting coastal evolution using a sediment budget approach: a case
   study from southern England
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite the fact that coastal evolution occurs over a range of temporal and spatial scales, most existing modelling tools for predicting coastal evolution are founded on the science of the small-scale coastal processes. This paper discusses the role of a variety of approaches to predicting coastal evolution and considers that the ability to predict long-term (e.g. 50-100 years plus) larger-scale changes in coastal systems is of paramount importance to coastal managers if the ultimate aim of developing long-term sustainable management of the coast and its resources is to be achievable.
   The advantages of a sediment budgetary approach to predicting coastal evolution are discussed and it is suggested that such an approach is better suited to predicting long-term and large-scale coastal behaviour than existing hydrodynamic and physical models.
   The procedure for developing a conceptual sediment budget model for predicting coastal evolution is outlined, based upon the identification of littoral cells, and consideration of sediment sources, throughputs and sinks. This modelling procedure is then applied to a "real case" coastal unit located in central southern England, namely Poole Bay, in order to exemplify its benefits and the type of results achievable. From the model, it is suggested that the most appropriate strategy for Poole Bay is one of continued beach replenishment, with maintenance of the existing seawall and groyne defences.

TI The application of a proposed generic institutional framework for
   integrated coastal management to India
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ZONE MANAGEMENT
AB The complex and dynamic nature of the coastal and marine area is prompting many nations to consider the internalisation of integrated coastal management (ICM) policy as part of a deliberate strategy for sustainable development. The institutional structures required to deliver such internalisation are subject to debate. This paper presents a suggested generic institutional framework derived through consideration of the core ICM process and proven organisational models. The proposed framework consists of an 'operating core' which facilitates local issue identification, evaluation and monitoring; an 'administrative component' of Central and State government to set policy direction, manage funding, and provide guidance on implementation and operation; a 'strategic apex' within Central government to oversee the transition from ICM concept to practice; and a 'co-ordinating mechanism' to allow open communication of ideas and information. The proposed framework is then applied to India, which currently faces the challenge of developing a suitable institutional framework to deliver ICM aspirations. It is concluded that the generic institutional framework works well when applied to India, with existing organisations and agencies requiring relatively minor organisational chances to address coastal and marine issues more effectively.

AB The Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) was developed as a replacement for the four-step travel demand model. The goal was to provide a simulation system that could analyze issues facing transportation planners such as sustainable development, environmental impacts of proposed projects, and intelligent transportation systems deployment. Because TRANSIMS represents a significant shift from the current state of the practice, the transportation planning community will need to spend significant human and capital resources preparing for the transition. Some insight into these transitional issues is provided on the basis of lessons learned from research on actual calibrated transportation networks in Texas. An overview of TRANSIMS in terms of its main components along with a brief comparison with the four-step model are supplied, followed by a discussion of the data requirements with specific reference to the current data needs associated with the four-step model. The challenges inherent in converting databases that have been developed for four-step models are also discussed on the basis of the conversion of existing traffic network files. Next, the TRANSIMS traffic flow theory is described, and the challenges for transportation planners are illustrated using calibrated networks from two highway corridors in Houston, Texas, and one diamond interchange network in College Station, Texas. Last, the capabilities of TRANSIMS with respect to output analysis are described.

AB In many developing countries like Tanzania, one of the major management problems is the lack of decision-making tools for preparing road maintenance programs. This deficiency results in poor resource allocation and poor utilization of existing assets. This paper summarizes the results of a pilot study on implementing sustainable highway management tools in Tanzania. It was recognized at the beginning of the study that data acquisition is one of the single most expensive items in the implementation of a pavement management system. Consequently a sustainable data acquisition scheme, appropriate to developing countries, was designed and tested. The research showed that using these methods together with appropriate management tools results in better management information. It is envisaged that the methods developed will help Tanzania to determine appropriate resource requirements as well as cost-effective pavement maintenance and rehabilitation programs.

SO PEDIATRICS

DT Article
DE economics of collaborative quality improvement; neonatal intensive care
   unit treatment costs
AB Objective. To make measurable improvements in the quality and cost of neonatal intensive care using a multidisciplinary collaborative quality improvement model.
   Design. Interventional study. Data on treatment costs were collected for infants with birth weight 501 to 1500 g for the period of January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1997. Data on resources expended by hospitals to conduct this project were collected in a survey for the period January 1, 1995 to December 31, 1996.
   Setting. Ten self-selected neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) received the intervention. They formed 2 subgroups (6 NICUs working on infection, 4 NICUs working on chronic lung disease). Nine other NICUs served as a contemporaneous comparison group.
   Patients. Infants with birth weight 501 to 1500 g born at or admitted within 28 days of birth between 1994 and 1997 to the 6 study NICUs in the infection group (N = 2993) and the 9 comparison NICUs (N = 2203); infants with birth weight 501 to 1000 g at the 4 study NICUs in the chronic lung disease group (N = 663) and the 9 comparison NICUs (N = 1007).
   Interventions. NICUs formed multidisciplinary teams which worked together to undertake a collaborative quality improvement effort between January 1995 and December 1996. They received instruction in quality improvement, reviewed performance data, identified common improvement goals, and implemented "potentially better practices" developed through analysis of the processes of care, literature review, and site visits.
   Main Outcome Measures. Treatment cost per infant is the primary economic outcome measure. In addition, the resources spent by hospitals in undertaking the collaborative quality improvement effort were determined.
   Results. Between 1994 and 1996, the median treatment cost per infant with birth weight 501 to 1500 g at the 6 project NICUs in the infection group decreased from $57 606 to $46 674 (a statistical decline); at the 4 chronic lung disease hospitals, for infants with birth weights 501 to 1000 g, it decreased from $85 959 to $77 250. Treatment costs at hospitals in the control group rose over the same period. There was heterogeneity in the effects among the NICUs in both project groups. Cost savings were maintained in the year following the intervention.
   On average, hospitals spent $68 206 in resources to undertake the collaborative quality improvement effort between 1995 and 1996. Two thirds of these costs were incurred in the first year, with the remaining third in the second year. The average savings per hospital in patient care costs for very low birth weight infants in the infection group was $2.3 million in the post-intervention year (1996). There was considerable heterogeneity in the cost savings across hospitals associated with participation in the collaborative quality improvement project.
   Conclusion. Cost savings may be achieved as a result of collaborative quality improvement efforts and when they occur, they appear to be sustainable, at least in the short run. In high-cost patient populations, such as infants with very low birth weights, cost savings can quickly offset institutional expenditures for quality improvement efforts.

AB Genetically modified plants are widely grown predominantly in North America and to a lesser extent in Australia, Argentina and China but their regions of production are expected to spread soon beyond these limited areas also reaching Europe where great controversy over the application of gene technology in agriculture persists. Currently, several cultivars of eight major crop plants are commercially available including canola, corn, cotton, potato, soybean, sugar beet, tobacco and tomato, but many more plants with new and combined multiple traits are close to registration. While currently agronomic traits (herbicide resistance, insect resistance) dominate, traits conferring "quality" traits (altered oil compositions, protein and starch contents) will begin to dominate within the next years. However, economically the most promising future lies in the development and marketing of crop plants expressing pharmaceutical or "nutraceuticals" (functional foods), and plants that express a number of different genes. From this it is clear that future agricultural and, ultimately, also natural ecosystems will be challenged by the large-scale introduction of entirely novel genes and gene products in new combinations at high frequencies all of which will have unknown impacts on their associated complex of non-target organisms, i.e. all organisms that are not targeted by the insecticidal protein. In times of severe global decline of biodiversity, pro-active precaution is necessary and careful consideration of the likely expected effects of transgenic plants on biodiversity of plants and insects is mandatory.
   In this paper possible implications of non-target effects for insect and plant biodiversity are discussed and a case example of such non-target effects is presented. In a multiple year research project, tritrophic and bitrophic effects of transgenic corn, expressing the gene from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt-corn) that codes for the high expression of an insecticidal toxin (Cry1Ab), on the natural enemy species, Chrysoperla carnea (the green lacewing), was investigated. In these laboratory trials, we found prey-mediated effects of transgenic Bt-corn causing significantly higher mortality of C. carnea larvae. In further laboratory trials, we confirmed that the route of exposure (fed directly or via a herbivorous prey) and the origin of the Bt (from transgenic plants or incorporated into artificial diet) strongly influenced the degree of mortality. In choice feeding trials where C. carnea could choose between Spodoptera littoralis fed transgenic Bt-corn and S. littoralis fed non-transgenic corn, larger instars showed a significant preference for S. littoralis fed non-transgenic corn while this was not the case when the choice was between Bt- and isogenic corn fed aphids. Field implications of these findings could be multifold but will be difficult to assess because they interfere in very intricate ways with complex ecosystem processes that we still know only very little about. The future challenge in pest management will be to explore how transgenic plants can be incorporated as safe and effective components of IPM systems and what gene technology can contribute to the needs of a modern sustainable agriculture that avoids or reduces adverse impacts on biodiversity? For mainly economically motivated resistance management purposes, constitutive high expression of Bt-toxins in transgenic plants is promoted seeking to kill almost 100% of all susceptible (and if possible heterozygote resistant) target pest insects. However, for pest management this is usually not necessary. Control at or below an established economic injury level is sufficient for most pests and cropping systems. It is proposed that partially or moderately resistant plants expressing quantitative rather than single gene traits and affecting the target pest sub-lethally may provide a more meaningful contribution of agricultural biotechnology to modern sustainable agriculture. Some examples of such plants produced through conventional breeding are presented. Non-target effects may be less severe allowing for better incorporation of these plants into IPM or biological control programs using multiple control strategies, thereby, also reducing selection pressure for pest resistance development.

AB The objective of this work was to study the effect of corn plant residue and mixture of atrazine plus metolachlor on weed control in no-till corn system. This experiment was performed in an Oxisol, and the weed desiccation was done using glyphosate, 15 days before planting. The experimental design was a randomized block, with three replications. Before corn planting, five levels of corn plant residues (0, 3, 6, 9 e 12 t ha(-1)) were equally distributed in the plots. Two treatments were applied in subplots after corn planting: one without herbicide and the other one using the commercial mixture of atrazine plus metolachlor (1,200 + 1,800 g ha(-1)). Different weed species were evaluated, at 26 and 41 days after planting. The total grass weeds number was significantly affected by the plant residue levels, independently of herbicide treatments and of evaluation period. The herbicide did not show a significant effect in the first evaluation period. However, in the second evaluation period, the herbicide reduced about 53% the total number of weeds compared to the plots without herbicide. It was verified that in the herbicide absence the total population of weeds were significantly higher in the second evaluation period. However, in the herbicide presence there was no significant difference in the total population of weeds between the two evaluated periods.

ID MODEL
AB Regional land use changes due to European market policy have far reaching consequences for various landscape functions. Among others land use change influences the local water balance. Simulation models are mostly used to analyse the effect of management practices on water quality but they can also be a useful tool to quantify the hydrologic response of a catchment to different land use options. In this study the physically based, continuous time step model SWAT(mod) has been applied within the joint research project SFB 299 at the Giessen University to support the development of sustainable land use concepts. In a first step the model has been calibrated and validated for four mesoscale watersheds with differing land use distributions. Then the model performance for changing land use has been tested in an artificial watershed with a single crop at one time and one underlying soil type to eliminate the complex interactions of natural watersheds. In relation to forest barley produced the strongest response of the water balance components. Finally a case study for the Dietzholze watershed with two land use scenarios derived with the ProLand model has been carried out. The impact of land use change on the annual water balance was relatively small due to compensating effects in a complex catchment. The decrease of forest due to a grassland bonus amplifies the peak flow rate and thus increases the risk of flooding. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An extended version of the SVAT model TRAIN is used to model groundwater recharge grid based (500 x 500 m) on a daily time step for porous aquifers without lateral flow components. The conceptual soil model of the HBV rainfall runoff model was integrated into the SVAT model. One empirical soil parameter was calibrated on measured percolation of 20 lysimeters in Baden-Wurttemberg, one of the federal states in the south-west of Germany. The model proved suitable to simulate monthly percolation (groundwater recharge) under very different conditions.
   After the calibration of the model at the point sites the model was applied to a study area. The study area is part of an extensive porous aquifer in the Upper Rhine Valley. The nature of the conceptual soil model allows an easy parameterisation from digital soil data sets of the scale 1.200 000 together with land use data. Different land uses are modelled separately within each pixel. The model can provide monthly groundwater recharge as input data for groundwater modelling as well as long term groundwater recharge, as a basis for sustainable management of groundwater resources.

AB Several impoundment schemes have been built or are proposed in the UK and worldwide. Impounding fundamentally alters the dynamics of estuaries with consequences in terms of sedimentation patterns and rates as well as water quality. This paper presents some initial findings on the relationships of water quality to river flow based on work done on the Tees impoundment in Northeast England (a total exclusion system) in the summer of 1999 and the winter of 2000. Eleven water quality surveys were undertaken to measure a range of water quality parameters (BOD, alkalinity, pH, Eh, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, suspended solids, nitrate plus nitrite, ammonium and orthophosphate, and a range of metals) over a variety of states of river flow. Statistical analysis was used to determine whether the major water quality parameters were controlled by processes internal to the impoundment, i.e. with water depth and distance downstream, or external inputs to the impoundment. Those reported as controlled by external inputs include nitrate and nitrite, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, dissolved metals, conductivity, alkalinity, and temperature. pH, and to a minor extent dissolved oxygen and nutrients, show internal control. Understanding the controls on water quality parameters will allow more sustainable management of such schemes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GLOBAL INVENTORY
AB The actual emission rates of gaseous N compounds, such as NH3, N2O and NOX are a serious constraint to sustainable development. Qualitatively, our knowledge on the most important sources and controlling factors influencing the emission of these gases is quite high. Quantitatively, however, still a lot of research needs to be done. The uncertainty of emission estimates is the result of a very important variability in time and space. Co-operation between reputed research groups is important to further upgrade our knowledge. In addition, lack of precise information and absence of palpable effects makes the society not very enthusiastic about efforts to reduce gaseous N emission from soil. Therefore, an independent, integrated assessment of reduction strategies by politicians, scientists and society should be established to assure its implementation.

DE sustainable harvesting; regeneration; coastal scrub
AB Regeneration of Chorizanthe vaginata Benth. var. maritima Remy, a medicinal plant intensively traded in Chile, was analyzed to address the potential for sustainable harvest. We analyzed individual productivity per season, extrapolated results to four populations. We visited collecting sites with harvesters from a traditional market in Santiago and learned traditional collecting procedure. Relative species cover in four sites of the coastal scrub was measured to obtain estimates of remaining biomass until November 1998. Results show that plants are able to regenerate in about three years when cut above the site of the buds in the root-crown. More than 50% of plants are harvested unsustainably, and are usually between the ages of 8 and 12 years. Around 3.44 tons of C. vaginata were available in four populations. Since 5 tons are traded per year, C. vaginata is in danger of disappearing, unless proper harvesting and cultivation in degraded areas starts, as proposed by our group.

AB Here we report on a range of studies designed to understand the link between diversity and function in soils and in particular how plants and fertilisers might interact with microbial community dynamics in soils. The data presented indicate that although plants and fertilisers do impact on microbial community structure, the relationship between diversity, community structure and function remains complex and difficult to interpret using currently available chemical and molecular fingerprinting techniques. The paper assesses plants and management practices as drivers of change in soil and argues that whilst understanding diversity per se is unlikely to contribute to our understanding of function, an appreciation of what causes communities to change and also the relative importance of such drivers, could lead to new insights into the sustainable management and conservation of soils and natural resources.

AB Low-input agricultural systems that do not rely on fertilizers may be more dependent on vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal [VAM] fungi than conventionally managed systems. We studied populations of spores of VAM fungi, mycorrhiza formation and nutrient utilization of maize (Zea mays L.) grown in moldboard plowed, chisel-disked or no-tilled soil under conventional and low-input agricultural systems. Maize shoots and roots were collected at four growth stages. Soils under low-input management had higher VAM fungus spore populations than soils under conventional management. Spore populations and colonization of maize roots by VAM fungi were higher in no-tilled than in moldboard plowed or chisel-disked soil. The inoculum potential of soil collected in the autumn was greater for no-till and chisel-disked soils than for moldboard plowed soils and greater for low-input than conventionally farmed soil. The effects of tillage and farming system on N uptake and utilization varied with growth stage of the maize plants. The effect of farming system on P use efficiency was significant at the vegetative stages only, with higher efficiencies in plants under low-input management. The effect of tillage was consistent through all growth stages, with higher P use efficiencies in plants under moldboard plow and chisel-disk than under no-till. Plants grown in no-tilled soils had the highest shoot P concentrations throughout the experiment. This benefit of enhanced VAM fungus colonization, particularly in the low-input system in the absence of effective weed control and with likely lower soil temperatures, did not translate into enhanced growth and yield.

AB This article discusses the utility of conceptualizing the transition to sustainable energy resources and technologies in terms of a significantly modified notion of strategic choice. This conceptualization combines recently popularized game-theoretic approaches with tools and concepts emerging from the application of nonlinear systems theory. These models, which involve systemic choices, explore a broader range of institutional dynamics than those commonly associated with prevailing notions of "public choice." They also explain a number of unique hybrid processes of public/private coordination and cooperation emerging in advanced industrial economies in Europe and Australasia.

ID REFORM; STATE
AB Since 1997, the United Kingdom (UK) government has embarked upon a series of education policy initiatives based around the increased role of private interests in both policy formulation and implementation. This article takes a detailed look at private sector involvement in education policymaking and implementation using the current "National Grid for Learning" (NGfL) technology policy drive as a contemporary form. Based on a series of in-depth interviews with key public and private actors in the NGfL the article covers the role of business in the origins, policy formation, and eventual implementation of the initiative. It concludes by discussing the function big business can be said to be playing in UK education policy and the bearing this may have on the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of such policies.

AB Understanding the relationship between the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the throughput of matter and energy over time in modern societies is crucial for understanding the sustainability predicament as it is linked to economic growth. Available data on changes in energy use and economic performance in Spain (over the period 1960-1996) shows that Spain has been increasing its energy intensity during this period contrary to the hypothesis of an "inverted-U shaped curve of intensity of use." Will this increase be followed soon by a decrease! Or rather should we look for alternative explanatory hypotheses and study changes in the dynamic energy budget of Spain as movements between 'attractor points'? If this is the case, what are the main mechanisms generating such a behaviour? Three nonequivalent methods of analysis complementing each other are used to deal with these questions.

AB The exergy method has been used to analyse changes in the structure of the UK energy system over a period of more than 30 years from 1965. A sectoral approach was employed, with the supply side examined in terms of the main energy sources, while final demand was separated into four energy end-use groups: the domestic, service, industrial and transport sectors. Estimates of sector-weighted or 'lumped' parameters, such as exergy efficiencies, were obtained from the particular characteristics of each sector. These were employed to determine the exergetic 'improvement potential' for critical elements of the energy system. Electricity generation together with final energy demand in the domestic sector and in transport are shown to account for nearly 80 per cent of the Second Law improvement potential. This poor thermodynamic performance is principally due to exergy losses in combustion and heat transfer processes associated with power generation, space heating and main transport modes. The results of the exergy analysis are placed in the context of recent developments in energy market liberalization and of the need to achieve environmental sustainability. They are also contrasted with proposals for new or improved energy technologies to meet the requirements of a sustainable energy strategy. Finally, the role of the exergy method is contrasted with the various other approaches to energy technology assessment.

AB Thinking in terms of product life cycles is one of the challenges facing manufacturers today: efforts to increase efficiency throughout the life cycle do not only mean extended responsibility of the parties concerned. Economically successful business areas can also be explored. Whether new service concepts are required, new regulations have been passed or consumer values are changing, the differences between business areas are disappearing. Life cycle management (LCM) considers the product life cycle as a whole and optimizes the interaction of product design, manufacturing and life cycle activities. The goal of this approach is to protect resources and maximize effectiveness by means of life cycle assessment, product data management, technical support and, last but not least, life cycle costing. This paper shows the existing approaches of LCM and discusses their prospects and further development.

DE traffic signals; urban traffic control; urban networks
AB The optimum control of traffic in urban networks is an important requirement of city authorities as they seek efficient and sustainable transport. A feature of most urban networks is the high density of city streets with numerous road junctions, which require efficient control mechanisms if congestion is to be contained. Traffic signals have become the most widely used form of control in this context, with increasing sophistication in detection and real-time optimization providing new levels of efficiency. A changing policy background in many cities has also required greater emphasis in traffic control on the needs of public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, and on the need to minimize vehicle emissions. This paper provides an overview of problems, methods, systems and applications in the context of urban network traffic control, concluding with a look at future needs. The paper focuses particularly on signallized junctions within computer-controlled urban traffic control (UTC) systems, which are increasingly at the heart of traffic control in cities around the world.

AB Utilising fuel resources responsibly, reducing waste volume and emissions as well as conflict potentials within the international community (non-proliferation, energy demand) are among the principles for the judgement of sustainable development. Utilising and burning plutonium in a light water reactor has been shown to be feasible for the disposition of the large amount of excess plutonium produced in today's power reactors and resulting from the disarmament efforts of the super powers. With regard to material technology aspects, efforts have concentrated on the evaluation of fabrication feasibility and on the determination of the physicochemical properties of a single phase zirconium/erbium/plutonium oxide material stabilised as a cubic solution by yttrium for plutonium and minor actinide incineration and transmutation. Due to the absence of uranium as origin for plutonium build-up, such a nuclear fuel is called Inert Matrix Fuel. Irradiation testing with a dedicated experiment in the material test reactor in Halden, Norway, is underway within the framework of the OECD-Halden Reactor Project. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The conceptual basis for understanding and management of living marine resources is built on three basic ecological principles developed in the first half of the past century: the law of the minimum, competitive exclusion, and succession. This paper highlights aspects of these principles that make them insufficient as a sound foundation for understanding and managing marine ecosystems, points out dangers of continuing to use approaches built on them, and presents alternatives which might be more appropriate and of lower risk.
   To do this, the paper considers variability of marine ecosystems on annual, medium and long-term time scales, highlighting that these scales correspond to less than, approximately equal to, and much greater than, the generation times of dominant predators in the systems. It also considers how each interval of variability may affect directly ecosystems which are controlled from the bottom up, top down, and middle outward, and how position and duration of forcing affect five types of responses: growth, maturation, recruitment, predation, and competition. Generally these five processes have manifestations at the scale of individuals, populations, and ecosystems, attention is drawn to which manifestations are the most significant for each duration and position of forcing.
   Effects of some combinations of duration of forcing and position of forcing can be explained reasonably well by conventional ecological theory. For other combinations, particularly forcing at time scales of predator generations on top-down or middle-out ecosystems, theory based on contest competition and equilibria are likely to be misleading. In these systems the major dynamics are transients, when many ecosystems are far from their carrying capacities, so scramble competition dominates, and the carrying capacity is not helpful in explaining the system dynamics. This review clarifies the sorts of questions that we should be asking, in order to begin to understand the transient behaviour of these non-equilibrium ecosystems. The answers to the new classes of questions may lead to great improvements in how ecosystems are managed, as well as how their variation is explained. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Implementing urban renaissance - problems, possibilities and plans in
   South East England
SO PROGRESS IN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper explores the concept of urban renaissance and how it applies to the South East of England, the region where pressure for new housing development is at its most extreme and the responses of the planning process in the past have been at their most conservative. The paper initially explores the notion of urban renaissance and its probable alternative-urban malaise. This analysis is contextualised through a review of national policy on planning and sustainability, before the concept is pulled apart and a range of its key constituent dimensions reviewed. This wide-ranging policy and research review subsequently forms the basis for an analysis of South East planning policy in the second half of the paper.
   Initially the problems and pressures in the South East are explored before a review of the developing regional planning guidance examines how these concerns are being addressed. The key empirical work next reviews development plans from across the region as a means to gauge the extent to which the planning process is already addressing the urban renaissance agenda, and to assess the evolving nature of policy. A final chapter presents the key findings and looks to the future, discussing the role of the development plan in delivering an urban renaissance in the region and offering an agenda to take practice forward. The argument is made that the planning process provides potentially the central focus around which contributions to implementing an urban renaissance may converge. In this role the development plan can have a central co-ordinating and visionary function, although as yet examples of this potential are few and far between. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Re-use of small airfields: a planning perspective
SO PROGRESS IN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID URBAN FRINGE; GOVERNMENT; WALES
AB The English countryside has, in recent years, been subject to an array of development pressures, many of which have been the focus of both national and local debate. Local planning authorities (LPAs) have been handed the task of negotiating these pressures and navigating a difficult path between the need to permit necessary development and the desire to sustain environmental quality and local amenity. It is within this context that less contentious development sites have been sought which also offer sustainable solutions. Wartime airfields have, in many instances, been seen as suitable sites for redevelopment and it is patterns of land re-use on such sites that provide the focus of this research monograph.
   Through a national survey of local planning practice on wartime airfields, and a series of local case studies, the research which is reported within this monograph explores both the ways in which re-use has been regulated by the UK planning system and the nature of re-use on different sites. Maintaining the rights of aviation groups is an added pressure upon this process. More specifically, the monograph focuses attention on current uses on these sites, the regulatory role of the planning system and the compatibility of new and established uses.

AB The financial crisis affecting many of the local authorities in Israel has a significant influence on their ability to supply municipal services of an appropriate amount and quality. So far, studies have been addressed to the financial crisis from a political approach by discussing aspects such as the problematic interrelation between central and local governments together with resource allocation, In this paper we investigate the financial crisis of many local authorities in Israel from a strategic point of view. However, this is by no means to argue that other approaches such as institutional and political ones are not important. Rather, the paper investigates whether the financial crisis affecting many Israeli local authorities is a result of their own strategies and practices.
   Specifically, we have used the resource-based approach to explore the nature of their joint crises and the potential strategic responses that the local authorities should adopt in order to move into a more favourable state. In particular, we examine three resource-based systems: customer-oriented, organizational culture, and human resources, as the strategic roots of this crisis. We also examine the way they could produce a sustainable competitive advantage and could lead local authorities from the present position to a better one. The article recommends that the heads of local authorities should move to a resource-based strategy in order to perform both more efficiently and effectively.

ID COMPLEXES
AB By learning how to balance natural resource limitations and pollution prevention with economic growth, green chemistry will become the central science of sustainability. The elimination of persistent pollutants is vital for a sustainable civilization. To achieve this, the most important guiding concept is that the elemental composition of technology should be shifted toward the elemental composition of biochemistry. Oxidation chemistry is currently a prolific producer of persistent pollutants. Many arise from the use of chlorine, hypochlorite, or chlorine dioxide in large-scale oxidation processes. Oxidation chemistry can be greened by replacing these with catalyzed alternatives based on Nature's oxidizing agent, hydrogen peroxide. TAML(R) (TetraAmidol/MacrocyclicLigand) iron catalysts, which were invented at Carnegie Mellon University are widely patented and are being developed to activate H2O2 for commercial applications. TAML activators are water-soluble, easy to use, function well from neutral to basic pH, are not dominated by nonselective Fenton-like reactivity, are straightforward to synthesize, work effectively in minute concentrations, enable peroxide processes to occur at temperatures well below those of the processes targeted for replacement, and are amenable to modification for capturing novel selectivities. TAML activators are "dial-a-lifetime" catalysts: an activator can be chosen exhibiting a lifetime commensurate with the desired task.

AB Stratigraphic investigations together with climatic proxy data measurements and reliable radiocarbon dating show a history of fluctuations of dry and wet environmental conditions in the and to semi-arid zone of northern China since the late Pleistocene. Based on these data, we are able to reconstruct shifts of the desert margin in two period extremes, the last glacial maximum (21-15 ka) and the Holocene Optimum (9-5 ka). We have compared the present desert margin with that for the two extremes. The results indicate that a southward shift of the present margin of about 3 degrees in latitude might be caused by anthropogenic impact. Hence the influence of human activity must be taken into consideration for sustainable development and environment protection. Future research will be to find a two-way feedback existing between climate and anthropogenic impacts.

AB In the past 100 years there have been substantial demographic changes in the Division. and in rural Australia in general. This has led to shifts in the political power base. Further, it has led to a split in the homogeneity between urban/rural understandings of landscape values and landscape usage. There is now a range of Acts apart from the Western Land Act that prescribes resource use in the Division. These Acts reflect a departure from the belief that the Western Division is somehow different from the rest of the State. There is also a range in international agreements that further impact on activities in relation to land use activities generally and thus in the Division. In today's global marketplace, the power and expectations of the consumer have begun to usurp the ability of Governments to control and direct change. Changes in farming systems and practices are now often generated as a response to consumer demands for a cleaner, greener or cheaper product. and not by legislation.
   The consumer push for 'clean and green' and for the implementation of demonstrable environmentally sound management systems will eventually force lessees in the 21(st) century to do what the Western Land Act failed to force them to do in the past 100 years. Where the Western Land Board procrastinated, forgave and through a benevolent attitude failed to enforce lease agreements or eject lessees who were in continual breach of these agreements, market forces will instead be ruthless. Given the changes in the domestic social and political climate, and the requirements of international customers for the products of the Division, it is hard to see any role for the Western Land Commission in the future, apart from the administration of an antiquated and scarcely relevant Act.

Much of this newly acquired land is in rangeland areas, where the environmental degradation arising from pastoralism has lowered land values, thereby making land available for Aboriginal acquisition but at the same time making it less commercially viable without major capital investment. with the attendant possibility of further damage. In this context there can be no simple return to `tradition'. nor are there easy blueprints to follow to redevelop a viable approach to land management. Aborigines are faced with the question of choosing practical management decisions that will meet their cultural and ecological, as well as economic, needs. They are seeking also to take an active role in the broader management of the rangelands for which they feel responsibilities, beyond the fencelines of any one property. They are finding, however, that environmental decision-making is still embedded in the long colonial history of rural conflict over land and resources.
   While there are some approaches in common with non-Aboriginal neighbours and despite severe pressures and constraints, Aboriginal land managers are developing a distinctive pattern of decision-making which privileges social and cultural uses, together with an interest in implementing practical conservation measures for a wide variety of native biota. But the expression of Aboriginal interests in environmental decision-making continues to be obstructed. The long history of rural racial conflict over land and resources has left a legacy of severe structural disadvantage and of persistent, hostile alliances which act to marginalise Aboriginal voices despite the appearance of increasing inclusivity. The: paper argues that these obstructions to an active Aboriginal role in environmental decision-making need to be recognised and addressed if Aboriginal interests and knowledge are to contribute justly and effectively to rangeland sustainability.

ID SEED PRODUCTION; WHITE CLOVER; AUSTRALIA; GRASS
AB Total and germinable soil seedbanks (litter and soil) were studied for a native pasture and three sown pastures (dominated by Phalaris aquatica L. cv. Sirosa) in northern New South Wales from 1993 to 1996. Soil core samples were taken from continuously grazed plots for both pasture types and two oversown treatments in the native pasture and from a spring-autumn rest treatment at the sown pasture sites. At each site above ground herbage mass was also estimated regularly as part of the Temperate Pasture Sustainability Key Program.
   For all sites and treatments, the proportion of germinable seeds as a percentage of the total (dormant and germinable) seedbank ranged from 1-26% for the native pasture and 1-39% for the sown pastures. Germinable seed numbers ranged from 280 to 26,110 seeds per in, while total seedbank numbers were from 6700 to 178,360 seeds per m(2). Native pasture herbage mass was dominated by native perennial grasses, but seeds of these species were less than 20% of the total seed bank in all treatments in 1994 and 1995. At the sown pasture sites, most of the germinable (51-92%) and total (65-97%) seedbanks were either barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beaux, annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin), subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) or wireweed (Polygonum aviculare L.). Since seeds of annuals and other forbs generally dominated both the total and germinable seedbanks of these perennial grass-based pastures, these species were likely to increase over time,
   Seeds of the sown perennial grass Phalaris aquatica L, cv. Sirosa were less than 1% or the total seedbanks in pastures sown in 1990 and less than 3% of those sown in 1979, With above average summer rainfall at the native pasture site in 1996 and prolific growth of redgrass, seeds of this species were 38-63% of the total and 11-29% of the germinable seedbank in May 1996. Except at this site and time, the species composition of the total and germinable seedbanks did not generally reflect the dominance of the above ground herbage mass of these pastures by perennial grasses.

AB Rising international concern about global warming and the rapid development of the renewable energy industry over recent years has led to a need for multidisciplinary programs in energy studies. We have developed a postgraduate program in energy studies which is based on the principles of ecologically sustainable development. This program combines work in energy technology with energy policy, energy economics and environmental and social issues. The program is offered on campus at Murdoch University and by external study, via the internet, throughout Australia and overseas. It has attracted considerable interest from students seeking to find new opportunities within the renewable energy industry. This paper outlines the philosophy of the energy studies program, its implementation and outcomes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The scope of the paper is to demonstrate, through the experience of the Lombardy Region, how the creation and the financial support of a network of local energy agencies can greatly enhance the correct use of energy and the promotion of renewable energy sources at a local level.
   After showing the nature and the structure of the local energy agencies, this paper focuses upon the most important actions carried out by the Network in the last 3 years of activities. The creation of these technical structures on the territory is a small but concrete answer to the need of an energy policy oriented towards sustainability. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Internationally successful models for the implementation of wind energy are presented and suggested for the Australian electricity supply systems. With Perth being the congress host and Western Australia's known good wind resource, particular emphasis is given to the WA South West Interconnected System (SWIS). In the current framework, energy legislation is State Government's responsibility. In the light of the Kyoto Protocol the carbon dioxide emissions of the SWIS are indicated, the associated external cost are estimated and the Greenhouse Gas emissions offset potential from wind power is outlined. The socioeconomic advantages of wind energy are depicted. Recommendations are made on how these sustainable advantages might be utilised to unleash business opportunities for the private sector, which is the cornerstone of free enterprise economies.

AB Africa's large mammals are conserved for their aesthetic, scientific and economic values. Many of these species face a gloomy future precipitated by a combination of factors directly and indirectly influenced by the activities of man, including habitat loss, overexploitation, poor management of designated protected areas, and the vulnerability of small isolated populations. Africa's designated protected areas and biodiversity hotspots are also under threat, highlighting the importance of embracing community participation to address accelerating poverty and malnutrition. Innovative strategies are required for the conservation of Africa's mammals, such as the integration of a wide range of species in the production landscape, including the farming community. Transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) have been established with the combined objectives of conserving biodiversity, creating new jobs in the tourism and wildlife industry, and promoting a culture of peace. These areas extend far beyond traditional national parks, providing opportunities for integrating large mammals into sustainable land-use practices, at the same time as addressing some of the continent's more pressing socioeconomic needs. Research on African mammals will inevitably have to change direction to accommodate the growing threats and changed circumstances. Priorities will include the identification of corridors associated with TFCA establishment, the determination of the economic value of certain species in consumptive use programmes, research on contraception as a management option in restricted areas, and further work on the indirect use value of species. There will also be worthwhile opportunities to be pursued with ex situ conservation programmes, but these need to be focussed more efficiently.

AB It is generally accepted that production processes should take into account environmental sustainability principles. Hence, any attempt to measure the performance of these processes should highlight, as a reference standard, those processes that combine greater amounts of desirable production with lower levels of undesirable outputs, e.g, waste generation or emissions of greenhouse gases. Using this concept of environmental performance, it is possible to establish efficiency scores within a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA! framework, and to calculate desirable output losses when specific environmental standards on undesirable production are set by the authority, i.e. legislative opportunity costs. This can be achieved by solving programming models that call for a reduction of undesirable outputs and that stress the weak disposability of such outputs. Once a standard is set, it congests or binds the technology if the reductions in undesirable production required to meet it imply lower desirable output levels, i.e, the regulation is costly. DEA enables us to simulate, for each producer, the effect of any regulatory standard on production, and the limits beyond which production is impossible - lower limits, or superfluous - upper limits, because the chosen standard does not bind production. The empirical implications of the DEA process are analyzed considering different regulatory scenarios on CO2 emissions for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s manufacturing industries.

AB Marine invertebrates have long been considered to be resistant to overfishing. However, a growing number of exploited taxa have declined substantially and even disappeared from parts of their former range. We consider the case of the white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni); the first marine invertebrate proposed for the US endangered species list. This high-value species was one of five abalones targeted in the California and Mexico fisheries; it is now rare and protected from fishing. The biological characteristics of this deep-living abalone indicate that it was particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation; reduction of density or group size is now known to lead to declines in fertilization success and recruitment failure. Warning signs of potential problems existed both pre- and post-exploitation but were not recognized. In particular, serial depletion was not detected because catch was not analyzed spatially, perhaps because total landings were reasonably stable for the short period of exploitation. Recent submersible surveys led to estimates that white abalone now number less than 2,600 animals or 0.1% of the estimated pre-exploitation population size. Densities and estimated population sizes are less than 100 animals, at all but one location. Alternate explanations for the decline in abundance were considered and only exploitation-linked factors, such as sub-legal mortality and illegal fishing, were likely contributors. Episodic recruitment appears to be a characteristic of broadcast-spawning, long-lived species and may make them particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation. Management strategies based on size limits that allow a few years of spawning prior to reaching minimum legal size are insufficient. Sustainable fisheries will require multiple protected areas to preserve brood stock aggregations necessary for successful fertilization.

TI Enclosure and micro-enterprise as sustainable development: The case of
   the Canada/Costa Rica debt-for-nature investment
SO REVUE CANADIENNE D ETUDES DU DEVELOPPEMENT-CANADIAN JOURNAL OF
   DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This study demonstrates that debt-for-nature investment conforms to the neoclassical model of economic development which itself underlies the current environmental, social, and cultural crisis. The NGOs funded under the debt-for-nature swap operationalize the ostensible commitment of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the corporate environmental NGOs to pursue "sustainable development" and "gender equity" by means of the capitalist market. A small fraction of Costa Rica's debt is relieved at the cost of criminalizing citizens excluded from "the commons," newly legislated as parks, and via incorporating rural women into global market circuits which impoverish and disempower them. In documenting these practices and their consequences for local populations, this research challenges the claim that debt-for-nature investment reduces poverty and ecological destruction and, instead, uncovers the inadequacy of market-based "solutions" which in practice worsen the problems they claim to solve.

AB This study shows how socio-economic and political developments in the small island states of the English-speaking Caribbean (CARICOM) have always been shaped by global events and trends as these have been adopted, modified or resisted in relation to the specific conditions prevailing in these islands. This interaction between the local and the global, and the implications for securing the goals of sustainable livelihoods, are illustrated with reference to the author's own experience in national planning in the late 1950s, in local and community development in the 1960s and in Women in Development programs from 1974 to date. One response to structural adjustment was Women in Development programming, the success of which was limited by the overwhelming influence of macro-economic shifts towards neo-liberal policies. The emergence of a Caribbean women's movement in the context of the United Nations Decade for Women marked the beginning of a new kind of politics in this region. This politics was much more aware of global events and trends, It forged a distinct identity for Caribbean women who demonstrated their capacities to strategize across regional and national borders. This identity as Caribbean women within a larger international women's movement enriched and empowered women in the region to promote their own agendas, pursue their own priorities and launch their own campaigns while drawing on the support and solidarity of women from other countries.

AB We examine what interpretation can be given to inclusive income, understood to be consumption plus the value of the net increase in all relevant capital stocks. We introduce the concept of instantaneously constant value income, defined as the maximum amount the economy can consume at a moment of time and keep the expected present value of utility of current and future generations constant. We argue that this income concept captures some of the concerns underlying sustainability. Our main result is that inclusive income equals instantaneously constant value income. We show that this result holds in a very general setting and, in particular, carries over to models incorporating technological progress when such progress can be captured by augmented stocks of knowledge. An important implication of our main result is that it provides a very simple method for deriving inclusive income, which does not involve any linearization of the Hamiltonian.

ID MANAGEMENT; OWNERS
AB In the last few years, the European countries have created a whole arsenal of regulatory, financial and informational instruments with the objective of enhancing sustainable forest management (SFM). In the course of this policy development effort so far, the targets of governance have been more or less neglected. This article argues that a forest managers values have a major influence on the perception of and the reaction to different types of public policy instruments. The results of a mail survey carried out among Austrian forestry professionals show that the persons in charge of putting SFM into practical action can be characterized by specific value patterns. By means of cluster analysis, forestry professionals were classified into six value types. Each of the six types identified is expected to respond to policy instruments in a specific way. Based on these findings, I finally discuss if and how policy instruments can be designed and implemented in a more target-group oriented way.

AB Previous research has documented that nitrogen fertilization can lead to a significant tree growth increase in large parts of Scandinavia. Nutrient management of Nordic forests is currently under debate, mainly because environmental values are believed to be unnecessarily endangered by these actions. Nutrient management including fertilization, liming, recycling of wood ash or application of alternative nutrient sources can counteract nutrient deficiencies and imbalances, and be used for compensating the nutrients removed through harvesting. For successful implementation of nutritional management measures, several questions should still be studied. These questions mainly concern diagnosis of the need for applications, nutritional sustainability and treatment effects on the forest ecosystem and the surrounding environment.

AB We review species richness in major organism groups, mainly using examples from northern Europe. A high proportion of these species is forest living, and large numbers are dependent on decaying wood. Biodiversity can be assessed at various scales using two different principles. One is to use features. such as ancient and dead trees, known to be important for a large number of species. The other method is to choose species or groups of species known to indicate high biodiversity or presence of many red-listed species. We argue that any serious biodiversity assessment method should include the most species rich organism groups, for example insects. In the present paper we point out the most important features for high biodiversity (old trees and large dead trees), and review the quantities of these features in near-virgin forests. The natural disturbance regime of a region should be the basis for defining a suitable scale and the appropriate features for biodiversity assessment. Possible indicator species for high biodiversity in northern Europe are suggested. based on previous investigations. Among epiphytic lichens and wood-living beetles there are many potentially useful species in addition to vascular plants in the nemoral forest. Among vertebrates, woodpeckers and grouses seem to be the most useful. Validation tests for indicator structures and species are largely lacking but urgently needed. The implications of possible delayed local extinctions tire important to bear in mind when managing for sustainable forestry. The knowledge of forest history is useful when developing cost-efficient measures.

AB Boreal forest management has changed rapidly during recent years, and new forestry practices, such as green tree retention (GTR), which aim at ecological sustainability have been developed. With our present knowledge. we cannot fully assess the ecological benefits of prevailing Fennoscandian GTR levels(5-10 trees/ha). Small retention tree groups cannot be expected to provide habitat for interior Forest species because of edge effects. However. even individual trees will increase the amount of snags and logs, which are important habitats for many species. According to our own results, the response of understory vegetation depends clearly on retention level. With 7% retention of stand volume, or about 50 trees per ha, we found no remarkable differences in vegetation response as compared with clear-felling. This indicates that a higher level of retention is needed to maintain late successional plant species on the site. Our data also show that there is much within-stand type variation, which correlates with the amount of CWD and stand characteristics. By locating larger retention tree groups in species-rich areas, and avoiding disturbance to CWD, a higher proportion of the resident species diversity may be "lifeboated" over the regeneration phase on the stand level. In this paper we review existing literature on green tree retention, with special emphasis on Fennoscandian forest management, biodiversity and productivity issues. We present results of two ongoing Finnish experimental studies that Focus on the effects of various forestry practices on understory vegetation including epixylic taxa.

AB Objectives: This paper evaluates the 10-year outcomes of a Northern Sweden community intervention program for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with special reference to the social patterning of risk development.
   Methods: Using a quasi-experimental design, trends in risk factors and predicted mortality in an intervention area (Norsjo municipality) are compared with those in a reference area (Northern Sweden region) by repeated independent cross-sectional surveys.
   Results: There were significant differences in changes in total cholesterol level and systolic blood pressure between the intervention and reference populations. The predicted coronary heart disease mortality (based on the North Karelia risk equation), after adjustment for age and education, was reduced by 36% in the intervention area and by 1% in the reference area.
   Conclusions: We conclude that a long-term community-based CVD prevention program which combines population and individual strategies can substantially promote a health shift in CVD risk in a high risk rural population. When evaluated for different social strata, we found no signs of an increasing health gap between socially privileged and less privileged groups. Socially less-privileged groups benefited the most from the present prevention program.

AB Drawing considerably from records of fish catches made by the fishermen of Fair Isle during the 20th century, this article highlights the dramatic decline in fish stocks in the waters around the Isle. It argues that the major cause has been the continuous intensification of the commercial fishing industry outside Fair Isle. Assessment is also made of the socio-economic and cultural impact on the community of Fair Isle, and means are proposed to retain and regain links with tho sea.

DE forestry scenario modeling; carbon balance; forest valuation
AB The dynamics of the age class structure stands at the center of modeling long-run forestry scenarios. This insight has been applied to the construction of the Forest Development and Carbon Budget Simulation Model (FORCABSIM), a model which is used for the study of several inter-related questions: the development of timber stocks and the potential level of sustainable harvests, the stocks and fluxes of tree carbon in managed forests, the economy-wide effects of management practices on the value of forest lands and timber stocks. The combined study of these issues allows to assess development scenarios with regard to the productive potential of forestry, the carbon cycle, and forest values. At present, the model is adapted to German data, but it is designed for use with other data sets as well.
   This paper provides a description of core mechanisms in FORCABSIM. On this background, the choice and impact of crucial assumptions is examined. Illustrative results are used to demonstrate the use of the model. The paper focuses on the impact of varying rotation ages and the tree species composition. Particular attention is given to the concept of steady states.

ID CARBON
AB Forests play an important role in the sequestration of carbon dioxide and the storage of carbon. The potential and efficiency of mitigation options in forestry have been studied using large-scale forestry scenario models. In Finland, three models have been applied in attempts to estimate timber production and related carbon budgets. In this study, these models are compared. The oldest, MELA, was designed in the 1970s for the regional and national analysis of timber production. The European Forest Information Scenario Model, EFISCEN, originally a Swedish area matrix model, was developed in the early 1980s. SIMA, a gap-type ecosystem model, was utilised in the 1990s for regional predictions on how the changing climate may affect forest growth and timber yield in Finland. In EFISCEN, only the development of growing stock is endogeneous because the assumptions on growth, and the removal and rules for felling are given exogeneously. In the SIMA model, the rules for felling are exogeneous but the growth is modelled based on individual trees reacting to their environment. In the MELA model, the management of forests is endogeneous, i.e. the growth, felling regimes and the development of growing stock are the results of the analysis. The MELA approach integrated with a process-based ecosystem model seems most applicable in the analyses of effective mitigation measures compatible with sustainable forestry under a changing climate. When using the scenarios for the estimation of carbon budget, the policy makers should check that the analyses cover the whole area of interest, and that the assumptions on growth and management together with the definitions applied correspond with the forestry conditions in question.

AB Gene diversity and inbreeding of seed crop over generations were derived and predicted as a function of fertility variation and population sizes in forest tree populations. Gene diversity was calculated in terms of group coancestry. Fertility differences were described by sibling coefficient, which is the probability that two genes originate from the same parent, compared to a situation where all parents give rise to the same number of offspring. Fertility data were collected in a finite population, and calculations were made for the case of a constant breeding population size. The change of status number could be associated with the sibling coefficient. Predictions over five generations showed that group coancestry and inbreeding accumulated fast at the first early shifts. Relative status number declined very fast over generations. The increase of inbreeding and group coancestry was accelerated by fertility variation, and the accumulation was slightly faster and higher if fertility of both genders varied than if maternal fertility was kept constant. Gene diversity decreased faster if fertility variation was large, and maintained higher if the effective population size was reasonably large. Breeding programs that use closely related genotypes lead to the decrease of effective number (i.e., drop in gene diversity) over generations and do not provide a sustainable long-term breeding strategy.

TI Moving towards local-level indicators of sustainability in forest-based
   communities: A mixed-method approach
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH

   sustainability
ID CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK
AB Forest-dependent communities can be exemplified in terms of subsistence dependence, park-based tourism dependence, or traditional logging dependence. In monitoring the sustainability of these places, researchers have struggled to develop relevant indicators responsive to their unique social, economic, and environmental conditions. In this study, we attempt to deal with these conditions by employing a quality-of-life framework in the selection of local-level indicators, and by scrutinizing these indicators in term of their relevance to specific sustainability concerns. We used workshops, an indicator evaluation framework, and survey research to identify relevant local-level indicators of sustainability in two Saskatchewan communities. Findings emphasize the need for caution in asserting the utility of ``one-size-fits-all'' approaches to community sustainability. These communities define progress toward sustainability quite differently and therefore require a unique set of progress measures.

TI Rangeland to cropland conversions as replacement land for prime farmland
   lost to urban development
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Data from the 1997 National Resources Inventory (NRI) are used in this study to examine recent trends in the conversion of cropland to urban land with special attention paid to the spatial distribution of these conversions relative to rangeland to cropland conversions. Our findings are that the approximately 11 million acres of cropland converted to urban land between 1982 and 1997 was coincident with an equal amount of rangeland converting to cropland. The rangeland to cropland conversions equate to replacement lands for cropland lost to urban encroachment. Approximately one third of the cropland lost to urban development occurs on prime farmland while the new cropland converted from rangeland is more likely to be irrigated as it resides principally in the and western United States. The findings are discussed in light of a sustainable land use system perspective. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All fights reserved.

TI Conversion to organic farming: A typical example of the diffusion of an
   innovation?
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; DIVERSITY; CHALLENGE
AB This paper reviews a large number of studies of organic farmers carried out in several countries over a period of about twenty years, and critically assesses whether or not the results appear to fit the framework of the adoption/diffusion model. After a summary of the adoption/diffusion model and a short description of organic farming and its development in Europe, the personal and social characteristics of early adopters of other innovations are compared with the conversion process to organic farming. Most of the studies reviewed, particularly the earlier ones, were carried out at a time when the organic sector was small and the diffusion of organic farming was at the so-called innovation stage. The first organic farmers showed similar characteristics to innovators of other environmental innovations and faced problems that were typically associated with this stage, such as opposition in the farmingcommunity and social isolation. Several similarities between the studied organic farmers and early adopters of other innovations were identified and the overall conclusion appears therefore justified that the moder can be used to gain some further understanding of the diffusion processes of organic farming and the individual adoption or conversion decision.

TI Organic farming in a regulatory perspective. The Danish case
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA English
DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; FARMERS
AB Organic farming aims at developing self-regulating sustainable farming systems and seems to be an important example of environmental self-regulation with a strong basis in values. Poltical acknowledgement of organic farming included the introduction of public certification, but this may disturb self-regulation This issue is discussed on the basis of Danish experiences, which include major increases in organic farming and domestic organic food markets. Originally public certification of organic products was introduced on the basis of dose co-operation with the organic farming movement, but the introduction of Ev certification gradually undermined co-operation, and the organic social movement has now lost control over production standards. Danish organic farmers seem on the other hand prepared to develop and use new methods of self-regulation. The farmers accord well with the fundamental values of organic farming, they do not violate the standards, and they are interested in active use of organic farming values in farm management.

AB Over the past few years, convergence between organic farming and processes of rural development has been progressively acknowledged and organic practices and practitioners have been effectively involved in various rural development projects. Nevertheless, organic farming's potential contribution to rural development processes has not been explored extensively in the specialized literature. This paper illustrates the manifold synergies existing between organic farming and sustainable rural development, through a specific framework of analysis built on the implicit assumption that both modem, dynamic and multifaceted organic farming systems and rural economies are 'hybrid and composite networks,' which can be analyzed according to an evolutionary perspective and to the network analysis approach. The work identifies four main points of communality between organic farming and sustainable rural development: innovation, conservation, participation and integration. All of them are critical aspects in current strategies for sustainable rural development, and, at the same time, key features of modern organic farming ideology and practices within an EU context.

AB Microwave-assisted extraction, a MAP (TM) technology, has been the subject of enhanced interest from the environmental sector in the last few years as a result of the need for methodologies that improve sample preparation without compromising the quality of the data while being environmentally sustainable. Liquid-phase microwave-assisted extraction offers such advantages: it is a very fast extraction technique, it consumes less solvent and energy, and it is cost effective. A preliminary validation study involving closed-vessel apparatus and contaminants such as PAHs, PCDDs/PCDFs, chlorinated pesticides, and PCBs was performed (Li et al., 1996). Excellent performance and precision were achieved for these analytes (Li et al., 1996). In order to fully evaluate the method fora wider range of analytes an interlaboratory study was performed. A round-robin study was performed with five laboratories carrying out the extraction portion. This study also involved thermally labile and potentially reactive RCRA target analytes such as phenols, phenoxyacid herbicides, and organophosphorus pesticides. Three split samples were used by each laboratory using methodologies stipulated in a single standard operational procedure (SOP). The extractions from the five laboratories were sent to a single laboratory who performed all the analyses in order to minimize the variability of the results due to the determinative procedure. Clean up was performed using standard procedures and analyses were done according to the appropriate US EPA SW-846 methods. The broad range of applicability, the reduced sample preparation time, and the reduced amount of solvent used all contribute to achieving sustainable environmental protection goals. Furthermore, the reduced operational costs associated with the protocol - compared to conventional Soxhlet, for example-are significant and prove valuable in these times where the `greening" of the laboratory usually gives rise to higher operating costs. Further work involving open-vessel apparatus is under way.

AB Despite being one of the most profitable crops for the southeastern USA, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is considered to create a greater soil erosion hazard than other annual crops such as corn (Zen mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Reduced tillage systems and cover cropping can reduce soil erosion and leaching of nutrients into ground water. The objectives of this study, which was conducted in north Alabama from 1996 to 1998, were to assess the impact of no-till and mulch-till systems with a winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop and poultry litter on soil erosion estimates in cotton plots using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). Soil erosion estimates in conventional till plots with or without a winter rye cover crop and ammonium nitrate fertilizer were double the 11 t ha(-1) yr(-1) tolerance level for the Decatur series soils. However, using poultry litter as the N source (100 kg N ha(-1)) gave soil erosion estimates about 50% below the tolerance level under conventional till. Doubling the N rate through poultry litter to 200 kg N ha(-1) under no-till system gave the lowest soil erosion estimate level. No-till and mulch-till gave erosion estimates which were about 50% of the tolerance level with or without cover cropping or N fertilization This study shows that no-till and mulch-till systems with cover cropping and poultry litter can reduce soil erosion in addition to increasing cotton growth and lint yields, and thus improve sustainability of cotton soils in the southeastern USA.

AB Wheat production in Morocco is constrained by both scarce climate and degraded soil quality. There is an urgent need to revert production decline while restoring country's soils. Among conservation tillage systems known for their improvement in yield, no-till technology was found to influence soil quality as well. Soil quality indices are also affected by wheat rotations at medium and long-terms. This paper discusses changes in selected properties of a Calcixeroll soil, including total and particulate soil organic matter (SOM), pH, total N and aggregation, subjected, for 11 consecutive years, to various conservation and conventional agricultural systems. Tillage systems included no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT). Crop rotations were continuous wheat, fallow-wheat, fallow-wheat-com, fallow-wheat-forage and fallow-wheat-lentils. Higher aggregation, carbon sequestration, pH decline and particulate organic matter (POM) buildup are major changes associated with shift from conventional- to NT system. Better stability of aggregates was demonstrated by a significantly greater mean weight diameter under NT (3.8 mm) than CT system (3.2 mm) at the soil surface. There was 13.6% SOC increase in (0-200 mm) over the 11-year period under NT, while CT did not affect much this soil quality indicator. Another valuable funding is the stratification of SOC and total nitrogen in NT surface horizon (0-25 mm) without their depletion at deeper horizon compared to tillage treatments. Fallow-wheat system resulted in reduction of SOC compared to WW, but 3-year wheat rotation tended to improve overall soil quality. Benefits from crop rotation in terms of organic carbon varied between 2.6 and 11.7%, with fallow-wheat-forage exhibiting the maximum. Combined use of NT and 3-year fallow rotation helped to improve soil quality in this experiment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI TOWNSCOPE II - A computer system to support solar access decision-making
SO SOLAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TOOL
AB TOWNSCOPE II is a computer system deleted to support solar access decision-making in a sustainable urban design perspective. The software consists of a three-dimensional urban information system coupled with solar evaluation tools. We've paid particular attention to the fact that numerical results interpretation proves to be all but trivial in complex built environments. It is nevertheless a crucial aspect in decision-making, especially for current negotiated urban design practices. Therefore it is important to develop visual instruments in order to unveil the geometrical mechanisms lying behind the final results. Various spherical projections were thereby developed, each of them presenting specific advantages and disadvantages for solar access visualisation and/or evaluation purposes.

DE cattle; sustainable; farming systems
AB A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among a purposive sample of 60 small-scale cattle farmers in the Mopeane Rustenburg district, all of whom owned five or more head of cattle. Results showed that small-scale cattle farming is a part-time activity for most farmers in this district, and a way of investing or saving money in a form that is easily converted to cash when needed. This activity also provides households with a source of fresh milk. Contrary to the situation in most other Southern African regions, social status and lobola (bridal dowry) did not constitute the most important reasons for farming with cattle. The poor economic return of these small-scale cattle farming activities and the potential environmental degradation associated with overstocking poses a serious risk to the long-term sustainability of such fanning systems.

AB Two distinct populations of West Coast steenbras Lithognathus aureti are found in Namibian waters; one, the northern population, is exploited recreationally and commercially. Data collected between 1995 and 1999 were used to evaluate its current state and potential yield. using two yield-per-recruit approaches. A Beverton and Holt model was used to study the effect of different fishing mortalities, natural mortality and age-at-first-capture schedules on yield-per-recruit, and also to derive fishing mortality levels for prescribed biological reference points. A Thompson and Bell model was used to test the performance of some fisheries regulations, e.g. the effects that implementation of a minimum size could have on the sustainable exploitation of the stock, within safe biological limits. Results from the Thompson and Bell model estimated maximum sustainable yield for the northern population of Lithognathus aureti at between 109 and 173 tons. The best estimate was some 134 tons, a value also proposed as the limit reference point. Current depletion is 42%, and a minimum size limit of 40 cm for West Coast steenbras off Namibia is proposed. This restriction would only slightly increase spawner stock biomass, but the spawning potential of the population would increase considerably.

AB The Lophius vomerinus component of the monkfish resource off Namibia was assessed by means of deterministic length- and age-based models. Steady state length cohort analyses illustrated that, although the model was sensitive to the rate of natural mortality, it was relatively insensitive to changes in terminal fishing mortality. These biases may, however, not be serious provided that estimates of abundance are used to reflect relative changes in the biomass dynamics of the population. The age-structured production model, tuned to trends in General-Linear-Modelling-standardized catch-per-unit-effort data and relative abundance indices calculated from hake (Merluccius spp.) biomass surveys, together with observed commercial and survey catches-at-age, showed similar trends. Both models provided evidence that the monkfish resource was fully to overexploited, with current harvesting levels higher than those concomitant with sustainable yields.

AB Bioregenerative life support technologies for space application are advantageous if they can be constructed using locally available materials, and rely on renewable energy resources, lessening the need for launch and resupply of materials. These same characteristics are desirable in the global Earth environment because such technologies are more affordable by developing countries, and are more sustainable long-term since they utilize less non-renewable, imported resources. Subsurface flow wetlands (wastewater gardens (TM)) were developed and evaluated for wastewater recycling along the coast of Yucatan. Emergy evaluations, a measure of the environmental and human economic resource utilization, showed that compared to conventional sewage treatment, wetland wastewater treatment systems use far less imported and purchased materials. Wetland systems are also less energy-dependent, lessening dependence on electrical infrastructure, and require simpler maintenance since the system largely relies on the ecological action of microbes and plants for their efficacy.
   Detailed emergy evaluations showed that wetland systems use only about 15% the purchased emergy of conventional sewage systems, and that renewable resources contribute 60% of total emergy used (excluding the sewage itself) compared to less than 1% use of renewable resources in the high-tech systems. Applied on a larger scale for development in third world countries, wetland systems would require 1/5 the electrical energy of conventional sewage treatment (package plants), and save 2/3 of total capital and operating expenses over a 20-year timeframe. In addition, there are numerous secondary benefits from wetland systems including fiber/fodder/food from the wetland plants, creation of ecosystems of high biodiversity with animal habitat value, and aesthestic/landscape enhancement of the community. Wetland wastewater treatment is an exemplar of ecological engineering in that it creates an interface ecosystem to handle byproducts of the human economy, maximizing performance of the both the natural economy and natural ecosystems. Wetland systems accomplish this with far greater resource economy than other sewage treatment approaches, and thus offer benefits for both space and Earth applications. (C) 2001 COSPAR.

TI Active commuting to school - An overlooked source of childrens' physical
   activity?

AB The assessment and promotion of childrens' healthful physical activity is important: (i) to combat the international obesity epidemic that extends to childhood: and (ii) to establish an early habit of lifestyle physical activity that can be sustained into adolescence and adulthood. The primary focus of both assessment and promotion efforts has been on in-school physical education classes and, to a lesser extent, out-of-school structured exercise, sport and play. A potential source of continuous moderate activity, active commuting to school by means of walking or by bicycle, has been largely ignored in surveys of physical activity. Suggestive evidence of steep declines in the amount of childrens' destination walking can be gleaned from national transportation surveys. At the same time, there has been a dramatic increase in the reported use of motorised vehicles, including the use for chauffeuring children. There is very little evidence to support or refute active commuting to school as an important source of childrens physical activity; however, this is largely because it has been overlooked in the stampede to assess time in more vigorous activities.
   The promotion of active commuting to school must be considered in the context of parents' real and perceived concerns for their children's personal and pedestrian safety. We certainly do not have a full understanding at this time of all the factors related to decisions about transportation mode, whether by child, parent, community, or school. Such information is necessary if successful and sustainable interventions can be implemented, important transport policy decisions can be made. and community and school designs can be modified. Practice rarely waits for research, however, and there are numerous examples of innovative programming, policies and environmental designs occurring internationally that can serve as natural experiments for enterprising researchers willing to push the envelope of our understanding of active commuting and childrens' physical activity. Since we know so little, there is much to learn.

AB Resource-based theory argues that resources must be valuable, rare, inimitable, and lack substitutes to confer competitive advantage. Inimitability is a lynchpin of resource-based theory and central to understanding the sustainability of competitive advantage.
   Although scholars recognize a positive relationship between causal ambiguity and inimitability, the relationship among critical resources called competencies, causal ambiguity, and firm performance remains an unresolved conundrum. One perspective suggests that causal ambiguity regarding competencies and performance is necessary among internal and external managers for sustainable competitive advantage because it severely limits imitation. Causal ambiguity, therefore, enhances firm performance. Another view holds that causal ambiguity places a constraint on the transfer and leveraging of these competencies within a firm. In this case, causal ambiguity may adversely influence firm performance.
   This paper takes a resource-based view to develop and test hypotheses that relate managers' perceptions of causal ambiguity to their firm's performance. The hypotheses examine relationships between firm performance and (1) causal ambiguity regarding the link between competencies and competitive advantage, and (2) causally ambiguous characteristics of competencies. Research involving 224 executives in 17 organizations provides valuable insights into the relationships between causal ambiguity and firm performance. A model is then developed based on these findings. particular consideration is given to the differing ways top and middle managers in a firm may experience causal ambiguity and to how these differences may be understood and managed.

AB The fact that the concentration of carbon dioxide is increasing steadily forces us to reconsider the ways in which we exploit fossil fuels. Current carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by factor two. In case we don't take any actions to reduce emissions now, they will double in the future, due to the increase of energy use from the growing Earth's population. Therefore, we will have to deal with an emission reduction factor of four, merely to stabilize the Earth's climate.
   It is possible to reduce primary energy needs for 50 - 75% by introducing sustainable energy system and by increasing efficiency at energy conversion and use. Heat exchangers will play an important role in this respect. In this paper some ideas are presented about how to attain the desired reduction of energy use while at the same time preserving the current level of living comfort and transportation using high efficiency heat exchangers.

AB Assessment tools based on static and linear concepts such as traditional cost-benefit analysis cannot reasonably be applied for long-term assessments of complex systems. One major reason is that secondary effects of policies caused by endogenous dynamics of the system are not considered. Therefore, the strategic environmental assessment is developed for environmental impacts; it already includes a feedback mechanism-from the failure to reach environmental targets to changes of policy initiatives and to a repeated impact prediction. Because the need to further integrate environmental assessment with economic and social assessment to achieve sustainability is recognized, a so-called strategic sustainability analysis (SSA) is suggested. The SSA is applied for integrated long-term assessment of policies and programs. Requirements and two prototypical examples (Economic Assessment of Sustainability Policies of Transport, Assessment of Transport Strategies) on how to realize SSAs are presented.

AB The Durastudy is a new surveillance protocol to detect impending pump failure in Novacor((R)) N100 left Ventricular Assist Systems implanted for the long term. Our patient, a 54-year-old man with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and contraindications for heart transplantation, received a Novacor pump in May 1995 and did not experience sustainable ventricular recovery during the subsequent 3 years. After more than 3 years of support, symptoms of pump wear were detected in this patient, through application of the Durastudy protocol. This enabled us to electively exchange the pump at 3.8 years. Our patient remained in New York Heart Association functional class 1 until he died in July 1999 of causes unrelated to the pump, after some 1,514 days of support. This, we believe, still constitutes a world record.

AB This paper examines some major institutional factors determining the possibilities for successful waste reduction policies. In a multiple case study, four geographically defined cases of markets for municipal solid waste are compared on four core elements in the sector structure, It shows that the structure is shaping institutional capacity for achieving waste reduction. This capacity is determined mainly by combined structural elements. Privatisation, for example, should definitely not be seen as the only effective solution, Only under very specific conditions (unbundling and separation of functions) can privatisation have positive results, On the other hand, when authorities act as regulators, they should not have interests in waste collection and disposal. They should stick to either regulation, collection or disposal.

AB This introductory paper presents the perspective of an oil company on automotive fuels development and vehicle emissions. Studies arc described of fuel effects on aftertreatment catalyst efficiencies for both modem gasoline and diesel vehicles. Shell has consistently responded to the fuel requirements of both customers and new vehicle technologies over the past few decades and will continue to do so. As society moves to more sustainable energy sources, the future of automotive mobility is discussed; new, alternative vehicles technologies are expected to emerge, which may require completely new fuels, and this could lead to a reshaping of our fuels (energy) business.

AB Since the beginning of combustion engine development in this recent century various different fuels have been successfully tested. Diesel engines have been adapted to fuels made from mineral oils because of the rising importance and the cheapness in comparison to other fuels. On the other hand, it is possible to burn regenerative fuels in engines and achieve some significant advantages in comparison to fossil diesel fuel. This is, for example, a closed carbon dioxide (CO2) cycle which causes no green house effect. It is possible to extract oil from various seeds like rapeseed. It is also possible to burn used oil from the food processing industry or waste grease and oil from food recycling companies. The great advantages: (1) food recycling oils can produce energy instead of use as animal food, and (2) as nobody knows exactly the consistency of the collected oils, poisonous pollution is possible. These regenerative fuels can be burned without any further processing in special adapted diesel engines, for example an Elsbett engine, or in precombustion engines with large swept volumes. Most researchers focused on operating diesel engines with regenerative fuels and reducing the emissions caring only about regulated exhaust components. In comparison to these studies it is necessary to learn more about the emissions beyond the exhaust regulations. Additionally emission reduction is possible by using an SCR-catalyst (selective catalytic reduction) to reduce the NO2 combined with an oxidation-catalyst which reduces any kind of oxidisable emissions. The TU Munchen, Lehrstuhl fur Energie- und Umwelttechnik der Lebensmittelindustrie, operates a small co-generation plant with the ability of analysing the standard emission components (CO, NO2, HC, particles, CO2, O-2) and unregulated components (SO2, NH3, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), aldehyde, ketone). The emissions show some significant differences in comparison to fossil diesel fuel which is caused by the diversity of each fuel. Results of an investigation on four different fuels (wastefat methyl ester (WME), rapeseed methyl ester (RME), rapeseed oil and diesel fuel) burned in a small co-generation plant with a SCR- and oxidation-catalyst will be presented. A comparison to the emissions before and after the catalysts will be shown additionally to the results of the different reduction potential of diesel fuel, methyl ester or untreated oils. The combination of regenerative fuel and catalyst shows good potential for reducing the emissions. Furthermore the use of regenerative fuels is a sustainable production of energy with an overall efficiency of almost 90%. Regenerative fuels based on vegetable oils and waste fat are a valuable form of energy and have some significant advantages in comparison to diesel fuel, like an almost closed carbon dioxide cycle, rapid biological decomposition and lower CO, HC and particle emissions. Regenerative fuels should also meet minimum standards discussed in the paper to avoid the risk of engine damage and to reduce emissions.

AB A broad overview is presented of the role and opportunities for bus transit in the 21st century. Drawing from the input of a millennium paper prepared by TRB's Bus Transit Committee (Bus Transportation in the New Millennium-A Look Forward), bus transit's past, its present status, and its future prospects are reviewed. Policy choices, likely dimensions of change, and various opportunities for improvements in service design, vehicles, bus technology, and management are identified. Bus transport will continue to provide important service to metropolitan America. Therefore, continued support at all levels of government is essential. Growing community concerns about traffic congestion, sprawl, air pollution, and sustainability; the progressive revitalization of cities and towns; and continued advances in transport technology argue for improved bus transit in the new century. A greater effort to establish more transit-friendly residential areas, employment centers, and shopping areas will further enhance the future of bus transit.

AB The automobile accounts for more than 95 percent of all person miles traveled in the United States, whereas transit accounts for less than 3 percent of all trips. Between the private automobile and traditional transit, niche markets exist for other transportation services, such as airport and transit feeder shuttles and carsharing. Commuter-based carsharing, by which individuals share a fleet of vehicles linked to transit, could potentially fill and expand one such niche; complement existing services, mainly transit and feeder shuttles; and develop into a viable transportation alternative. A brief overview is presented of transit feeder services, particularly in Northern California. The CarLink I field test is described-a commuter-based carsharing model developed and tested in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1999. Key behavioral findings are highlighted. Recommendations are made for strengthening the viability of this innovative service, mainly on the basis of experience from the CarLink I field test. Empirical evidence suggests that CarLink could be sustainable if certain conditions exist: strong cooperation with local businesses and transit is established; parking limitations and congestion are prevalent; system feasibility is demonstrated; incentives are used (e.g., preferred parking and transit pass subsidies); higher user fees are generated; and technology and management costs are lowered. Further, CarLink's long-term potential and viability could be strengthened by a combination of approaches, including cost reduction strategies, policy incentives, linkages to other complementary services (e.g., ridesharing), and local program support (e.g., demonstration grants).

AB Multimodal passenger transportation has received renewed attention in industrialized countries as a more sustainable and environmentally sensitive alternative to the uncontrolled growth in car travel. As a result there has been a diverse range of policy and planning guidelines supporting, promoting, and evaluating seamless multimodal travel alternatives. Few attempts, however, have been made at quantifying the space-time implications of multimodal transportation on the travel behavior and activity patterns of individuals. This research is concerned with an analysis of multimodal trips to provide insight into the specific travel behavioral and sociodemographic characteristics of multimodal transportation users in the Netherlands. A conceptual overview of multimodal transportation is provided followed by a brief literature review that discusses some relevant research themes relating to multimodal transportation. This conceptual overview is quantified with travel data from the 1998 Dutch National Travel Survey. On the basis of the analysis, conclusions are drawn with regard to the most frequently occurring mode chain combinations, number of trips, trip duration, and mean trip and stage distance. Attention is also paid to each mode's unique distance decay function for the different stages in a multimodal trip. Finally, a schematic framework of the typical multimodal trip characteristics is provided. The individual level attributes that influence multimodal transportation is explored with multivariate analysis. The results indicate some very distinct person characteristics associated with multimodal transportation.

TI The changing nature of rail freight in Great Britain: the start of a
   renaissance?
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper reports on ongoing research into the potential for rail freight service developments to achieve a significant modal shift away from road towards more sustainable modes of transport for freight movements. It is based on the analysis of comprehensive databases of rail freight flows in Great Britain in 1991 and 1997, a period in which there has been dramatic upheaval of rail freight services. This reveals that traffic volumes in early 1997 were still below those in early 1991, but that many new flows were beginning to manifest themselves as a result of traffic gains by the newly privatized operators who have been actively seeking new custom. Some of these flows are ones that were lost from rail during the period of decline, but it is clear that a significant volume of traffic gained is entirely new to rail. Finally, the need for more research on the interactions between these supply-side developments and logistical restructuring is highlighted.

AB Critical Mass, an urban bicycle/sustainability movement, began in San Francisco in 1992 and has spread to more than 100 cities around the world during the past eight years. Featuring organized monthly bicycle rides in specific cities, Critical Mass uses the Internet to sustain local and global actions, combining cyber- communication with face-to-face interactions. Critical Mass aims to shape debates on sustainability and material practices that will contribute to sustainable communities through a celebration of bicycling. We examine the ways in which Critical Mass uses scale to organize for sustainability. We also describe, through a survey of participants and interviews with bicycle advocates, how Critical Mass has been successful in changing people's travel behavior and in legitimizing the efforts of formal advocacy organizations.

ID OLDER DRIVERS; IMPAIRMENT
AB In the next three decades there will a huge increase in both the absolute number of older people and in their percentage of the population in almost all Western European countries, North America, and Australia. Most older people will have active lifestyles in which mobility and access play a major role and almost all older men and a majority of older women will be car drivers, used to the convenience and flexibility which the car provides.
   Using data from the US, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom, the paper shows that, in spite of cultural and policy differences, older people around the world are more likely to have a license, to take more trips, and to do so more often as the driver of a car than older people just a decade ago; they are also less likely to use public transit. These trends have a number of sustainability implications - the most obvious one is increased environmental pollution. For example, even though older people may travel less than younger drivers they may be polluting proportionately more because a) they are less likely to make as great a proportion of trips in public transit as younger people and b) the trips they do make may create more pollutants. In addition, older drivers may incur more wasted miles due to wayfinding errors and trip-scouting behavior. And when older people curtail their driving, younger family members may have to increase (or lengthen) their trip-making to provide needed services or additional transportation.
   While this paper stresses the environmental problems posed by an aging population, effective strategies arise from a focus on a broader definition of sustainability. The most important approach is to accept the inevitable and work to make the private car "greener" and safer. New transit service concepts and strategic community and neighborhood design and service elements can complement the development of cleaner cars.
   Although many of the potential strategies are not new, or can be expensive to implement, the convergence of environmental concerns with other problems arising from the automobility of the elderly - including increasing crash rates and serious loss of mobility among those unable to drive - may make these policies more politically viable than in the past.

AB For the past 5 years the Regional Strategies for the Sustainable Intermodal Transportation Enterprise (ReS/SITE) project has worked on the development of new regional transportation planning frameworks that recognize the realities of modern-day regional economic development. The project began with the identification of a number of weaknesses in conventional regional transportation planning and set about the development of an expanded framework that would remedy these shortcomings (including intermodalism, technology scanning, freight, private-sector involvement, economic integration, national information infrastructure-telecommunications-transportation relationships, master plan perspective, and human resource development). A new framework emerged, based on the idea of scenarios, as advanced by Royal Dutch Shell in the 1970s, and on an expanded notion of regional architectures reflecting the new organizational interactions required to plan and manage transportation systems at a regional scale. This framework has been applied in case studies in Houston, Texas, and Mexico City, Mexico, over the past several years, and the methodology has been greatly refined as a result of those applications. How the new ReS/SITE structure addresses the shortcomings in the planning process Is indicated, and some further steps in framework expansion and refinement are suggested.

AB Freight flow databases and their development have had a checkered history in South Africa. The private and public sectors both accept that such a resource is needed, and numerous attempts have been made to establish one. However, there is no freight flow database that fulfills all needs potential users would have. An overview of the status quo of freight flow databases in South Africa is given. The organizations involved in development of this resource are identified. An understanding of why longterm sustainability of freight flow databases has not been achieved is presented through an exploration of the shortcomings faced by agencies wanting to establish such a resource. The challenges that could affect the success of freight flow databases are presented. It is concluded that the development of freight flow databases has passed its initial stages, and the need for establishment of an all-inclusive database is evident. Nevertheless, agencies involved in freight flow database development have been negatively affected by increased competition for fewer resources. Sustainable development, therefore, will require innovative approaches for establishing freight flow databases, potentially through maximizing the application of information technology.

ID TRAVELER INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; MODEL
AB A framework is developed to parametrically evaluate networks under user equilibrium route guidance (UERG) and system optimal route guidance (SORG), assuming that the unguided traffic is in stochastic user equilibrium. The framework can determine in what condition an advanced traveler information system performs well and which route guidance state performs better as the market penetration of guidance systems increases. Unlike other studies that assumed a fixed number of compliant drivers, this study explicitly considers compliance rate as an endogenous variable in a general parametric nonlinear programming framework. Under endogenously determined compliance rate, SORG may result in a higher total system cost than UERG because of a lower compliance rate, even though SORG aims to minimize total system cost. In contrast, even though UERG is generally preferable because of higher acceptance, it may result in increased total system cost under certain conditions. A simple network is used to illustrate the application of the framework and show that the performance of route guidance is highly dependent on the level of unguided drivers' familiarity with the network. A significant part of the framework is the scheme to find "sustainable" compliance rates under assumed compliance function.

TI Development of sustainable transportation metrics for vehicular
   pollutants
SO TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE sustainability; air pollution; equivalency factors; social equity;
   transportation policies; cost allocation
AB A major challenge for transportation policy makers is to identify policies that will result in a sustainable transportation system. However, given the wide range of definitions of sustainable transportation it is not always clear how a given policy will affect this overall goal. In addition, there are very few quantifiable metrics that can be used to assess sustainability at a disaggregate or individual vehicle level. The amount of air pollution is often identified as a critical element in sustainability concepts and thus is the focus of this paper. A method is developed for assessing the responsibility of different vehicle classes for air pollution as a function of operating conditions. The responsibility measures are referred to as pollutant equivalency factors (EF_p's). MOBILE 5a, which is the standard mobile source emission model in North America, was used for the analysis although the methodology can be applied to any emission model. The EF_p allows policy makers to make a quantitative comparison between vehicle types under stated traffic conditions, which can then be used to assess directly the effects of different transportation policies. It was found that, in general, responsibility increases with increasing vehicle age, increasing vehicle size, increasing mileage, and decreasing speed. It is shown subsequently how one element of sustainability, namely equity, may be obtained by using EF_p to allocate costs associated with air pollution., The allocated costs then can be used to pay for externalities associated with the transportation system. A hypothetical test case, which involved the upgrading of an arterial roadway section to a freeway, was used to demonstrate this approach. It was found that EF_p's can be used both as metrics for sustainability issues and for the implementation of sustainability policies.

TI An International Biodiversity Observation Year
SO TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
LA English
DT Article
AB The International Geophysical Year (IGY), which took place between July 1957 and December 1958, helped us to rethink the world. At a time when there was a major paradigm shift In our understanding of the physical world, the international collaboration of the IGY helped to reset the discipline. The international Biodiversity Observation Year (BOY) is now occurring at a time when our dependence on, and understanding of, biodiversity is being acknowledged as a paradigm shift in our present view of the world. Although the benefits of IGY were initially Intellectual with practical effects remaining unknown until many years later, the benefits of greater knowledge of biodiversity will support efforts towards sustainability and affect the quality of life, both now and in the future. By providing the framework for International collaborations between scientists involved in every aspect of life on Earth, IBOY has the potential to redefine our current understanding of biodiversity in a manner similar to how IGY helped redefine the geophysical world.

AB The proliferation of computer technology and the advent of the Internet have created many new relationships and problems that raise questions about traditional legal and economic principles. The development of "open-source" or "free" software is an example of this phenomenon. Unlike the traditional producers of computer software - Microsoft for example - open-source software is often developed by computer programmers from all over the world, each submitting contributions to the code, and distributed without charge or for a minimal fee. Open-source software is generally passed from programmer to programmer, with the understanding that improvements may be made, but that the improvements must be distributed freely, without any attempt to "privatize" the program.
   The existence of such relationships among programmers raise several interesting questions. First, how do large-scale open-source projects come into being? One open-source project, the GNU/Linux operating system, even threatens the market share of Microsoft's operating systems - a feat that calls traditional economic theories on the operation of the firm into question. A more important question is whether the open-source model is sustainable and generalizable. Ultimately, one wonders what role the law will play in the open-source community - a community that seems to operate in the absence of traditional legal principles.
   In this article, which was introduced at the University of Illinois College of Law Symposium on Intellectual Property Challenges in the Next Century, Professor McGowan addresses these questions. Using the GNU/Linux operating system as a case study, he probes the organization of the open-source community and the philosophies of its leading members in order to understand how traditional firm models, intellectual property, and contract law might apply. Professor McCowan concludes by reviewing recent attempts by courts to impose traditional principles in computer software transaction disputes. Ultimately, it appears that the open-source community cannot be neatly categorized. Although many traditional firm theories - such as the formation of a hierarchy - and legal principles - such as copyright - do apply to the open-source model, these theories and principles are employed in creative ways not previously envisioned.

TI Cover design for radioactive and AMD-producing mine waste in the
   Ronneburg area, Eastern Thuringia
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB At the former uranium mining site of Ronneburg, large scale underground and open pit mining for nearly 40 years resulted in a production of about 113 000 tonnes of uranium and about 200 million cubic metres of mine waste. In their present state, these materials cause risks to human health and strong environmental impacts and therefore demand remedial action. The remediation options available are relocation of mine spoil into the open pit and on site remediation by landscaping/contouring, placement of a cover and revegetation. A suitable vegetated cover system combined with a surface water drainage system provides long-term stability against erosion and reduces acid generation thereby meeting the main remediation objectives which are long-term reduction of radiological exposure and contaminant emissions and recultivation. The design of the cover system includes the evaluation of geotechnical, radiological, hydrological, geochemical and ecological criteria and models. The optimized overall model for the cover system has to comply with general conditions as, e.g. economic efficiency, public acceptance and sustainability. Most critical elements for the long-term performance of the cover system designed for the Beerwalde dump are the barrier system and its long-term integrity and a largely self-sustainable vegetation.

   Environmental Protection (WASCON2000)
CY MAY 31-JUN 02, 2000
CL HARROGATE, ENGLAND
AB Some 20 years ago Dutch society became very aware of the problem of the increasing production of waste materials and of the need to find solutions. Technical solutions had to be developed and introduced into society. Due to the discovery of many soil pollution problems and other environmental calamities, people asked for clear criteria on which proper and safe solutions could be based. Therefore a large number of environmental aspects I lad to be taken into account in the developing field of environmental policy. The Dutch building materials decree is one of the steps on the road towards a sustainable society. The decree is based on the soil protection act and the surface water protection act.. The decree gives quality criteria for the application and re-use of stony materials and earth used as building materials. No difference is made between primary materials, secondary materials and waste materials. The decree is applicable in case these materials are used in constructions where they are in contact with rain, surface water and ground water (e.g. in embankments, road building, outside walls of buildings, foundations and roofs.) For implementation of the decree in the construction industry it was necessary to develop standards, methods for testing and certification schemes. In order to guarantee independent testing and judgement, laboratories had to meet quality standards put forward in an accreditation scheme. Although this legislation does not cover all environmental aspects, it has proved to be an important element in judging the environmental quality of construction materials in a direct or indirect way, and a contribution to the management of waste materials. The question of clear and fair criteria was easily put forward. Answering this question, however, turned out to be a complex task in which a great number of aspects had to be considered and a great many tools had to be developed, checked and thoroughly discussed. In some cases practical choices had to be made in order to prevent an unclear situation continuing too long. After an introduction period of three years, the decree came into full operation on 1 July 1999. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An analysis of UK waste minimization clubs: key requirements for future
   cost effective developments
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; ENGLAND
AB The UK waste strategy is based upon use of the best practicable environmental option (BPEO), by those making waste management decisions. BPEO is supported by the use of the waste hierarchy, with its range of preferable options for dealing with waste, and the proximity principle, where waste is treated/disposed of as close to its point of origin as possible. The national waste strategy emphasizes the key role of waste minimization and encourages industry, commerce and the public to move towards sustainable waste management practice for economic and environmental reasons. Waste minimization clubs have been used, since the early 1990s, to demonstrate to industry/commerce that reducing waste production can lead to significant financial savings. There have been around 75 such clubs in the UK and they receive support from a wide range of agencies, including the Environmental Technology Best Practice Program. The early Demonstration Clubs had significant savings to cost ratios, e.g. Aire and Calder at 8.4, but had very high costs, e.g. Aire and Calder at pound 400 000. It is acknowledged that the number of clubs will have to be approximately doubled in the next few years so as to have an adequate coverage of the UK. There are at present, marked regional variations in club development and cognizance needs to be taken, by facilitators, of the need for extensive coverage of the UK. Future clubs will probably have to operate in a financially constrained climate and they need tc, be designed to deliver significant savings and waste reduction at low cost. To aid future club design, final reports of all projects should report in a standard manner so that cost benefit analysis can be used to inform facilitators about the most effective club type.

   perpetual sites; environmental performance and monitoring
ID MUNICIPAL
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills worldwide are experiencing the consequences of conventional landfilling techniques, whereby anaerobic conditions are created within the landfilled waste. Under anaerobic conditions within a landfill site slow stabilization of the waste mass occurs, producing methane, (an explosive 'green house' gas) and leachate (which can pollute groundwater) over long periods of time. As a potential solution, it was demonstrated that the aerobic degradation of MSW within a landfill can significantly increase the rate of waste decomposition and settlement, decrease the methane production and leachate leaving the system, and potentially increase the operational life of the site. Readily integrated into the existing landfill infrastructure, this approach can safely and cost-effectively convert a MSW landfill from anaerobic to aerobic degradation processes, thereby effectively composting much of the organic portions (one of the potentially polluting elements in a conventional landfill site) of the waste. This paper summarizes the successful results of two separate aerobic landfill projects located in Georgia (USA) and discusses the potential economic and environmental impacts to worldwide solid waste management practices.

AB The applicability of critical load (CL) methodology for the determination of natural terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity to sulfur acidity loading in South Korea was investigated. The sulfur critical load values, CLmaxS, were calculated for the terrestrial ecosystems of South Korea using the steady-state mass balance approach. The corresponding mapping of CLmaxS was carried out on the scale of 11 x 14 km grid cells. The estimated CLmaxS values depend on the low rate of soil chemical base cation weathering (mainly, 200-400 eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), relatively low base cation depositions (mainly less than 450 eq ha(-1) yr(-1)) and base cation uptake (predominantly 300-400 eq ha(-1) yr(-1)), and in significant degree on high values of acid neutralizing capacity. The latter in turn is connected with relatively high values of surface runoff (maximum 9000 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)). It has been shown that about 75% of CLmaxS values are in the range of 1000-2000 eq ha(-1) yr(-1) and about 15% are relatively low values (< 1000 eq ha(-1) yr(-1)). About 10% of ecosystems have CL values more than 2000 eq ha(-1) yr(-1). The sensitive and very sensitive ecosystems occur in the southeastern part of the country whereas the sustainable ecosystems are wide spread in the northeastern part. In accordance with sulfur critical load and sulfur deposition patterns, in 1994-1997 the CLmaxS values were found to be exceeded in about 40% of total number of Korean ecosystems, mainly in the southeastern part of the country. The average yearly values of exceedances varied from 176 to 3100 eq ha(-1) yr(-1).

AB Ireland is an island country on the western boundary of the European Union. A suite of environmental legislation over the last decade has combined to increase the amount of municipal sludge for treatment fourfold, while, simultaneously, eliminating traditional disposal methods. The Irish Government has instituted a comprehensive programme of policy development, infrastructure provision and drafting of "codes of good practice" to meet these environmental and legislative challenges. As the programme has developed, it has become clear that the sludge/biosolids issue shares many of the philosophical and logistical elements of other environmental issues that are developing apace in Ireland, including municipal waste management, agricultural waste management and overall integrated development. In many ways, it represents a model of the ultimate "sustainable development" issue. To provide specific data for decision making and policy/infrastructure/technology development, the Irish Government has funded a US$600k programme of research in The Characterisation, Treatment and Sustainable Reuse of Biosolids. The design philosophy of the programme is a "cradle-to-grave" approach, in order to integrate the outcomes of specialised research studies into an overall sustainable development model.

AB The role of biosolids management continues to gain priority in terms of holistic waste management/reuse, Recommended options should lead to simple and safe management alternatives that stress reclamation of resources. This paper addresses current sustainability strategies, priorities and future direction of waste management as it relates to residuals and in particular to sludges/biosolids. Sludge management and resource recovery approaches must be diversified and flexible. They should be based on actual needs of the affected society and community. It is also important that the chosen strategy be appropriate to the conditions of the site under consideration. Processes which promote sustainability will become viable options for resource management if conversion into a "value-added product" can be realized.

ID WASTE-WATER TREATMENT
AB Sorption of phosphorus (P) to the bed sand medium is a major removal mechanism for P in subsurface flow constructed wetlands. Selecting a sand medium with a high P-sorption capacity is therefore important to obtain a sustained P-removal. The P-removal capacities of 13 Danish sands were evaluated and related to their physico-chemical characteristics. The P-removal properties of sands of different geographical origin varied considerably and the suitability of the sands for use as media in constructed reed beds thus differs. The P-sorption capacity of some sands would be used up after only a few months in full-scale systems, whereas that of others would subsist for a much longer time. The most important characteristic of the sands determining their P-sorption capacity was their Ca-content. Also the P-binding capacities of various artificial media were tested (light-expanded-clay-aggregates (LECA), crushed marble, diatomaceous earth, vermiculite and calcite). Particularly calcite and crushed marble were found to have high P-binding capacities. It is suggested that mixing one of these materials into the sand or gravel medium can significantly enhance the P-sorption capacity of the bed medium in a subsurface-flow constructed wetland system. It is also possible to construct a separate unit containing one of these artificial media. The media may then be replaced when the P-binding capacity is used up.

AB The Laguna de Bay is the largest lake in the Philippines and is situated 15 km southeast of the centre of Metropolitan Manila. The population of the capital region is growing out of proportion, especially in the watershed area of the lake. This development is endangering the resource Laguna de Bay due to the increasing discharge of nutrient and suspended solid loads from the drainage basin into the lake. During the EU-funded project "Laguna de Bay, Philippines An Ecosystem Approach for Sustainable Management" a monitoring campaign on selected tributary rivers was conducted. Based on the results of this monitoring and an analysis of census data, the total annual loads were estimated at about 8000 t N, 2300 t P and 160,000 t TSS. The occurrence of the typhoon "Loleng" in the research area during the monitoring campaign made it possible to state that about 25% of the annual load is drained during such a weather situation.

AB Domestic wastewater reuse is currently not permitted anywhere in Australia but is widely supported by the community, promoted by researchers, and improvised by up to 20% of householders. Its widespread implementation will make an enormous contribution to the sustainability of water resources. Integrated with other strategies in the outdoor living environment of settlements in arid lands, great benefit will be derived. This paper describes six options for wastewater reuse under research by the Remote Area Developments Group (RADG) at Murdoch University and case studies are given where productive use is being made for revegetation and food production strategies at household and community scales. Pollution control techniques, public health precautions and maintenance requirements are described. The special case of remote Aboriginal communities is explained where prototype systems have been installed by RADG to generate windbreaks and orchards. New Australian design standards and draft guidelines for domestic greywater reuse produced by the Western Australian State government agencies for mainstream communities are evaluated. It is recommended that dry composting toilets be coupled with domestic greywater reuse and the various types available in Australia are described. For situations where only the flushing toilet will suffice the unique "wet composting" system can be used and this also is described. A vision for household and community-scale on-site application is presented.
