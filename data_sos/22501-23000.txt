AB A possible method of protecting biosphere reserve core zones is to encourage transition and buffer zone activities which are compatible with the core and which provide sufficient returns to the human population to make entry into the core zone unnecessary. The AMISCONDE project is promoting block plantations and coffee/tree agroforestry systems to do this, but did not analyze their financial or economic feasibility. Unprofitable systems will not be adopted without subsidy and are not sustainable after a project ends. Analyses show internal rates of return exceeding 30% for coffee/tree combinations both with and without project subsidies. Coffee/tree systems have significantly higher returns than coffee without trees, reduce the risk from coffee price fluctuations, and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers. Returns from a block plantation of cypress are a small fraction of coffee and coffee/tree system returns, but still are positive and have the advantage of requiring much smaller initial investments. The systems analyzed seem likely to be sustainable and to contribute to project conservation and development objectives.

AB An alley cropping experiment was conducted from 1986 to 1992 near Cotonou, Benin Republic on a field previously used as four-year bush-fallow. A no-tree control was compared with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit and Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. grown in 4 m distant hedgerows. In the same experiment, application of 90-39-75 kg ha(-1) NPK fertiliser vs. no fertiliser and maize-cassava intercropping vs. rotation of sole crops was also tested. Topsoil samples (0-30 cm) were taken initially and again after four and six years. Alley cropping enhanced nitrogen recycling relative to the no-alley control by 253 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for Leucaena and 131 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for Cajanus in the overall average but a maximum of 22 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) was recovered in total crop exports. Apparent fertiliser-N recovery increased from a low average of 14% in the first year to 66% in the second year up to a maximum of 109% in the no-tree control in the last year. Soil nutrient depletion during the six years was significant for all nutrients except P, K falling from 0.5 to 0.1 cmol(c) kg(-1) soil and N from 0.08 to 0.05%. Hedgerow accumulation of N in the topsoil-plant system calculated as difference to a no-tree control was only 18 to 37 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) during the first four years after clearing, increasing to 208 kg in Leucaena and 111 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in Cajanus without NPK during the last two years. During the first four years, average N, K, Ca and Mg losses from the topsoil-plant system of 223 kg, 160 kg, 176 kg and 80 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) were high but probably stored in the subsoil because corresponding leaching losses were only 10, 1, 15 and 6 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) at 150 cm depth during the second to fourth cropping year. Beyond the fourth year, markedly reduced nutrient losses from the topsoil and stable food crop yields in no-tree plots suggest that continuous maize-cassava cropping using balanced rates of mineral fertiliser is producing sustainable yields with almost closed nutrient cycles of the soil-plant system on our site.

AB Productivity, sustainability and economics of agriculture, forestry and agroforestry land use practices were compared over a six year period in a split plot experiment on a moderately alkali soil of the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, Karnal, India. Three commercial trees of the area formed the main plot treatments and four crop sequences were the sub-plots. The trees were: poplar (Populus deltoides), Acacia (Acacia nilotica) and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus tereticornis), and the crop sequences were (1) rice (Oryza sativa)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) for four years followed by guinea grass (Panicum maximum)-oats (Avena saliva) for two years; (2) rice-Berseem (Trifolium alexandrium) for four years followed by cowpea (Vigna unquiculata)-Berseem for two years; (3) pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan)/sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)mustard (Brassica juncea) for three years followed by turmeric (Curcuma longa) for three years and (4) no intercrops (only trees). Eucalyptus and poplar gained maximum height, girth and woody biomass in six years when they were intercropped with rice crops in sequences 1 and 2. Acacia attained maximum growth in the absence of intercrops. Protein content in guinea grass was more under tree canopies than in the open. Soil amelioration during five years followed the order: Acacia based system > poplar > Eucalyptus > sole crops. The benefit-cost ratio was highest (2.88) in poplar based system and minimum (1.86) in Acacia based system. The study indicated that growing trees and agricultural crops together is a better land use option in terms of productivity, maintenance of soil conditions and economics.

AB Agricultural runoff from the Chablais region of France, is believed to contribute to the pollution of the waters of Lac Leman (Lake Geneva). This study aimed at determining which factors influence the frequency of runoff from agricultural lands. Two hundred agricultural fields under a wide diversity of agricultural practices were monitored during a winter and a summer period. For each field the kinetics of formation of superficial soil crusting that can prevent infiltration of rainfall into deeper soil layers was evaluated and the presence of runoff was observed. Additionally, the farmers were surveyed to determine the specific agricultural practices that were used on each field. The observations showed that both Hortonian and non-Hortonian runoff occurred. Sheet runoff was observed as well as runoff following tracks of cultivation equipment. The frequency of runoff varied among agricultural practices. Fields cultivated with non-rotative implements had a higher frequency of runoff than fields cultivated with rotative implements. Fields in long periods of rotation of corn or other crops without mulching showed high frequencies of runoff. A scale of runoff risk was developed to compare the frequency with which the different fanning systems in Chablais produced runoff. For each farming pratice this scale takes into account, at the field level, the kinetics of the development of impermeable soil crusting and the duration of the time the field is at risk to produce runoff. Fields on which the mechanization and rotational practices of traditional systems are used have the highest risk of producing runoff per unit area. Intensive farmiing systems have a lower risk of producing runoff per unit area. Intensive farming systems have a lower risk of producing runoff per unit area. However, because of the relatively small land area presently devoted to the traditional farming systems, both intensive and traditional systems contribute equally to the pollution of Lake Leman. As a result of this work, changes in traditional and intensive practices are suggested that are believed to enhance agricultural sustainability on the French shores of Lake Leman and reduce environmental impacts.

TI Natural resource management: Opportunities and challenges in the
   application of decision support systems
SO AI APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Decision support systems have been most successfully applied in engineered systems or simplified, intensively managed systems and in addressing highly defined and well structured domains. In such contexts, system functioning and the problems addressed in management are relatively well understood. In contrast, natural resource management for sustainability, particularly at a catchment or landscape scale, is typically characterized by consideration of complex interactions which are only partially understood and about which limited data are available. Opportunities exist for the application of AI techniques in improving the efficacy of natural resource management for sustainability in three key areas: providing support in the often complex and demanding process of problem formulation and task analysis; making effective use of available data and knowledge bases; and in supporting rational use of the results of analysis. However, there are practical challenges to be faced in integrating a sufficient range of the identified techniques to meet a sufficiently useful proportion of the tasks faced in natural resource management to attain widespread operational acceptance. More fundamentally, the inherent nature of natural resource management is political, while most Al applications to date have been based on a view that decision making is a purely rational process with demonstrably correct solutions.

AB This paper explores issues of agricultural sustainability in relation to arguments to sustain the family labor farm and the theoretical justification for the recent increase in smaller-scale milk processors and differentiated dairy product markets. Using a population of New York State dairy farm households, we identified farm structural variables that influence farmers' use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers and their consideration of intensive rotational grazing, Milk sales division of hired labor on the farm, and ownership arrangements are found to be interrelated and predict relative use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers within a ''conventional'' confinement feeding system. Marketing strategies predict production practices within a confinement feeding system less reliably but do predict whether the farm has considered adopting an intensive grazing system. Farms that have higher sales, that use hired labor more extensively, and that are not single family operations are more likely to use chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Farms that sell to differentiated markets are more likely to look favorably on an eventual switch to an intensive rotational grating system.

AB This paper discusses certain culturally based adverse impacts upon northern peoples' socioeconomic and cultural ''security'' which originate in distant urban centers where economic and political agendas often antagonistic to Northerners' interests are aggressively pursued. In particular, anti-sealing and anti-whaling movements are addressed. The culture-historic basis of urban-led opposition to arctic marine mammal hunting is explored. Resulting animal rights campaigns have influenced conservation legislation in many countries, to the detriment of local economies in the North. Furthermore, a strict application of science-based resource management regimes often results in the uncritical application of numerical catch quotas, thereby undermining the indigenous relationship between humans and animals that has supported centuries of sustainable resource use in the past.

AB ''Sustainable'' is an old established term which has made a political career in the past ten years. The roots of this career extend back into the 18th century, when an economic concept of forest management was developed to replace yield maximization achieved by means of complete deforestation by yield optimization attained by conservative forest management This latter type of forest management was termed ''sustainable''. The language used in today's sustainability debate was based on the idea of presenting the capital provided by nature and living on the interest. As a consequence, the term ''sustainable'' became one of the key points in environmental policy and economic policy after the Brundtland report had been published (V. Hauff; 1987), which also constitutes the background to this article.

AB Against the background of the public debate about the future of energy supply which, for a long time already, has been part of the collective battle of ideologies, the Academy for Technology Assessment conducted the ''Climatologically Sustainable Energy Supply in Baden-Wurttemberg'' Project in order to study whether the envisaged reductions of CO2 emissions can be reached despite different societal concepts for the future, or whether the goals of climate protection require specific future developments. For this purpose, energy scenarios were developed which - in contrast to customary approaches - were derived from societal models. These models were designed so that, on the one hand, they embodied the main lines of the societal discussion about the future of energy supply while encompassing the whole range of that discussion, on the other hand. The result showed that the goals of climate protection can be attained also with highly divergent concepts for the future, and that no preference for any specific future development can be derived from the climate protection goals. If these goals are to be pursued seriously, then the central conflict of society in the foreseeable period of the next 25 to 30 years, under the conditions prevailing in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, will not be the issue of nuclear power versus renewable energies, but rather the dichotomy of an expanded use of nuclear power, on the one hand, and the willingness to give up, or accept changes in behavior, on the other hand.

AB Six treatments were compared for their effects on wheat yields, nitrogen (N) uptake, protein content, and fertiliser N requirements in a long-term rotation study on a black earth and a red clay in northern New South Wales. Three of the treatments were lucerne, subterranean clover, and snail medic, all grown simultaneously from 1988 to 1990 and all followed by 3 years of wheat. The other 3 treatments were biennial rotations of chickpea-wheat and long-fallow-wheat as well as a continuous wheat monoculture, all lasting 6 years.
   With the exception of the first wheat crop, which experienced very low growing-season rainfall, lucerne was more beneficial than other legumes to following wheat crops in terms of yield, protein content, and fertiliser N requirement. Clover closely followed lucerne in the magnitude of its positive effects: whereas medic and chickpea produced much smaller effects. Because of the amount of N removed in the chickpea grain, it appeared that the small positive effects of chickpea were due to soil N sparing or rapid mineralisation from crop residues rather than any net contribution of N fixation to soil N accretion.
   Average yields of the 3 wheat crops following lucerne and clover were much higher than average yields 20 years previously following lucerne: even though average yields of continuously grown wheat have declined over the past 20 years. However, lucerne eliminated the need for N fertiliser for no more than 2 following wheat crops, and clover for only the first wheat crop. It appears that the longer duration of lucerne benefits reported in earlier studies was due to the higher background soil N levels as well as the lower yield potential in the earlier years. Nevertheless, lucerne lowered the fertiliser requirement of the third wheat crop by more than 50%. In contrast to lucerne, annual legumes are probably most beneficial if grown in alternate years with wheat.
   The large benefits of long fallowing particularly on the black earth were apparently caused by its enhancement of soil moisture and mineral N accumulation. However, these N effects were surprisingly large considering the degree of depletion of organic matter in long-fallowed soils.

AB The paper reports the relative acidification potential of 10 N-2-fixing grain legume species grown in nutrient solution for 35 days after nodule appearance. The legumes studied were pilosus (Lupinus pilosus Murr. P23342), yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus L. R1171), white lupin (Lupinus alb us L. Kiev mutant), narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L. Gungurru), faba bean (Vicia faba L. Fiord), field pea (Pisum sativum L. Dundale), grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L. S453), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L. T1587), common vetch (Vicia sativa L. Blanchefleur), and lentil (Lens culinaris Med. ILL6002). The species varied considerably in their acidifying ability; proton production ranged from 77 to 136 cmol/kg dry matter. Chickpea and narrow-leafed lupin had the largest acidification potential and field pea the least. The specific acidification (amount of protons produced per kg dry matter) was best correlated with concentrations of excess cations, ash alkalinity, and calcium in plant across the species but was not correlated with plant nitrogen concentration. Total ash alkalinity or total excess cations in shoots provided a good indicator for estimation of total proton production in these species, which were reliant on N-2 fixation for their source of N. The results have implications for the selection of legumes to be used in sustainable farming systems.

AB Several cool- and warm-season pulse crops (grain legumes) are grown in rotation with cereals and pasture forming sustainable farming systems in Australia. Australian pulse production has increased rapidly over the past 25 years to about 2 x 10(6) t/year, mainly because of the increase in the area and yield of lupin production for stockfeed purposes. Pulses currently comprise only 10% of the cropping areas of Australia and this could be expanded to 16% as there are large areas of soil types suitable for a range of pulse crops and new better-adapted pulse varieties are becoming available. Cool-season pulses will continue to dominate pulse production in Australia and the majority of the expansion will probably come from chickpea and faba bean industries. There appears to be no major constraint to pulse production in Australia that cannot be addressed by breeders, agronomists and farmers. Of the current major pulse crops, field pea faces the most number of difficulties, in particular the lack of disease management options. A recent strategic plan of the Australian pulse industry predicts the production of 4 x 10(6) t/year by 2005 but this will largely depend upon export demand and pulse prices. It is predicted that the growth in pulse production will come from increased productivity in the existing areas, from 1.0 to 1.4 t/ha, through improvements in crop management and the development of superior varieties. The area of pulse production will also expand by an additional 1.2 x 10(6) ha probably yielding 1.0 t/ha. If trends in grazing stock prices continue, the increased area under pulse production will mostly come at the expense of those areas under unimproved pasture and continuous cereal cropping.

AB Permanent raised beds coupled with reduced tillage and cover crops are part of the Australian processing tomato industry's strategy to move towards more sustainable farming practices. As a consequence, crops may be planted into denser soils. Previous work showed that processing tomatoes had considerable tolerance to no-tillage; mild soil compaction reduced vegetative growth but not fruit yield. This field study showed that severe compaction not only reduced vegetative growth, but also extended the duration of the exponential vegetative growth period, so that fruit and vegetative growth were competing for assimilates. Under these conditions, fruit yield was severely reduced. Accurate management of drip irrigation could not compensate for the narrow, non-limiting water range of compacted soil. Mild water deficits during the late flowering and early fruit growth phase also reduced fruit yield. Pot experiments under controlled conditions revealed an interaction between soil fumigation and tillage management. Soil fumigation improved shoot growth at high and low soil densities with the greatest effects observed below ground; root length was more than doubled when soil cores with a bulk density of 1.79 t/m(3) were fumigated. A cover crop of subterranean clover, grown in the off-season winter period, had no effect on fruit yield under non-compacted conditions. The implication is that cover crops, which have been shown to ameliorate adverse soil physical conditions, can only express their potential when soil conditions in a conventionally managed system are suboptimal.

TI Sustaining productivity of a Vertisol at Warra, Queensland, with
   fertilisers, no-tillage or legumes .4. Nitrogen fixation, water use and
   yield of chickpea

ID CICER-ARIETINUM; SOWING TIME; DRY-MATTER; WHEAT; ACCUMULATION; BALANCE;
   SYSTEMS; CROPS
AB Continuous cereal cropping in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales has depleted native soil nitrogen fertility to a level where corrective strategies are required to sustain grain yields and high protein content. The objective of this study was to examine the performance of chickpea in chickpea-wheat rotations in terms of yields, water use and N-2 fixation. The effects of sowing time and tillage practice have been studied.
   Chickpea grain yields varied from 356 kg/ha in 1995 to 2361 kg/ha in 1988; these were significantly correlated with the total rainfall received during the preceding fallow period and crop growth. Almost 48% of total plant production and 30% of total plant nitrogen were below-ground as root biomass.
   Mean values of water-use efficiency for grain, above-ground dry matter, and total dry matter were 5.9, 14.2 and 29.2 kg/ha.mm, respectively. The water-use efficiency for grain was positively correlated with the total rainfall for the preceding fallow and crop growth period although cultural practices modified water-use efficiency. The potential N-2 fixation was estimated to be 0.6 kg nitrogen/ha.mm from 1992 total dry matter nitrogen yields assuming all of the nitrogen contained in chickpea was derived from the atmosphere.
   Sowing time had a much larger effect on grain yield and N-2 fixation by chickpea than tillage practice (conventional tillage and zero tillage) although zero tillage generally increased grain yields. The late May-early June sowing time was found to be the best for chickpea grain yield and N-2 fixation since it optimised solar energy use and water use, and minimised frost damage. Nitrogen fixation by chickpea was low, less than 40% nitrogen was derived from atmosphere, representing less than 20 kg nitrogen/ha.year. The potential for N-2 fixation was not attained during this period due to below-average rainfall and high soil NO3-N accumulation because of poor utilisation by the preceding wheat crop. Increased soil NO3-N due to residual from fertiliser N applied to the preceding wheat crop further reduced N-2 fixation. A simple soil nitrogen balance indicated that at least 60% of crop nitrogen must be obtained from N-2 fixation to avoid continued soil nitrogen loss. This did not occur in most years.
   The generally negative soil nitrogen balance needs to be reversed if chickpea is to be useful in sustainable cropping systems although it is an attractive cash crop. Sowing time and zero tillage practice, possibly combined with more appropriate cultivars, to enhance chickpea biomass, along with low initial soil NO3-N levels, would provide maximum N-2 fixation.

TI Steer gains, pasture yield and pasture composition on native pasture and
   on native pasture oversewn with Indian couch (Bothriochloa pertusa) at
   three stocking rates
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English

ID QUEENSLAND; GRASSES
AB Pasture production and steer liveweight gain were compared on native pasture (Bothriochloa decipiens, Heteropogon contortus, Themeda triandra and Chrysopogon fallax) and on native pasture oversewn with Indian couch or Indian bluegrass (Bothriochloa pertusa). This grass was not a planned introduction to the area but is spreading in Central and North Queensland and its value as a pasture species is questioned by graziers.
   There were 3 nominal stocking rates of 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 steers/ha. Each paddock was stocked with 3 steers of stratified ages. The experiment was sown in March 1988 and terminated in June 1993. The experiment, sited 50 km south of Townsville in eucalypt woodland on a solodic-solodised-solonetz soil, was sown in March 1988 and terminated in June 1993.
   Increases in stocking rate resulted in a linear decline in both pasture yield (by 3-5 t/unit increase in stocking rate) and steer gains (by more than 100 kg/unit increase in stocking rate). Differences between pastures were apparent only at the medium and high stocking rates where, over time, Indian couch gave higher pasture yields and steer gains. Younger steers gained far more weight than older steers. Mean gains over 3 years were weaners 125 kg/year, yearlings 93 kg/year and 2-year-old steers 46 kg/year.
   Native pasture remained fairly stable botanically at the low stocking rate, but the tufted perennial grass species declined at both the medium and high stocking rates. Sowing Indian couch hastened the botanical changes due to stocking rate, and it became the dominant species at these higher stocking rates. At the low stocking rate, the contribution of Indian couch declined from initial values indicating that this is not an invasive species in the area at a low stocking rate. Contribution of Indian couch to pasture yield was linearly related to stocking rate.
   Nutritional quality of the Indian couch was similar to the other native perennial grasses though calcium concentration was higher. Increased steer gains were related to higher yield on Indian couch pastures at the higher stocking rates rather than to improved quality.
   Maximum liveweight gain/ha was achieved at about 0.6 steers/ha. Stocking at 0.9 steers/ha was not sustainable. Even at the low stocking rate, steers would need to spend about 2.8 years on the pastures after weaning to reach 500 kg liveweight.
   It was concluded that B. pertusa is a useful pasture grass in this environment giving steer gains equal to, or higher than, the gains from the native pasture which it replaced.

AB Laboratory phosphorus (P) adsorption and desorption experiments were conducted on 9 substrata to evaluate their potential to remove P from sewage effluent. The substrata comprised 2 gravels used in constructed wetlands, Hawkesbury sandstone, and 6 steelworks by-products: granulated blast furnace slag, blast furnace slag, steel slag, fly ash, bottom ash, and coal wash. The studies involved ion-exchange experiments and calculation of Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms and column adsorption/desorption trials. The ability to adsorb P was then correlated to the physico-chemical attributes including X-ray fluorescence analyses of each substratum.
   High P adsorption capacities (>380 mg/kg) were shown for granulated blast furnace slag, blast furnace slag, and steel slag, as well as fly ash. All steelworks by-products had adsorption capacities greater than the constructed wetland gravels and Hawkesbury sandstone. The P adsorption capacities of the substrata were significantly correlated with Ca (r(2) = 0.9206), Mg (r(2) = 0.8681), pH (r(2) = 0.7009), S (r(2) = 0.6696), and Si (r(2) = 0.6438) when fly ash was omitted from the analyses.
   Further research is recommended to evaluate the sustainability of using slags for P removal (as well as other contaminants present in wastewater), using full-scale constructed wetlands. Research should include an evaluation of any likely environmental impacts using leachability and toxicity studies.

ID PHOSPHATE ADSORPTION
AB A young plantation of Pinus radiata in south-eastern Australia was irrigated with secondary-treated sewerage effluent for 48 months, when evapotranspiration exceeded rainfall. Concentrations of phosphorus (P) in saturation pastes of soil were measured after 30, 37, 42, and 48 months to monitor vertical transport of P, and results were compared with depth of transport predicted from P sorption isotherms.
   Standard laboratory isotherms greatly underestimated the capacity of soil to retain P. Thirty months after plantation establishment, 165 kg/ha of P had been applied in effluent, and P in soil solution was predicted from sorption isotherms to be at a concentration of 5.7 mg/L to a depth of 0.29 m. In comparison, the concentration of P in saturation paste at this time decreased exponentially from 3.5 mg/L at 0.025 m to 0.43 mg/L at 0.30 m. Similarly, 48 months after plantation establishment, 318 kg/ha of P had been applied, and P was predicted to be in equilibrium to a depth of 0.51 m. At this time, concentration of P in saturation paste was 4.7 mg/L at 0.25 m but decreased to a concentration of 0.11 mg/L at 0.45 m. The concentration of P in saturation paste in the bore-water control was low (<0.36 mg/L) throughout the profile.
   The discrepancy between predicted and observed results was found from subsequent experiments to be due largely to the short (17 h) equilibration time and to the wide solution:soil ratio (10:1) used during construction of standard sorption isotherms. In the 0-0.1 m layer of soil, P-retention capacity determined in saturation paste and after 21 days incubation was about 9-fold greater than when the standard method was used. Leaching of dissolved P is unlikely to threaten the sustainable life-time of the effluent-irrigated plantation studied.

ID STABILITY; PASTURE
AB Some New Zealand soils withstand intensive cultivation and support continuing high production and yet maintain essential soil physical qualities of infiltration, aggregation, and aeration. In other soils, essential soil qualities deteriorate rapidly under the impact of even moderately intensive management practices. Our objective was to estimate the inherent susceptibility of New Zealand soils to physical degradation by focusing on structural vulnerability. We took a deductive approach by reviewing the available information on the structural stability and physical degradation of New Zealand soils. We identified 4 soil attributes that are well represented in the national soils database and are most likely to control structural vulnerability: (i) stabilising short-range-order oxy-hydroxides of aluminium and iron as estimated by phosphate retention, (ii) total organic carbon content, (iii) clay content, and (iv) wetness. The 4 attributes were standardised and transformed and a simple structural vulnerability index (SV) was devised. We determined SV for all mineral soils in the national soils database. The results provide a ranking of soil groups according to their structural vulnerability. We concluded that the index may be used as a first approximation rating of the structural vulnerability of New Zealand soils to aid resource management.

TI Testing gypsum requirements for dryland cropping on a Red-Brown Earth

ID PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SOIL; WHEAT; MANAGEMENT; VICTORIA; SODICITY
AB Gypsum requirements of a Red-Brown Earth used for dryland cropping were determined by 2 methods: those of the State Chemistry Laboratory (SCL) and of the Institute for Sustainable Irrigated Agriculture (ISIA). These are based, respectively, on exchangeable cations of soil by the Tucker method, and on water-soluble cations in a 1:5 water extract of soil. Information was also gained on longevity of gypsum effects on soil.
   Gypsum was applied to plots at rates 0.5, 1, and 2 times that predicted by ISIA, whereas the SCL method predicted that no gypsum was required. After 2 years, plots were split and the 3 rates of gypsum were either applied to soil previously untreated with gypsum, or re-applied to the soil treated 2 years before.
   According to the SCL test, the 0-10 cm soil depth of the Red-Brown Earth was not sodic (ESP <6), it was slightly magnesic (EMgP >25), and required no gypsum. However, it was found that gypsum lowered ESP, EMgP, and clay dispersion, with some effects extending into the 10-20 cm soil depth.
   With the ISIA method, the 0-10 cm soil depth was classed as low-sodic, but potentially dispersive; it required 2.5 t/ha of gypsum if soil was cultivated, but no gypsum if it was direct-drilled or was under pasture. One year after application, only the highest rate of gypsum (5 t/ha) significantly (P < 0.001) raised the electrolyte concentration of the soil suspension, although all rates reduced (P < 0.001) SAR, and the 2 higher rates reduced (P < 0.01) clay dispersion. However, these effects had disappeared after Year 3.
   There were significant increases in crop yields due to gypsum treatment in Year 1 (0.5-0.9 t/ha, P < 0.01) and Year 2 (0.3 t/ha, P < 0.001), but no response in Year 3. Fungal diseases seemed to reduce wheat responses, and the highest rate of gypsum caused chlorosis of lupins.
   Judging by crop performance, the ISIA method predicted an optimal rate of gypsum for the 0-10 cm layer of this soil type. The SCL prediction was also only for the 0-10 cm layer, but had it been used for deeper layers in the profile (the original intention for the technique), it would have given a recommendation not very different from the ISIA method.

AB Pedology, the field study of soils as natural landscape bodies, has suffered serious cutbacks in staffing and funding in many developed countries. Soil survey, a strong focus for pedology, has been most affected by this recession. The cutbacks to pedology reflect the reduction in funding for general purpose soil resource inventories and a decline in central government planning and land development, as well as changing needs for soil information and perceived failure of soil survey to respond by delivering relevant, timely information at affordable cost.
   A refocusing of research effort in pedology is required to contribute to research into environmental issues of sustainable land management, and global change processes and impacts. The adoption of modern, efficient approaches to collecting, analysing, interpreting and presenting field soil data will improve the fund-raising capability of pedology and enhance its institutional stature. The general purpose paper soil map and soil survey report has largely been superseded as a medium for presenting soil information. Increasingly, it will be replaced by computer-generated, special purpose, interpretive soil maps that are based on soil-landscape models and include more objective, statistically estimated information on soil variability. There is a continuing role for pedology to define the extent, distribution, properties, suitability, and vulnerability of soils as a basis for sustainable land management. There is a need for increasing focus on temporal changes in soil properties, greater attention to soil properties that determine soil functioning and influence soil use, and interpretation of the environmental record contained in soils and regolith.

AB Over the last 150 years Australia has gained great economic rewards from the use of the natural resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. However, many of the methods used to gain those benefits are now seen as unsustainable. To maintain the region's productivity in the future, a different approach to managing its natural resources is needed. This paper explains the economic and environmental importance of the Basin, describes the degradation that has occurred, and summarises the efforts being made to achieve sustainable management of the region.

AB Biotechnology is discussed in terms of its potential to improve crop productivity and protect the environment. The topics covered include soil stabilisation, dinitrogen fixation, plant growth enhancement, biocontrol, bioremediation, and sustainability. It seems that soil science and biotechnology are totally interactive and both disciplines will advance where it is recognised that interdisciplinary studies are most valuable. Many advances in medicine and pharmacology are based on developments in soil science, such as the discovery of streptomycin from soil-borne actinomycetes. The soil biota should produce much scope yet for further discoveries, and there seems to be a place for soil science courses in biotechnological, environmental health, and medical education.

AB In temperate Australia, accelerated soil acidification through the introduction of legume-based pasture systems is a major limiting factor to their sustainability. In this study, soil samples were collected from paired sites (developed v. undeveloped) to a depth of 90 cm to assess acidification rates under Stylosanthes spp. based pasture production systems in the semi-arid tropics of central and northern Queensland and the Northern Territory, Australia. Net acidification rates varied from 0.2 to 10.6 kmol H+/ha year for the sites sampled. The highest rate of acidification was observed under an irrigated Stylosanthes seed production system. Since acidification was measured by difference between paired sites, the total acidification rate of the developed sites is likely to have been underestimated. The contribution from the export of meat products was estimated to be 0.022-0.035 kmol H+/ha.year on those sites with suitable records. Acidification occurred to depth on all sites that exhibited accelerated acidification, which makes conventional remediation methods impractical in these extensive grazing systems. Pedotransfer functions to predict the pH buffering capacity of a soil were developed for surface, subsoil, and the entire profile based on soil organic carbon, day, and silt content. Management strategies to minimise the negative impact of Stylosanthes pastures are suggested.

AB With completion of the commendable work of the KSPW, an abundance of valuable insights into the transformation process of East Germany has been attained. After the phase of concentrating on the observations and descriptions of the status quo, it would now be desirable that further work be oriented towards developing recommendations and courses of action for political, economic and societal praxis. In doing so, territorial references should be extended and the work expanded to such relevant fields that have previously been insufficiently examined, such as transportation, ecology and sustainable development, among others. The subject of social and political change in East Germany cannot be considered completed, rather the work of the KSPW should be continued in a suitable form.

AB Royal Bardia National Park in Southern Nepal contains a number of internationally endangered wildlife species, and a mix of habitats, including areas of grassland known as phantas. The conservation and current use of these areas is briefly described, including the extraction of grass from inside the National Park by local people living in adjacent villages. The products collected fulfil a range of human needs, both practical and ceremonial. The study attempts to quantify the annual offtake in both material and monetary terms, and comments on the sustainability of the practice. Alternative sources of roofing materials are apparently outside the scope of poorer households. The use of these materials has particular significance given the initiation of a Parks and People Project to implement a Buffer Zone around the National Park and effectively to link conservation and development needs.

AB Intercropping is growing two or more crops in the same field. There are various reasons for the application of intercropping in both tropical and temperate food production. So far, intercropping in European intensive agriculture has not been applied because of possible yield loss due to competition between the main crop and intercrop, the availability of cheap pesticides and growers' reluctance to use more complicated cropping systems. In addition, there was no consumers demand for pesticide-free crops and no legislation from governments limiting pesticides. During the last decade, intercropping research in field vegetables demonstrated significant pest suppression effects, enabling cropping of cabbages and leek of good commercial quality without using pesticides. Presently, research efforts focus on the clarification of underlying mechanisms and the solutions of constraints, competition effects and acceptable weed management. Progress has been made in this direction. For sustainable food production methods, both ecological and economic conditions must be fulfilled. While satisfying ecological demands, attention must be given to the economic viability of intercropping-based crop production methods. Yield quality and quantity are important, but so also is the balance of inputs and savings. A consumer market demand for products which are produced in an ecologically acceptable way is also crucial.

AB Large-scale changes in agriculture, such as those associated with set-aside regulations and the move towards sustainable or organic systems, have impacts on landscape structure which will alter the abundance and dispersion of organisms within the system. In seeking to understand the mechanisms behind these changes, there is an opportunity to investigate the possible manipulation of populations of organisms to the benefit of agriculture, such as augmentation of beneficials. This paper presents a landscape-scale simulation model of the spatial dynamics of Lepthyphantes tenuis, with the aim of assessing the potential for manipulating agriculturally beneficial species by altering farm management; Field size, timing of agricultural operations, the dispersal power of the species were all factors which affected the abundance and distribution of this species in a simulated U.K. farmland landscape. The model was most sensitive to changes in assumptions about the dispersal ability of the test species, demonstrating the need for accurate ecological information.

AB Organic farming is often suggested as a remedy to address farmers' problems in developing countries. However, little is known about the comparative performance of organic versus conventional farming techniques. Publications on the potential of organic farming are often anecdotal and the research methodology used often raises doubt. Little has been published on methodologies. This paper describes methodological experiences of comparative research of organic versus conventional farming techniques in Kenya. Key characteristics of the described methodology are the comparative approach, on-farm research and the focus on a limited number of organic techniques (composting, liquid manure, double digging, storage protection and organic pest control) and their conventional equivalents (cattle manure and fertilizers, fertilizer (C.A.N.), shallow tillage, pesticides for storage protection and pest control). Criteria for selecting organic farming techniques and agro-ecological study areas are elaborated. The importance of comparable sets of farms and use of recommendation domains for their selection are explained. The experimental designs and methodology of data collection are presented. Inclusion of farmers' perspectives in the evaluation of the different techniques is presented as a key element of the methodology. The paper concludes with an overview of the main methodological lessons learned.

AB Short rotation, even-aged, monoculture, intensively managed bioenergy plantations, which offer the great environmental advantages of providing a renewable energy source and displacing fossil fuels, face a problem. They are increasingly at odds with the environmental movement's paradigm of what forests should be: late successional, long rotation, uneven-aged, partially harvested, with retention of much of the net primary production as soil carbon, snags and coarse woody debris. International pressure to certify forests as being sustainably managed is having a major and generally positive effect on forests managed for conventional forest products. But if this movement expands to encompass bioenergy forests, these alternative energy production systems will Face new challenges: how to maintain the efficiency of the systems while at the same time satisfying "criteria and indicators" that are being established to define "sustainability". Methods by which the sustainability of bioenergy systems can be predicted are discussed, and it is concluded that multi-value, ecologically-based ecosystem management models of the hybrid simulation type will be needed to design sustainable management systems that will satisfy the emerging set of criteria and indicators of sustainability. The second and third generation hybrid simulation models FORECAST and FORCEE, which had their origins in the FORCYTE models developed specifically to evaluate the sustainability of bioenergy plantations, are briefly reviewed. It is concluded that strategies that combine biological and technological approaches, which conserve soil organic matter and nutrients, and which utilize organic wastes will have the greatest chance of attaining sustainability.

AB In late 1989, because of concerns related to a major expansion of the forest products industry, the state of Minnesota commissioned a Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) to assess the cumulative impacts of timber harvesting. Total harvest, primarily for pulpwood, was increasing from 3.5 million m(3) in 1975 to an estimated 9 million m(3) in 1992. The GEIS examined the direct impacts of forest management at three alternative levels of annual harvest, base (9 million m(3)), medium (11 million m(3)), and high (16 million m(3)). Ten major issues, ranging from economics to biodiversity and aesthetics, were considered. Using a 1990 Forest inventory of over 13 000 plots, and computer models that optimized management goals and minimized costs, harvesting scenarios were generated by 10-year increments over a 50-year planning period. The results of the scenarios were evaluated in the context of the major issues of concern. The GEIS, completed in 1994, concluded that harvesting at the base level would be sustainable if recommended mitigation strategies were implemented. The projected impacts at the medium and high levels differed in degree rather than in type compared to those occurring at the base harvest level. Harvests exceeding about 12.5 million m(3) were only sustainable if substantial investments were made in forest management. Through political consensus arising via the GEIS, the 1995 Minnesota Sustainable Forest Resources Act appropriated $1.74 million over 2 years to address site-level impacts, establish an information cooperative, establish a research advisory committee, develop a framework to coordinate landscape planning, encourage certification and education for forestry professionals, and provide technical assistance to private landowners. Although the GEIS did not answer all questions dealing with forest management in Minnesota, it clarified the issues, identified gaps in information, and helped bring interested parties together in setting the course for forest management in the next millennia.

AB Since June 1992, significant progress has been made in defining sustainable Forest management. The approach taken has been to establish criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management. The criteria constitute a set of key elements that define the scope of the concept of sustainable forest management. They reflect a series of broadly held societal values-the environmental, social and economic benefits of forests that should be maintained for future generations. Indicators are chosen to provide measurable features of each criterion. These criteria and indicators should serve a number of purposes, by providing (1) a set of key terms that can be used in future international discussions on forests, (2) a framework against which countries can evaluate their forest policies, (3) a mechanism for rationalizing and evaluating international aid and technical cooperation programs, and (4) a means of resolving difficulties in international discussions on trade in products from sustainably managed forests. The criteria and indicators have been developed through a series of regional and international processes that are very similar in approach. The challenge now is to put them into practice, to refine the measurement and definition of the indicators, and to explore linkages between national-level criteria and indicators and the implementation of sustainable forest management at the working level.

AB Weyerharuser Company is committed to being a responsible steward of the environmental quality and economic value of the forests we manage. Weyerhaeuser's regional Forest Councils have developed specific resource strategies for forest products, water qualify, wildlife habitat, soil productivity and aesthetics. The sustainable site productivity or soil productivity strategy is as follows: "We protect soil stability and ensure long-term soil productivity by: (1) using equipment and practices appropriate to the soil, topography and weather to minimize erosion and harmful soil disturbance, and (2) using forestry practices and technology to retain organic matter and soil nutrients." The elements of the Weyerhaeuser reliable processes used to achieve this strategy in the Northwest, U.S.A. include (1) a research database, (2) common goals and standards leading to management guidelines; (3) education, training and teaming across the organization; (4) implementation of Best Management Practices (BMPs); (5) monitoring of performance and (6) adaptive experimentation. This is not a static process-continuous improvement is a design element in the process. Guidelines and BMPs have bern developed to minimize detrimental soil disturbance. This was accomplished by having (1) a strategic database on soil disturbance impacts; (2) a classification system that describes soil disturbance classes; (3) a soil operability risk rating system that rates soils on their susceptibility to compaction and puddling; and (4) a close working relationship between R and D and operations to develop BMPs. Steps are bring taken to develop organic matter management guides for various soil groups and a soil nutrient risk-rating system. These combined with fertilizer guides will lead to practices that conserve and strive to maintain organic matter and soil nutrients. Education and training of employees is an important step in implementing the guides and BMPs. Operational practices are monitored to assess performance against specified standards. Identification of knowledge gaps lead to additional research and operational adaptive trials. Based on new research information, operational experiences and monitoring feedback, BMPs will be continuously improved to meet Weyerhaeuser's sustainable site productivity strategy.

AB The importance of whole-tree harvesting of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) in Great Britain is likely to increase rapidly in the next 30 years. Large areas of marginal agricultural land were planted with Sitka spruce from 1960 to 1980 and this is likely to be harvested on a 50-60 year rotation. Increased mechanisation of harvesting operations has led to the frequent removal of whole trees from the site and there is concern over the implications of such forest management operations for longterm site fertility. This paper describes an integrated approach to be used in Britain to develop a decision support system (DSS) to provide long-term predictions of the impact of whole-tree harvesting on site fertility across a range of site types. The approach to be taken will make use of a wide range of data available from conventional yield tables, field and laboratory experiments which have examined various aspects of growth and nutrient cycling in Sitka spruce. This information will be used to calibrate a hybrid computer simulation model capable of simulating ecosystem dynamics. The parallel development of an ecological site classification system will provide a framework within which the model can be applied to generate a series of decision rules to be incorporated into a DSS. A key feature of the strategy employed is the establishment of a series of long-term field experiments which will test model predictions across the spectrum of sites to which the DSS will be applicable. Provision is also made to ensure that Feedback will be obtained to compare research output with operational performance. Finally, an approach is suggested by which the DSS could be integrated within a geographic information system (GIS) to provide a spatial context For the output which will be relevant to the wider forest industry, planning authorities and policy makers.

AB Among the proposals for mitigating the increase of atmospheric CO, are the possibility of reforesting degraded lands to sequester C or of using sustainable forest harvests to displace fossil fuels. Storing C on-site in forests and harvesting forests for a sustainable flow of forest products are not necessarily conflicting options if we recognize that their relative merits in mitigating net emissions of C will depend on site-specific factors, such as forest productivity and the efficiency with which harvested material is used. Since the land available for reforestation or development of forest plantations is limited, the relative merits of the different mitigation strategies need to be considered. We use a mathematical model of C stocks and flows to compare the net effect on C emissions to the atmosphere for the two approaches over a range of values of forest productivity and the efficiency of product use. When sustainably-produced forest products are used inefficiently to displace fossil fuels, the greater C benefit is achieved through reforestation and protection of standing forests, and increasing the rate of stand growth yields little gain. However, when forest products are used efficiently to displace fossil fuels, sustainable harvest produces the greater net C benefits, and the benefit increases rapidly with increasing productivity.

AB The annual consumption of fuelwood in Brazil is approximately equal to 180 million oil barrels, or 13.3% of all Brazilian primary energy use. Fuelwood consumption in the country is greater than the use of wood for industrial use. Fuelwood taken from existing forest has been a very common activity in Brazil. Forest plantations to support the Brazilian fuelwood consumption have not been important. As fuelwood consumption in the country is expected to increase in the future, it is important to increase the supply of wood by sustainable use of the existing natural forests. Even if they are far from the centers of consumption, these are the only available reserves capable of supporting the Brazilian future fuelwood requirements. For this reason it is necessary to use advanced technology to convert the energy of wood efficiently into a form (such as electricity) to carry it to the centers of consumption. In addition, forest plantations would be established in the available areas, mainly for specific uses, as for charcoal production for the pig-iron and steel industries. In all the above plans, at least, the US$3.2 billion/year that represents the current Brazilian fuelwood consumption should be returned to rehabilitate the forest growing stock. In addition, it would be used to stimulate the development and use of the most suitable systems of fuelwood conversion, improving the efficiency of energy production. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID CORROSION
AB Inorganic elements and compounds in biomass fuels influence the combustion process and the composition of the ashes produced. Consequently, knowledge about the material fluxes of inorganic elements and compounds during biomass combustion for different kinds of biofuels and their influencing variables is of great importance. The results gained will especially influence the future design and control of biomass furnaces and boilers in order to prevent slagging, fouling and corrosion and to assist in the definition of quality requirements for biofuels as well as the possibilities of a sustainable ash utilization.
   For this reason, comprehensive test runs were carried out in several biomass combustion plants equipped with different combustion technologies and using various biomass fuels (wood chips, bark, straw and cereals). During continuous observation periods of at least two days, samples of the biomass and the different ash fractions were taken and analysed. Furthermore, the most important operating data of the plants were recorded.
   The results of the material balances for inorganic elements showed that the concentrations of environmentally relevant heavy metals (especially Cd and Zn) in biomass ashes increase with decreasing precipitation temperature and particle size. This effect is independent of the biofuel used. Consequently, a major requirement for a sustainable ash utilization is a fractionated heavy metal separation, distinguishing between different fly-ash fractions and taking the temperature of By-ash precipitation into consideration for new furnace technologies. Research has also shown that straw and cereals, as well as their ashes,contain significantly lower amounts of heavy metals than woody biofuels and wood ashes.
   The same principles pointed out for environmentally relevant heavy metals are also valid for K, Na, Cl and S. The high concentrations of these elements in the filter fly-ash as well as in the boiler fly-ash are of great relevance for reactions that can take place in the boiler section where the flue gas is subjected to a considerable temperature gradient which is accompanied by chemical reactions, phase transitions and precipitation processes that can support or initiate fouling and corrosion. These effects are of special importance for biofuels that are rich in alkali metals and Cl such as straw and cereals. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Sustainability of pyrethroid-impregnated bednets for malaria control in
   Afghan communities
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID BED NETS; TRIAL; AREA
AB Between 1992 and 1995 a series of studies was undertaken to assess the long-term suitability of pyrethroid-impregnated bednets (PIBs) for malaria control in Afghan refugee communities in two villages in North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan. During 1992, 86% of bednet owners volunteered to have their bednets re-impregnated, and a further 15% of families purchased nets at two-thirds of cost price. From 1992 onwards, 27% of the villagers returned to Afghanistan, and annual house spraying campaigns were introduced to protect those still resident but sleeping without bednets. Within 3 years, these campaigns, together with PIBs, reduced the annual incidence of malaria by 87%, from 597 to 78 cases per 1000 population. Nevertheless, 65% of resident families continued to re-impregnate their nets annually with permethrin. To assess whether PIBs were still being used and were still protective, in view of these reduced transmission rates, we carried out a case-control study in 1994 on febrile or otherwise symptomatic patients presenting at village health centres. Comparison of the slide-positivity rates of PIB users and those without bednets showed that regular usage reduced the odds of contracting falciparum and vivax malaria to 0.22 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09-0.55) and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.19-0.51), respectively. There was no evidence of a sex- or age-bias in bednet use or in protective effect. The results indicate that a community-based PIB programme is an appropriate malaria control measure in areas where management or security problems make traditional house-spraying campaigns impossible.
   A relevant finding for those involved in the monitoring of bednet distribution projects is that the local coverage of bednets and the local impact on malaria, even when introduced to remote areas, can be estimated very cheaply by health centre microscopists who simply catalogue blood film diagnoses according to patients' bednet use practices.

AB Ill health is a serious impediment to progress in must pour countries, yet health is not a high priority on foreign aid agendas. Health research, which provides the essential base for sustainable progressive health programs, is barely visible in developing countries. For example, in Bangladesh, one finds unacceptably high morbidity and mortality rates among infants and children, health programs that are struggling and a rudimentary health research establishment; for the huge foreign donor community in that country, health programs and research do not appear to warrant major investments, Diarrheal diseases are at the toy, of the list of killers in many poor nations including Bangladesh. Recent advances in our understanding of diarrhea suggest that while prevention may not he possible soon, improved active treatment can evolve from an aggressive research effort centred in a developing country and linked to appropriate international partners. Global agencies such as the World Health Organization have demonstrated a declining interest in health research, as reflected in the policies of their Diarrhoeal Disease Control Programme. Major donors ro the developing world, the Canadian International Development Agency for example, have had a relatively minor involvement in health and little commitment to health research. University links with the west, private enterprises and specially targeted programs are involved in developing world health. research but they have not been able to foster and leave behind sustainable, high quality research programs. The problem should be attacked directly by supporting focused, relevant health research centres in regions of the world where the burden of disease continues to impede progress and where the environment is conducive to high quality research that is well integrated with care delivery programs. An instructive model of this approach is the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

TI Phosphorus retention in the soil matrix of constructed wetlands
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS

DT Article
ID CALCAREOUS SOILS; DOMESTIC SEWAGE; WASTE-WATER; PHOSPHATE; AVAILABILITY;
   PLANTS
AB Constructed wetlands may be described as soil/plant systems for wastewater treatment in which pollutant removal is based on general principles of nutrient transformation in soils. Currently perceived as ''black boxes'' by engineers, the design and operation of these systems may be greatly improved based on the knowledge gained from several decades of studying nutrient cycling in soil-plant systems. This paper reports on an attempt to operate this linkage. Three pilot scale systems planted with reed, cattail, and water hyacinth were used to study the role of the soil matrix in phosphorus (P) removal over a period of five months. Phosphorus removal was superior in the soil-based systems with a mean P reduction from the influent concentration (24 mg . mL(-1)) of 80% compared with 54% in the soilless bed. Recycling the effluent into the system in order to increase the detention time did not contribute to improving removal, except in the soilless bed. This indicates that P removal in the soil-based systems is rapid, and that an equilibrium value may be reached beyond which no further removal is possible. The effect of a lime amendment on the improvement of P removal was studied in batch tests in a decarbonated sand amended with 1.4%, 12.2%, 21%, 38%, and 49% calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Phosphorus removal from solution can be significantly improved by the addition of small amounts of lime (2-4%). Fixation is also faster and sustainable in lime-amended sands. These results suggest that P removal from wastewater can be greatly enhanced by the addition of small amounts of lime to the soil substrate.

AB Cover cropping and mulching to sustain and improve soil fertility and for weed control are common practices in organic growing systems. In this study, microbial parameters under different kinds of mulches and cover crops were analyzed in a field experiment with organically grown black currant (Ribes nigrum). The experiment comprised a combination of two mulches with bare soil as a control and two cover crops which were compared with bare soil, with and without an extra supply of organic fertilizer. Soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) as well as pH were unaffected by any of the treatments. The basal respiration rate was increased by mulching with wood chips throughout the four years of the experiment. During the last two years of the experiment, substrate induced respiration was also measured but was not found to be affected by any of the mulches. The potential ammonium (NH4+) oxidation increased significantly after an initial supply of 200 kg N ha(-1) as solid cattle manure. The increase was significantly lower under wood chips than in bare soil, although an extra 200 kg N ha(-1) had been supplied under the wood chips. Furthermore, the black currant bushes suffered from a N deficiency in the wood chip treatment. The results: showed that there was no substantial lasting build-up of microbial biomass or organic matter content with wood chips because of lack of N, despite a large initial input ofN and easily-available C. Possible reasons for this deficiency are either increased denitrification under the wood chips or fungal translocation of N to the wood chip layer. Results from this experiment suggests that the evaluation of a few complementary biological soil parameters can be an important tool when developing sustainable growing systems and for indicating environmental stress.

TI Depletion of plant-available silicon in soils: A possible cause of
   declining rice yields
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB The phenomenon of yield decline in different rice ecosystems from many parts of the world has been reported to be associated with decreases in the effective nitrogen (N) supply from soil. However, many reports in the literature suggest that silicon (Si) is an agronomically essential element for sustainable rice production. Depletion of plant-available Si in soils where rice is grown could be a possible limiting factor contributing to declining yields. In order to address this problem of yield decline or stagnation, it seems necessary to survey Si status of soils and rice grown in different ecosystems throughout the world and develop region-specific integrated nutrient management systems that include the element Si.

DE carbon sequestration; climate change; forestry; economics; policy
AB All countries in Scandinavia have introduced a carbon fee on fossil fuel to reduce the emission of the climate gas CO2. In Norway the fee is 0.82 NOK (or about 0.12 US$) per liter of gasoline, equivalent to 343 NOK (or 49 US$) per ton CO2. The fee is an emission cost which gives a corresponding benefit for absorbing atmospheric CO2 in forest biomass. This article shows that this benefit corresponds to a net economic value of carbon sequestration in forest biomass 2-30 times higher than the net value of timber as raw material for the forest industry in Norway, which has one of the highest timber prices in the world. If a fee high enough to stabilize the CO2 emission in Norway were to be introduced, the value of carbon sequestration will be at least twice as high as the above estimates. It is argued that this will imply substantial changes in forest management and policy, both in rich and poor countries. Projects to restore and maintain sustainable forest ecosystems will be very profitable, and could simultaneously provide considerable other environmental benefits like increased biodiversity, soil stability, and improved watershed structures.

SO CROP SCIENCE

DT Article
ID ERGOVALINE; GENOTYPE; PLANT
AB Ergot alkaloid concentrations vary among genotypes of endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). Because the ergot alkaloids are responsible for detrimental health disorders in grazing livestock, but the endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones and Gams) Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin is mutualistic, development of E+ tall fescue populations low in ergot alkaloid concentration may be a sustainable non-toxic solution for livestock producers, Current techniques for screening ergot alkaloids in tall fescue are labor and equipment intensive and time consuming, The objective of this research was to determine the number of replications and locations needed to detect specified differences among treatments varying in alkaloid concentration. Six E+ tall fescue genotypes were harvested twice at two held locations and one greenhouse location in 1 yr, and the number of replications and environments required to show specific treatment differences for alkaloid concentration calculated within harvest dates. Ergot alkaloid concentrations for the genotypes ranged from 488 mg kg(-1) to 2504 mg kg(-1) in the spring, and 219 mg kg(-1) to 986 mg kg(-1) in the summer. Genotypic variances were proportional to the mean; hence, data were subjected to a log(10) transformation. Treatments harvested twice with differences of 50% of the experimental mean were detectable (P = 0.05) in experiments containing two replications grown at four environments, or two replications grown at three environments and harvested once when nontransformed or transformed data were used, respectively. Use of transformed data will be necessary to keep the number of observations per experimental unit manageable.

Individual patient work has begun to benefit from cognitive behaviour therapy approaches and the centrality of medication compliance is increasingly clear. The challenge is to devise and research interventions sustainable in routine practice.

AB Erik Eckholm is attributed with having popularized a theory of environmental crisis in the Nepal Himalaya. In his treatise Losing Ground (1976), he links population growth to contemporary upland deforestation and soil erosion, which are presumed to cause downstream flooding and silting. Since the 1980s, this theory has come under intense criticism on empirical, theoretical and ideological grounds, although it remains a sacred cow in the popular-press. A historiography of the theory reveals that representations of and discourses on the nature and extent of environmental degradation have been an important dimension of three distinct aid regimes that shaped the post-World War II development project in Nepal. As such, within specific historical and institutional constellations, some conclusions have seemed more tenable than others, and certain interventions have become more legitimate. Moreover, the production of environmental interventions is intimately connected to the production of environmental knowledge, both of which are intrinsically bound up with power relations. Therefore, the facts about environmental deterioration have become subordinate to the broader debates on the politics of resource use and sustainable development.

SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMON PROPERTY
AB The latest orthodoxy to emerge in environmental literature centres on the notion that state ownership of forests results in poor management and ecological degradation. Depending on their political persuasion, scholars, policy-makers and activists either advocate privatization of state forests, or demand their transferral to local communities as solutions for promoting sustainable forest management. This article argues that such proposals are flawed because they assume that ownership status determines the ways in which resources are used and managed. It argues that an analytical distinction needs to be made between property and control for understanding the complex interplay of social, economic, political and ecological factors that influence forest stock, composition and quality. Through a historical analysis of the development of state forestry in the Indian Himalaya, the article shows how state ownership of forests does not result in the monolithic imposition of proprietary rights, but emerges instead as an ensemble of access and management regimes.

AB The golden-headed lion tamarin Leontopithecus chrysomelas is endemic to the Atlantic Forest of the southeastern part of Bahia State, Brazil. The Una Biological Reserve, covering 7,022 ha, is the only federal conservation unit which legally guarantees the preservation of this species In this region. Sixty-five percent of the Reserve area is covered with vegetation which provides an ideal habitat, but it is not sufficient to maintain a genetically viable tamarin population in the long term. The Environmental Education Programme with the community surrounding the Reserve aims to make people understand how important it is to protect this kind of conservation unit and the forest remaining around it. Up to mid-1997, 70 farms had been visited and landowners and rural workers have had access to information about conservation, property rights and land use. In 70% of these farms conservation activities are already being carried out and in 10% of them sustainable agricultural practices have already been adopted or are being implemented. A buffer zone, therefore, is being created around the Una Biological Reserve, effectively increasing the habitat for the golden-headed lion tamarin and other species under threat.

DT Article
AB The basic conditions of economic stabilisation, have been realised by the macroeconomic policy in Croatia. But only a longterm economic: development strategy could provide answer to the following questions: With what and how can we approach the European and world economy? The purpose of this paper is to point out the essence of contemporary economic development trends and the preconditions that should be fullfilled in Croatia in order to join these trends as soon and as productively as possible. Qualitative analysis of contemporary literature dealing with this subject as well as the experience of developed economies indicate that economic growth causes high social casts. As transitional social costs that are already high should hot multiply, it is necessary for Croatia, while taking into consideration its specific conditions, to initiate economic growth congruent with the global development strategy - the strategy of sustainable development.

TI Perceptual and structural barriers to investing in natural capital:
   Economics from an ecological footprint perspective
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE perceptual barrier; structural barrier; investment; natural capital
ID ENERGY
AB This paper argues that perceptual distortions and prevailing economic rationality, far from encouraging investment in natural capital, actually accelerate the depletion of natural capital stocks. Moreover, conventional monetary analyses cannot detect the problem. This paper therefore makes the case for direct biophysical measurement of relevant stocks and flows, and uses for this purpose the ecological footprint concept. To develop the argument, the paper elaborates the natural capital concept and asserts the need of investing in natural capital to compensate for net losses. It shows how the ecological footprint can be used as a biophysical measure for such capital, and applies this concept as an analytical tool for examining the barriers to investing in natural capital. It picks four issues from a rough taxonomy of barriers and discusses them from an ecological footprint perspective: it shows why marginal prices cannot reflect ecological necessities; how interregional risk pooling encourages resource liquidation; how present terms of trade undermine both local and global ecological stability; and how efficiency strategies may actually accelerate resource throughput. Affirming the necessity of biophysical approaches for exploring the sustainability implications of basic ecological and thermodynamic principles, it draws lessons for current development.

TI Steps towards indicators of sustainable development: Linking economic
   and ecological concepts
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

   critical loads; critical levels
AB Conceptions of defining and measuring sustainable development can broadly be placed in two categories: weak and strong sustainability. The concept of weak sustainability is based on neo-classical economic theory and assumes that manufactured and natural capital are close substitutes. This means that costs of environmental deterioration (e.g., forest damage) can be compensated by benefits from manufactured capital (e.g., income). Thus, environmental damages are valued in monetary units. The concept of strong sustainability denies the degree of substitution that weak sustainability assumes, at least for some critical elements of natural capital. This paper pledges for strong sustainability indicators, especially for critical loads and critical levels. Since the costs and benefits of avoiding critical impacts have to be taken into account, a combination of strong and weak sustainability indicators-means a linkage of ecological (physical) and economic (monetary) approaches-should be suggested.

AB Rural Amazonians, especially Indians, extractivists and other forest dwellers, desperately need something that they can sell. Sale of material commodities taken from the rainforest is the focus of most attempts to encourage 'sustainable development' for these populations, but the mother lode waiting to be tapped is not a material commodity, but rather the forest's environmental services. Converting services like biodiversity maintenance, carbon storage and water cycling into monetary flows that can support a population of forest guardians requires crossing a series of hurdles. Reliable quantification of the magnitude of services being offered is a first necessity. How to convert forest environmental services into an income stream, and how to convert this stream into a foundation for sustainable development in rural Amazonia is a great challenge. Effort should be focused on tapping environmental services as a long-term strategy for maintaining both rainforest and its population. In addition to progressing toward long-term goals, immediate measures are needed to support the population and to avoid further loss of forest.

AB Minilivestock encompasses vertebrates and invertebrates which can be produced on a sustainable basis as food, feed or revenue. Animals most often used today are rodents (like Thryonomys sp., Cricetomys sp., Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris. Capromys. Agouti paca) and guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), frogs, giant snails (Achatina sp. and Archachatina sp.) manure worms (Eisenia fetida, Eudrilus eugeniae,...) and insects (butterflies, termites). Scientific knowledge is available, but the time now is ripe to consider education and training in minilivestock and classical domestic livestock alike.

AB In this discussion the principle is adopted that factors tending to increase food and/or income for economically marginal rural families, while decreasing pressure for land-clearing, pesticides and intensive agriculture, will tend to favor the preservation of biodiversity and a sustainable future. The great diversity of habitats of insect species that serve as traditional foods presents an almost endless diversity of situations in which recognition and enlightened management of the food insect resource can result not only in better human nutrition but simultaneously aid in maintaining diversity of habitats for other forms of life. Approaches include. 1) Enhancing forest conservation and management by acting on the desire of local populations for protection of traditional insect foods (i.e., caterpillars in Zambia and Zaire); 2) Reducing poaching in parks and wildlife preserves by allowing sustainable use of the food insect resources by the local people (i.e., caterpillars in Malawi); 3) Reducing pesticide use by developing more efficient methods of harvesting pest species that are traditional foods (i.e., grasshoppers); 4) Increasing environmental and economic efficiency by developing dual product systems (i.e., silks and silk moth larvae/pupae, honey and honey bee brood); 5) Reducing organic pollution by recycling agricultural and forestry wastes into high-quality food or animal feedstuffs (i.e., fly larvae, palm weevils). Other relevant considerations are that some edible insect species enhance their local environment in various ways (i.e., leafcutter ants in S. America) or create additional diversity of species within the habitat (i.e., termites in Africa). Some, as shown in studies with crickets exhibit considerably higher food conversion efficiency than beef cattle when fed diets of similar quality. Finally, there is need for research on industrial scale mass-production of edible insects, for increased recognition of the nutritional and environmental importance of insects by national governments, and for increased involvement of Western media and academia in dispelling unfounded cultural biases in the Western World toward insects as food.

AB Insects form an important part of the diet for the people of New Guinea. Most are collected opportunistically, but the grub of sage weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus papuanus is produced sustainably for the market. Butterflies, especially birdwings are ranched by villagers in both Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya and marketed overseas. Conservation projects have been initiated in New Guinea to protect the birdwing butterflies and to provide economic incentives for the landowners.

DE edible insects; entomophagy
AB Insects as a major animal group possess enormous biodiversity and form a colossal biomass in nature that generally is wasted. Insects offer us many benefits, including their use in human and animal nutrition, in medicine, religion, art, and handicrafts. Also, they are efficient recyclers of organic matter and provide a source of economic gain for the poor through their commercialization.
   Even if insects are considered by developed nations as an emergency and nonconventional food of low prestige, they are part of the daily diet of the larger part of humanity, that conceive them as a healthy, nutritious and savory meal, constituting sometimes the only significant source of protein of good quality. Up to date we have recorded around 2000 different edible insect species in the world.
   Because of their high nutritive value and ubiquitous presence, insects present a potential sustainable food source for humans. Once was select suitable species and develop appropriate breeding methods, insects can provide a reliable and sustainable source of high-quality animal protein.

AB Insects and terrestrial invertebrates are presumed to have consistently contributed to the diet of our ancestors and it is estimated that 1386 insects are still adopted worldwide for human nutrition. As elsewhere in the tropical world, insects are a part of the diet of Irian Jaya populations. The distribution of insect food consumption on the western side of New Guinea island follows different patterns, according to the environment and to population subsistence economy.
   In the forest biome of the periferic mountain areas, many different insect species are collected in small numbers, mainly by women and children. Insect collection occurs by chance but probably helps these subjects, the most vulnerable to possible food-shortages, to complement their diet with some extra proteins and fats.
   In the western lowlands, a complex cultural system is centered around the traditional staple: sago (Metroxylon sagu and rumphii). The pit of this palm, which grows spontaneously in the swampy forest plains, contains a high amount of starch and is easily gathered by the local people. A beetle (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus papuanus) is strictly linked to the sage palm and oviposits especially on damaged or felled specimens. Villagers manage the sage palms in order to increase palmworm oviposition and to collect a consistent number of larvae about 6 weeks later. This ancient sage culture, favoured by an abundant and reliable resource, has developed a rich ceremonial life connected with sage larvae consumption.
   Ecologic, economic and cultural factors influencing the variety of insect consumption modalities are taken into account. The development of local, small-scale invertebrate breeding systems can contribute to the development of sustainable, renewable resources and protect tropical forests from degradation.

ID RADIATION-INDUCED XEROSTOMIA
AB Jaborandi (Pilocarpus sp.;) is a shrub or small tree 3-7.5 m tall that can be found in native stands or as isolated individuals throughout Brazil. The leaves of jaborandi contain the alkaloid pilocarpine, winery used in ophthalmology for treatment of certain types of glaucoma and more recently for xerostomia. This paper discusses the current systems of production of jaborandi leaves in Maranhao, Northeastern Brazil. On one side, the extractivism practiced by indigenous people and peasants; on the other, the plantation recently established as the result of henry investment by a pharmaceutical company. In the extractive system, the non-sustainable exploitation of the drug-rich leaves of this plant species may have produced considerable damage To the native populations over time, reducing the size of the populations, and impoverishing their gene pools. The following potential effects of the plantation are discussed; contribute to diminishing the pressure on wild populations; impact on the local people currently involved in the extractivism; and its impacts on the local economies.

AB This paper values the savanna woodland resources of two neighbouring villages in Zimbabwe. Households receive a diverse range of products from a variety of ecologically contrasting sites, and a large number of products are marketed. Whilst the rules and regulations regarding tree-based resources are similar in the two villages, there is a greater degree of enforcement in Jinga, where ecological sustainability is also more promising. Using a derived demand approach, it was found that, in both villages, fuelwood for household cooking, wild fruits and poles are the most important in terms of contribution to total value. The total values obtained for the woodland products investigated are sizeable by comparison to annual cash income. Non-market values (water retention, rainmaking functions, etc.) were ranked highly during participatory rural appraisal techniques, The valuation of a select range of products based on market prices is thus a small component of total economic value.

AB The human population is ever-expanding and the ability to provide enough food is becoming increasingly difficult, Insect-plant interactions have always been of interest to man but, owing to the need to feed the world's population in a sustainable and environmentally friendly fashion, such studies are taking on a new significance. By considering the third trophic level (natural enemies of herbivorous insects) when studying insect-plant interactions, not only can this help improve ecological understanding but it may enable us to improve biological control.

AB This paper deals with sustainable energy technologies under restrictions on resources and environmental impact. We have developed a database to estimate life-cycle efficiencies and greenhouse-gas emissions. Next, we define sustainability limitations on resource depletion and emissions. Based on these concepts, the present world energy system is judged to be unsustainable. Mitigation measures such as disposal of CO2 and solar power generation are evaluated utilizing the concept. We show how sustainability influences the cost-effectiveness of measures taken. At the same time CO2 removal is shown to play a transitional but important role to realize sustainable energy scenario in ultra-long term. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In this article the characteristics and requirements of a sustainable energy system are described. Special attention is given to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2. It is indicated that we may have to reduce the annual CO2 emissions due to our energy consumption from 6 GtC at present to less than 3 GtC in the year 2100, and the cumulative CO2 emissions between the years 1990 and 2100 to 550-750 GtC.
   To reduce the CO2 emissions, one option we can develop and apply is improvement of the energy efficiency with 50-90%. In addition strong efforts are needed to develop a sustainable energy supply system with low or no CO2 emissions. Option number one, the use of renewable energy sources, offers a huge potential but major technological breakthroughs are required to allow a massive application of these sources at affordable costs, in a reliable way and in an acceptable manner. This probably also holds for another option, nuclear energy. The impact of a fuel switch from coal to oil and natural gas will depend on the recoverable amount of fossil fuels. Therefore, due attention should be given to Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), especially as it is the only option that may allow continuing large scale use of fossil fuels. Application of this option could prevent the emission of 300 GtC or more between the years 1990 and 2100. Studies in the Netherlands suggest its application would be accepted socially. One of the main implementation barriers is its high cost. In the power sector CDR may increase the electricity production costs with 30-100%, although there is room to reduce these costs. Lower cost CDR options are available outside the power sector, like CDR from natural gas recovery processes, from specific industrial processes and from the production of hydrogen from natural gas, coal or biomass. Consequently, CDR may be applied at a cost ranging from US$ 5-10 to 250 per ton Carbon avoided, depending on the option and circumstances involved. Given the pursuit of sustainability, further attention is needed not only for costs reductions but also for the environmental and safety aspects of CO2 disposal especially in aquifers and in the deep ocean.

Well located renewable energy sources have low external costs and provide sustainable energy options, Both economic and regulatory instruments may be used for internalizing environmental externalities - a mix will be most appropriate.

AB The last decade has witnessed a fundamental change in the planning process for development, It is now recognized that the dimension of environment protection is of vital importance for sustainable development, From the comparative survey of available energy planning models, it was found that the environmental considerations are limited only to estimating the pollution load, thus sending false price signals to the technology market, and leading to environmentally distorted policy decisions, The centrepiece of this research is a methodology for integrated energy sector planning, policy impact assessment, and policy mix analysis, incorporating the impact of environmental externality cost of energy supply and use into the planning process, The model aims at determining the least cost energy planning policy path for a country, namely Egypt, with the least environmental damage.

ID GASOLINE CONSUMPTION
AB This paper extends the debate over the ideal of the sustainable city, particularly as it relates to transport, by providing empirical evidence, from five case-study cities in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands on the links between urban form and energy consumption in transport. It also links energy use measures to the physical, economic, and social structure of the city to determine whether there are significant relationships. Energy-use measures combine all the characteristics of travel (mode, distance, and frequency), together with occupancy, to give a new set of composite measures of travel. The conclusions reached are mixed in that significant relationships have been found, principally between energy use in transport and physical characteristics of the city, such as density, size, and amount of open space. But comparability problems make it difficult to establish definitive relationships.

ID RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; EQUITY
AB Environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been identified as an important instrument for facilitating sustainability. However, to do so requires the integration oi sustainability into EIA theory and practice. The sustainability concept is a Valid and important environmental management perspective. However, many issues and obstacles need to be addressed further if the concept is to be translated into practical strategies. Sustainability can potentially infuse EIA with a clearer sense of direction, an ethical foundation, a mechanism for establishing priorities and assessing choices, and a means of linking EIA to other environmental management instruments. Conceptually, EIA and sustainability can be integrated, but frameworks should be refined, adpated to context, and linked to related initiatives. Sustainability should be explicitly incorporated into EIA legislation, guidelines, and institutional arrangements. An experimental approach to testing, assessing, and sharing experiences is suggested.
   A framework is first presented that defines and characterizes the sustainability concept. A further framework is then described for integrating sustainability into EIA at the conceptual level. The integration of sustainability and EIA at the regulatory level is next addressed through an overview oi sustainability initiatives in EIA requirements in Canada. The Canadian examples include many promising initiatives but these and other experiences will need to be monitored, shared, and integrated into comprehensive environmental management strategies. Finally, means of incorporating sustainability into each activity in the EIA planning process are identified.

AB Increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases as a result of human activities are thought to be resulting in discernible changes in global climate. Australia, as a signatory to the Climate Change Convention, has agreed to stabilize emissions of these gases at 1990 levels. There is a need to identify options that may reduce emissions from all industry sectors including those emissions arising from agricultural activities such as wheat cropping. The wheat cropping systems of the Wimmera region of Victoria studied here are likely to be significant net emitters of greenhouse gases with average annual emissions equivalent to 1350 to 2150 kg of carbon dioxide per hectare. Choosing stubble retention wheat cropping systems could reduce the average net emissions per hectare by up to 37% depending on the systems used. More importantly though, the stubble retention cropping systems which have lower emissions also tend to have greater yields, and thus may produce up to four times the grain yield per unit emissions than other systems such as conventionally tilled, continuous wheat. This indicates that there is significant potential to adapt wheat cropping systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective way. This capability may be enhanced by tactical management decisions that change fertilizer inputs depending on soil moisture levels at sowing or on seasonal forecasts based on factors such as the Southern Oscillation Index. This approach is also likely to have financial and risk management benefits. Loss of soil carbon was the most substantial component of the emissions budget for all cropping systems (63 to 84% of total emissions), followed by nitrous oxide emissions (from 12 to 42%) with methane forming a relatively small component (from 0.003 to 17%). Emissions from fossil fuel combustion (from 0.8 to 8%) and from burning crop stubble (from 0 to 21%) formed relatively small components of the emissions budget. Policy issues are discussed including the removal of barriers to adoption of the more sustainable, low-emission systems identified in this study. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The major predictors of health risk from pesticide exposure are quantity and toxicity of pesticides reaching end-users, field workers, and persons (including children) with casual and indirect exposures to field and food residues, drift, and contaminated groundwater. Past work in Israel and the Palestinian National Authority has documented risks for acute poisoning, daily illness, transient neurotoxic effects, and potential cancer hazards in workers, populations exposed to pesticide drift, and the general population. Risk assessment predicts that reduction in use of agents with high toxicity and pesticide substitution are desired strategies for achieving the largest reductions in risk, but successful implementation and program sustainability depend on maintaining crop yield and increasing farmer earnings. A joint pilot Israeli-Palestinian-NGO program aims to determine whether crop yields and profits can be sustained while reducing pesticide use, promoting integrated pest management, and restricting ecosystem damage. The project involves six components: (1) assessments of health risk and crop yield in relation to pesticide use and exposure; (2) training health-agricultural teams to introduce and evaluate crop growth and managements with reduced pesticide use; (3) tracing and stopping import and trade in banned or restricted pesticides; (4) restricting child labor; (5) promoting information delivery and worker and community right-to-know and right-to-act; and (6) establishing a uniform regional standard for protection of workers and the general public. Preliminary evidence (organochlorines and breast cancer, organophosphates and illness in field workers) indicates that (1) a reduction of use is the foremost determinant of a reduction in health risk; (2) cotton yield can be increased despite a reduction in pesticide use (organophosphates); and (3) a reduction in pesticide use (organophosphates and organochlorines) has to be part of a crop rotation program for food crops timed to seasonal fluctuations in supply, demand, and crop price.

AB Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is not sufficiently tailored to the analysis of strategic environmental problems of material suppliers. Sustainable development calls for a reduction by a factor of 10 to 20 in the material intensity of the economy, a situation which leads to dramatic shifts in markets for raw materials. Furthermore, a material supplier might have major improvement options in the material's numerous downstream uses. LCAs, however, can't cover these two aspects. An adapted form of Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) may be an answer. This approach defines a system in relation to the flow of a specific material through society. All environmental interventions related to the material are inventoried. An emission evaluation indicates the dominant environmental bottlenecks, given the current market volume of each application of the material. This helps to identify improvement options and strategic choices in market portfolios. Scenario analysis on potential measures can further indicate changes of material flows - and thus markers - in the system. The approach is illustrated with a case study on chlorine.

AB Environmentally sound manufacture does not have its source only in developing and improving the techniques for treating solid, liquid and gaseous wastes at the end of the production process. Our experience shows that more effort and capital budgets must be devoted to developing preventive measures. Although the treatment techniques have become very advanced and meet ecological requirements to a very high degree, they are now reaching the limits of their technological and economic feasibility. Environmental protection at the production site has undergone structural change in recent years. The emphasis has shifted to preventive techniques which affect the production process itself, avoiding the emergence of waste at the ''end of the pipe'' by preventing its formation or recycling it straight away. This integrated approach is in harmony with the demands of sustainable production. The functions of in-process environmental protection measures need to be looked at as a whole from the points of view of both environmental protection and cost-effectiveness. Some integrated methods are described.

AB Common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L. is intercropped or relay cropped with maize in many Andean highlands of Colombia and Peru. Breeding beans for the target multiple cropping systems is essential for the development of productive and sustainable agriculture for the Andean smallholders. Outline of the breeding programme should follow the farming system approach with the establishment of on-farm trials and early farmers involvement. Bean breeding is oriented to minimize intercrop competition and to stabilize complementarity with maize. Genetic traits needed for improved varieties are divided as follows : traits not interacting with the cropping systems, traits specific to intercrops and traits related with socioeconomic and seed quality aspects. Screening, prebreeding and recombination nursery are better made under sole cropping while varietal improvement and on-farm trials are conducted under the target multiple cropping systems. Breeding schemes may involve recurrent, pedigree and bulk hybrid selection. The given application concerns the genetic improvement of P. coccineus, P. polyanthus and interspecific hybrids of P. vulgaris for both simultaneous and relay intercropping in Colombia and Peru. Earliness, cold tolerance, resistance to fungus diseases (mainly Ascochyta leaf blight and anthracnosis) and seed yield potential were the major objectives of the bean improvement programme. Priority has been given to the exploitation of the large diversity available in the secondary gene pool of common bean.

AB There are severe soil constraints for agriculture in many tropical regions of the world. Acidity and low levels of calcium are examples of them in the Brazilian Cerrados (Savannahs). They may prevent deep root growth of cultivated plants, exposing them to moisture stress during dry spells. This study aimed to develop a technique for screening soya bean varieties tolerant to low calcium based on root growth in nutrient solution. The results have shown varietal differences for tolerance to low-Ca stress. The method of screening for response to low-Ca is quick, non-destructive and can be employed in genetic studies and breeding programmes for efficient calcium utilisation by soya beans. It is expected that improved varieties for this character will lead to yield stability and contribute to develop sustainable farming systems in the savannahs.

DT Article
AB In the first part of this study the author focuses on a number of theoretical problems in ecology, and especially the relationship between anthropocentrism and biocentrism and the question of the possibility of going further than the intersubjective conception of moral judgement and extend it to non-human beings, particularly animals. In this context the author supports the position of "cultivated anthropocentrism" and an extended conception of humanity.
   In the second part the author reflects on a number of questions of the practical application of ecologically motivated ethics, and especially on the significance of the concept of long-term sustainable life. The author is convinced that a change in value orientations is possible not so much in the form of a society-wide process as in the form of struggling for and gaining space for the development of "minority" styles of Life that are favourable from the ecological point of view.

AB This review paper describes the nature and scale of changes to forest soils brought about by forestry operations. A relatively non-technical approach is adopted with the aim of stimulating debate within as wide an audience as possible. The paper does not aim to be exhaustive but rather a position statement. Areas where further study is required are highlighted.
   The concept of sustainability is explored in relation to forest soils, and the condition highlighted is that impacts of forest management operations should not, in the long term, exceed the capacity of soil to recover by natural processes (e.g. erosion losses should not exceed soil formation rates, nutrient removals should not exceed nutrient inputs etc.). Soil erosion, nutrient removal, compaction, and changes in organic matter content and soil water status are identified as the most important processes involved in the impacts of management.
   The impacts of some of the more intensive forest management regimes on soil compaction, nutrient removal and erosion rates appear to be of similar magnitude to the recovery capacity of soils. Where the most intensive forms of forest operation are used on susceptible sites some degree of long-term soil degradation appears to be likely, and it can be regarded as valid to describe such management practices as unsustainable. However, the scale of occurrence of such management is probably relatively modest, and decreasing. On less susceptible sites, and where less intensive forms of management are employed, impacts on soils are low enough for management to be regarded as sustainable, and are often less than under pre-existing land uses. Compaction caused by heavy harvesting and extraction machinery, nutrient depletion resulting from whole tree harvesting on infertile sites where rotations are short, and erosion following cultivation and harvesting on erodible soils are the greatest causes of concern. Compliance with recent Forestry Commission guidelines should lead to lower impacts than those recorded during recent decades. However, rotation-length audits of the impacts of different forest management regimes on a range of site types are needed before definitive statements about the sustainability of management operations can be made.

TI The silviculture of conifers in Great Britain
SO FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID SITKA SPRUCE; SCOTS PINE; SCOTLAND; GROWTH; ROOTS
AB The original paper by H.M. Steven, with this title, described the silvicultural characteristics of the main coniferous species then available in British forestry. The use of these introduced conifers was justified by the limited site tolerances of the one native species, Scots pine, and the need to expand forest cover on to sites with infertile soils in harsh climatic conditions. This paper reviews the developments in silvicultural techniques and understanding that have enabled the rapid expansion of productive forestry in the last seventy years:
   The problems associated with afforestation, requiring amelioration of soil physical and chemical conditions, have been resolved and the climatic limits to the use of individual species are more clearly defined.
   Increased knowledge of the physiological responses of individual species to environmental factors has influenced silvicultural practice from nursery production to the regeneration of mature stands.
   Analysis of genetic variation within introduced conifer species has refined their use and is leading to improvements in their productivity and timber quality.
   The application of ecological principles, based on the ecosystem concept, has led to an understanding of forest stand dynamics that should ensure production from exotic species on a sustainable basis.
   Future requirements in the silviculture of conifers include the transfer of the results of computer simulation modelling into practice, the development of silvicultural systems appropriate to British conditions and greater emphasis on the quality of production.

AB The Fallingsnow Ecosystem Project documents the ecological consequences of alternative conifer release treatments (motor-manual [clearing/brush saw], mechanical [Silvana Selective/Ford Versatile tractor], helicopter-applied herbicides Vision(R) [a.i. glyphosate], Release(R) [a.i, triclopyr], and control [no treatment] in young spruce (Picea spp.) plantations. Here a series of papers that quantify the effects of these alternative treatments on major environmental components, as well as their production rates and costs is introduced. In general, one growing season after treatment, untreated plots tended to have consistently larger, more diverse populations of the biotic components examined. Biotic and abiotic changes caused by the cutting treatments were more similar to each other than to those resulting from the herbicide treatments, but statistical differences among treatments were few. Herbicide treatments were the most productive and least costly, and about 60% of the active ingredient was deposited on the target (aspen [Populus tremuloides Michx.]) foliage.

AB Soil erosion is the principal threat to agricultural sustainability, affecting both the characteristics of the in situ soil and its productive potential. However, soils vary in their resilience and there are very few empirical data upon which to appreciate the degree and type of impact on the soil caused by erosion. This paper describes an experiment designed to generate such data based on soil loss and runoff plots, and it reports on nearly nine years of experience with the design at the Instituto Agronomico, Campinas. Brazil on a Latosol (Oxisol). After rev en years of erosion induced by four levels of artificial cover, the effective rainfall on the most eroded soil was 20 percent less than on the control full cover. Crop yields were also found to be significantly affected: in 1995 by nearly 700 kg/ha and in 1996 by over 1000 kg/ha-a 50% decline in yield, amounting to a loss of 4 kg/ha of maize per tonne of cumulative soil loss, losses of nutrients (organic C, P, K, Ca and Mg) in the runoff and eroded soil were also significant with far higher levels of loss associated with the eroded sediment. Changes in the in situ soil were less clear, but a test of trends showed that the decreases in organic matter and increases in acidity could unambiguously be attributed to soil erosion. Average enrichment ratios of the eroded sediment were 1.3 for organic C, 2.6 for P, 0.7 for K, 1.3 for Ca and 1.2 for Mg. Erosion has also affected the maize quality-mainly N, Ca and B nutrient content. Through these various measures, we conclude that seven years of induced erosion has bad a marked effect on soil productivity, and for the first time we are now in a position to begin calculating the financial impact of the erosion process on future yields and farmer livelihoods.

AB Despite the burgeoning literature on sustainable development in the Third World only a small proportion has focused on the environmental problems of towns and cities. In this article the principal items on the recently christened 'Brown Agenda' are reviewed. Following the contextualisation of these issues in terms of the urban development process, a number of specific themes are examined. These include the nature of environmental problems in Third World cities and the relationship between the environment, poverty and shelter. A number of these themes are illustrated by reference to a case study of Calcutta. In the final section the question of how best to manage and plan the urban environment is examined. In particular, recent proposals by influential international agencies such as the World Bank are considered.

AB Orthodox approaches to the dynamics of ecosystems and socio-cultural systems assume a one-way transition from an initial to a final state. Recent critiques, however, suggest more than two possible states, each a stage in a never-ending sequence of transitions. In the orthodox view; ecosystems and sociocultural systems are simple (predictable, equilibrium-seeking, linear); in the critical view, they are complex (unpredictable, far from equilibrium, non-linear).
   The aim of this paper is to test these two hypotheses by examining the responses of the human inhabitants of mountain regions to the changing environments in which they live. The conceptual framework is based in Cultural Theory, which posits a complex plurality of states, defined in terms of four 'myths of nature', each embodying a different set of assumptions about stability and change in nature. They can be described as Nature Benign (cf. individualism, neo-classical economics); Nature Ephemeral (cf. egalitarianism, the precautionary principle, Georgescu-Roegen's entropy principle, Schumacher's dictum 'small is beautiful'); Nature Perverse/Tolerant (cf. hierarchies, statutory regulation, sustainable development); and Nature Capricious (cf. fatalism: 'why bother?').
   This conceptual framework is applied to 'typical' Himalayan villages, the institutional systems in a 'typical' Swiss Alpine village, and the past seven centuries in the Swiss community of Davos. It is concluded that a simple model of unidirectional change does not explain the variety of institutional responses to either the biophysical or the socio-economic surprises which such mountain communities experience; a requisite variety of diverse institutional responses to surprise is always necessary.

   management
AB Strategic management is defined as the system of action programs which form sustainable competitive advantages for a corporation, its divisions, and its business units in a strategic planning period.
   We have developed a system called Woodstrat to serve as a support system for these action program activities on both the corporate, the divisional, and the business unit levels. The system is modular and is built around the logic of strategic management, i.e., the main modules cover the market position; the competitive position; the production position; and the profitability, investment, and financing positions. The innovation in Woodstrat is that these modules are linked together, i.e., when a strong market position is built into some market segment, it will have an immediate impact on profitability through links running from the assumptions on an expected development to the projected profit/loss statement. There are similar links making the competitive position interact with the market position, and the production position interact with both the market and the competitive positions, and with the profitability and financing positions.
   The intermodular links are based on expert knowledge of strategic management; expert knowledge is also worked into the modules such that the logic of strategic management guides the user through the process of working out sustainable competitive advantages. The process is made user-supportive with a hyperknowledge user interface. The support is made intuitive and effective with the use of object-oriented expert system technology. The basis for this is rather unusual: the Woodstrat system was built with Visual Basic, in which the objects to create a hyperknowledge environment were built.
   It is shown that the conceptual constructs which form strategic management can be described with cognitive maps, and that these can be adequately represented with our hyperknowledge objects. It is also shown that the knowledge formation which takes place in a management team when strategic plans are formed can be described and validated with a hyperknowledge support system. It is finally shown that a support system with hyperknowledge features, which are close to the cognitive maps of a management team, will have a profound impact on the depth and the structure of its strategic management processes.

TI Beyond greening: Strategies for a sustainable world
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Three decades into the environmental revolution, many companies in the industrialized nations have recognized that they can reduce pollution and increase profits at the same time, But beyond corporate ''greening'' lies the enormous challenge- and opportunity to develop a sustainable global economy, one that the planet is capable of supporting indefinitely.
   Stuart Hart, director of the Corporate Environmental Management Program at the University of Michigan School of Business, explains the imperative of sustainable development and provides a framework for identifying the business opportunities behind sustainability. The dangers today are clear: exploding population growth, rapid depletion of resources, and ever more industrialization and urbanization are creating a terrible environmental burden.
   Companies normally frame greening in terms of risk reduction, reengineering, or cost cutting. But, says Hart, when greening becomes part of strategy, opportunities of potentially staggering proportions open up. A number of companies are moving in that direction. BASF, for example, is colocating plants to make the recycling of waste feasible, and Xerox is reusing parts from leased copiers on new machines.
   Hart identifies three stages of environmental strategy: pollution prevention, product stewardship, and the development of clean technology. But companies will not benefit from such efforts unless they draw a road map that can show them how new products and services must evolve and what competencies they will need. Businesses that create a vision of sustainability will be ready to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the need for a sustainable global economy.

AB Health outcomes in populations are the product of three factors: (1) the size of effect of the intervention; (2) the reach or penetration of an intervention into a population and (3) the sustainability of the effect. The last factor is crucial. In recent years, many health promotion workers have moved the focus of their efforts away from the immediate population group or environment of interest towards making other health workers and other organisations responsible for, and more capable of, conducting health promotion programs, maintaining those programs and initiating others. 'Capacity-building' by health promotion workers, to enhance the capacity of the system to prolong and multiply health effects thus represents a 'value added' dimension to the health outcomes offered by any particular health promotion program.
   The value of this activity will become apparent in the long term, with methods to detect multiple types of health outcomes. But in the short term its value will be difficult to assess unless we devise specific measures to detect it. At present the term 'capacity-building' is conceptualised and assessed in different ways in the health promotion literature. Development of reliable indicators of capacity-building which could be used both in program planning and in program evaluation will need to take this into account. Such work will provide health-decision makers with information about program potential at the conclusion of the funding period, which could be factored into resource allocation decisions, in addition to the usual information about a program's impact on health outcomes. By program potential, we mean ability to reap greater and wider health gains.

TI Eucalyptus water use greater than rainfall input-a possible explanation
   from southern India
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Hydrological and silvicultural studies carried out in southern India on the effects of plantations of Eucalyptus and other fast growing exotic tree species have determined the impacts of these plantations on water resources, erosion, soil nutrient status and growth rates at sites of differing rainfall and soil depth in Karnataka. Whilst providing new information on these issues, the studies also raised two important questions: what was the explanation for the anomalous result that the water use of 3400 mm from Eucalyptus plantations at Hosakote over a three year period exceeded the rainfall of 2100 mm over the same period and why were growth rates of woodlots on most farmer's fields higher than those of plantations on land owned by the Karnataka Forest Department? The records of the soil moisture depletion patterns under these plantations from the day of planting provide the basis for the answers to both questions: i) whilst roots are penetrating into deeper soil layers, they are able to extract from a reservoir of water additional to that available from the rainfall each year, ii) farmer's land on which short rooted agricultural crops have been grown previously is likely to have a much higher soil water status than land previously under forest or scrub vegetation. These new studies have also established that the development of the drying front under the Eucalyptus camaldulensis plantations is very rapid, indicating average root extension rates in excess of 2.5 m per year, whilst those under Tectona grandis and Artocarpus heterophyllus advanced at approximately half the rate. These results have obvious implications for the long term sustainability of growth rates from these plantations and the recharge of groundwater.
   The authors believe that this study may be the first to report neutron probe soil moisture depletion observations, from the date of planting, beneath tree plantations in a dry climate. The extent to which the roots were able to penetrate raises the question of whether other studies, which have estimated water use from soil moisture observations in dry climates, may have seriously underestimated both the actual soil moisture depletion and the water use through having soil moisture measurements located to insufficient depth.

AB The heat shock (HS) response in callus cultures of the ornamental plant Gerbera jamesonii H. Bolus var. hybrida was analyzed. A HS at 35 degrees C or 40 degrees C for 4 h induced (a) the synthesis of several heat shock proteins (HSPs), especially in the small molecular weight range and some spots corresponding to HSP70 components, and (b) an increase in the steady state levels of some specific mRNAs. At the nonstressing temperature (26 degrees C), a sustainable level of translation for HSP70 was indeed carried out, as confirmed by immunological analysis with a monoclonal antibody against cotton HSP70. The steady state levels of mRNAs measured before and after a HS by Northern hybridization showed an increase with the heterologous probes HSP17.4, HSP17.6, and HSP21, whereas the probes HSC70 and HSP70 did not show any difference between the levels of control and HS-mRNAs. A pretreatment at 35 degrees C, which induced a set of HSPs in the callus cultures, decreased the cell damage upon exposure to a temperature of 45 degrees C as determined either with a regrowth test or by the tetrazolium reduction assay. Typically, as with the whole plants, callus cultures of Gerbera jamesonii possessed the ability to respond to HS both by inducing HSPs and by developing an acquired thermotolerance.

AB Outlines sustainable humanitarian demining procedures and some of the breaching and post-conflict demining equipment currently in use. Explains that several projects have proposed the use of autonomous robots to search for anti-personnel mines. However, none has solved the problem which exists on the sensor side,and it will take several years before a combination of sensors will be available and sufficiently tested in order to give lull confidence that all the mines have been discovered. Describes the major problems facing humanitarian deminers, including the need for cost-effectiveness and the difficulty of defining the precise boundaries of suspected minefields.

AB The Industrial Revolution transformed society and its interaction with the environment, increasing the use of natural resources and the pace of development of new products and processes. This has left permanent changes in the structure of society and also on the earth through depletion of resources, alteration of natural habitats and pollution from unwanted by-products of the production process and discarded products at the end of their useful life. Recently, concern for the environment has led manufacturing industry to take a proactive role in the development of cleaner manufacturing processes and the design of recyclable products. The goal is sustainable development, where the waste from one process becomes the raw material for another in a large cycle which imitates the natural food chain.
   This paper outlines the requirements for such sustainable development, and gives an example of the elimination of unwanted by-product through the use of dry cutting.

TI Agricultural education at the crossroads: Present dilemmas and possible
   options for the future in sub-Saharan Africa
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Agricultural Education and Training (AET) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) needs to respond; to the many changes in the socio-economic and political environments within which it exists. In addition to these, there are marked changes in the concept of 'agriculture' itself, which is increasingly seen in terms of broader notions of renewable natural resource management, with increasing emphasis on integrated systems and sustainable production.
   Traditional forms of AET are also challenged by new ideas about the process of teaching and learning, including soft-systems thinking, participatory rural appraisal and farmer-to-farmer extension; as well as the emergence of new modes of learning (including distance learning). Current moves towards privatisation also mean that there is increasing prominence given to new and more flexible providers such as NGOs, parastatal bodies and agribusinesses. All these factors are leading to calls for adaptation, innovation and diversification in systems which have been marked by their lack of responsiveness in the past.
   Dilemmas which now face the AET sector include changing patterns of donor support, the emergence of new training needs and new types of audiences. The paper examines a range of issues, including the lack of labour market and training needs identification studies, the need for more relevant and responsive curricula, the key role of staff development in creating 'learning organisations', the need for a strategy of developing linkages and learning webs or networks and for far more sustainable donor interventions. Finally there is a lack of a coherent policy framework for AET in most countries in the region.
   A number of options are discussed, such as rationalisation, including achieving a better balance between public and private sector provision, the adoption of new aims and learning styles at all levels, catering for the needs of new target audiences and enhancing innovation and relevance in curriculum.
   Some important prerequisites for such changes are highlighted and include political will and commitment, consensus and popular support, entrepreneurial leadership, a balance between responsiveness and stability and the targeting of financial and other forms of support to enable sustainable models of innovation to emerge.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION

DE joint implementation
AB More than 150 countries are now party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), which seeks, as its ultimate objective, to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. As a step toward this goal, all Parties are to take measures to mitigate climate change and to promote and cooperate in the development and diffusion of technologies and practices that control or reduce emissions and enhance sinks of greenhouse gases.
   In the US, efforts between countries or entities within them to reduce net GHG emissions undertaken cooperatively, called joint implementation (JI), hold significant potential both for combatting the threat of global warming and for promoting sustainable development. To develop and operationalize the JI concept, the US launched its Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) in October 1993, and designed the programme to attract private sector resources and to encourage the diffusion of innovative technologies to mitigate climate change.
   The USIJI provides a mechanism for investments by US entities in projects to reduce GHG emissions worldwide and has developed a set of criteria for evaluating proposed projects for their potential. The criteria are designed to identify and allow the USIJI to 'accept' projects that:
   Support the development goals of the host country while providing greenhouse gas and other environmental benefits;
   Produce measurable reductions in addition to reductions that would have been achieved in the absence of the project;
   Can be monitored and tracked;
   Will not result in net greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere or otherwise have significant secondary environmental impacts;
   Have enduring impact.
   To date, the USIJI has received more than 80 project proposals, of which 25 have been accepted. These projects represent a diverse set of innovative technologies and practices in 11 countries, and include projects developing renewable energy sources such as solar, biomass, and hydroelectric power, and land-use change projects leading to better forest management, reforestation and afforestation.
   Aggregating preliminary estimates presented to the USIJI by project developers suggests that cumulative net emission reductions as a result of these projects are expected to be over 30 million metric tons of carbon (mt C) equivalent. While the USIJI does not certify project estimates prospectively, it does set forth provisions for monitoring and verifying emissions reductions as they occur. Furthermore, accepted projects, when fully implemented, are expected to lead to significant financial and technical investments in host countries.
   Additional proposals considered by the USIJI include submissions for projects in such other technical areas as methane reduction from livestock and waste treatment. Some of these proposals were withdrawn and others were not accepted. However, most of these proposals have been placed 'In Development' and will receive limited technical support in order to assist them in fully meeting USIJI criteria for acceptance.
   To test the USIJI criteria and to provide input into the international pilot phase, the US intends to promote the development of other 'acceptable' projects, and to seek additional information on the experience of individual developers during project implementation. As a supplemental effort, the USIJI seeks to assist countries in developing their national joint implementation programmes and to this end not only has developed a domestic outreach effort, but also sponsors regular international workshops, produces a USIJI newsletter, and maintains a Home Page on the World Wide Web.

ID SCARCITY
AB This policy study placed population policies into the wider context of North-South relations and sustainable development policies by presenting four perspectives regarding this topic: The Lipservice for Solidarity Perspective is characterized by well-meaning pledges and rhetoric by industrialized countries, but it lacks a serious follow-up; The Blame the Rich Perspective puts too much emphasis on individual women's reproductive rights and industrialized countries' policy failures, while it tends to overlook ancient local constraints on women's empowerment, which are rooted in cultural and socioeconomic behavioural patterns and make exercising women's rights illusory; The Sustainable Development Perspective is considered to be on the right track, but population priorities tend to get lost among many other objectives; The Intergenerational Perspective is seen as the preferred analytical framework, because it focuses on collective aspects of the development process, and on the ecosystem's carrying capacity.

AB The world community faces a major challenge in addressing the implications of rapid global population growth. The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development responded by reaffirming that population growth, development and the environment are closely interrelated. It adopted a Programme of Action, which goes beyond the traditional exclusive focus on demographics, and places population issues in the context of women's empowerment, sustained economic growth and sustainable development, and rejects coercion in population policies and programmes. The Programme of Action calls upon states to establish and implement national policies and plans of action to address population and development issues. It also underscores the need for increased international cooperation to achieve the objectives and goals set out in the Programme of Action.

AB Strategies to limit the detrimental impact of human population growth must seek not only to limit the number of humans on the planet but also to provide for the preservation of the biological diversity that population growth threatens to destroy. Balancing human numbers with biological support systems is the kev to finding a sustainable furure. Efforts to protect biological diversity can further the population debate by identifying the real effects and limits of population growth, and by identifying the relationship between biological degradation and human population growth.

AB Aldous Huxley said 'All great truths begin as heresy.' It is important for every generationm to ask heretical questions. Some of the current heretical questions in the West have to do with 'growth' - both of the economy and of population. The question of growth gives rise to such other questions as sustainablity, immigration and carrying capacity.

DE scenarios; sustainable transport
AB Current trends in transport indicate that the system is moving away from a sustainable development (e.g., due to rising CO2 emissions), and that major changes in technology and public policy, as well as in the behaviour of individuals, are necessary to make the transport system more compatible with environmental sustainability. This indicates the need to assess a set of future images for transport in relation to the environment. In this paper, reference and expert scenarios, which can act as a judgement framework for a sustainable transport system, are constructed on the basis of the recently developed 'spider model'. Based on a set of distinct characteristics of a transport system, represented by eight axes in the spatial, institutional, economic and social-psychological field, an evaluation framework is constructed, which visualizes the driving forces that largely influence the future of the transport system. There are several directions in which these factors may develop, and each of them will separately or in combination lead to entirely different transport systems. In this way, many scenarios can be constructed by connecting points on the successive axes. Such scenarios may range from market-oriented to regulatory pictures; the first may lead to a transport system in which individual, the second in which collective modes of transport dominate.
   Next, expected and desired scenarios are constructed from the opinions of Dutch transport experts, who responded to a nationwide survey. The expected scenario indicates that many current trends will continue, while the transport system is largely the same as the current one. The desired scenario, on the other hand, gives a more collective system, in which also many new modes are operating. The conclusion is that there are many roads for achieving a sustainable transport system, but that whichever one is chosen, it will be hard to follow.

Mexico City's experience with vehicle use restrictions is described and its failure analysed. It is argued that Mexico City took a step in the right direction, but failed to make the restrictions flexible, thereby making the policy perverse. A programme of tradable vehicle use permits is presented and described that would provide the needed flexibility and promote urban sustainability.

AB The aim of the work reported is to support regional planning tasks by providing co-workers who are situated at different locations with access to a GIS. Five technical challenges for application sharing are identified: multiple views, multi-user access, feedback about other users' activities, conference management facilities and sustainable performance. A system is presented which re-uses an existing single-user GIS and encompasses a User Interface Management System (UIMS), knowledge-based techniques and agent support for group-work. This novel approach offers a solution to the technical challenges, while enhancing the usability of such systems.

ID DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
AB The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how the use of a participatory health care management and problem-related research methodology may help strengthen health service management and the capacities of local health care personnel. The text refers to five studies carried out in three Bolivian health districts from 1993-1995, in an Operational Research Project, conducted by an Italian N.G.O. (Cooperazione Internazionale) in agreement with the local Ministry of Health and P.A.H.O./W.H.O. The object of these studies was to assess the main problems in health care delivery and to define and implement appropriate solutions. The studies utilized a methodology based on the principles of operational research and continuous quality improvement. During the process some positive aspects and difficulties were met. The positive aspects were: the applied character of the research focused on the solution of a problem; the study of a problem related to health service management; the use of modern and simple techniques adapted to local knowledge; on-the-job training of health care personnel during the research process, Lack of a generic 'culture of research' and poor health personnel training were the main difficulties encountered. National health authorities should take these points into account to define or readjust policies on health service research, health workers' academic education and in-service training. Insisting on developing human resources and allowing them to achieve and expand their potential is the key factor for getting developing countries out of their current crisis and toward reaching a truly human and sustainable development.

DE capability; lead time; kaizen success level; 5S movement; 4M scheme
AB Continuous-improvement processes (CIP) are fostering the capability of companies. Capability itself is determined by three elements: climate, competence and capacity and each of these is measurable by indicators. Such improvement in capability is the central goal for CIP. The CIP approach of Mercedes-Benz's Sindelfingen Plant is dedicated to achieving a substantial logistics improvement in the first phases of a CIP project. During these phases positive improvements for time and costs have been realized. Moving further ahead requires other elements (e.g. human-orientated ones) to be involved. Thus sustainable kaizen success levels are built up. They are helping to attain a better position in different markets than other competitors.

AB In an age of discontinuity, one of the few sources of sustainable competitive advantage remains in the ability of companies to innovate their products effectively. As innovative processes for products become more frequent and strategically relevant, long-term competitiveness compels firms to exploit synergy and learning among projects. In fact, mastering the overall process of knowledge creation, dissemination and application is the basis for creating and continuously improving a capability in product development. Learning through sequences of unique innovations, however, is neither simple nor natural, but requires adequate enabling mechanisms. This paper proposes an interpretative model of learning in product innovation. The objective is to identify the barriers that inhibit learning and the main enabling mechanisms to overcome them. The application of these mechanisms and their effects on a firm's performance are discussed on the basis of the results of research involving nineteen case studies of Italian and Swedish companies.

AB The National Research Council recently published a report calling for a three-part strategy to improve the quality of water service in small communities. The strategy, outlined in this article, involves improving the sustainability of financing and management of small water systems, enhancing the training of small system operators, and reducing duplication of costly pilot testing efforts for small system technologies. These steps correlate to key provisions of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act amendments and should assist the US Environmental Protection Agency, states, and water utilities with implementing those amendments.

DE HIV/AIDS pandemic; international collaboration; program integration
AB As the epicenter of the HIV/AIDS pandemic shifts from Africa to Asia, Japan is becoming ever more aware of the importance of containing and preventing spread of the virus. International collaboration, particularly with the United States, is a logical approach because it allows utilization of expertise from countries in other stages of the pandemic, can prevent duplication of efforts, and complements efforts of the other countries. Further, both Japan and the United States can use their combined influence and prestige to encourage cooperation among all nations. In 1994, Japan established the Global Issues Initiative to extend cooperation to developing countries in the areas of population and AIDS control. It has disbursed more than $460 million (U.S.$) to promote active cooperation and stimulate international attention to the importance of addressing these health issues. Japan has established four main programs for international collaboration for control of HIV and AIDS, three operated by ministries and one by a Japanese nongovernmental organization. Japanese/United States collaboration is developing through the United States/Japan Cooperative Medical Sciences Program, the Common Agenda for Cooperation in Global Perspective, the Paris Summit, and the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS. It is critical that Japan and the United States, as the two largest donors to international development, demonstrate, through their collaboration, ways to maximize the use of limited resources, reduce duplication, and promote sustainable development programs in which HIV prevention and AIDS care programs are systemically integrated.

AB The Green Revolution in India which was heralded in the 1960's was a mixed blessing. Ambitious use of agro-chemicals boosted food production but also destroyed the agricultural ecosystem. Of late Indian farmers and agricultural scientists have realized this and are anxious to find alternatives - perhaps a non-chemical agriculture - and have even revived their age-old traditional techniques of natural fanning. Scientists are working to find economically cheaper and ecologically safer alternatives to agro-chemicals. Blue-Green Algae Biofertilizers, Earthworm Vermicomposts (Vermiculture), biological control of pests and herbal biopesticides are showing promise. Saline agriculture and sewage farming are also being promoted in India to augment food production in the face of water scarcity. Then is a move to search for alternative foods, which are more nutritious, cheaper and have shorter harvest cycles. Farm and food policy in India has to change its outlook before then can be a second green revolution.

DE Sahel; nutrient balance; nitrogen; phosphorus; millet
ID WESTERN NIGERIA; SOIL
AB Millet cultivation in the Sahel may be unsustainable as it contributes to soil degradation, particularly via nun-lent depletion. The flow of nitrogen and phosphorus in millet cultivation has been assessed from empirical and literature data in order to construct a simple nutrient balance model. Whereas most nutrient balances refer to single fields, balances for a village territory have also been calculated. The results suggest that nitrogen and phosphorus are lost from fields, the amount depending on soil type and millet yield. With boundaries at the village territory, the balances show a negligible output of nitrogen and an input of phosphorus to the village. The combination of two different spatial scales suggests that millet cultivation is more sustainable than generally believed. Further, the balances serve to identify the important nutrient flows, and can be used as a tool in nutrient management. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited

AB Cattle, wildlife and mixed ranching in the semi-arid savannas of the Midlands Province of central Zimbabwe were compared. Revenue in cattle enterprises was derived mainly fi om beef cattle while most income in wildlife enterprises was from plains-game hunting. Cattle ranching became less profitable and wildlife ranching more profitable and widespread during the 1980s. The 1989/90 survey of 50 ranches found that, in areas with abundant wildlife, greatest net revenue ha(-1) was earned by mixed ranches. Profitability of wildlife ranching depended on access to off-ranch wildlife resources but lower capital requirements for wildlife enterprises resulted in less financial risk. The study did not support the claim that in semi-arid savannas wildlife ranching is more profitable than cattle ranching. It was concluded that Midlands ranchers would maximize their profits and spread risk by operating mixed ranches. Sustainable management of such multi-species animal production systems could be enhanced by the combination of individual management of cattle enterprises with a co-operative wildlife management scheme.

TI Chocolates El Rey: Industrial modernization and export strategy
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The introductory article to this special issue points out that export-oriented policies have proven superior to inward-oriented policies in delivering both long-term economic growth and quality of life indicators. One reason is that export-oriented policies demand economic liberalization as well as reductions in market distortions from import barriers, subsidies, and internal market inefficiencies. However, a number of management writers, including Porter, Michael E., The Competitive Advantage of Nations, Free Press, New York, (1990), have suggested thai factor costs and availability are not a sufficient basis for sustainable competitiveness in world markets. Nations will attain global competitive advantages to the extent that they are able to foster a spectrum of related industries led by companies possessing a broad set of managerial competencies. Understanding how world-class industries and companies develop remains one of the major research issues in public and corporate policy. This is even less well understood in the case of developing nations, because they have been less well researched and because most studies have focused on industry policy for newly industrializing countries (NICs) and highly industrialized nations. The dilemmas and decisions of Chocolates EI Rey and the Venezuelan cocoa industry richly illustrate the commitment required to achieve world-class competitiveness at company and industry levels. In the early 1990s, Venezuela began to open its economy and to encourage nontraditional exports. This transition came to an early halt as a result of a number of political scandals and public opinion backlash in a country accustomed to big government and managed markets. The policy reversals that followed have had a dismal effect on the Venezuelan economy, which has plunged from one crisis to another Nonetheless, there have been an increase in internal competition and a drive to increase nontraditional exports. Heightened competition has challenged Venezuelan companies to increase their capabilities, even if they do not enter international markets. Some companies simply have sold out to multinational firms. Others have attempted to develop into world-class competitors. For example, some have forged strategic alliances with multinational companies (see Ickis article in this issue). Some, as Chocolates El Rey, have attempted to go it alone. The Chocolates EI Rey case traces the efforts made by that company both to raise standards in the Venezuelan cocoa industry and to forge a niche for high-quality products in industrial markets. In those markets, there is a wide supply of high-quality goods, intense competition, and well-defined user preferences. Two of the major challenges set forth in the case are:
   Export Strategy: Which market segments to target, how to advantageously differentiate the company from entrenched competitors, how to distribute its products to the appropriate segments, what sort of presence to have in export markets, and what price to charge different channel members.
   Developing Brand Equity: How to overcome the negative image associated with goods from underdeveloped countries in such a way that an adequate market share may be achieved al profitable prices.
   The case lends itself to other teaching purposes as well. It illustrates the scape, uses, and limitations of market research; it also is good for a discussion of the company-level process of industrial reconversion in countries that are liberalizing their economies. The case also would be suited to a discussion of the effects of development policies on company and industry performance. The clouds that were gathering over the Venezuelan economy in 1994 raised once again the specter of renewed exchange control regimes and overvalued currencies that have plagued Venezuela's economy. An overvalued currency could greatly complicate El Rey's pricing in export markets. We hope that the case will encourage research on the development of brand equity (Aaker, D. G., Managing Brand Equity, Free Press, New York, 1991; Keller; K. L., Conceptualizing, Measuring and Managing Customer-based Brand Equity, Journal of Marketing 57 (January 1993): 1-22) by firms from less developed countries (LDCs). Venezuela's cocoa industry laced many of the same problems as other emerging industries; for example, the marketability of whose products is hampered by adverse consumer perceptions (Heslop, Louise A., and Papadopoulos, Nicholas, But who knows where and when: Reflections on the images of countries and their products, in Product-Country Images, International Business Press, New York, 1993; Samiee, Saeed, Customer evaluations of products in a global market J. Int. Bus. Stud. 25, mo. (1994):579-604). Venezuela as a tropical country is ideally suited to cocoa production. However, El Rey faced resistance from industrial customers and household consumers who did not associate Venezuela with the production of high-quality chocolate; in fact, there were negative perceptions that derived from Venezuela's industrial policy mistakes. The clue raises interesting issues about overcoming negative associations and determining which hinds of associations should be favored (e.g., whether functional or hedonic) in building brand equity with the trade. EI Rey's internationalization diverged from the notion of a process of incrementally deeper commitments to export markets in response to unsolicited initial orders and gradual learning. El Rey started out with a major investment in plant design, process improvements, and human resources, all in response to a vision and a strategic imperative identified by top management. Whereas early stages of internationalization are supposed to respond to importer pull, that is, to the needs and designs of developed-country exporters (Wortzel, L. H., and Vernon-Wortzel, H., Globalizing strategies for multinationals from developing countries. Columbia Journal of World Business (Spring 1988):27-35), El Ray contemplated immediately participating in the domestic channel in the United States with its own company and brand name identity.

AB The indiscriminate clearing of tropical rain forests poses a grave threat to sustainable development in Central America, lending to soil depletion, erosion, and the drying of streams and rivers. At risk are agricultural productivity and water supply, both essential for human survival. In the pace to build competitive industries and open trade barriers, these fundamental realities are sometimes forgotten. The Cerro Cahui case, set in Guatemala's El Peten region, offers a stark reminder that one qi the most difficult management challenges in Central America-and in all developing countries-is the management of natural resources. The causes of deforestation in Guatemala, as in other developing countries, are complex and interwoven into the political, economic, and cultural fabric of the society. The Cerra Cahui case enables us to understand the complex interrelationships ranging from contraband timber, to cattle ranchers, to drug lords, to the Guatemalan army, to members of the National Congress. But ii is not just the powerful who are responsible Landless farmers, driven from other provinces of Guatemala during the 1980s by the army's counterinsurgency campaigns, use slash-and-burn agriculture as a means of basic survival. It is in this context that Carlos Oliva, project director of a local environmental foundation, Fundary, must develop a strategy for saving a protected area known as Cerro Cahui, on the banks of Lake Peten Itza near the internationally lamed Mayan ruins of Tikal. He also is deeply concerned about raising the living standards of families in the three communities in buffer zones around Cerro Cahui, whose extreme poverty presents a striking contrast to the affluence in the nearby Camino Real Hotel. This tension that Mr. Oliva feels between the goals of natural resource conservation and socioeconomic development is perhaps the major issue in Central American development today. The Sustainable Development Project proposed by the Guatemalan Tourist Bureau, with its emphasis on ecological tourism, appears to offer the opportunity to address these goals simultaneously The foreign exchange earnings from ecologically conscious international visitors will create incentives to conserve the forest and wildlife resources rather than to exploit and deplete them, creating new jobs and bringing a new source of wealth to the impoverished buffer zone communities. A closer examination of the case reveals problems and threats in the implementation of the project, from the possible contamination of the lake ao the potential influx of a new wave of immigrants. Carlos Oliva faces the same management challenge that confronts many other directors of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) concerned with the preservation of tropical forests in Central America and other developing countries. It is a challenge of both design and implementation, in a highly convulsive-and dangerous-sociopolitical environment and with severe resource constraints. Most of these directors are biologists or zoologists with little or no management training to prepare them for the challenge Cases such as this one, prepared by INCAE's Program in Natural Resource Management, provides a useful basis for discussion and learning not only to NGO directors but also to public- and private-sector managers who play a role in the evolving drama in places such as El Peten.

AB As it moves to expand its product line to include oak doors, Portico, S.A., is weighing whether to continue using environmental certification of its forestry operations as an integral part of its corporate strategy. When its high-end, residential exterior-we doors were made from tropical mahogany, it was important to have environmental certification in order to avoid controversies about deforestation and to gain entry into important U.S. distribution channels. Now, however, Portico is questioning whether that strategy proved sufficiently beneficial to them to warrant pursuing the same certification for their new line of oak doors. Oak, after all, is not as controversial as tropical mahogany. Portico, S.A., located in Heredia, Costa Rica, manufactures high-end, residential exterior-use mahogany doors for export to the United States. Some of its mahogany is supplied by its subsidiary, Tecnoforest del Norte, established to oversee its natural mahogany forest acquired through a ''debt-for-nature'' swap in 1987. This operation had earned environmental certification from Scientific Certification Systems. By 1994, Portico's sales had grown to 60,000 units per year. The mahogany needed to satisfy the demand had been obtained by increasing the frequency of cutting in the managed forest and by introducing engineered wood technology (i.e., veneers and butcher-bloch interior pieces), which enabled Portico to continue making solid mahogany doors while wing the raw material in the most efficient manner. In 1994, Portico's management believed that there were significant business risks associated with increasing the company's investment in mahogany forests. Concurrently, the market for high-end exterior doors, both within and outside the United Stales, was growing. In order to expand its sales, the company would need to we an additional premium wood material, American Red Oak. This world also enable Portico to offer its customers doors made of both mahogany and oak, considered to be the best materials for premium exterior-use doors. Because Portico did not own forests of American Red Oak, it planned La purchase the oak in the United States, ship it to Costa Rica where the doors would be produced, and then reexport the finished doors to the United States and other markets. However, this oak did not carry an environmental certification. Portico's management felt that the environmental certification had been essential in helping them avoid controversies about tropical deforestation and gaining distribution through U.S. retail chains such as The Home Depot, but they wandered whether the same certification would be as important in the case of American Red Oak, an abundant species over which there had been little or no environmental controversy. This case includes strategic management issues about growth strategies and the inclusion of proactive environmental policies in corporate strategies and information on environmental issues and on the high-end residential exterior-use door market in the United States. Environmental information in the case includes descriptions of debt-for-nature swaps, tropical hardwood deforestation, sustainable logging, the history and status of logging in Costa Rica, natural forest management, and environmental certification under Scientific Certification Systems.

DE cooperative games; core; public goods; congestion; Lindahl equilibrium
AB This paper considers a public-good economy with congestion, where participants jointly produce a public good from input of a private good. This economic model gives rise to a transferable-utility game, the profit game, that depends on consumer preferences and a congestion parameter. The simplicity of the game allows the maximum level of congestion that guarantees the nonemptiness of the core of the economy to be determined. It is known that the sustainability of the Lindahl equilibrium in the core of the economy depends on the distribution of profits. In this paper two distributions of profits are compared: the Lindahl solution and the marginal-contribution solution. The latter is more often in the core than the Lindahl solution which in turn ''Lorenz-dominates'' the marginal-contribution solution.

TI Effects of participation in the Fifth Dimension on far transfer
SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The Fifth Dimension is a distributed literacy consortium comprised of after-school programs located in Boys and Girls Clubs, YM & YWCAs, recreation centers, and public schools across America, Mexico, Australia, Sweden, and Russia. The Fifth Dimension is also a mixed activity system designed to continue the projection of a second psychology [1] and to instantiate cultural-historical activity theory [2]. At the macro level the Fifth Dimension is a cultural system containing rules, artifacts, divisions of labor, and outcomes that appropriate local Fifth Dimension cultures. The four overarching goals of the Fifth Dimension are: 1) to create sustainable activity systems in different institutional settings that instantiate cultural-historical activity theory, 2) provide contexts for children to master knowledge and skills and acquire practices mediating cognitive and social development, 3) deepen our understanding of how the social and individual create each other, and 4) to provide a context in which undergraduates from disciplines such as developmental psychology, communications, and teacher education have opportunities to connect theory with practice and at the same time deliver community service to children in the local community.

ID INFORMATION
AB A Bayesian model for assessing uncertain and variable economics of proposed environmentally conscious and other manufacturing processes from available information is described in this paper. Economic risks may stem from environmental, health, and safety liabilities; potential product losses; and other intangibles. Benefits and costs may be uncertain due to lack of information and experience within the available time and budget, or may be inherently variable in nature. Bayesian inference allows the integrated use of available numeric data, related data, summary statistics, and professional judgment. The Principle of Maximum Entropy is used as a basis for incorporation of subjective information. A Bayesian Pareto incident-size distribution is used to model size distributions for individual costs. Sensitivity analysis is used to help identify primary elements of project economic risk. Probability distributions for planning period costs, exceedance probabilities, and other risk indicators for alternative paint-stripping projects were computed and compared for an example industrial facility. The relative importance of variability and uncertainty as a function of planning-period length is probed.

TI Soil environmental quality: A European perspective
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental quality is a major political concern in Europe and the important role of the soil is widely recognized. However, soil science still has an important role to play in translating good intentions into policies supporting the implementation of innovative soil management procedures that can ensure sustainable production systems in harmony with nature. Society is impatient and demands solutions from science. This could in time lead to only holistic, applied research that is not adequately supported by basic research. A plea is made for establishing research chains in which a holistic, interdisciplinary analysis of a problem to be studied is followed by reductionistic basic research in relevant areas. Results are again communicated to and analyzed by the holistic team to be integrated in the overall analysis. Two areas of particular concern in soil research are discussed: (i) the implications of variability in space and time on defining characteristic threshold values for environmental indicators, and (ii) providing data to economists, which will allow them to express environmental effects of soil management practices in monetary terms.

ID INTERGENERATIONAL PROGRAM; OLDER; ADOLESCENTS; ATTITUDES; SCHOOL
AB Community service-learning in schools, and increased awareness of the interdependence of generations, has heightened interest in intergenerational programming. While there is agreement that service-learning results in substantial educational opportunities, too often the result is training, or reflection, but not pro-active aging education. Students, therefore, have little sustainable understanding of the older adults with whom they are interacting. This paper addresses what aging education should include, why it is not consistently being taught, and how to integrate aging education into already existing curricula and age-appropriate skill development.

AB Corporate downsizing has destroyed millions of well-paying jobs just in the USA. The psychological, medical, and social costs are staggering. Families are fragmented, communities impoverished, democracies weakened by oligopolistic, plutocratic corporarchies, and Third World nations recolonized and their subsistence economies decimated. Most of the employee survivors of this economic and class warfare are working longer and harder and are suffering various stress, burnout; and psychiatric symptoms. In addition to intense global competition cheap foreign labour, and superefficient technologies, there are psychocultural factors contributing to the ''jobless economy'': executive ambition, greed, power-lust, and winner-take-all ideologies. Solutions include changes in tax and other federal policies, restrict-ive corporate charters, shorter workweeks, community development programmes, and co-operative, employee-owned enterprises. The learning organization and fourth-wave business suggest an evolutionary paradigm for the twenty-first century based on global responsibility, economic justice, a new bottom line, and a restoration of meaningful, sustainable work.

AB Tylophora indica (Burm.f.) Merr (syn. T. asthmatica), is being indiscriminately collected for medicinal use which is not sustainable. Conservation of the species requires information on existing genetic content and its distribution in different populations. In the present study, polymorphism in allozyme and RAPD profiles of five populations were analysed using six enzyme systems and ten random primers. Genetic content in terms of allozymes and RAPDs as revealed by Shannon-Weiner index was more or less same in all the populations. Evenness as calculated from observed diversity (Shannon-Weiner index, H') and the maximum expected diversity (H-max) for the allozymes and RAPDs was high for individual populations indicating that the distribution of genetic content was fairly uniform. From the results, it was concluded that collection of few genotypes from geographically distinct locations rather than intensive collection within one or two locations would be representative of the genetic variability present in this species.

TI Effect of rice hull ash silicon on rice seedling growth
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
LA English
DT Article
AB Silicon (Si) promotes healthy development of rice plants. Research has shown that an adequate supply of Si to rice plants improves the plant resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses such as soil aluminum (Al) and manganese (Mn) toxicities and plant pest and diseases. Rice hull, a major by-product of rice milling, contains about 8% Si that can be recycled for use in a sustainable rice cultivation system. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the effect of Si from rice hull ash (RHA) on the growth of rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings. Rice hull ash was applied to two Malawian nice cultivars grown on three soil types at the rate of 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 kg . m(2). The RHA-treated seedlings produced (average of all treated seedlings) more dry matter (18%) over the untreated seedlings. The treated seedlings also reduced the uptake of N (16.4%), Al (20%), and Mn (34%), but increased uptake of P (7.7%), K (20%), and Si (100%) by shoots than the untreated seedlings. The effects of rice cultivars and soils on the seedling growth were not significant. The RHA application to rice nurseries seems to be an efficient way of recycling plant Si and have agronomic and environmental benefits, especially in developing countries.

AB As the nations of the world continue to develop, their industrialization and growing populations will require increasing amounts of energy. Yet, global energy consumption, even at present levels, is already giving rise to concerns over both the security of future supplies and the attendant problems of environmental degradation. Thus, a major objective for the energy industry -- in all its sectors -- is to develop procedures so that the burgeoning demand for energy can be tolerated without exhaustion of the planet's resources, and without further deterioration of the global ecosystem. A step in the right direction is to place lead/acid batteries -- serviceable, efficient and clean technology -- at the cutting edge of energy strategies, regardless of the relatively low price of such traditional fuels as coal, mineral oil and natural gas.

DT Article
AB A significant number of recent papers and research reports in the U.K. have focused attention on the 'alternative way' of reducing the pressures borne by social housing providers in the face of public spending cuts. By exploiting aspects of the land-use planning system, it is possible to lower land prices in certain circumstances and therefore reduce producer costs. As well as exploring the strategy in general terms, this paper considers the operation of this 'alternative way' in rural Wales and asks the following questions: is this strategy numerically significant (in terms of the number of units added to the rural housing stock); how has the strategy helped shape the relationship between voluntary and public sector housing agencies and, is the strategy sustainable, particularly in the context of the Government's new Housing Act?

TI Rural development in the context of conflictual resource usage
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper examines the role of aquaculture in sustainable development of rural communities. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, aquaculture is the fastest growing sector in the food sector, and the only growing component in the fisheries. It offers year-round jobs and incomes. However With its agricultural focus on 'enclosing' waterways, aquaculture is frequently opposed by the traditional fishery, and residential property owners. Their opposition may succeed in banning aquaculture. This paper, recognizing that aquaculture may produce conflicting rights and damage to other users, suggests that mutual economic and environmental interactions should be identified. This will permit a more holistic approach to coastal management. Regulations can be imposed to mitigate adverse environmental repercussions, and a cost-benefit study made to clarify socio-economic impacts. Cage culture of salmon in the Bay of Fundy in Atlantic North America is used to illustrate conflictual relationships, but the illustration could have come from Galicia in Spain, or the Tenth Region in Chile.

ID INTEGRATION; PERSPECTIVE; FIRM
AB This study demonstrates that a recent development in the strategic management literature, the resource-based view of the firm, has great utility for furthering our understanding of sport sponsorship. The paper provides a theoretical framework to explain the application of the approach to sponsorship. Illustration and greater insight are then provided through the presentation of two case studies. These are used to identify the salient characteristics of agreements made by two international companies, each of which has been extensively involved in sport sponsorship but with varying degrees of success. The resource-based approach is used to demonstrate that the disparate returns of the companies' sponsorship investments could have been anticipated. As such, as well as providing a conceptual extension to the sponsorship literature, the paper also offers a route for more empirical analyses of potential sponsorship opportunities.

AB A study was conducted in 1993 to determine the roles of Nigerian women in promoting sustainable agricultural production. Seventeen states selected from different agro-ecological zones of the country were involved.
   The results showed that over 90% of the women were involved ire farming even in the traditionally Muslim states where purdah is still practiced. About 64% of this number were involved in only crop production, 48% in both crop and livestock production and only about 4% in just livestock production. Most of the women were involved in processing and marketing. With little control over their labour, rural women worked in both family and personal farms. The results also indicated that women farmers were actively involved in all cultural farming operations, although to a lesser extent in land clearing (12%) and land preparation (18.6%) in family farms. They were highly involved in planting, weeding, fertilizing, and totally responsible for processing, with little or no appropriate labour-saving devices and technologies to employ in these labour-demanding and time-consuming tasks.
   The rural women did not have adequate security for farming. The majority neither owned nor possessed land, did not have adequate funds for farming and those who engaged in paid jobs were paid less than men for the same piece of work. Although women now grow practically all crops including ''male crops,'' they were still not encouraged to grow tree crops so that they would not ''feel'' like land owners. Although women did most of the farm work, it was men that made decisions on what to grow and inputs to use. Men also controlled the proceeds from the family farms. Although women were willing to practice some techniques that encourage sustainable agriculture they did not have adequate knowledge about them.
   The paper concludes that the state of the act as it is presently does not encourage sustainable agricultural production. Ways of facilitating sustainable productions like giving women control over land and generally empowering them were suggested. These could help make farming integrated and resources used more effectively.

AB This paper examines the results of an evaluation of a training conference in sustainable agriculture for New England extension agents. The results of a survey of participants revealed a polarization among agents in their attitudes and knowledge about sustainable agriculture and participatory learning. These differences in attitudes and knowledge, in turn, had a large effect upon the usefulness and impact of the training. The results indicate that agents with differing attitudes and knowledge have different training needs and that the approach using a single training format for ail agents needs to be reconsidered. It concludes with recommendations to planners of future conferences and suggestions of further research.

TI Factors affecting plant height and yield of eggplant
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID ROOT
AB Examination of the interaction of environment and cultural methods will lead to a better understanding of the development of eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) and contribute to sustained yield. Seedlings were transplanted on 16 April 1991 and 21 July 1992 into soil left bare or treated with black spray-on or black plastic mulch. Plant height, and total and marketable fruit yield were correlated with number of days following transplanting, air temperature (high and low), soil. temperature, soil moisture, and soil CO2 levels. In 1991, weekly yields fluctuated, but total marketable yield was not affected by mulching. In 1992, yields were highest on black plastic mulch. Model R-2 values for height and yield ranged from 0.607 to 0.971, and 0.503 to 0.962, in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Days following transplanting was generally negatively correlated in 1991, but generally positively correlated in 1992 with plant height and yield. In 1991, air temperature was the most important of the few factors affecting height and yield. In 1992, few factors affected plant height, but many factors interacted to affect yield. Cultural methods that reduce fluctuations and insure sustainability of yield can be developed from this information.

TI Structural adaptation of human settlements to climate for sustainable
   agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB In their pursuit for sustainable agriculture, populations are increasingly searching for efficient utilization of resources. History suggests that human settlements actually become more sustainable when they adapt to climatic conditions confronting them. They develop built-in institutional adjustments for yielding maximum benefit from resources to achieve sustainable agriculture by converting externalities that become invisibles in market transactions, such as climate, family, and insurance, to become integral inputs in the production of agriculture. Therefore, efficient utilization can only become effective in the long run if it can promote sustainable practices which can adequately link output, technological change, and resources. After examining three alternative links among these aspects, simultaneous action is suggested on two fronts. They are: (a) costs of adjustments must be paid for in their entirety, and (b) changes to resource utilization must be accompanied by institutional adjustments.

TI Soil quality and soil productivity in Africa
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB More than four decades of research and development work in Africa have not resulted in the 3-5% annual increase in agricultural growth necessary for most African countries to ensure sustainability of agriculture and the promise of food security in the next decade. The present study evaluates the quality of the soil resource base of Africa and also the risks to sustainable agriculture and soil productivity on a continent-wide basis. Fifty-five percent of the land in Africa is unsuitable for any kind of agriculture except nomadic grazing. These are largely the deserts, which includes salt flats, dune and rock lands, and the steep to very steep lands. Though these lands have constraints to sustainability, about 30% of the population or about 250 million people are living, or are dependent on these land resources. About 16% of the land has soils of high quality and about 13% has soils of medium quality. This 9 million km(2) of land in Africa currently supports about 400 million or about 45% of the people. There are compelling reasons for African nations to return to fundamentals in terms of research and developmental initiatives. Those countries with subsistence agriculture have had minimal inputs in acquiring and managing information about their resource conditions. The green revolution succeeded in Asia in those countries where there was a serious effort to match technology with resource conditions and where advances in development and use of high-yielding cultivars was accompanied by appropriate soil, water, and nutrient management.

ID AGROECOSYSTEMS; LANDSCAPE
AB This study analyzes human labor as a renewable resource to develop sustainable agriculture by taking examples from a regional landscape of the Central Himalaya. The technology level in agricultural systems of the studied region (Kumaun) differs with change in the major landforms, viz., traditional in mountain, transitional in the foothill belt, and modern in the adjacent alluvial plain. Human labor contributes 63-65% of the total power in traditional agriculture, about 30% in transitional agriculture, and 8% in modern agriculture. Contribution of human labor input to the total energy input decreases towards the modernization. In traditional agriculture, more time was devoted to yield collection and soil preparation operations. Human labor efficiency increased towards the modernization. With labor saving devices, human labor in transitional agriculture was more efficient than in modem agriculture. Using manpower as a renewable resource, with a suitable framework of technology, can be a useful tool in sustainable agriculture.

TI Yield limiting factors to food barley production in Ethiopia
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Most previous studies conducted to examine food barley production constraints in Ethiopia were single factor experiments and unsuitable to determine the relative importance of various factors and interactions among these factors. To develop sustainable food systems in regions with limited resources, it is essential to understand the relative importance of alternative production inputs and their interactions. A replicated 2(5) factorial experiment examined the effects of cultivar, fertilizer, weeding, fungicide, and seed dressing on food barley production under local and recommended practices at the Holetta Research Center in 1987 and 1988. Results indicate that poor soil fertility is a major constraint to food barley production followed by weed competition, then by shootfly incidence. Cultivar choice and fungicide spray appear to be relatively less important. A combination of higher input levels and their positive interactions demonstrated the beneficial effect of combining improved production practices in one cultural package where adequate resources are available. Future research needs to give high priority to improvement of soil fertility, minimum weed competition and use of landraces to develop resistant cultivars to shootfly and diseases. Special attention must be placed on those practices and systems that maximize the use of internal, renewable resources, and to convincing researchers, growers, and policy makers that long-term sustainability must take precedence over shortterm, single factor production enhancement initiatives.

ID SOIL-TEMPERATURE; YIELD; MOISTURE
AB The effect of sorghum stover and tree leaf mulches on seed yields and yield components of maize (Zea mays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), and sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) crops in tied ridges were studied under rainfed conditions at Chiredzi Research Station in 1993/94 and 1994/95 seasons. Mulching significantly increased maize seed and stover yields by 26% in 1993/94 and showed some improvement in total soil water content and water use efficiency over the control treatment in 1994/95 season. Seed yield of sunflower was significantly correlated (r=0.55) to cumulative soil water content in 1994/95. Stover yield for sunflower was significantly correlated (r=0.60) to cumulative soil water content in 1994/95. The results from this study suggest that sorghum stover and dry tree leaf mulches had significant beneficial effects on maize performance in a year with good and well distributed rainfall whereas for sorghum and sunflower, the benefits were higher in the drier year.

AB Community support agriculture (CSA) is a form of direct marketing of agricultural products that can be an important facet of a more sustainable, locally based food system. This study estimates the probability of becoming a CSA member using a binomial legit regression model. Data were collected through phone interviews with members, ex-members, and non-members of three CSA farms in Vermont. Results indicate that price, productivity shifters, consumer beliefs, and awareness impact the probability of membership. Suggestions for target marketing to increase CSA membership are included.

AB The paper develops a theoretical framework to explain changes in crop genetic resources. For this purpose the genetic diversity of crop plants is treated as a social/natural co-construct of human beings in particular historical settings. To illustrate the potential of such an approach, the history of rapeseed (Brassica rapa L. and Brassica napus L.) breeding in Canada from 1954 to 1991 is examined. Pedigree and cluster analyses are used to evaluate the genetic diversity of rapeseed cultivars as well as its change through time. Relationships between the genetic diversity of crop plants and the ecological sustainability of agriculture are discussed.

AB Technological options available for increased millet production and productivity in the West and Central Africa are many in the National and International agricultural research institutions. Research information is available on the constraints associated with both the crop and the environment. Solutions in the form of improved technologies to several of these constraints are known. This paper addresses two fundamental questions:
   1. What is technology transfer? 2. How to transfer technologies to the farmers to promote sustained millet production in the semi-arid tropics?
   The research conducted by scientists in the millet research network (sensu late) is reviewed to partly answer the above questions. An indepth analysis of the achievements of the concepts involved in the process of technology transfer is presented to assess its implications both on NARS scientists research activities, farmers fields, and to identify critical elements for strategy development and implementation. The scope of the millet research network includes: technology transfer to farmers (appropriate varieties for respective production systems), development of improved insect control methods, control of mildew, and improvement of millet based cropping systems.
   The strategy or conceptual framework provides operational definitions of some key concepts involved in technology transfer namely: participation, collaboration, adoption, performance, and impact. These definitions involve shared values, expectations, competencies, ideas, resources, meaningful interactions, tension reduction/conflict resolution mechanisms, results, benefits shared among the various actors, and a clear vision of the future. All these factors can be pulled together to make up what is known as the technological transfer mix or the foundation of program impact planning and impact assessment.
   The paper concludes with a model based on the hypothetical relationships between the critical variables involved in explaining research performance and impact in transferring technologies to the farmers. The main concern and contribution of this paper is centered on construct discussion, and model operationalization for prediction purposes. These two notions are important in strategy development and impact assessment.

AB This study examines the economic feasibility of short-rotation intensive culture tree plantations as an alternative crop for farmers and ranchers in eastern Colorado. Numerous wood biomass production scenarios were evaluated using standard economic criteria. All scenarios gave negative economic results even when including a federal subsidy program. The best two scenarios, one irrigated and the other not, applied herbicides and fertilization, and produced wood chips as a product using a 10-year rotation. Compared with other studies land and harvest costs were proportionally less, however unit production costs were higher. The overall economic analysis was most sensitive to changes in yields and market prices. While the economic performance is marginal, rural landowners in eastern Colorado may still wish to consider these plantations given their substantial environmental and sustainability benefits. A reevaluation should be conducted if more comprehensive yield information becomes available or there are changes in technology or market opportunities.

AB A study on comprehensive sustainable development of dryland agriculture in Northwest China was conducted at Zhengyuan Dryland Agriculture Research Station from 1991 to 1995. The prototype system detailed in this paper, emphasizes a form of sustainable agriculture composed of a technical system for increased water use efficiency and a technical system for diverse crop products and by-products. Favorable results were obtained with the prototype system in the experimental and field site of 1000 hectares. The key features of the prototype system included selection for: drought resistance crops having low water requirement and high yield potential, intercropping systems with high yield and high benefit, a grain crop yield computer model, nutrient management with emphasis on fertilizer balance and water use efficiency, tillage management and polythene film mulching techniques, establishment of water storage tanks for harvesting runoff to provide life saving/critical irrigation, ammonia-treated wheat straw and silage (corn stem) as livestock forage, etc. Further research is required to techniques for water harvesting and critical irrigation and water budgeting under conditions with different crops, and for application of antitranspirants.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; ROOTS
AB A method is given to dynamically evaluate the physical aspects of Parr's SOIL QUALITY. Measurements of two main variables are found to be essential: OHI (Optimal Hydric Interval>, and RS (Relative Stability of the soil aggregates). The OHI is a range of the hydric content at which available water is easily used by crops, soil solid mass is capable of being drilled by roots and other useful organisms without offering great resistance, and aeration is non-limiting for breathing. The OHI reflects the properties of the ''porous structure'' of the soil relative to fluid motion and retention, and the consistency of its ped units. The RS informs about the relation of water infiltration capacity values, gaseous exchange, and resistance to erosion for a parcel of cultivated soil, in comparison with another parcel of the same soil kept untouched for a long time. Sensibility of both variables is illustrated through the analysis of real measurements taken in Argiudoll soils of the Argentine Pampean region.

TI A natural language parsing system for encoding admitting diagnoses
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Free-text or natural language documents make up an,increasing part of the computerized medical record While they do provide accessible clinical information to health care personnel, they fail to support processes that require clinical data coded according to a shared lexicon and data structure. We have developed a natural language parser that converts free-text admitting diagnoses into a coded form. This application has proven acceptably accurate in the experimental laboratory to warrant a test in the target clinical environment. Here we describe an approach to moving this research application into a production environment where it can contribute to the efforts of the Health Information Services Department. This transition is essential if the products of natural language understanding research are to contribute to patient care in a routine and sustainable way.

AB Pitaya (Stenocereus queretaroensis) is a columnar cactus that produces attractively colored edible fruits in both wild and cultivated populations in the subtropical semiarid lands of Mexico. Pitaya is a relatively recently domesticated fruit, which during the last 10 years has emerged as a fruit crop whose cultivation is feasible using relatively low inputs of anthropogenic energy or water and whose fruits ripen during the spring season, before summer when the local markets are flooded with other fresh summer fruits. These agronomic traits have increased the economic viability of small farms in semiarid subtropical lands of Mexico.
   This article summarizes the work on agroecological and biological aspects of Stenocereus queretaroensis conducted during the last seven years in the subtropical semiarid lands of the Sayula Basin, Jalisco, Mexico. Our work is oriented to the development of basic knowledge of the plant and its environment, which allowed us to define opportunities and needs for basic and applied research, oriented to the domestication of pitaya under the modern precepts of sustainable development.

AB The calcination of limestone is one of the oldest technical processes and it is still of actual interest. Very early calcitic mortars from Turkey have been investigated and compared with materials of other early civilisations i.e. with Egyptian mortars containing gypsum as well as medieval dolomite-based mortars from alpine regions. Contemporary calcination procedures, in particular the cement production, range among the most important global industrial processes causing non neglectable environmental problems. Sustainable, solar energy assisted calcination technologies and the conversion of product CO2, into useful commodities are discussed.

AB This paper discusses various issues involving EMU. In evaluating the potential benefits of EMU we stress that the elimination of asymmetric financial shocks enhances confidence in the sustainability of a well-functioning internal market. The convergence criteria reflect both the strong negotiating position and the lack of trust of the EU countries with strong financial discipline (and Germany in particular) vis-a-vis their potential EMU partners. Moreover, Germany has sought assurances from its potential EMU partners that they would keep to the rules after the single currency has been established. In this connection, we discuss two alternative ways to reconcile fiscal discipline with flexibility for member states to determine their fiscal policy at a decentralized level. The paper also discusses the relationship between the EU countries taking part in EMU immediately and the other EW countries that cannot or choose not to take part. Finally, we assess how EMU might affect the labor market, social security, and employment.

SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Hong Kong has a long history of creating urban land by reclamation, The leasehold system, coupled with the production of new land. is a major source of government revenue, The executive-led government's objective of economic growth, rather than improving the overall quality of life, to a large degree explains the reclamation strategy, This objective and the means of achieving it, are now being challenged by a democratizing Hong Kong society, The current controversy about the central harbour reclamation is a reflection of this, The paper argues that further large scale harbour reclamation is not sustainable, and recommends that the government work together with its citizens on an integrated urban development strategy comprising planning of the New Territories in the regional context.

AB This paper focuses on the application of sustainability concepts in Hong Kong, It briefly reviews the evolution of environmental management approaches in the territory and discusses the continuing tension that exists between the desire to promote economic growth and the need for the formulation of environmentally sustainable development strategies, The paper argues that sustainable development poses a particular challenge for Hong Kong because of the existing relationship between pollution control and environmental policy the way in which environmental matters are handled within government, and the limited extent of public consultation and accountability.

AB A procedure for dynamic optimization of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) for crop production in Controlled Ecological Life-Support Systems (CELSS) was developed using leaf lettuce as a model crop. Canopy Pn was measured in real time and fed back for environmental control. Setpoints of photosynthetic photon nux (PPF) and CO2 concentration for each hour of the crop-growth cycle were decided by computer to reach a targeted Pn each day. Decision making was based on empirical mathematical models combined with rule sets developed from recent experimental data. Comparisons showed that dynamic control resulted in better yield per unit energy input to the growth system than did static control. With comparable productivity parameters and potential for significant energy savings, dynamic control strategies will contribute greatly to the sustainability of space-deployed CELSS.

TI Fishery ecology and oceanography of the prawn Penaeus merguiensis (de
   Man) in the Gulf of Papua: Estimation of maximum sustainable yield and
   modelling of yield, effort and rainfall
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH

AB Annual fishing effort for banana prawns, Penaeus merguiensis (de Man), in the Gulf of Papua increased from low levels in 1974 to around the optimum level in 1978 and peaked at 95 000 trawl-hours in 1989 before decreasing after the introduction of effort controls in 1988. Maximum sustainable yield of P. merguiensis was estimated at 559 +/- s.e. 25 t (of tails) by linear regression of CPUE (U) on effort using the Schaeffer model. Optimum effort was estimated at 84.0 (+/- s.e. 11.8) x 10(3) trawl-hours, and an equation for the yield (C-E) for a given effort (E) was derived as C-E = 13.5E - (8.31 x 10(-2))E-2. Application of the CLIMPROD program to Gulf of Papua yield and effort and seasonal rainfall inputs resulted in validated modelling of the fishery. CLIMPROD selected a Schaeffer model for the CPUE-effort relationship (U = a + bE). When CLIMPROD incorporated rainfall (V), the model used was U = aV((b+c)) + dV((2b))E (linear-exponential-exponential), where rainfall influences abundance and catchability. For 1974-93 overall, effort was by far the chief determinant of yield. The model using regionally averaged total rainfall in the fourth quarter and unstandardized effort data explained only an extra 5% of the variation in the following year's catch over the model using effort alone. Standardization of effort data by 3% probably approximates the real effort applied more accurately than does recorded effort.

AB The performance of a proposed management 'decision rule'-an algorithm that specifies management actions when specified criteria are met-was evaluated by exploring the impact of different choices for three decision-rule parameters on the ability of the rule to achieve management objectives. To do this, forward simulations from an age-structured assessment model for the substock of red rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) off southern New Zealand were used. The size of this substock is currently estimated to be about one-third of B-MSY (the level of vulnerable biomass that would produce maximum sustainable yield), and the management goal is to rebuild it to B-MSY. A target rebuilding trajectory to B-MSY was generated by allowing the model population to rebuild under the current catch regime with constant recruitment. The decision rule is based on comparison of observed catch per unit effort (CPUE) to predicted CPUE.
   Process and observation errors, each with a coefficient of variation of 20%, were introduced, and five values were used for each of the three parameters of the rule. The decision rule was effective in removing all instances of failure to rebuild and all excessively slow rebuilding trajectories. The decision rule was also applied to an arbitrarily depressed starting substock size, and the conclusions were the same.

AB India has about 2 million km(2) of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) which is nearly two-thirds of her total land area. The mineral potential of the EEZ includes well-known monazite-ilmenite-rutile placers on the east and west coasts, calcareous aggregates and sands in the shallow waters (especially in the Lakshadweep island group off the southwest coast), and phosphate mud and sediments (along the west coast, and possibly in the Andaman Sea). There is also potential for cobalt-rich crusts in several locations, and for hydrothermal sulfide mineralization in the Andaman Sea. In addition, seawater components and hydrocarbon deposits in the offshore areas are already attracting expanded activity. To be able to exploit the mineral potential of the EEZ on a long-term sustainable basis, it is necessary to investigate the nature of each type of deposit and to make an associated oceanographic-environmental evaluation. A good beginning has been made with respect to exploitation of the beach and offshore placers.

AB Ventilatory and lactate thresholds have been proposed as tools to establish the highest steady-state intensity sustainable during prolonged physical exercise. The purposes of this study were to clarify whether the intensity at the Ventilatory threshold could be sustained during prolonged high-intensity exercise and if the corresponding work rate, pulmonary Ventilation, and blood lactate concentration could also be maintained. Fifteen young and healthy male subjects were submitted to a VO2max test on ergocycle and a 90-min high-intensity ergocycle endurance exercise test. During the 90-min exercise test, subjects were able to maintain an intensity corresponding to a heart rate 5 beats . min(-1) lower than that predetermined from the ventilatory threshold. Heart rate., FeO2, and FeCO2 were stable during the period from 20 to 80 min, VO2 was constant from 30 to 80 min, while work output, pulmonary ventilation, blood lactate, and VCO2, decreased significantly over the 90-min performance. These results show that physiological parameters near the ventilatory threshold are not interchangeable and that some cannot be used to monitor high-intensity long term exercise. Moreover, they clearly demonstrate that the blood lactate concentration fluctuates substantially during a 90-min endurance performance and cannot predict the highest work intensity that can be sustained during prolonged exercise without fatigue. However, heart rate and VO2 at the ventilatory threshold seem to be more suitable markers for that purpose.

TI Safety and registration of microbial agents for control of grasshoppers

AB Microbial control agents offer a method of pest control using organisms that are a natural component of the environment and are usually much more selective than chemical pesticides. Furthermore, they can usually be integrated with other methods of control, and may provide prolonged control by establishment within the host population. However, microbial control agents also possess properties that can pose human and environmental risks depending on the nature of the pathogen and its pattern of use. We present an overview of issues concerning the safety and registration of microbial control agents with emphasis on pathogens of locusts and grasshoppers. The potential safety issues and other consequences of concern from the deployment of microorganisms for pest control are: (1) pathogenicity to non-target organisms, (2) toxigenicity to non-target organisms, (3) competitive displacement of microorganisms, and (4) allergenicity. Inundative control methods pose unique risks because the pathogens must be produced in large quantities, stored, transported, and applied, usually in concentrations much higher than would normally ever occur naturally. The overriding concern in introducing an exotic agent is the risk to non-target beneficial organisms, because once the agent becomes established. it will in most situations be impossible to eradicate. However, if indigenous organisms are used, there is relatively little risk of irreversible, long-term detrimental effects. A synopsis of safety testing results of some of the more promising microbial control agents for grasshoppers and locusts and an evaluation of their potential hazards are presented. Safety to vertebrates is evaluated by a tiered series of laboratory test requirements. Assessments on hazards to non-target invertebrates are based principally on results of laboratory bioassays. Safety tests should be chosen with regard to the biological characteristics of the agent and should not impose standards that are more stringent than those imposed on other forms of pest control. Regulatory oversight should assure the integrity of the environment and safety of the public, while at the same time not unduly hampering the development, registration, and use of more sustainable pest control methods.

AB This paper describes an attempt to model soil moisture over the Australian continent with an integrated system of dynamic models and a Geographic Information System (CIS) data base. A land surface scheme with improved treatment of soil hydrological processes is described. The non-linear relationships between soil hydraulic conductivity, matric potential and soil moisture are derived from the Broadbridge and White soil model. For a single location, the prediction of the scheme is in good agreement with the measurements of the Hydrological and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment (HAPEX). High resolution atmospheric and geographic data are used in soil moisture prediction over the Australian continent. The importance of reliable land surface parameters is emphasized and details are given for deriving the parameters from a GIS. Predicted soil moisture patterns over the Australian continent in summer, with a 50 km spatial resolution, are found to be closely related to the distribution of soil types, apart from isolated areas and times under the influence of precipitation. This is consistent with the notion that the Australian continent in summer is generally under water stress. In contrast, predicted soil temperatures are more closely related to radiation patterns and changes in atmospheric circulation. The simulation can provide details of soil moisture evolution both in space and time, that are very useful for studies of land use sustainability, such as plant growth modelling and soil erosion prediction.

Approaches to this challenge include reducing the use of external inputs, regenerating locally available resources more effectively, and integrating a wide range of low-cost management technologies that build on services provided by nature. In Sierra del Rosario Biosphere Reserve in western Cuba, long-term basic studies on the functioning and succession of different forest systems have provided a solid basis for the development of tropical forestry. Key components include the holistic management of functional groups of tropical trees, improved understanding of landscape functioning and the use of mycorrhizal-based ecotechnologies in tropical afforestation. The transplantation of native Glomalean diversity seems to be both effective and economic, and is based on the use of different strains, of native microbial inocula obtained from a range of forest soils.

AB Forestry is a sector undergoing dynamic evolution in a rapidly-changing world. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, provided impetus and commitment to international activity focused on the world's forests. This has intensified over the past two years, with considerable stimulus provided by activities of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF), which was set up in April 1995 by the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. Never before has there been so much attention paid to global forest issues in the popular press, such a large number of regional and international initiatives on various aspects of forest conservation and management, and so many demands on forests to address a multitude of needs and concerns of diverse interest groups. The context and the expectations facing forestry today are complex and challenging, as reflected in FAO's most recent report on the world's forest resources and the forestry sector.

AB National geological survey organizations are amongst the oldest government scientific agencies in many countries. Their evolution thus usually reflects the history of scientific and economic patterns and policies in their home jurisdictions. In most cases this evolution progressed from the classic 'frontier' exploration phase, through the development of information bases for use mainly in mineral, Fuel and water resource development. In many modern organizations, the thrust is increasingly toward environment-related activities, including natural hazards, geochemical baselines and sustainable development.

AB The density of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in the modified tussock grasslands of the Mackenzie Basin, South Island, New Zealand, in August-September 1991 was determined within 26 I-ha quadrats spread over 1000 ha. The area was poisoned with 1080-carrot baits and dead and live rabbits counted. The overall kill rate was 93%. Wide variability in rabbit densities amongst the quadrats was correlated with burrow density, but vegetation was not a significant predictor of rabbit numbers. High density quadrats were not all spatially clumped together. Variation amongst quadrats of 0-43% of rabbits dying underground shows that searching burrows as well as the surface will provide the most accurate rabbit densities. Poisoning efficacy was greater than or equal to 90% in 77% of the quadrats, but two low-density quadrats recorded kill rates <70%. Nine per cent of carcasses had been partly eaten by predators, suggesting a potential for the predators to be killed during rabbit control operations via secondary poisoning. The average density of 19 rabbits per ha confirms the classification of this area as a moderate to high rabbit-prone zone, with the rabbit population imposing grazing pressure equivalent to at least 1-2 sheep per ha at the beginning of spring. Sustainable agriculture cannot be attained in these semi-arid regions of New Zealand without cheap, widespread and effective rabbit control.

AB Experiments were conducted during April-Oct. 1994 in a Beijing rice field. Four types of rice varieties have been tested. Large cultivar differences in methane emission flux have been found. Variety 93812 emitted about fivefold more CH4 than did the Qiuguang variety. An organic amendment plus (NH4)(2)SO4 as the base fertilizer and (NH4)(2)SO4 as the topdressing applied in different amounts and growth stages, compared with no topdressing, reduced methane emission about 58% and increased rice yield about 31.7%. Emission peaks of CH4 in the tillering stage and reproductive stage were suppressed.
   A comprehensive strategy could meet both the goal for sustainable rice productivity and methane reduction. Such a strategy includes:
   1. Selection of cultivars which have reduced root exudate and litter but increased root mass most of which growing in the oxidized soil layer, cultivars also need an effective number of tillers for optimum yield but with less CH4 transportation ability;
   2. Application of organic manure combined with chemical fertilizers, that reduce CH4 emissions. Fertilizers such as SO42- or other inhibitors can be maintained for a long period in soil;
   3. Adoption of scientific irrigation mode such as flooding-drainage-intermittent irrigation,that can both increase the rice yield and decrease the CH4 emission, etc..

AB Technologies to reduce net emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide within the agriculture sector were reviewed to estimate the global potential for mitigation of these radiatively active greenhouse gases. Our estimates of the potential reduction of radiative forcing by the agricultural sector range from 1.15-3.3 Gt C equivalents per year. Of the total potential reduction, approximately 32% could result from reduction in CO2 emissions, 42% of carbon offsets by biofuel production on 15% of existing croplands, 16% from reduced CH4 emissions and 10% from reduced emissions of N2O. Agriculture encompasses large regional differences in management practices and rates of potential adoption of mitigation practices. Acceptability of mitigation options will depend on the extent to which sustainable production will be achieved or maintained and benefits will accrue to farmers. Technologies such as no-till farming and strategic fertilizer placement and timing are now being adopted for reasons other than concern for climate change issues.

AB World soils represent the largest terrestrial pool of organic carbon (C), about 1550 Pg compared with about 700 Pg in the atmosphere and 600 Pg in land biota. Agricultural activities (e.g., deforestation, burning, plowing, intensive grazing) contribute considerably to the atmospheric pool. Expansion of agriculture may have contributed substantially to the atmospheric carbon pool. However, the exact magnitude of carbon fluxes from soil to the atmosphere and from land biota to the soil are not known. An important objective of the sustainable management of soil resources is to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by increasing passive or non-labile fraction. Soil surface management, soil water conservation and management, and soil fertility regulation are all important aspects of carbon sequestration in soil. Conservation tillage, a generic term implying all tillage methods that reduce runoff and soil erosion in comparison with plow-based tillage, is known to increase SOC content of the surface layer. Principal mechanisms of carbon sequestration with conservation tillage are increase in micro-aggregation and deep placement of SOC in the sub-soil horizons. Other useful agricultural practices associated with conservation tillage are those that increase biomass production (e.g., soil fertility enhancement, improved crops and species, cover crops and fallowing, improved pastures and deep-rooted crops). It is also relevant to adopt soil and crop management systems that accentuate humification and increase the passive fraction of SOC. Because of the importance of C sequestration, soil quality should be evaluated in terms of its SOC content.

AB A case study on the nutrient input-output budget of slash and burn agriculture was carried out in Northeast-Para, Brazil, where such a land-use system has been practised for about 100 years. A common cropping period lasts for two years and the fields lie fallow for 4 to 8 years. We quantified rates of deposition, fertilization, and losses due to the burn, harvest and leaching. Six fields of different phases in the rotational cycle were under study during a 19 month period. During the fallow period, the input of Na, K, Mg, N, P and S via deposition exceeded the estimated losses with the seepage water. The Ca budget was almost balanced. The balance of fields in the transition from the fallow to the cropping phase was negative for Na, K, Ca, Mg, N, and S. The P balance was positive when NPK fertilizer was applied, and negative without fertilizer application. The nutrient balance for K, Mg, Ca, N, and P was also negative on the field in transition from the cropping to the fallow period. The nutrient budget for an entire land-use cycle of 9 years was estimated by the ''false time series approach''. In the case of an NPK fertilization during the cropping period there were net losses of 75 kg K ha(-1), 125 kg Ca ha(-1), 16 kg Mg ha(-1), 285 kg N ha(-1) and 13 kg S ha(-1). Na (86 kg ha(-1)) and P (11 kg ha(-1)) were accumulated. The harvest was the most important flux for the K (61%) and P (62%) output. The element transfer into the atmosphere during the burn caused the main losses of N (60%), S (65%), Ca (58%) and Mg (41%). The most important path of Na loss was leaching (92%). The net K losses were severe as they represented 45% of the K store found extractable in the soil down to 1m depth and in the aboveground biomass. The presented results may be useful in planning a sustainable and environmentally protective method of land-use within a shifting cultivation system. It is strongly recommended that slash burning be abandoned in order to keep the nutrients in the ecosystem.

AB A study was conducted on an Oxic Paleudult in South Western Nigeria to evaluate the effects of organic residue treatments after clearing a 3 year secondary fallow land on soil nutrients, maize yield and profitability. Burning of the fallow residue in 1993 and crop residue in situ in 1994 led to significant increases in soil pH, total N, organic matter, available P, exchangeable Ca, Mg and K within one month in both fertilized and unfertilized treatments. However, the increases were not sustained till harvest and in most cases the concentrations of the nutrients decreased significantly below the pretreatment levels. Increases due to residue incorporation were small but more sustainable, while in bare unfertilized plots the nutrients decreased below the pre treatment levels throughout the period of the experiment. Maize yields were significantly higher in residue incorporated and burnt plots than in the bare plots with or without fertilizer application in both years. The influence of fertilizer application was profound. However, residue incorporation without fertilizer produced 84% of the yield obtained in bare fertilized plots in 1993 and as much as 104% in 1994. The highest profit was obtained when fertilizer application was combined with residue incorporation.

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In September 1994, a Workshop on Climate Change Implications and Adaptation Strategies for the Indo-Pacific Island Nations was held in Honolulu, Hawaii. The workshop was convened under the auspices of the US Country Studies Program and was designed to provide a forum for representatives of several Pacific Rim nations to discuss the implications of climate change for economic development and resource management in their jurisdictions. As a background to the workshop's deliberations, this article provides a survey of scientific understanding related to climate variability and change. In addition, the article identifies specific opportunities to use emerging information on climate variability and climate change to support environmentally sustainable economic development in the Pacific region. The article is based on the Opening Keynote Address presented to the workshop by Eileen Shea. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB Xiamen has been selected as a demonstration sire for the GEF/UNDP/IMO Regional Programme for the Prevention and Management of Marine Pollution in the East Asian Seas. Its purpose is to test a working model for the application of an integrated coastal management system for mitigating marine pollution, rapid economic development. The paper outlines the success in ICM institutional development at the local level, particularly the establishment of decision-making mechanisms based on consensus building among major stakeholders, and inputs from science and technology. Further, the institutional development provides a framework for, and facilitates progress in, the legislative improvement and enforcement, cross-sectoral marine pollution monitoring, developing sustainable financing options, enhancing public awareness and participation, and capacity building towards ICM goals. Evaluation criteria for application of ICM system are also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID VALIDITY
AB The results of a quantitative evaluation of community-based coastal resource management at six sites of the Central Visayas Regional Project-1 (CVRP-1) located in Cebu and Negros Oriental, Philippines, are discussed. The goal of the research is to determine factors influencing dir success and sustainability of community-based coastal resource management projects. Several lessons were learned, or confirmed, by the analysis, including: variations in evaluations of project success by project staff and beneficiaries; early and continuous participation of beneficiaries in the project is related to this positive evaluation of success; positive cultural attitudes toward collective action were related to perception of positive change; and job satisfaction among fishers was high, suggesting the development of supplementary, not alternative, employment opportunities.

TI Canada's Atlantic Coastal Action Program: A community-based approach to
   collective governance
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Atlantic Coastal Action Program (ACAP) is a community-based coastal management initiative that has been underway on Canada's east coast for the past 6 years. Coalitions of local stakeholders have been assisted by government in taking a lead role for the planning and management activities in 13 coastal ecosystems throughout Atlantic Canada. The program was initiated and originally facilitated by the federal government (Environment Canada) but has come to be led and owned at the local level. The objective is to have all those affecting and/or affected by local decisions involved in this process. In ACAP, the traditional role of government is shared with the local roundtables that are established in each coastal ecosystem. Instead of government departments being the lead agencies that set policy and priorities the communities assume this function and the government agencies become partners in responding to their identified needs. ACAP is a practical demonstration of the joint management, or collective governance approach to Integrated Coastal Management and offers lessons to governments and coastal communities looking to establish lasting partnership approaches that have the potential to achieve the sustainable development of coastal ecosystems.

TI Integrated coastal food production systems - A review of current
   literature
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article

   GROWTH; WATER
AB With dramatic population increases in coastal areas, food requirements have risen dramatically, and traditional, extensive production systems cannot satisfy present and future requirements without using vast amounts of space. Modern intensive, monoculture aquaculture systems are also not ideal because they require high levels of inputs and produce undesireable wastes. They are devoted to a few expensive (usually export) species and do not supply food for coastal communities; such systems are not sustainable.
   This article reviews the literature on polyculture and integrated polyculture systems relevant to coastal aquaculture. In open-water fish cage culture, molluscs and seaweed can be used to take up excess feed and waste from the fish, while molluscs are a potential food source for the cultured fish. In China, molluscs and seaweed are raised together on lines, since they mutually enhance each others' growing environments. In pond culture, shrimp and/or fish are grown in combination with molluscs, seaweed and crabs in order to stabilize the growing environment, decrease food requirements, clean up pond effluent and, in some cases, increase production and profit.
   Much of the reviewed information is based on fish or shrimp farming which uses other organisms To decrease the environmental impact or to stabilize production. Although it revolves around the production of high-valued species, the interactions and basic ecological principles can be used to develop food production systems for coastal communities which have less negative impact on the environment yet which produce sufficient food for today's requirements in an efficient manner.

TI Fisheries in the East German Lander: Some aspects of the integration
   process
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The unification of Germany in 1990 can be considered as a clear example of all those topics strictly linked to the transition front a centrally planned economy to an open market, also considering that these kind of issues arose there for the first time. This process of deep change created a great number of problems involving all sectors not only of the economy but also of the society in the regions of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), which today still appear as the weaker part of the country. After a formal legal and economic unity, the questions related to how to solve all the problems linked to the political, psychological and social unity still remain unanswered for the great differences between the two German societies. In this article the fishery sector has been used as an example to show the peculiarities of the East German transition towards the market: many governmental programmes have been launched in order to quickly achieve an economic system based on efficiency and environmental sustainability-something that Last-Central Eur ope in general is aiming to achieve at present. The idea of adsorbing the economy of the GDR into the West German model easily and rapidly, forced all the consequences of the process of a quick integration onto a society used to living in a public property system, based on subsidies, and social costs were not sufficiently taken into account. In the fishery sector, as well as in other economic sectors, a concrete reduction in output became one of the first goals to achieve with scarce attention paid to the social effects of these policies. The result was that the reduction in East German producers' income and high unemployment represented a serious heritage for the united Germany and the European Union, making the GDR a sort of laboratory for a transformation towards the market without a transition.

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The shared aquatic resources of Southeast Asia are important in terms of nutrition, income and employment, and at the same time, they are unique in terms of species composition and biodiversity. Many economically important fish species are highly migratory and are adversely affected by interference with the migration corridors between spawning and nursery grounds and adult habitats, as well as habitat degradation caused by pollution. In Southeast Asian waters migratory fish pass through overlapping 'exclusive economic zones, (EEZs), often claimed by more than one country. As fish may be dependent on habitats in the contested area or on either side of the zone, there is a need to develop viable fisheries management systems, which in the end may ensure the enhancement of the aquatic resources and their sustainable use for years to come.

AB The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has not properly settled the question of conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in areas beyond zones under national jurisdiction, despite the recognition of the interdependence of these stocks with those located within exclusive economic zones. As a consequence, unregulated fishing under the open access regime of the high seas has caused overfishing of these living resources and has led, in recent years, to tensions between coastal states and high seas fishing states. In 1992, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development requested that the United Nations convene a conference aimed at implementing the relevant provisions of the Convention and with a view to establishing a conservation and management regime for the two types of stocks concerned. In August 1995, the conference adopted an agreement for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. Although the agreement is generally considered to be in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, it nevertheless contains innovative provisions that might be considered as marking a departure from the latter. This article attempts to analyze the agreement in relation to the Convention, other relevant instruments, and state practices and identifies where the agreement has contributed to an effective implementation of the relevant provisions of the Convention and where if has gone beyond its regime in order to deal with recent fisheries management issues not foreseen in 1982.

TI Distribution, status and conservation of primates in Monte Alen National
   Park, Equatorial Guinea
SO ORYX
LA English
DT Article
AB Equatorial Guinea has a new network of protected areas, but only Monte Alen National Park has any effective protection. As a contribution to the knowledge of this area, a survey of primate populations teas carried out during it 7-month period in 1994. The results showed that there is a high primate diversity (15-16 distinct. species) in Monte Alen. The three most commonly sighted monkey species were Cercopithecus nictitans (35.9-40.8 per cent of sightings), Cercopithecus cephus (28.9-43.5 per cent) and Cercopithecus pogonias (17.4-22.4 per cent). Mean distance covered to find any group of these guenons varied from 1.1 km in open primary forest to 2.7 km in dense primary forest. Gorilla nests were more abundant in secondary forest near villages (5.15 nests/km), while chimpanzee nests were mostly found in primary forest (5.35 nests/km). Hunting pressure appeals to be low but shifting agriculture has a significant impact on the conservation of the area. The degree of threat varies between species. Alternatives for better management of the area, such as educational programmes and sustainable use of natural resources, are suggested.

AB The Acheron Delta is a coastal wetland of Western Greece which has remained unexplored from a floristic and vegetational point of view. The flora of the investigated area consists of 415 taxa belonging to 89 families and 280 genera, 395 of the listed taxa are reported for the first time, three taxa are reported for the first time from Epiros and one taxon is a new record for the Western Greek mainland. From chorological analysis of the nora the predominance of Mediterranean elements (52.2%) and the high percentage of widespread taxa (45.1%) are evident. The life-form spectrum shows, that Therophytes are predominant (32.8%). The proportion of the Hemicryptophytes is noteworthy (24.6%) and the high percentages of Phanerophytes (15.4%), and especially Hydrophytes (13.7%), must also be emphasized. The vegetation mosaic of Acheron Delta is mapped and analytically described at the plant association level. A syntaxonomic arrangement of the plant communities is also given. The human impact on the vegetation during the last 35 years is recorded on the basis of the area covered by the different vegetation types in 1960 and 1995. The total loss of natural habitats within 35 years is 163.8 ha. Conservation and restoration proposals for this ecologically significant wetland are made in the framework of a sustainable management plan.

AB Supervised control programs were initiated by the Extension Service in the deciduous orchards of Upper Galilee and the Golan almost 20 years ago. The integrated pest management (IPM) project on fruit crops and vines, launches as a systematic state-wide program in 1991, covered 23% of the total acreage at the end of 1996. The program has reached a critical mass and generates a steady demand for this new kind of advisory service. The project has set the right pattern for intensive and continuous collaboration among research, extension and grower. The program has been successful in reaching out to growers with the help of a newly formed group of local and regional pest scouts; the field-level implementation is the responsibility of the extension system. A reduction of approximately 30% in the use of pesticides has been achieved. The project prepares the ground for environment-friendly and sustainable cropping systems, generating produce competitive on both the local as well as foreign markets. The program on indoor vegetables, flowers, herbs and spices initiated in 1992, had to address first the problem of the sweetpotato whitefly. The field program methodology relies on the establishment of model farms and plots. The model plots are used to examine supervised control scenarios which could, in turn, be diffused to all growers. A 30-50% reduction in the use of pesticides was achieved on the model farms. The program represents an integration of supervised control, fully fledged IPM, and biological control practices. The program on corn and cotton covers the entire acreage under these two crops. The cotton program is supported by an integrated resistance management component. Three area-wide pest management programs were initiated: in the Arava and Bet She'an valleys, and in the Golan.

AB The capacity of a soil to supply roots with water and nutrients for crop growth is important when defining sustainable land management which implies maintenance of production and reduction of production risks. Not only the amount of ''available'' water is important but also its ''accessibility'', which differs among different soil structures. Different structures within one soil series were associated with three types of management: (i) conventional, temporary grassland (Conv), (ii) biodynamic, temporary grassland (Bio) and (iii) conventional permanent grassland (Perm). Transpiration of barley plants, under identical circumstances, and the associated rooting patterns, were measured in five large undisturbed cores from each of the three sail structures. Management had significantly changed bulk density, organic matter content and porosity. Measured transpiration showed significant differences with highest amounts for Perm followed by Conv and lowest amounts for Bio. ''Rooting pattern characteristics'', defined as the relation between a series of hypothetical extraction zones around each root and the volumes of excluded soil were determined for the three structures. These ''rooting pattern characteristics'' were most favourable for Perm, followed by Bio and Conv, respectively. The ''water supply characteristics'', defined as the number of days the soil can satisfy a transpiration demand of 5 mm d(-1) as a function of a hypothetical extraction zone, reflects the capacity of the soil to supply roots with water. These ''water supply characteristics'' combined with the ''rooting pattern characteristics'' were used to quantify the accessibility of soil water. Accessibility was highest for Perm and Conv with 95% and 94% respectively, followed by Bio with 68%. When used in a simulation model and compared with simulations implicitly assuming total accessibility, measured transpirations were better simulated by introducing the expression for water accessibility.

AB Na Cl (salt)- and mannitol (drought)-tolerant callue lines of Brassica juncea (L) Czern. Var. RW-85-59 were isolated by a plated cell suspension culture technique against 43 mM NaCl and 165 mM mannitol, respectively. Callus lines, adapted to a high concentration of Na Cl (171 mM) and mannitol (329 mM) were then established by direct adaptation procedures. In the initial passages, the calluses showed severe reduction in tissue growth when grown on NaCl/mannitol-containing media but growth of adapted calluses recovered and was sustainable in the subsequent passages. Adapted calluses showed considerable accumulation of free proline in NaCl-/mannitol-containing media compared to the control callus grown on stress-free medium. A significant increase of intensity of one particular acid phosphatase isozymic band in the adapted calluses, irrespective of NaCl or mannitol stress, indicated that it may be used as an osmotic stress-marker in this system. Short-term salt/osmotic-shock-treatment with high concentrations of osmotica revealed that only the adapted lines retained the maximum amount of free proline within the cells for osmoregulation. This response probably helped the cells to restore their normal growth when the stress was withdrawn.

AB Through measurement and interpretation of the spectral, spatial and temporal variations in electromagnetic emissions and reflections from the Earth's surface, important information related to natural resources can be acquired. Furthermore, satellite technology has greatly improved the communication and positioning techniques world-wide. Consequently, space science now provides valuable and timely information about natural resources, which has become a major factor in sustainable development.
   The realization of the full potential of space science in the context of development in Africa requires adequate education and training in order to facilitate project formulation, planning, management and implementation. This, in turn, would lead to the formulation and adoption of national space science policies based on user needs and addressing both the short and long-term needs of a particular country.
   Space science education in Africa needs to address issues like (i) provision of programmes, (ii) integration of the proposed techniques within the existing infrastructure, and (iii) training in Remote Sensing, Global Positioning System, Geographic Information System and other space science techniques, in order to ensure the successful implementation of space science projects within the continent. In this context, African universities ought to play a major role in space science training, research, consultancy and publication. Through international co-operation, it is possible to develop and support national, regional and international training programmes and international scientific exchange in Africa. (C) 1997 COSPAR.

TI Urban sustainability: Discourses, networks and policy tools
SO PROGRESS IN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB There is widespread interest in policy circles and among academic researchers in the concept of urban sustainability. It is recognized that sustainable development, the goal of intergenerational equity promoted by the Brundtland report, the Rio Earth Summit and the United Nations Commission, has a strong local dimension and that this implies an urban focus. The research project reported here was funded by the Commission of European Communities during the period 1992-1994 to look at urban sustainability in Britain and Italy. It examined sustainability by considering three important local policy areas: urban traffic management; the planning of the location of retail faclities; and the management of green spaces in urban areas. The urban focus was explored through four city case studies: of Bologna, Edinburgh, Florence and Leicester. Through these case studies, the nature of the urban level policy process was considered and the relationship of environmental concerns to other items on the local policy agenda was investigated. The research took a multi-faceted approach to studying the policy process, considering the role of key actors in decision making, the importance of networks between actors and organizations and the ways that discourses of policy making interacted. The approach therefore sought to give a balance in analysis to the actor, the institution and the role of communication in the policy process. This latter feature suggested analyses of the overlapping, complementary and competing discourses of policy In conclusion, the implications of the research approach and findings for contemporary planning theory are explored.

SO REVUE CANADIENNE D ETUDES DU DEVELOPPEMENT-CANADIAN JOURNAL OF

LA English
DT Article
AB This study traces the struggles in Kenya of two groups of landless women to assert control over their own labour in agricultural production in the decade 1986-1997. In the first case, at least two thousand women of Maragua have refused to produce coffee an export cash crop, and instead are producing bananas and selling them independently. In the second and very different setting of Mwea, a government rice producing project, hundreds of women have appropriated the inputs, notably irrigation water to produce garden crops for their own consumption and sale. The study uses a "gendered class analysis" to consider how women farmers resist exploitation at the household, national and international levels The success of grassroot women's sustainable, sustenance agriculture is linked to their success in establishing control over their own labour power, in the face of efforts by husbands, the state and private firms to retain control.

TI Influence of soluble phosphate on P-solubilizing activity of bacteria
SO ROSTLINNA VYROBA

DT Article
DE soil phosphorus; solubilization of phosphate; P-solubilizing
   microorganisms
ID RHIZOBIUM
AB Phosphorus supplied into the soil in the form of mineral phosphorus fertilizers transforms up to 90% into the form hard-accessible to plants (Goldstein, 1986; Domey, 1987), In view of constantly sustainable agriculture, at least a part of phosphorus needed for plants should be compensated from other resources. Ability to transform poorly soluble phosphates into soluble forms has been confirmed in about 20 to 30% of soil microorganisms (Kucey, 1983; Halder, Chakrabartty, 1993; Mikanova, Kubat, 1994). The property to solubilize phosphates can be easily proved in vitro conditions. This fact led earlier to the efforts to produce bacterial preparations - biofertilizers containing P-solubilizing microorganisms. These preparations, however, after the application into the soil did not meet the expected results (Mishustin, Naumova, 1962; Brown, 1974). Repression of P-solubilizing activity by soluble mineral phosphates now seems to be one of the probable reasons of low efficiency of preparations in soil. Goldstein, Liu (1987) found that solubilization of phosphates in Erwinia herbicola and Escherichia coli is induced by a deficiency of available phosphorus and suppressed by raised level of soluble orthophosphates in soil. This study tried to find whether repression of P-solubilizing activity by soluble mineral phosphates is not one of the reasons of different results obtained in vitro and results obtained with the same strains in pot trials with soil (Mikanova et al., 1995). Isolates of P-solubilizing rhizospheric microorganisms were acquired from rhizosphere of cereals grown in pot and field trials at the Research Institute of Crop Production, Praha-Ruzyne. Their P-solubilizing activity was tested on agar plates with P-agar (Mikanova, Kubat, 1994) at various levels of soluble phosphate (0 to 50 mmol P.ml(-1)). A soluble phosphate in the form of KH2PO4 was added to this agar. Selected isolates were tested also in liquid shaken cultures (Mikanova, Kubat, 1994). Likewise in the previous case, KH2PO4 was added in various concentrations (0, 10, 30 and 50 mmol P.ml(-1)). After incubation in the medium the concentration of phosphorus was determined (Murphy, Riley, 1962) by a modified method (Machacek, Kotek, 1978); 32 isolates were tested on agar plates, 19 of 32 tested isolates showed P-solubilizing activity even under the presence of 10 mmol of soluble P in 1 ml of medium and 10 of them on agar containing 50 mmol P.ml(-1) (Tab. I). In liquid shaken cultures four isolates were tested which in tests on agar plates exhibited a high P-solubilizing activity (without the presence of soluble phosphate in medium) and were distinct by the fact whether this activity was (26, 141) or was not (86, 291) repressed by soluble phosphate (Tab. II). When compared repressed (26) and not repressed (86) isolates, it has been confirmed that an activity of not repressed one was higher than that of not repressed isolate at higher concentrations. When another two isolates were compared an inverse ratio was observed. In liquid shaken cultures of different level of soluble phosphate also six strains of the genus Rhizobium were tested. The same medium like in the previous case was used and KH2PO4 was added in concentrations 0, 10 and 30 mmol P.ml(-1). Results are presented in Tab. III. Different P-solubilizing activity follows from comparison of these strains at gradated concentrations of soluble phosphate. Strains D55 and D661, charecterized by comparable P-solubilizing activity, preserve the same ability to solubilize only at the level 5 mmol P.ml(-1). Al the level 10 and 30 mmol P.
   ml(-1) in the strain D661 a distinct inhibition by this higher concentration of phosphorus was exhibited. Results of our studies are in agreement with those obtained by Goldstein, Liu (1987) and confirm the hypothesis that there are microorganisms whose P-solubilizing activity is repressed under the presence of soluble phosphate and those microorganisms in which repression does not occur.

AB A rigorous model connects together the following three basic concepts: (1) ''sustainability'' - meaning the generalized future power of an economy to consume over time; (2) ''Green NNP'' - meaning a current measure of national income that subtracts off from GNP not just depreciation of capital but also, more generally, depletion of environmental assets evaluated at current efficiency prices; (3) ''technological progress'' - meaning a projection onto the future of the so-called ''Solow residual''. A simple general formula is derived. Some crude calculations suggest a possibly strong effect of the residual, which hints that our best present estimates of long-term sustainability may be largely driven by predictions of future technological progress.

AB Weitzman provides a foundation for NNP as the stationary equivalent of a wealth-maximizing path when there is a constant interest rate and no exogenous technological progress. Here, the implications of Weitzman's foundation are explored in a case encountered in resource models, i.e., the case of non-constant interest rates. In a setting that allows for exogenous technological progress, an expression for NNP is obtained that adjusts Green NNP for anticipated capital gains and interest rate effects to produce a measure that indicates sustainability. This result is important when measuring the relative sustainability of resource rich and resource poor countries.

AB The objective of fc,rest management planning is often expressed as maximum sustainable economic yield. Methods used to collect information for forestry planning should, therefore, include variables significant for economic evaluations of management alternatives. It is important to be able to differentiate mature stands with respect to timber volumes and species mixture. In this study, digital high-altitude aerial photographs are tested as a data source for planning. Circular plot data from a forest estate in northern Sweden were used as reference material. Global positioning system (GPS) measurements, with differential correction, were used to georeference the plots. Harvesting priorities were calculated for each plot using the Forest Management Planning Package. Volumes, species mixture and harvest priorities were estimated using regression analysis based on textural and spectral information from aerial photographs. The results show that the dependent variables could be estimated fairly well using only spectral information, e.g., R-2 = 0.44 when estimating timber volume at reference plot (10 m radius) level. Aggregated to stand level, the precision was comparable with customary field survey methods (e.g., RMSE = 13.4% for timber volume).

AB Forest management planning comprises selection among treatment alternatives in management units, A traditional linear programming (LP) approach may effectively account for a profit maximization objective combined with sustainability constraints, e.g. on the temporal distribution of harvest volume flows, cash-flow. and net present value development. but it fails to account for spatial constraints, especially those associated with final felling. By applying a simulated annealing adjacency model based on net present value maximization and combined with an LP consequence computation model, it is possible to delineate optimal strategies of final felling scheduling. Evaluation is made of the trade-off between (1) the incremental cost (determined by use of the LP model) of an optimal adjacency model solution, and (2) the potential damage cost resulting from adjacency characteristics such as windthrow and bark injuries. The decision support system may contribute significantly to reduce damage costs and may improve the reliability of forest management planning.

AB With the central place concept still in use as a major instrument in German spatial planning, central place relationships are currently being investigated in the new federal states of East Germany and normative central place systems are being defined The shortcomings of the central place concept - as a theory of economic space, a model for spatial description and analysis and as a planning strategy - are cleat; but its potential should, nevertheless, not be neglected. Service supply relationships are by no means losing their relevance as elements of spatial interaction; and especially in attempts to create 'sustainable' spatial situations the concept can regain power due to its inbuilt spatial efficiency principle.

ID PRINCIPLES
AB Through the past half-century, much effort in a variety of disciplines, has been put to developing an approach to assessing change that pushes beyond an emphasis on economic signals to include a more complete treatment of human and ecosystem wellbeing. This challenge lies at the very heart of reporting on progress toward sustainability. Key to addressing this challenge is developing an effective conceptualization of the human-ecosystem relationship. The results of a review of 29 conceptual models that address the human-ecosystem relationship are presented. These results are used to develop a conceptual approach to assessing progress toward sustainability that: (1) builds on a number of common features drawn from these models; (2) is founded on a value set that insists on parallel care and respect for people and the ecosystem together; and (3) is consistent with systems ideas.

AB This article provides a qualified defence of economic indicators of human well being. Purchasing power obviously matters as a prerequisite for obtaining basic needs; abundant examples of human behaviour even in the richest countries in the world suggest that it matters for many other reasons, as well. Despite the shortcomings of indicators like GDP and GNP, richer nations (like richer individuals) have options that are simply not available to poorer ones. A particularly serious limitation of such indicators arises from their failure to take into account the distribution of income and wealth, both within and among nations. Higher income does not automatically lead to increased well being, but extreme caution is in order about attempts to dismiss its contribution, or to pathologize certain forms of consumption. While arguing the merits of a lifestyle less organized around consumption, proponents of sustainable development must acknowledge the strength of the evidence that money matters.

AB The United States health care system is congruous with the US economy and with prevailing local values: it is resource intensive, technology-focused, consumer-oriented, individualistic, and unequally available. However, the US health system is incongruous not only with other health care systems around the world, but also with the increasingly global nature of health care concerns. Indeed the US system, according to the World Bank, stands out as strikingly expensive and ineffective in its public health impact.
   The article first identifies several significant incongruities, and then argues that there is an increasing obligation for the US health system to become more ethically responsive in light of global concerns. Sustainable health should be sought as a significant goal of US health services. Health services need to be fully and accurately assessed for their environmental costs, which need to be made explicit. Actual, universal access to basic health care services needs to take priority over scarce high-tech therapies when resource allocations are made. Traditional health values such as individualism,autonomy and privacy must be placed within a context of global interdependence and responsibilities to community. Public health fundamentals such as adequate nutrition, clear water, and a biologically intact ecosystem must be emphasized. Innovations in health technology need to be made with attention to their potential international use and impact. Finally, a longer time horizon for planning is needed, taking into account environmentally caused health problems arising fifty years or more in the future.

AB Over the last 50 years, industrial countries have seen dramatic increases in the health and well being of their citizens. Life expectancy, infant and maternal mortality, key measures of population health, have shown continuous improvements since the turn of the century. Yet changes in the economic and social fabric such as increasing income disparity, psychological stressors such as high unemployment levels, and health care reforms with reductions in service provisions that are currently being experienced in industrialized countries, are threatening the sustainability of human health and well-being. With government resources dwindling for health services, expectations are increasing for communities to take charge of their own health and well-being. This paper presents some of the issues and dilemmas surrounding the sustainability of human health, and identifies the importance of developing educated and mobilized communities. By highlighting examples from the Community Health and Well-being in Southwestern Ontario: A Resource for Planning report, it suggests that the provision of key local health and well-being indicators is an important first step to community education and mobilization.

AB In this paper an attempt is made to illustrate some ways in which social, economic and environmental indicators can be combined to tell a coherent story about the sustainability of human well-being. Using examples from the fields of health, the fishing industry and energy, it is argued that one's success at constructing a single comprehensive system of indicators of human well-being will always be limited by one's particular point of departure from social, economic or environmental indicators. If that is indeed the case, then it would be helpful for researchers to abandon attempts to construct single comprehensive utopian systems in favour of agreed upon lists of important goals, indicators and monitoring procedures that can be used to implement progressive social change.

ID GROWTH MANAGEMENT; LAND
AB The traditional approach to resource management emphasizes local autonomy in regulatory policy, sustained yield in resource allocation, and management by single resource. While maintaining consistency with this paradigm, a number of states have expanded their regulatory and management responsibility as resource issues and problems have outpaced the capabilities of local government to resolve them. This paper contrasts such state efforts with a new paradigm in resource management-ecosystem management. The requirement of a fundamental change in beliefs attitudes, and values concerning the interaction of humans with their natural environment distinguishes bioregionalism from other forms of ecosystem management and provides the theoretical basis for managing resources as an interrelated whole. Addressing the specific topics of sustainable economics, empowerment education, and equity within the context of two case study areas-the Adirondacks and the Sierra Nevada-this paper explains how bioregionalism can help to resolve environmental issues and problems.

AB This article seeks to describe sustainable development in operational terms for three different modes of production. It provides two theoretical concepts to characterize each society's relationship with nature: societal metabolism and colonization. Metabolism is the mode in which societies organize the exchange of matter and energy with their natural environment. Colonization refers to the strategies employed to transform parts of the natural environment to render them more useful for societal needs. The first section offers an exploration of the sustainability problems within three modes of production and social organization: hunter-gatherer, agricultural, and industrial societies. Metabolism and colonization are then empirically described in detail for industrial societies. The final section discusses strategies for industrial societies to reduce and transform their metabolism toward more sustainable development.

AB In 1995, Florida maintained 1.15 million beef cows. The Univ, of Florida, Archbold Biological Station, South Florida Water Management District, and Florida Cattlemen's Association have initiated a holistic, multidisciplinary, research program to develop cattle production practices that are economically and environmentally sustainable. Research is being conducted on Buck Island Ranch in wildlife ecology entomology, nematology, veterinary medicine, range science, soil science, water quality, hydrologic modeling, and resource economics. For example, wildlife surveys have identified 46 bird species in summer pastures and 54 in winter pastures at Buck Island Ranch. The peak egg-laying period for the Crested Caracara (Caracara plancus Audubonii), a threatened bird species, occurs during late December and January. A 4-year study has indicated that 50% and 30% of nematode populations in pasture land were herbivores and bacterivores, respectively. Vegetative cover in representative summer pasture was dominated (82%) by bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge), followed by carpetgrass (Axomipus affinis Chase), bluestem (Andropogon glomeratus Walter B.S.P), bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Persoon) and vaseygrass (Paspalum urvillei Steudel). Organic N and soluble reactive P were the predominant forms of N and P in runoff from Buck Island. In addition to providing a better understanding-of ranch ecosystem components, research results have been integrated into decision-support systems such as the Beef Ranch Decision Support System. Also presented are the rationale and goals of a new field experiment to study the effects of cattle stocking-rate on water quality and other indicators of the cattle ranch ecosystem, such as wildlife utilization.

AB Understanding the mechanisms controlling crop effects on soil aggregation is necessary to develop sustainable soil management practices. Changes in soil aggregation, carbohydrates, and fungal vs. bacterial biomass were monitored following a shift from fallow (bare soil) to various cropping systems. Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) and wheat (Triticum aeslivum L.) were used as annual cropping systems, while alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), timothy (Phleum pratense L.), bromegrass (Bromus inermis L.), and reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) were used as perennial cropping systems. Crops were established in spring 1989, on a silty clay loam (fine, mixed, frigid Typic Dystro-chrept) and a clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Humaquept) near Quebec City (Canada). After three growing seasons, the mean-weight diameter of water-stable aggregates (MWD) was higher under reed canarygrass (2.26 mm in the clay loam and 2.45 mm in the silty clay loam) and timothy (2.13 and 2.26 mm) than under faba bean (1.92 and 1.89 mm) or wheat (2.06 and 1.57 mm). Intermediate values were found under alfalfa and bromegrass. Changes in MWD were not correlated with microbial biomass C. Acid-hydrolyzable carbohydrates correlated with MWD in the silty clay loam (r(2) = 0.42**) but the relationship decreased with higher carbohydrate levels in the clay loam (r(2) = 0.05), Close correlations were found between MWD and both fungal glucosamine (r(2) = 0.68***, soils combined) and bacterial muramic acid (r(2) = 0.48***). Changes in MWD were mostly reflected in aggregates >2 mm, and the close relationship with fungal glucosamine suggests that fungi played a dominant role in soil macroaggregation. Measurement of muramic acid and glucosamine is proposed as a potential approach to compare bacterial vs. fungal contributions to soil aggregation.

AB Analysis of the availability and use of the biomass resource is crucial if biomass energy is to be used on a sustainable basis.
   Detailed biomass energy flow charts for Kenya and Zimbabwe have been produced. Both of these flow charts took an average of Ig months to complete because of the difficulty in obtaining and analysing detailed and good quality data. In view of this, we have developed a flexible spreadsheet methodology which applies a common methodology to the drafting of biomass energy flow charts as a useful initial guide to more detailed studies. The FAOSTAT. PC database was chosen as the primary data source as it accounts for forestry and agricultural production in well defined and comparable categories for each country. Users can incorporate their own data energy values, and energy ratios in an attempt to produce more accurate biomass energy how charts than could be drafted from the FAOSTAT. PC database and default settings alone. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID MODERN DRAMA; PHYSICIST; IMAGE
AB This article presents the systems sciences as a field of inquiry and discusses the way in which it has evolved in relation to the humanities. Following a brief historical overview and assessment of the systems sciences by considering their origins and foundations in general system thinking, the review highlights the key players and the major trends in the field, and leads to a consideration of the ways in which it complements and contrasts the methods of human-related studies generally pursued in the humanities. It discusses the potential for the systems sciences to enrich descriptive, instructional, and explanatory orientations of contemporary Geisteswissenschaften through the inclusion of normative considerations.
   The normative component of the systems sciences is considered within an evolutionary framework that presents holism as a methodology for understanding the dynamics of complex 'real-world' (ontological) systems and suggests action imperatives for their viable and sustainable design over time. Through the tools metaphor, modeling and simulation, interactive design and other praxes, systems scientists investigate the goals and ends of systems and their interactions within environments shared with, and provided for, one another. In this way social systems in general, and human activity systems in particular, can be described as a function of their degree of purposefulness in terms of the role of human values in concrete circumstances.
   Through the tools of systems analysis and design, systems science represents the world of symbols, values, social entities, and cultures as embedded in an embracing order of hierarchies that bridges the gap between C. P. Snow's Two Cultures' of the sciences and the humanities. The use of modeling in systems sciences provides the language of design and the means by which creativity is applied in the course of inventing, making, assessing, and implementing the designs. In this way it lends to the humanities the capability to deal with increasing systemic complexities, rapid societal changes, and design decisions that affect the sustainable evolution of human societies within the wider context of their life support systems.

AB We propose a resource allocation scheme that takes into account both the QoS requirements and the characteristics of traffic streams. In our scheme, the decision to allocate buffer and bandwidth resources to a QoS class depends on whether buffering will be effective in reducing loss probability for this class. We present analytical techniques based on the theory of large deviations for estimating the small loss probability. Furthermore, we address the problem of accepting calls with incomplete traffic statistics. Existing proposals of traffic descriptors call for specification of only the first-order statistics such as the peak rate and the sustainable cell rate. To guarantee QoS, the admission policy must be conservative by assuming the worst-case distribution compliant to the traffic descriptor. We demonstrate that on-off sources exhibit such worst-case behavior. However, a static conservative policy results in under-utilization of network resources. We devise and analyze dynamic algorithms that improve the estimates of the actual bandwidth requirements for existing sources by collecting information on-line. We show that a direct approach, where the quantity measured is the QoS of interest, combined with an extrapolation technique to speed up the estimation process, offers a promising solution.

Viewed in this light, the main question in the article is as follows: Can the introduction of economic flexibility in the fisheries generate more sustainability without making the regulations stronger?
   The article describes two types of systems of economic flexibility in the fisheries: a system of flexibility based on exploiting many species, and a system of flexibility based on combining incomes from the fisheries and other sectors. If these systems are generating sustainability, there must be factors other than public fishery regulations which influence the decisions to direct fishing efforts away from declining populations and towards ones of greater abundance.
   The article is based mainly on statistical analysis of register data from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries.
   The most important conclusion is that the concept ''economical flexibility'' must be precisely defined if it is going to be the point of departure for implementing changes in the management of the fisheries. The mobile offshore fleet is the most flexible fleet if we define flexibility as exploiting many species, and choice of technology is the most decisive factor for whether the forms of production can be characterized as flexible or not. The immobile fiord fleet is not flexible with regard to exploiting many species, but this fleet is based on flexibility in participation. The offshore fishing fleet is flexible because the fishing technology used gives secondary catches of species other than the one primarily caught. Fishermen in the fiords have the ability to promote a much more selective fishing. The last main conclusion is that not all kinds of flexibility are sustainable. A deregulation of fisheries which opens up for even greater possibilities for exploiting many species will not be sustainable because these kinds of fishing use technology that do not distinguish how hard it exploits the various species. On the other hand, a deregulation that opens up for greater participation in the coastal and fiord fisheries can be sustainable because these fishermen have the possibility to choose which species they are going to exploit, and they have the ability to get incomes from other sectors when special kinds of species are not available.

ID AGRICULTURE; FAMILY
AB Contemporary 'sea-changes' in rural policy, particularly in Europe, are promoting a search for diversification and 'relocalization' of farming goals, values and systems away from the globalizing model of capitalist industrial productivism. Part of this quest has centred on an insight that some rural areas have 'lagged behind' in an uneven modernization process. There, persistence of more traditional styles of farming appears to offer prospects for revival of more 'ecological', less environmentally threatening, forms of production. This article presents the findings of a survey of Maltese farm-based opinion on prospects for development in this new policy setting. It takes rural Malta as a locality exhibiting 'lagging' characteristics which recur in other peripheral areas of the Mediterranean realm. The case-study evidence is used to suggest that defining a strategy which meets the shifting ambitions of policy makers while finding a consensus among highly differentiated local farmers may prove hard, particularly in the very 'marginal' settings which appear to have evaded full modernization.

AB The spatial organization of economic activities in the Pacific Rim has been significantly changed with the increase of international trade and Db and the emergence of cross-border regional economic zones or growth triangles in the Pacific Rim, especially in the Asian Pacific Rim. Localization and globalization of industries with various inter-firm relations have developed in the North American Pacific Rim. In this article, cooperative networking strategies, instead of rapid growth strategies, are suggested for the sustainable industrial development of the Pacific Rim. Inter-firm cooperative networking and localization, regional networking and regional industrial space, inter-regional networking and international economic integration, and networking the Pacific Rim are discussed as cooperative strategies of the spatial organization in the Pacific Rim for sustainable development.

AB The future won't resemble the past, and future leaders won't resemble past leaders. So, what qualities and skills will future leaders need? White proposes that the most effective leaders can learn a thing or two from children and experienced travelers. In other words, successful leaders will need to be adventuresome, not restricted by the past, and willing to explore new, uncharted territory, They will, in fact, seek uncertainty.
   Future leaders will eschew such familiar courses as generic mission statements, management fads, and leadership by machismo, What they don't know will become more important than what they do know. It will be OK for them to admit that they don't know all of the answers.
   The key will be to embrace ''difficult learning.'' Such learning means deliberately scouting areas for potential business benefits and developing capabilities in themselves, their people, and their organizations. Such learning provides sustainable competitive advantage, and isn't that what successful leadership is all about?
   Already, some organizations, such as British Airways and General Electric, are putting difficult learning into practice. They take the long view, questioning how things are done, seeking innovation, taking risks, and admitting mistakes and moving on.

AB The rationales for ecological and landscape engineering are becoming absorbed within economistic interpretations of sustainable development grounded in maintaining 'environmental capital'. These interpretations incorporate the possibility of compensating for the adverse impacts of development with environmental benefits of equivalent worth, thus maintaining the 'stock'. Habitat creation is an important form of this 'environmental compensation'. This paper explores the conflicts surrounding environmental compensation as sustainable development is translated into policy and practice in the British planning system. The extent to which environment damage can be meaningfully compensated raises difficult questions of environmental values and technical expertise. Analysis at two levels - national planning policy and the negotiation of compensatory habitat creation for a specific development scheme - indicates that the pursuit of environmental compensation through present planning processes can serve to accommodate development interests. Furthermore, claims about the manageability of environmental impacts help legitimize particular patterns of economic growth.

AB Debates about sustainability still take insufficient account of the significance of space and time. In this payer, their significance is demonstrated empirically through an account of the complex environmental and socio-economic impacts of dam construction on flood-plain wetlands in the Hadejia-Jama' are river basin in Nigeria. Socio-economic data from a rapid rural appraisal exercise and household questionnaire survey (data on patterns of production in the flood plain and patterns of mobility) are appraised in the context of patterns of environmental change and of inundation (analysis of riparian vegetation and time-series aerial photographs). The paper concludes that sustainable river basin development requires more attention to be paid to the perspectives derived from different scales of analysis. This calls for appropriate institutions allowing communication at the interface between village-level producer and river basin manager.

AB The history and development of South Africa has been linked strongly to the sea over the past 500 years, since the first visits by the early portuguese navigators in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The earliest coastal development was associated with the construction of ports and harbours, and the country now has sire commercial ports equipped with modem facilities, as well as a number of smaller ports used mainly by the fishing fleets. Construction of some of these has presented particular challenges, because of the littoral drift and its impact on adjacent beaches. Since the 1950s, a series of excellent facilities and amenities, including tidal pools and small craft marinas, has been developed for recreation, and the management of effluent has been managed through the construction of ocean outfalls. On the South African west coast, and extending into Namibia, there are rich coastal and offshore marine diamond deposits, and innovative approaches have been developed to allow their mining. For all of these developments, up-to-date, accurate environmental information has been a key input, and appropriate measuring networks and data-management techniques and facilities have been developed to allow the use of the information. Worldwide there has been a growing awareness of environmental issues. In 1992, one of the world's largest international environmental meetings took place in Rio De Janeiro. There, coastal states were urged to commit themselves to integrated and sustainable development of coastal areas, so giving impetus to the already growing international trend towards integrated coastal zone management (ICZM). People are adopting and demanding an integrated and holistic approach in the coastal area. South Africa was until recently excluded from the international community. Perhaps the most significant development in ICZM in South Africa is the participatory policy-formulation programme launched in the mid 1990s that will address the shortcomings currently experienced, Indeed, South Africa is poised on the brink of major advances in the field of ICZM. It is predicted that the country will become a major force in the advancement of all spheres of ICZM in both East Africa and the whole African continent. Historically coastal engineering proceeded with little regard for the environment. in many cases with devastating effects, from environmental, economic and social points of view. As the years went by, and information became more freely available, there was a growing awareness that the environment had to form part of the calculations, formulae and debate of coastal engineers and other interest groups operating in the coastal area. Therefore, over the past 30 years, marine and environmental scientists and coastal engineers in South Africa developed methodologies that allowed a holistic approach to the technological support for judicious development of the coastal and marine resources of South Africa. The path of increasing collaboration was initially fraught with conflict between engineers and environmentally orientated coastal managers. Recently, the two viewpoints have increasingly converged, and at present it would appear that a new breed of professional, coastal development scientists, consisting of coastal engineers and coastal, marine and environmental scientists, will be playing a key role in the sustainable development of our coastal resources.

AB The effect of dusting elemental sulphur (S) as a fungicide for controlling powdery mildew (Oidium anarcadii) disease in cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) upon soil fertility was studied in two agro-ecological zones (AEZ), termed C2 and E5. Annual S dusting decreased the pH of topsoil by up to 0.7 units over a period of four years dusting, reducing pH values to less than the critical 5.5 level in some areas. At most sites a decrease in pH was associated with the loss of major soil macronutrient elements from the topsoil due to leaching. An increase in Al saturation to toxic levels also occurred, particularly in A C2. Preliminary data showed that annual crop performance was also negatively affected by the increased soil acidity in some soils. From these results it was concluded that the annual application of S dust to control powdery mildew disease is not environmentally sustainable and alternative control strategies are needed with less damaging effects on environment.

AB In the practice of integrated urban water management it is difficult to choose the best combination of available techniques. This paper gives the outline of a decision network to make it easier. It consists of six steps: problem definition, technologies, selection procedure, combination, ranking by sustainability and costs. It is used in an iterative way. By looking at soil characteristics, surface water, groundwater and pollution aspects and by giving priority to sustainable techniques, foundations for a decision can be achieved. It is stated that techniques are sustainable, when they handle stormwater near the source and are visible (not hidden under the ground). From this point of view rainwater utilisation and infiltration are more sustainable than separate and combined sewer systems. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The mean annual load is related to the number of inhabitants and given in mass or volume per capita and year. The toilets are identified as predominant sources of N and P. 60 % of nitrogen and 80% of phosphor are concentrated in 2 liters or 1% of the water flow. The drainage system is a diluting system, The introduction of waste water separation at the source is recognized to be most effective to improve the surface waters quality. Innovative source separating technologies are recommended for modem drainages' future. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The development of appropriate strategies for the treatment and disposal of sewage sludge is a major problem for all conurbations throughout the world. Sludge treatment and disposal not only represents half of the total costs of municipal wastewater collection, treatment and disposal, but it is also strongly regulated, more so than almost any other form of waste, and readily attracts adverse media and public attention. Thus the challenge for wastewater authorities is to find affordable, sustainable and safe approaches to sludge management, which are also publicly acceptable. This paper describes the Best Environmental Option (BPEO) approach to identifying optimum sludge treatment and disposal strategies and its application to the sludge management problems of city of Warsaw and the surrounding region.

AB Rapid urbanisation and its consequent increase in impermeable surface areas and changes in land use has generally resulted in problems of flooding and heavy pollution of urban streams and other receiving waters. This has often been coupled with ground water depletion and a threat to water resources.
   The first part of this paper presents an alternative drainage philosophy and strategy which mimics nature's way by slowing down (attenuating) the movement of urban runoff. This approach results in cost-effective, affordable and sustainable drainage schemes. The alternative strategy can be described as one of prevention rather than cure by effecting controls closer to source rather than the traditional approach which results in the transfer of problems downstream, resulting in its cumulation and the need for large scale, centralised control.
   The second part describes a research project which has been launched in order to quantify the cost and operational benefits of source control and distributed storage. Details of the methodology of the modelling and simulation processes which are being followed to achieve this target are presented. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The character of urban water cycle does not comply with the principles of sustainability. The task of restructuring the urban water cycle is to create a system which is close to a natural. The approached method for this research was to develop and demonstrate a new comprehensive system in two cities of Germany (Dortmund and Zwickau). Standardized types of settlement structure were developped in order to obtain transferable results and to portray the total spectrum of urban planning situations. (C) 1997 IAWQ.

AB All the parts of an urban drainage system, i.e., the sewer system, the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the river, should be integrated into one single model to assess the performance of the overall system and for the development of design and control strategies assisting in its sustainable and cost effective management. Existing models for the individual components of the system have to be merged in order to develop the integrated tool. One of the problems arising from this methodology is the incompatibility of state variables, processes and parameters used in the different modelling approaches.
   Optimisation of an urban drainage system, and of the wastewater treatment process in particular, requires a good knowledge of the wastewater composition. As important transformations take place between the emission from the household and the arrival at the treatment facility, sewer models should include these transformations in the sewer system. At present, however, research is still needed in order to increase our knowledge of these in-sewer processes.
   A comparison of the state variables, processes and parameters has been carried out in both sewer models (SMs) and activated sludge models (ASMs). An ASM approach is used for the description of reactions in sewer models. However, a difference is found in the expression for organic material (expressed in terms of BOD) and heterotrophic biomass is absent as a state variable, resulting in differences in processes and parameters. Reconciliation of both the models seems worthwhile and a preliminary solution is suggested in this paper. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB New insights into the anaerobic degradation of very different categories of compounds, and into process and reactor technology will lead to very promising new generations of anaerobic treatment system, such as 'Expanded Granular Sludge Bed' (EGSB) and 'Staged Multi-Phase Anaerobic' (MPSA) reactor systems. These concepts will provide a higher efficiency at higher loading rates, are applicable for extreme environmental conditions (e.g. low and high temperatures) and to inhibitory compounds. Moreover, by integrating the anaerobic process with other biological methods (sulphate reduction, micro-aerophilic organisms) and with physical-chemical methods, a complete treatment of the wastewater can be accomplished at very low costs, while at the same time valuable components can be recovered for reuse.

AB Every year a variety of xenobiotic chemicals as pesticides, dyes,... are introduced on a very large scale. The majority of these compounds have a rather poor biodegradability. Hence, fresh water resources become more and more contaminated with micro-quantities of these man-made pollutants. Moreover, some of these obscure pollutants may have the undesirable capability of having oestrogenic activity on various high forms of life.
   This paper deals with the problems of micropollutants in drinking water production and wastewater treatment. The biocatalytic properties of microorganisms can be limiting for several reasons such as lower threshold values for metabolism, insufficient free energy change or inadequate metabolic knowledge base in the microbial cell or community.
   The limiting biodegradative capacity of natural microbial associations necessitates the development of more integrated water treatment and management. Research is necessary on two levels i.e. the search for biotechnological processes able to remove such chemicals through engineering of pathways and microbial associations, and the need for reliable biosensors able to generate information on residual microorganics. Trends such as improved biocatalysis and accurate process control are of major significance. However, a clear-cut scientific and political endorsement of the necessity to use reclaimed wastewater is of prime importance to evolve towards sustainable water treatment and management.

AB Sustainable water management is a challenge for the future, as is the question what role technology may play in this. In the framework of the Netherlands interdepartmental research programme Sustainable Technological Development a pilot study has been carried out on the feasibility of a sustainable urban-water chain. Relevant unsustainability factors have been analysed to decide in what way sustainability of the water system might be increased. The starting point was a reduction by a factor of 20 for realisation in the year 2040. Relevant ideas have been processed into scenarios, In the four scenarios emphasis has been placed on reduction of emissions into the water chain, reduction of water consumption, minimal pollution (source reduction) and on small-scale, When the ideas have been realised in the 'zero emission' scenario, a substantial reduction of unsustainability may be realised, The attendant technological changes need to be developed.

DE sustainability; wastewater treatment; Life Cycle Assessment;
   LCA-methodology; environmental impacts
AB In this study the insustainability of the treatment of municipal wastewater is evaluated with the LCA-methodology. Life-Cycle Assessments (LCA) analyze and assess the environmental profile over the entire life cycle of a product or process. The LCA-methodology proved to be a proper instrument to evaluate the wastewater treatment plant on the sustainability. However, environmental impacts which are caused by sludge handling should still be classified. Besides that, the LCA should be carried out on regional level instead of on national level. In a situation of high nutrient removal the contribution of the treatment of municipal wastewater to the total insustainability level in the Netherlands is relatively low. When the sustainability of the WWTP has to be improved, the most attention has to be paid to the minimization of discharge from pollutions with the effluent and minimization of the sludge production. Because the contribution of energy consumption is relatively low, less attention can be paid to the minimization of the energy demand. The building of a WWTP and the use of chemicals are not determining the insustainability of the WWTP. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

   Phragmites australis; Typha latifolia; sludge dewatering
AB Helophytes such as the common reed can be used for removing excess water from sludges from different sources such as municipal and industrial wastewaters and from dredging. Several pilot and full-scale studies indicate that the original dry-weight content of municipal wastewater sludge can be increased from about 1% to 40%. Reeds can grow in substrates polluted by several heavy metals without taking up and concentrating excessive amounts of these elements in their above-ground parts. In contrast with terrestrial plants and similar woody plants (willows) reeds can be at the origin of food-chains and so constitute a safe species for dumping sites. Sludge drying by reeds constitutes a sustainable procedure since it does not make use of manmade energy nor chemicals. Being atmosphere driven it is a reliable procedure but, in the short-term, of low predictability. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB New Zealand's primary environmental legislation, the Resource Management Act (RMA), was enacted in 1991. The RMA is effects based rather than activity based and is intended to promote the sustainable management of natural and physical resources. A number of New Zealand's pulp and paper mills are now coming under the permitting requirements of the RMA. The prime environmental concerns have been associated with the two kraft mills, and include dissolved oxygen, color, toxicity, nutrients and impacts on fisheries. This paper presents a case study of one of these mills and discusses the regulatory approach which is to be adopted under the constraints of the RMA. (C) 1997 IAWQ.

TI Wintering waterfowl community structure and the characteristics of

AB Wintering waterfowl community structure and their association with lake characteristics were studied in the Cotswold Water Park, a complex of more than 120 gravel pit lakes in southern England. The major distinction in community types was between assemblages dominated by diving waterfowl and those dominated by dabbling waterfowl. The trophic status of lakes was found to be a major determinant of community structure: young lakes in the early stages of a natural process of eutrophication tended to support the most diverse assemblages of diving waterfowl. The abundance of individual species was strongly related to lake size and assemblage type. Some effects of food supply and the recreational use of lakes were also apparent. The relevance of the findings for the sustainable value of the lakes for wintering waterfowl is discussed.

AB A growing number of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are adopting the collateral-free credit programs by anchoring them with their social development programs aimed at improved program effectiveness and sustainability. Drawing upon a sample of 3,564 targeted poor households covered by five small NGOs in rural Bangladesh, this study finds that the NGO credit-members as well as those who reside in the NGO program area are higher adopters of child immunization than those in the non-program area. Similarly the study found that infant and child mortality is lower among the NGO credit members than among the non-members and that under five-year deaths of children progressively decline with the increase in the doses of vaccines. Implications of these findings are discussed in the study.

DT Article
AB The Australian Wool Industry is facing a challenge to maintain international market share against substitute fibres.
   For a prolonged period, the industry as a whole has been reluctant to change. In recent years there has been a realisation by all sectors of the industry that unless producers deliver a product in demand by consumers the industry's future is bleak.
   NSW Agriculture is committed to assisting the wool industry to meet international consumer demand. NSW Agriculture commits significant resources to the NSW Wool industry, in research, extension services, education and animal health.
   The Department's goals for the Wool industry can be summarised succinctly as follows:
   1. Adjust Wool Quality to meet Consumer Demands
   2. Increase Profitability for Producers
   3. Develop Sustainable Systems
   4. Enhance
   These goals are currently being met through coordinated programs of research and adoption.
   Specifically this includes:
   Wool genetics
   Pasture and Rangelands Development and Management
   Animal Health Programs
   Agriculture Engineering
   NSW Agriculture is committed to undertaking research focussed on meeting industry needs, and packaging it in a way that maximizes adoption and implementation by industry.

AB In 1993 and 1994, the importance of weed strips as reservoir for coleopteran pests among Nitidulidae, Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae was investigated in two weed strips, in fields and the adjacent boundaries with the help of yellow traps, suction samples, visual observations and eclectors. During this research, several harmful species were observed, but always of very low abundance, except the blossom beetles, Meligethes spp.. They were, first of all, dependent on rape, but after the rape flowering time the new generation was found everywhere searching for food (pollen), especially on yellow flowers such as Sinapis alba in the strips. Oulema spp., Psylliodes chrysocephala, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Phyllotreta spp. (Chrysomelidae) and the Ceutorhynchus species (Curculionidae) were always connected to their host plant in the field and have only been caught more frequently in presence of the respective field. Sitona and Apion weevils also showed low abundance in the strips during both investigation periods. According to these results, weed strips have no enhancing effect on pest species, but in some cases they can offer food resources during the seasonal absence of the crop, as for the beneficial groups, too.
   The greatest diversity was revealed in the weed strips, even with rare species for Switzerland. Therefore, strip-management, providing ecological compensation areas, is an important measure for maintaining species conservation and contributes to biodiversity and sustainable agriculture.

AB Scope: This review summarizes the main issues discussed during Track D, which examined the societal impact of HIV/AIDS, and responses to the epidemic by individuals, families, communities and societies worldwide. Micro- and macrolevel issues addressed included the development, implementation and evaluation of programmes for prevention and care; policy development and implementation; structural issues such as the impact of gender relations, development and migration on the development of the epidemic; and the social and economic impact of HIV/AIDS on affected societies and communities.
   Recurrent themes: Presentations provided strong evidence that peer-led, community-based programmes offer particularly effective ways of working, and that participatory research involving affected communities provides useful results for the design and evaluation of programmes and policies. This is the case across settings, issues, populations and countries.
   Future directions: Emerging needs include how best to ensure sustainability of national and international responses, how best to scale up successful interventions for wider reach, and how best to work with systematically marginalized, neglected groups and populations. Research priorities include the characterization of the multiple determinants of HIV-related vulnerability, and the evaluation of interventions that take these complex determinants as their starting point. A more coherent and strategic response requires less separation between the different constituencies involved in AIDS work, and the more sustained involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS themselves.

DE sustainability; definitions; social processes; ''cultural theory''
AB What does Sustainable Forest Management mean? In order to get an understanding of what sustainable forest management means be side the huge variety of answers to this question and their sometimes contradictory meaning it seems reasonable to analyze the reasons why there are so many different interpretations in forestry science as well as in practical forestry. It is shown that it is not only conflicting interests but more often conflicting views of how reality works that produces different interpretations of Sustainable Forest Management. It is therefore concluded that the meanings of Sustainable Forest Management are negotiated in social processes and are not the results of a somehow accessible objective rationality.
   By picking up the ideas of ''Cultural Theory'' it is shown that all different interpretations over time and space can always be reduced to only 4 basic understandings of Sustainable Forest Management. As a conlusion it is discussed how the results can be applied to negotiation processes in society and thereby facilitate future implementations of Sustainable Forest Management.

AB Accelerating land degradation constitutes a risk for sustaining the environment as well as the livelihood of man. A holistic approach to the planning, development and management of land resources is required to meet the human and environmental needs and to combat degradation. It is essential to facilitate the dialogue in the planning process and to further cooperation between people and institutions by inviting all stakeholders to a participatory decision-making process. It is stated that action-oriented research, e.g. on the development of indicators of soil and land quality as well as of adapted technology packages, shall be enhanced. Approaches to promote sustainable land management and progress in soil and water conservation technologies were extensively discussed at the 9th ISCO Conference entitled ''Towards sustainable land use-furthering cooperation between people and institutions'', held in Bonn from 26-30 August 1996.

TI Sustainable band management for the semiarid and sub-humid tropics
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable land management (SLM) ensures adequate levels of current production whilst preserving the land resource base over time in order not to compromise or reduce development opportunities for future generations. This is particularly important globally in the large areas of the semiarid and sub-humid tropics. This paper presents five case studies involving different land management systems in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, Biophysical and socioeconomic causes of land degradation are first outlined, the linkages between them discussed, and regional commonalities and differences outlined. Practical procedures and recommendations are made on how to reverse the spiral of land degradation. These include the need to assess land degradation and sustainability, land quality change indicators, linking biophysical and socioeconomic information, and the institutional and funding mechanisms which may be necessary. A multidiscilinary and participatory approach directly involving the land users themselves is also recommended.

ID LAND DEGRADATION; BALANCES
AB Nutrient stocks and budgets (positive minus negative flows) are quantifiable indicators of sustainability, and are applied in this paper to classify agro-ecosystems. Earlier work revealed that most agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) can be labelled nonsustainable due to low nutrient stocks and negative nutrient budgets. To increase production and build sustainable agro-ecosystems in SSA, technologies that rank under ''integrated nutrient management'' (INM) should be adopted, to save nutrients from being lost, and to add new nutrient supplies to the system. An account is given of the socioeconomic factors at national and farm level, the interplay of which determines the actual adoption rate of INM. Based on an overview of what we do know and what we don't know, an INM research agenda is proposed that is based on the knowledge gaps.

AB Harvesting natural populations is practiced for many animal and plant species and frequently constitutes a part of the management of those populations. Similarly, enhancement through the release of captively bred animals and cultivated plants is an increasingly common practice in the management and protection of biological resources. Both harvest and enhancement may, however, constitute potential threats to biodiversity at the gene level. Many of these perils are not recognized today, and strategies for carrying out these activities in a genetically sustainable manner are largely lacking. The potentially negative effects on intraspecific biodiversity caused by harvest and enhancement are particularly serious when managing economically important species since those programs are typically carried out on a very large scale. Contrary to the potential perils associated with high technology DNA engineering and the release, or escape, of transgenic organisms, these genetic manipulations presently attract very little attention.

DE animal production; environmental impact
AB Environmental issues, linked to the production of animals in lowland farming systems, are reviewed, using pigs, poultry and dairy cattle as examples. The principal livestock production factors influencing their environmental impact are identified as the balance between different farm animal types and the husbandry practices used for these species, the variable potential which exists for the recycling of wastes and the modification of inputs to systems, the extent to which animal production can be integrated into move holistic farming systems and the impact of livestock on 'wildlife' (plant and animal) biodiversity. The production of large quantities of nitrogenous waste, resulting from the importation of large quantities of nitrogen to intensive animal production units, is identified as the major environmental problem for lowland animal production. The development of systems which allow these waste products to be re-used at sites of primary crop production is seen as a sustainable solution to this problem.

AB Objective: To explore options for the development of a set of indicators to assess the long-term outcomes achieved by all people with a given disabling condition in a given population.
   Data Sources: The review draws on empirical studies of predictive indicators, theoretical literature on long-term recovery processes, and literature from administrative science on the use of indicators in accountability systems.
   Study Selection: Studies were selected that explicitly sought to relate short-term and long-term outcomes or that explored the mediating factors in the relationship between impairment, disability, and handicap.
   Data Extraction: The focus of the review is on (1) empirical evidence of the relationship between short- and long-term outcomes, particularly in causal claims, and (2) theoretical analyses of the factors that mediate this relationship.
   Data Synthesis: Evidence is presented that certain outcome states can be considered thresholds that make the outcome usable and, hence, sustainable or that create the opportunity for further improvement. Such thresholds could meet the construct validity criteria necessary for measures that are to be used as indicators in an accountability system. The interaction between psychological and physical factors in setting thresholds means that both objective and subjective indicators are required in an indicator system.
   Conclusions: It may well be possible to develop a parsimonious set of population-based outcome indicators for people with disabilities. The key safeguards required are construct validity and the involvement of people with disabilities in both the development and use of the indicators.

AB Following the UNCED Conference of 1992, most nations have committed themselves to sustainable development. But what does this phrase mean in practice and how is it being implemented in federal countries such as Australia? In particular, what are the in?plications for peripheral regional economies such as Tasmania? This article examines the establishment and initial operations of the Sustainable Development Advisory Council (SDAC) in Tasmania and actions taken with respect to two major projects: development and ratification of a State Coastal Policy and redevelopment of the Mt Lyell copper mine in western Tasmania, designated a Project of State Significance (POSS). Both involve a perplexing conjunction of scientific uncertainty, economic significance and innovative policy-making. Do they indicate a need to reinvent policy process? What are the broader implications for public policy?

TI The diffusion of eco-farming in Germany and the concomitant development
   of the knowledge system supporting it
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB Eco-farming is considered by experts as the most suitable agricultural system for avoiding the environmental pollution of modern farming and realising a sustainable agriculture. Eco-farming could also be an answer to the acute problems of agricultural policy. Although it enjoys high consideration in the public discussion, based on its percentage of cultivated surface area (1,8 %) eco-farming plays an insignificant role in farming. To explain the relative advantages of eco-farming on the one hand and its limited practice on the other hand, the process of its diffusion (its creation and expansion as an innovation) and its knowledge system were examined.
   The growth of eco-farming took place in three phases. The first phase, its birth, began in 1924 with the-foundation of the bio-dynamic method. Its adoption was limited. The first expansion occurred in the second phase (1970-1988) through the increasing ecological consciousness of some farmers. As well, alternatives to the anthroposophically based bio-dynamic method now existed with the foundation of new eco-farming federations. The biggest expansion took place in the third phase (after 1989), with new government subsidies and farm conversions of large areas in the five new states of Germany.
   The extension of eco-farming followed the typical course of a diffusion process: The innovation is introduced by pioneers whose ideas are, at first, rejected. Once its practicability becomes evident, adoption by formerly sceptical farmers increases. The characteristics of eco-farming such as its complexity, risks, higher labour input, limited visibility, and the necessary conversion of the whole farm, have slowed down its speed of diffusion. However, one aspect of the expansion of eco-farming has been totally atypical of the diffusion process: It was not introduced as a scientific technical progress, but as a correction of this. It was not developed by the sciences and afterwards introduced by extension services, but was developed by the practice and later examined by science.
   Due to ethical beliefs, eco-farmers voluntarily restrict themselves from using certain management options. This is a special feature of its knowledge system and a main reason for its environmental compatibility. These voluntary restrictions owe their inspiration to an expanded understanding of science based on the natural science work of GOETHE. This special epistemology represents an enlargement to modern natural science. It includes the idea of man as a cognitive and morally accountable being as part of it's knowledge generation. This separates eco-farming from currently valid paradigms and is also an important reason for its limited extension up to now.
   Eco-farming offers an alternative to and, at the same time, points out the weaknesses of other knowledge systems. In the future, the practice of eco-farming will only expand if its knowledge system is protected from growing ''outside influences'', some dogmatism is abandoned, and its practitioners actively promote their ideas in society.

TI Sustainable agriculture in Agenda 21 - The implementation of the
   UN-action programme by the EU-common agricultural policy
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB An international attempt to transfer the concept of sustainable development into political programmes is the UN-action programme for the 21st century ''Agenda 21''. The voluminous document was adopted by 178 states at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which took place in Rio de Janeiro, June 1992. The newly established UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) shall control and its implementation. Being held in New York, April 1995, the 3rd session of the CSD dealt particularly with the model of Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD) which constitutes a considerable part of Agenda 21.
   The article evaluates to what extent Agenda 21 has been implemented be analysing the EU-Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) with reference to the action programme. After describing the history and contents of Agenda 21, its agricultural implications are listed and compared with the existing CAP. Aimed at feeding a growing world population, the main objective of sustainable agriculture - as defined in Agenda 21 - is to increase global food production. This should be accomplished, however in a sustainable way, and for example include supporting integrated farming systems and the withdrawal of unnecessary trade distortions.
   The article concludes that the CAP - despite some elements of its reform in 1992 and additional environmental programmes and legislation - has yet to fully implement Agenda 21. At the present, the implementation process takes place more on the informal level by promoting public awareness for and discussions on sustainable development rather than on the concrete macropolitical level.

AB This paper discusses policy responses to the potential loss of biodiversity in the Mara Area of Kenya from the conversion of essentially wild and undeveloped rangeland to developed agriculture. Property rights are central to the debate, and raise two fundamental issues. First, to what extent do the Maasai, the traditional users and owners of the land, have the right to benefit from the development potential of their land to further their economic, social and political standing, even if by so doing they create domestic and global externalities through the loss of biodiversity. Second, if the state alienates their development rights in the name of conservation, then to what extent should the state compensate the Maasai for their lost economic opportunities. To the Maasai, conservation as implemented through Government policy is a public bad: they are denied access to resources, their costs of production are significantly increased, and development is slowed down or actively discouraged. A cost:benefit analysis suggests that it is neither supportable nor sustainable to condemn the Maasai to a poverty trap on behalf of conservation, and that it is instead socially profitable for the Kenyan Government to meet in full their opportunity costs of forgone economic benefits.

One reason for their underemployment is the lack of fundamental information on their biology and ecology, needed to achieve more consistent biological control. Another reason is the requirement that each strain, formulation. and use be registered based on a policy to treat microbes as ''pesticides.'' The costs of registration, especially the costs of obtaining the necessary toxicological data patterned after requirements for chemical pesticides, rarely can be justified because the specific nature of microbial biocontrol agents limits their use to small and niche markers. Typically, a different biocontrol agent is needed for each pest or disease, or different agents are needed in different environments to control the same pest or disease. Studies are needed to identify the real risks of microbial biocontrol agents to human health and to the environment as a basis for appropriate regulation of these beneficial organisms. Furthermore, greater use should be made of microbial biocontrol, no matter how minor the use, including the use of genetically modified microbial biocontrol agents, so as to increase experience and familiarity with environmental uses of microorganisms among producers, processors, consumers, and the public.

AB An attempt is made to establish a relation between the question of what 'sustainable development' means and the non-linear theory of shock waves. Despite the presence of dispersive, i.e. entropy-producing, forces a soliton-like, isentropic, transport of a wilfully desired distribution in a field of traded commodities is possible. Starting with the classical Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation, two other examples, a sigmoidal and a Gaussian soliton in a diffusional environment, are analyzed in derail as a guide-line of how a 'sustainable' transport of an economically defined creation can be carried through time.

AB This article introduces and discusses some of the implications of the effects of the dual processes of economic and state restructuring on historic cities in England, The article focuses on the politics of development which are emerging in historic cities in response to structural changes in the local, regional and national economy, and the move to reconstitute English democratically elected local government into a more widely constituted system of local governance, There is a wide literature on the heritage industry and conservation of historic cities, but there is little which examines the political economy of these places and the extent to which this shapes the development agendas and strategies being produced, The article begins to chart how economic and political restructuring in England impacts on historic cities, and focuses on how provincial English historic cities are responding to a range of competing and often contradictory economic and political pressures, The emergence of sustainable development policy frameworks which seek to reconcile the potentially incompatible requirements of growth, conservation and environmental sustainability in historic cities are seen as key sites of political contestation.

AB Benefit-cost (BC) analysis offers a flawed instrument for examining the economic feasibility and environmental impact of a complex project. A BC analysis of the gigantic Paraguay-Parana Hidrovia project is inadequate because the massive structural changes induced by the Hidrovia transformations are just one part of an ambitious project for remaking the transport and production systems of South America; it will induce the remaking of economic systems, social structures and the environment itself. The role of the analyst must be to clarify the way in which nation-states, local communities and private capital will participate in defining how these structural transformations will be evaluated; furthermore, in the face of this proposed globalization of limited segments of the economy, there is a need to create alternative productive opportunities for the masses of people displaced by the infrastructure and its concomitant environmental disruptions.

TI Sustainable development principles and their implications for transport
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development principles; transport; mobility; accessibility
AB 'Sustainable mobility' has been adopted as an overall objective for European transport policy, and similar intentions are expressed in other parts of the world. However, little has been done to define what 'sustainable mobility' would actually imply for our understanding and assessment of transport. We suspect that this much used term could merely end up acting as a lubricant to the very development it was meant to challenge: The ever increasing movement of people and goods. In this article we attempt to place transport in the context of sustainable development principles. We emphasise the need to include principles of development (increasing well-being and equity) as well as sustainability (preserving natural and man-made capital). Four such principles are suggested, taking inspiration from Herman Daly and others. We then turn to explore the main features of transport, establishing a comprehensive transport concept. The concept combines a systems perspective with a service perspective. Omitting either one would disable a complete consideration of sustainable development. Our confrontation of the four principles with the reality of current transport trends gives rise to several critical implications. The most important of which relate to the contribution of transport to depleting natural capital and quality of life. Moreover, we are also forced to challenge the value of increasing mobility itself, if other forms of access may provide relevant substitutes. The article thereby outlines some conceptual foundations for a transport policy that could qualify as sustainable.

DE fisheries; contagion; catch-effort data; maximum likelihood estimation
AB A stochastic model of a fishery which recognizes a contagion effect in the fishing process (i.e. the fact that the events of individual fish being caught are not independent) is developed and is used to establish how the probability distribution of the aggregated annual catch of the fishery depends upon the aggregated annual fishing effort. From this relationship, and the assumption of deterministic, non-linear population dynamics, it is possible to determine analytically a likelihood function of the various model parameters (catchability coefficient, two parameters of the Ricker stock-dynamic model and a contagion parameter). Maximum likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio confidence intervals for these model parameters can then be obtained numerically. The method is applied to two sets of catch-effort data. The performance of the method is assessed by comparing predictions of catch and catch-per-unit-effort with observed values for reserved data which were not used for model fitting. Also confidence estimates of the maximum sustainable yield are obtained and the credibility of such estimates discussed.

DE Bernoulli valuation; extinction; management strategies; owl; population
   dynamics; risk assessment; sustainability
AB The concept of population viability is probabilistic in nature, usually being expressed through such indicators as 'expected extinction time', or 'probability of survival for 1000 years'. Such one-dimensional indicators might be adequate to characterize empirically-derived extinction risk in steady-state circumstances, such as in a long-established and undisturbed reserve. But they do not serve as well for evaluating viability in dynamically changing environments, nor for appraising the circumstantial evidence of risk provided by computer simulation of a stochastic population model. To characterize risk adequately in these circumstances requires describing a qualitative pattern of risk, sorting out short-term effects, due to initial population size and environmental state, from longer-term effects related to the character and quality of habitat. Furthermore, the relevant time-scales for the analysis depend upon the processes of change present in the habitat, including persistent effects from deliberate or inadvertent anthropogenic habitat manipulation. In the present study, alternative extinction risk indices and sustainability profiles are suggested, appropriate for formulating a risk management strategy in a dynamically changing environment. The concepts presented are applied to the problem of viability assessment of the endangered northern spotted owl, in the harvested temperate rainforest landscape of the U.S. Pacific Northwest.

AB This paper explores the relationship between discounting procedures and sustainable development in environmental economics. Sustainability criteria ensure that future generations enjoy a set of life opportunities that is undiminished relative to those of the present. Cost-benefit analysis may be used to detect potential improvements in economic efficiency, which make at least some members of society better off while leaving none worse off, if discount rates are equated with market rates of interest. Cost-benefit analysis and sustainability criteria are premised on value judgements that are complementary, not mutually exclusive, in the general framework of welfare economics. The paper outlines an integrated approach to long-term natural resource and environmental management that exploits the strengths of both sets of criteria.

DT Article
DE global warming; developing countries; sustainable development
AB There are concerns that the rapid development of the developing countries will hasten global warming and exacerbate resource problems. That is to say, it is quite possible that we cannot solve the North-South problem while at the same time containing global warming and conserving fossil fuels. But this paper attempts to show that, on the contrary, the fast development of these countries might very well bring about a long-term solution of the global warming problem. A model incorporating development stage theory is built and used to calculate by region the world's economic growth, population growth, energy supply and demand, CO2 emissions and other items up to the end of the 21st century. Results indicated that if in 2100 world population is about 10 billion (it was 5.1 billion in 1990), world GDP is US$200 trillion (1987 prices; it was US$20 trillion in 1990) and CO2 emissions are 10 billion tonnes (carbon equivalent; they were 5.8 billion tonnes in 1990), there will be fairly good prospects for solving the North-South, fossil fuel exhaustion and global warming problems. Making this scenario happen will require accelerating development of the developing countries so they quickly join the ranks of the developed countries, expediting the shift to renewable energy in the developed countries by imposing carbon taxes, transferring energy saving technologies from the developed to the developing countries, and other efforts.

AB Rural people in most of the developing countries are facing an acute shortage of domestic fuel which has led to many socio-economic and environmental problems. In an attempt to examine the nature and extent of the household energy problem, and to suggest certain measures to alleviate it, 432 sample households from eight sample villages in Haryana, north-western India, were surveyed using structured questionnaires during 1995. We find that there has been widespread switching over to low quality fuels (crop residue and dung cake), more time and effort are now spent in fetching fuelwood, biomass fuels have been monetized, and that severe degradation of vegetation cover has occurred. All these changes reflect the acute shortage of household energy in rural areas of Haryana State. It has almost become a crisis, particularly in the Eastern Haryana Region and in poor households. The common lands still provide a significant proportion of household fuel, especially to landless and marginal farming households. Hence, energy plantation on common lands is an immediate, feasible and sustainable solution to the rural energy problem. There is also an urgent need to prevent the wastage of energy by increasing end-use efficiency.

AB National Parks have become the most widely-used category of protected areas in developing countries, including sub-Saharan Africa. Several studies have shown that local-community support for National Parks is based mainly on perceptions of benefits and costs against the background of social, cultural, political and economic considerations. This paper examines the experience in the Cross River National Park (CRNP) in southeast Nigeria using data collected through rapid rural appraisal techniques, household questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions and guided interviews. The results show that in spite of a high level of community awareness of the need to conserve the forests of the study area, there is a low level of local support for the CRNP forest conservation initiative. Four main factors are identified as the main influences on the support extended to the project, namely: reality and expectations of socio-economic development, the pace of project implementation, the relationship between park staff and communities, and the historical rights of local people to the forest of the study area. The implications of the findings relate to the long-term sustainability of the CRNP as a protected forest area.

TI Ecosystem management: Implications for fisheries management - Summary
   and interpretation of a symposium at the 125th annual meeting of the
   American Fisheries Society
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
AB A panel of nine professional fish and wildlife scientists presented their views and exchanged ideas regarding ecosystem management during a symposium held in August 1995 at the American Fisheries Society's annual meeting in Tampa, Florida. The panelists agreed many fisheries resources are declining, and management efforts are not succeeding; natural resource management is increasing in complexity; and a change in management philosophy is needed. The panel agreed that ecosystem management is an evolution of management philosophy that focuses on local and large geographic scales, considers long-term temporal scales, and preserves biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems when making natural resource management decisions. They noted that the philosophy of ecosystem management considers human values and requires collaboration among government agencies, private property owners, and a wide array of stakeholders when making management decisions. The panel also identified a need for enhanced education and communication regarding ecological processes and issues among professional managers, agencies, and the public. Numerous unanswered questions remain, including the role of state agencies; the definition and measurement of parameters such as ecosystem health, integrity, and sustainability; and ways to blend economic, social, and ecological values in the decision-making process. The presenters agreed that implementing ecosystem management faces many hurdles but offers an opportunity for long-term protection and enhancement of sport and commercial fisheries.

ID RAIN-FOREST; POPULATIONS
AB The controlled extraction of timber from the Budongo Forest Reserve began in the 1930s. From the start of the operations it was intended that the timber should be harvested on a sustainable yield basis and the first of several 10-year working plans for the forest was drawn up in 1933. This paper documents the volume of timber removed, the date of logging, date of arboricide treatment and volume of arboricide applied in most compartments in the forest. Four species of mahogany formed about 65% of the timber extracted and this remained almost constant over the years despite attempts to encourage the use of other species by the Uganda Forest Department. Forest type maps made from sets of aerial photographs taken in 1951 and 1990 showed an increase in 'mixed forest' at the expense of 'Cynometra forest'; one of the major aims of the arboricide treatment.
   Ordination of the basal areas of the common tree species showed that the geographical position of a compartment explained more of the variation in species distribution than the variation between adjacent logged and unlogged compartments. A more detailed inventory of all species of tree in eight compartments across the forest showed greater species richness in the west of the forest and greater species richness in logged compartments. Measures of forest structure showed that more than 50 years is required for the forest to recover to pre-logging levels.

LA English
DT Article
AB This article presents the outcome of a Delphi study carried out between October 1995 and February 1996. The subject of the study is external sources of vehicle propulsion, and its possible role in achieving more sustainable modes of transportation, The Delphi study concludes that external propulsion technologies ave unlikely to be the substitute for internal combustion engines. External sources of power or energy are potentially a means of saving energy, because the weight of vehicles can be reduced and energy can be produced on a large scale thus boosting efficiency, However, there is no practical system by which these advantages can be realized without putting an unacceptable strain on the quality of the transport system. The costs would be huge; there would be considerable energy losses; safety problems could arise; and the flexibility of the users is limited, Electric vehicles could, however, become important. Pantographs and quick charging techniques could become important technologies if battery technology will not improve considerably. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Long-term participative regional planning is a relatively new and developing field in Australia. To conduct a futures project that seeks to address the serious matters of reef-related food production, jobs, recreation, cultural heritage and the conservation of the Great Barrier Reef with over 60 organizations participating, is not without its challenges. This futures project-the 25-year Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area Strategic Plan Development Project-has been described by the IUCN (The World Conservation Union) as having established a world model in participative regional planning for ecologically sustainable use of a natural resource. This article deals with the following questions: Why was the futures project needed? What was done? How was it achieved? What else needs to occur now and in the future? And, so what?

AB The economic structure of south China, including Hong Kong, has undergone rapid changes in the last 20 years. The transformation is more rapid in the wake of the opening up of China's economic system. This paper argues from the vantage point of the New International Division of Labour (NIDL) and investigates the impact of economic development and urban development strategies on the region. It reviews the process of economic development and the flows of resources, capital and labour forces in China as a whole, with special reference to Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta region. Increasing economic integration has led to interaction in the planning domain, such as in infrastructural development. Selected development strategies have also been employed and these will be discussed in detail. The paper concludes that future development between Hong Kong and south China will be a symbiotic one and that the implementation of a sustainable urban development strategy is vital to the continued growth of the region.

AB The workplace as a setting for promoting health and preventing disease - Brian Oldenburg and David Harris - Homeostasis 37,5,1996 - Various lifestyle factors such as smoking, diet, physical activity and alcohol consumption have been shown to be associated with some of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in developed and developing countries. By positively influencing these health risk behaviours, improvements in life expectancy and well being can be achieved, as well as a substantial reduction in societal costs.
   The workplace has been recognised as a critical setting for promoting health and preventing disease. If workplace based health promotion programs can be demonstrated to have even a small average intervention effect on individual employees, this has the potential to produce a substantial improvement in health outcomes across the whole community, given the size of the employed population. Interventions addressing multiple risk factors, as well as the physical and psychosocial environment, increase the likelihood of inducing sustainable behavioural change.
   Measuring the impact and effect of health promotion activity in the workplace, however, is not an easy task. Most worksite intervention studies to date have used inadequate study design and poor measurement. High attrition rates and poor reach have also compromised their efficacy and effectiveness. Furthermore, few systematic studies have provided definitive evidence that health promotion is a cost effective means of improving long term health outcomes and decreasing health care costs. The challenge will be to enhance employee participation in behaviour change by structural and organisational changes in the workplace environment. This requires firm commitment by management and participatory involvement of employees.

TI Sustainability of rice (Oryza sativa) wheat (Triticum aestivum)
   sequential cropping through introduction of legume crops and
   green-manure crop in the system
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
LA English
DT Article
ID FERTILIZER
AB A study was undertaken by replacing one of the cereal crops rice (Oryza sativa L.) or wheal (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) by a grain legume crop or to introduce summer greem-manure crop (Sesbania) in the sequence. Over 5 years period wheat yield was higher by 0.71 tonne/ha after pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] compared with that after rice. The fertilizer dose to rice after lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) or wheat after pigeonpea should remain the same as in rice-wheat sequence. The overall productivity of the system in terms of wheat equivalent was highest in pigeonpea-wheat sequence compared with lice-lentil or rice-wheat sequence. Introducing Sesbania green-manure in rice-wheat sequence increased its productivity by 1.08 tonnes/ha. Any reduction in fertilizer even with green-manuring brought reduction in system productivity. Introduction of legume in the system increased soil organic carbon and available soil phosphorus. Thus replacement of rice with pigeonpea for some time or introduction of Sesbania green-manuring may inhance the sustainability of rice-wheat system.

AB This is a discussion and analysis of the issues related to international trade and international technology to eliminate ozone-depleting substances on a global scale. The premise is that policies promoting trade and protecting the ozone layer through technology transfer are mutually reinforcing. The intent of simultaneously fostering trade and environmental improvement is encompassed in the concept of sustainable development and is so recognized in the trade measures to implement environmental agreements including the the Montreal Protocol for phasing out ozone-depleting substances.

AB Purpose: To develop a checkpoint-based strategy for preferential radiosensitization of human tumors with deficient and/or mutant p53.
   Methods and Materials: A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines differing in their expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene were produced by transduction with the E6 oncogene from human papilloma virus type 16. The cells expressing E6 (E6+) lack a G1 arrest in response to ionizing radiation, are deficient in p53 and p21 expression, and exhibit a fivefold greater clonogenic survival following 10 Gy radiation.
   Results: Postirradiation incubation with millimolar concentrations of the methylxanthine pentoxifylline (PTX) results in preferential radiosensitization of the E6+ cells compared to the LXSN+ vector transduced controls. There is a threefold sensitization of the LXSN+ cells and a 15-fold sensitization of the E6+ cells, which results in equal clonogenic survival of the two lines. Flow cytometry reveals PTX abrogation of the radiation induced G2 arrest for both cell lines. PTX also prolongs G1 transit for both cell lines. Preliminary results are presented using a novel methylxanthine, lisofylline (LSF), which has similar cell cycle effects on G1 and G2 and achieves differential radiosensitization at micromolar concentrations that are sustainable in humans.
   Conclusion: This checkpoint-based strategy is a promising approach for achieving preferential radiosensitization of p53- tumors relative to p53+ normal tissues. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The term 'sustainable development' is a prophetic combination of two words which unites both aspects - economic progress and environmental quality - in one vision. This vision of an economic structure that meets all needs of this generation without restricting the needs of future generations is highly attractive, because it reconciles the terms 'economy' and 'ecology' - terms seen so often as opposites - and postulates a generally acceptable distribution rule among generations. Lest the concept of sustainable development deteriorates into meaningless pleas, it must be anchored and designed to suit definite requirements. What is needed is a description of the concept that is as exact as possible, and details on how to implement it. Such a definition should allow for flexibility - but not arbitrariness - in implementing the concept. At the same time, the concept must have the strength of broadly accepted reasoning behind it in order to remain applicable above and beyond the interests of various players involved. The project of the Center of Technology Assessment in Baden-Wurttemberg with the title 'Qualitative Growth as Prerequisite for Sustainable Development in Baden-Wurttemberg' is an attempt to accomplish this objective. It is an attempt to help interpret the implications of the concept by developing general guidelines and conversation strategies for the various levels of players involved. It will then test, and try to improve upon, the means proposed to achieve the concept of sustainable development through case studies in the region that have been derived deductively from the concept.

AB The Lesser Himalaya, as the most densely populated part of the tectonically active and ecologically sensitive Himalayan mountain ranges, deserves specific attention to the conservation of the environment and the sustainable development of natural resources. Rapid growth of the human population during recent years, and the absence of any viable means of livelihood other than uneconomic crop farming have led to the uncontrolled exploitation of land areas and the consequent degradation and depletion of critical biophysical resources in the region. The need for sustainable development in Himalaya, therefore, makes it imperative to adopt a comprehensive land-use policy based on land capacity analysis that is scientific and practical. The main objective of this paper is to evolve an optimal land-use framework for the Gomti Watershed, situated in Kumaon, Lesser Himalaya. A detailed study of the traditional land use, regional agricultural system and the areas prone to environmental hazards was made throughout the watershed, through the preparation of large scale topographical forest and land record maps, field surveys and mapping. The average slope was considered as the principal parameter of land capacity, the potential for landslides and the intensity of erosion. Recognising the drastic changes that have taken place in the traditional land use, the watershed area has been proposed to be defined as protected forests (33.41%), community forests (32.86%), cultivation (23.33%) and horticulture (8.30%).

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Global Security; positive human survival; sustainable development;
   indeterminism
AB An interactive and incremental developmental approach to sustainable development is proposed. It requires broad public participation, is based on the development of a shared value system for civic society and norms which determine the behaviour of states. It is aimed at building commitment rather than directing change. This is achieved by simultaneoulsy harnessing the notions of 'positive human survival' adopted from Global Security theory and a co-evolutionary approach to human socio-economic constructs. Modern threats to Nation States can be regarded as 'threats without enemies', are not compatible with traditional views of sovereignty, and confronting such threats frequently requires co-operative behaviour and good neigbourliness from states. Principles likely to underpin an evolving shared value system for Nation states and civil society include: democracy, equity and diversity. In order to deal with the uncertainty of evolving socioeconomic constructs and the conceptual pluralism inherent in modern societies, public agencies need to develop significant mediation, negotiation and facilitation skills. This view has significant implications for National and Regional policy, and the democratisation of information and the development of early warning capabilities about potential threats to human security are pivotal.

   sustainable Europe
AB Environmental Space is being used by many groups throughout Europe as the basis for describing targets to make development in Europe sustainable. The concept is described together with the policy suggestions for a sustainable Europe emanating from the use of this method. The methodology of Environmental Space is then evaluated critically and its similarity with Ecological Footprints is noted. It is also noted that alternative calculations, using a materials balance approach, give a very different solution to some of the problems of making development sustainable, as addressed by the use of Environmental Space. This difference raises the questions of whether the approach is roughly right or not, and whether the policy prescriptions by using the Environmental Space method are misguided.

AB Environmental economics involve techniques for monetary valuations of environmental resources. But environmental problems raise fundamental questions of social, political and environmental organization. This article mirrors in economics the 'cross-over' of Left and Right suggested by Giddens. Positive economics leads to notions of planning, not to laissez-faire and makes evident Habermas's view of the 'scientization' of politics. Positive economics contains an implicit political theory of technocracy. Economics cannot conceive of social resources, and views environmental resources as externalities. It attempts to obtain money valuations for non-traded resources. Essentially, this is a planning supplement to markets and it is unclear how both markets and planning supplement can be justified simultaneously. Environmental questions are also ethical. We act as citizens in considering them. They are less suited to markets than to a public forum which requires justification in terms of the collective welfare and involves a process of dialogue between citizens.

AB The need for a wide range of analytical methods is indicated in the study of ecosystems for those changes which are related to anthropogenic activities, as well as for the introduction of sustainable development. A survey is presented of the various nuclear analytical methods and their underlying nuclear-physical basis. The advantageous features of these methods are considered: physically different basis, isotopic rather than elemental analysis, a limited or nonexistent effect of electrons and molecular structure, and the penetrating character of nuclear radiation. Suggestions are given for proper uses and full exploitation of nuclear analytical methods in environmental and related studies.

AB The types of fuel burned by juvenile rainbow trout (17 g) during a 58-h period of aerobic sustained exercise were studied by respirometry. Attempts to measure fuel usage by depletion (the compositional approach) in these same fish were unsuccessful due to lack of detectable changes in proximate body composition. O-2 consumption, CO2 excretion, and nitrogenous waste excretion (ammonia-N plus urea-N) were measured in individual fish swum continuously at 55% and 80% of maximum sustainable swimming speed and in non-swimming controls. O-2 consumption and CO2 excretion increased with swimming speed, and decreased over time. Absolute rates of N excretion were independent of swimming speed and time. Instantaneous aerobic fuel use, as calculated from the respiratory quotients and nitrogen quotients, was approximately 47% lipid, 30% protein, and 23% carbohydrate in non-swimmers at the start of the experiment. With increased swimming speed there was no change in absolute rates of protein oxidation, while lipid and carbohydrate oxidation both increased. Therefore, the relative protein contribution decreased with increasing speed but increased with swimming duration as the oxidation of other fuels declined over time. However, lipid oxidation predominated at all speeds and at all times. The relative contribution of carbohydrate increased with swimming speed and decreased over time. These results suggest that swimming becomes more efficient over time and help resolve uncertainties in the literature. We conclude that lipid is the main fuel of aerobic exercise, that protein catabolism is kept at minimum levels necessary for maintenance, and that carbohydrate oxidation becomes more important with increased white muscle recruitment at higher speed.

AB 1 It is widely assumed that grass-legume associations offer a way to sustainable, low input land use, with reduced environmental impact. However, a combination of both ecological and physiological principles may be needed to understand the sustainability of species balances.
   2 To increase understanding of grass-legume dynamics, we developed a model that extends a recently proposed pasture model (Thornley, Bergelson & Parsons: Annals of Botany 1995, 75, 79-94) by including selective grazing and spatial considerations, Population oscillations were shown to stem from the way grasses can exploit leguminous N fixation. If the legume is a relatively good competitor for light, populations do not oscillate near equilibrium, but in the converse case, populations do oscillate.
   3 Large amplitude oscillations can arise when there are sufficiently long time delays in the plant populations' responses to changes in the competitive environment. In the present model, these stem from variable internal substrate pools (of C and N), which uncouple biosynthesis from resource uptake, but other time delay mechanisms are easily envisaged.
   4 Urine deposits prevent the establishment of equilibrium within patches, but spatially random urine deposition stabilizes population fluctuations at the field scale. This is because perturbations to local N cycles desynchronize patches with regard to the grass-legume population cycle.
   5 Differences in the soil N environment (fertilizer input, leaching rate) determine whether the species can coexist, but where coexistence is possible, species composition regulates soil mineral N.
   6 Selective grazing (herbivory) does not essentially alter the grass-legume interaction, but complex foraging trade-offs lead to herbivory effects that may seem counterintuitive. The model has important implications for attempts to control the legume content of mixed species communities.

TI Conceptual design of Enertopia by Korea
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Conventional literature argues that the competitiveness of new energy technologies is dependent on existing market conditions. Moreover, contemporary analyses have suggested that enhanced, energy-related research and development activities alone an insufficient to ensure a sustainable future. Korea's energy policies, meanwhile, have given top priority to research and development of new energy technologies. Given the aforementioned approaches, the Korean government has adopted ''diffusion-oriented'' policies that encourage technology transfer, international alliances, and the dissemination of information to supplement research and development. In addition, it has adopted the policy that market barriers can be overcome in part by direct government involvement in the energy marketplace, under the premise of promoting the public good. The present paper analyzes Korea's national energy strategy, describes the potential contributions of new energy technologies, and provides an overview of Enertopia, a major demonstration project being sponsored by the central government to test the viability of the sustainable development concept.

TI Planning biosolids land application rates for agricultural systems
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
ID SLUDGE-LOADING RATES; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; FERTILIZERS
AB Federal regulations restrict land application of all but ''exceptional quality'' biosolids (sewage sludges) to ''agronomic rates.'' When municipal biosolids are applied to farmland over time, soil organic nitrogen accumulates, reducing the design application rates in succeeding years. This paper describes a simple linear algorithm useful for designing agronomic rates under such non-steady-state conditions. Designs are primarily determined by biosolids nitrogen content, crop nitrogen demand, and site denitrification rates. Percolating ground water can be incorporated, but the advantages of doing so are generally modest. This paper also describes how the economic sustainability of a site can be predicted. Examples are described for a Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, cornfield and for dryland wheat in Hemet, California. Over a 20-year planning period, cumulative applications in Wellsboro ranged from 120 to 162 Mg/ha dry weight, depending on the design approach. Systems are economically sustainable for from 13 to 16 years. Hemet values ranged from 43 to 96 Mg/ha dry weight.

TI Mechanisms involved in vibratory destabilization of NAPL ganglia in
   sands
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
ID DISPLACEMENT
AB Immiscible liquids when spilled into the ground or leaked from underground storage tanks tend to remain trapped in the form of discrete ganglia due to strong capillary forces. These ganglia often have low solubility in water and may remain in the subsurface over long periods of time creating a continuous source of pollution. Previous studies, which were exploratory in nature, showed that creation of localized vibrations could recover high percentages of trapped ganglia. Tn this paper, the mechanisms involved in the vibratory destabilization of ganglia are analyzed using results from two sets of experimental studies. It is postulated that, when vibrations result in compaction of sands, viscous pressures tend to destabilize the ganglia by splitting them whereas buoyancy pressures increase the maximum sustainable lengths. The roles of viscous and buoyancy pressures are reversed when vibrations result in increased porosities due to expansion (dilation) of soil. The volumes of trapped ganglia recovered during the experiments are consistent with these postulates. Experimental results also indicate significant recoveries in the cases where the ganglia are supposed to remain stable. These recoveries are attributed to the transient particle rearrangement during vibrations, which is concluded to be an important mechanism.

AB Although the contribution of red muscle to sustained swimming in fish has been studied in detail in recent years, the role of pink myotomal muscle has not received attention. Pink myotomal muscle in the scup (Stenotomus chrysops) lies just medial to red muscle, has the same longitudinal fibre orientation and is recruited along with the red muscle during steady sustainable swimming. However, pink muscle has significantly faster rates of relaxation, and the maximum velocity of shortening of pink muscle (7.26+/-0.18 muscle lengths s(-1), N=9, at 20 degrees C, and 4.46+/-0.15 muscle lengths s(-1), N=6, at 10 degrees C; mean +/- S.E.M.) is significantly faster than that of red muscle. These properties facilitate higher mass-specific maximum oscillatory power production relative to that of red muscle at frequencies similar to the tailbeat frequency at maximum sustained swimming speeds in scup. Additionally, pink muscle is found in anatomical positions in which red muscle produces very little power during swimming: the anterior region of the fish, which undergoes the lowest strain during swimming. Pink muscle produces more oscillatory power than red muscle under low-strain conditions (+/-2-3 %) and this may allow pink muscle to supplement the relatively low power generated by red muscle in the anterior regions of swimming scup.

AB Reproductive segregation among the large barbs Barbus intermedius complex, Cyprinidae, of Lake Tana, Ethiopia, was investigated in the mouths and upstream reaches of rivers tributary to the lake, during the spawning seasons of 1993 and 1994. The percentage of running fish of four Barbus morphotypes [Acute (Ac), Bigmouth big-eye (Be), Intermedius (In), and Shorthead (Sh)] peaks with the highest water level of the lake. Large differences are apparent in the minimum fork length of running fish among morphotypes [c. 12 cm for male Sh and 28 cm for male Bigmouth small-eye (Se)]. Significant differences occur in temporal, but especially in spatial patterns of the relative abundance of running morphotypes, when the lake is compared with the four major river mouths and their upstream reaches. These different relative abundances are dearest among Ac, Be, In, Sh and Troutlike (Tr). Also, the absence from the rivers of some morphotypes that are usually abundant in the lake itself [Barbel (Ba), Dark (Da), Lip (Li), and Zurki (Zu)], and the abundant presence in the rivers of Tr, rare in the lake, strengthen the hypothesis that spatial and/or temporal spawning segregation is present among the morphotypes. There are indications that Bighead (Bh) and Zu spawn in the lake itself, while other morphotypes were only found running in or near rivers. Combined with the morphological, ecological, and genetic differences, these data suggest the existence of several Barbus species, forming a unique species flock, which probably evolved within the lake. The presence of several, instead of one Barbus species complicates management of sustainable fisheries and protection of the lake's biodiversity. Present results show the importance of the rivers for Barbus reproduction and stress the urgent need for careful management of fishing activities in spawning times and areas.

AB The effects of a yard waste compost on densities of plant-parasitic nematodes and forage yield of maize (Zea mays) were determined over three seasons in two sites in north Florida. In each test, the experimental design was a randomized complete block with five replications and three treatments: 269 mt/ha of a yard waste compost C:N ratio = 35:1 to 46:1) applied to the soil surface as a mulch, 269 mt/ha of compost incorporated into the soil, and an unamended control. Of the nematodes found in these sites, Paratrichodorus minor was affected most by compost treatments, with densities at harvest reduced by a compost treatment on at least one sampling date in all three seasons (P less than or equal to 0.05). Meloidogyne incognita was not consistently affected by compost application. Densities of Criconemella spp. and Pratylenchus spp, were reduced by compost treatment much more often in the third season than in the first two seasons of the study (P less than or equal to 0.05). Forage yield of maize was increased (P less than or equal to 0.05) by both compost treatments in every test, with yield increases ranging from 10% to 212% over yield levels in unamended control plots and varying with season (P less than or equal to 0.05). Use of yard waste compost on agricultural sites may provide a beneficial amendment for crop production and a convenient means for disposal of a common waste product from urban areas. Effects of this compost with high C:N ratio on nematodes were long-term, often not appearing until the third season of the study.

TI Modelling network synergy: Static and dynamic aspects
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The present study aims at developing a new research approach based on the synergy concept as a driving force in network analysis and modelling. Starting from some introductory reflections identifying the role of network synergy in regional development and transportation science, it gives a new interpretation of synergy effects in a network by focusing the attention on three dimensions of economic network analysis, based on the related (network) production functions. These dimensions or levels are: (i)network links, (ii)uni-modal networks, and (iii) multi-modal networks. First, a static economic analysis is carried out with particular attention to the role played by connectivity and 'diversity' among actors/segments/layers in a network. Secondly, the restructuring effects of either complementarity or competition between different links and modalities are investigated by looking at the dynamic aspects of network performance by revisiting and investigating concepts from evolutionary ecology in connection with resilience and sustainability issues.

AB Historically, engineers have focused on providing the most cost-effective, effective, efficient use of resources to fulfill the goals and objectives of organizations they represent. Priorities have been local rather than global; a partnership of public and private interests has been the exception, not the rule. Today, the accelerating pace of technological advancement and a concern for the protection of limited natural resources mandate a partnership of interests to fuel innovative ideas for moving humankind into the age of sustainability. Meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs will require sustainable management practices, and engineers will take the lead as the managers of sustainability. First, however, fundamental changes must occur in engineering, regulatory, and bureaucratic philosophies. Engineers must become innovative thinkers, ensuring that technological applications incorporate sustainable development concepts. Regulatory policies must include positive economic incentives to encourage investment in research and development that leads to innovation. Finally, people at all levels of bureaucracy must become informed risk takers capable of making responsible, timely decisions.

TI The improvement of US North Korean relations: A journalist's view of the
   Japanese perspective
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB Washington-Pyongyong relations are swiftly moving toward the normalization through various diplomatic accords and improvement steps. Repeated bilateral talks have already produced MIA and other formal agreements.
   Given the dynamics of the two negotiators, the ongoing talks will lead to a fait accompli of full-scale normalization much sooner than observers have so far speculated. Why is the US in such a hurry? Speculations about US motives range from the political need for the forthcoming presidential election in November to a strategic necessity to secure US military footholds on the peninsula, Okinawa and their peripheral areas and to preempt the outbreak of armed conflict in the region. Other observers stress the fact that China is no less eager than the US to improve ties with its strategically vital buffer, North Korea.
   Whatever the motives and intentions, the US is determined to improve its relations with Pyongyang; but a crucial doubt exists among its allies and friends in the Asia-Pacific area whether Washington might be too eager to achieve just ''any'' improvement. Prior consultation as well as the speed and the substance of an agreement are closely related to the perception of respective national interest of the other nations concerned.
   They, Seoul and Tokyo, are ready and willing to cooperate in the improvement process, by planning to resume rice deliveries to Pyongyang and by collaborating in arms control and crisis management measures. In case of an unpredicted outbreak of armed crisis, even Japan, often labeled as a permanent bystander, can be expected to act promptly in providing the UN and US forces with wartime host nation support.
   On the other hand, few military experts believe Pyongyang has realistic capabilities of launching full-scale, sustainable sophisticated armed attacks on its neighbors. One exception is its missile capability; though limited in operational performance, the missiles are at least useful for bluffing or psychological warfare purposes. One countermeasure available to potential target nations will be a regional cooperation with the US program of R&D and production of tactical ballistic missile defense, a system primarily to uphold a minimum deterrence and designed to preempt either the demonstrative or the destructive launchings of tactical missiles. Such a deterrence posture coupled with arms control and crisis management measures collectively adopted might help to create a strategic environment in which all nations concerned can work for ''a peace that must nor end.''

AB Riparian forests in the Sahel zone of Africa are of considerable importance for human resource use and for their ecological and conservation value. Typical riparian forest tree species are dependent on river flows and a shallow aquifer, and the community and population structure of riparian forests is related to spatial and temporal patterns of flooding at a site. Therefore, changes in hydrology caused by darns cause changes in floodplain vegetation. This paper explores the spatio-temporal complexity of these changes through an analysis of regeneration in a Nigerian floodplain affected by dams built in the early 1970s. The study shows that under certain conditions, and given sufficient time, riparian forests may be changing to forest types more characteristic of unflooded, upland areas, The results of the study have implications for the way in which the sustainability of developments downstream of large darns are analysed, suggesting that assessment of impacts must take place within temporal parameters relevant to ecological processes and at spatial scales that encompass spatial variation in floodplain ecosystems.

AB The history of the Feniglia Dune is an example of human-induced degradation and rehabilitation of a Mediterranean ecosystem. Between 1700 and 1900 the forest almost completely disappeared owing to intensive exploitation. The rehabilitation of Feniglia started at the beginning of 1900 with dune consolidation and the sowing of Mediterranean pines. Reforestation was long and complex, and was finished in the 1950s. The evolution of the vegetation can be studied from an aerophotogrammetric series (1955, 1968, 1985 and 1989). GIS was used to analyse the cartographic images. The vegetation dynamics was positive, showing increased plant cover at least until 1985.
   The 1989 map showed the beginning of cover recession, probably as the result of a number of concurrent disturbing factors: the evolution of the coastline, and an increase in grazing and tourism. Since the Feniglia Dune vegetation is not a resilient natural coenosis, it still needs the support of human interventions to safeguard its natural dynamism.

   control on Rana sediments in central Spain

ID SOIL
AB Bench-terracing and Pinus afforestation have been extensively adopted as a means of soil conservation in Spain. This paper questions the appropriateness of this technology to extensively gullied soils and sediments of the Rana formation of central Spain. Bench-terracing has markedly altered the characteristics of the surface soil horizon as compared with nearby undisturbed matorral (natural scrub) vegetation. The construction process and resultant bench-terrace morphology have imposed a new, more spatially structured pattern in soil properties giving enhanced opportunities for overland flow generation and erosion. The terracing has exposed subsurface Bt horizons on inner treads and lower risers, producing a very compact clay rich surface horizon, low in organic carbon and of poor structural stability. Despite subsoiling hydraulic conductivity is very low. Excavated soil material is ploughed sideways to partially bury the original surface horizon and form part of the next riser downslope. Downslope drainage on the terraces gives rise to soil moisture contents approaching saturation on the lower risers and treads. Consequently only small rainfall inputs are required to initiate pending and overland flow generation on sloping treads. Rainfall simulation demonstrates the importance of antecedent soil moisture to runoff generation, and the role of vegetation and organic matter in retaining water. Erosion bridge measurements show that erosion rates on sloping treads are as high as those recorded on gully sidewalls. Gully sidewall erosion is also accelerated by runoff waters shed from terrace treads. Management of native matorral vegetation may provide a more sustainable approach to soil conservation than bench terracing with afforestation.

TI Accounting for sustainability: Challenges to landscape professionals in
   an increasingly unsustainable world
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Global human population growth presents compelling challenges to today's landscape professionals. In the final analysis, it is the world's landscapes from which must be coaxed, at feasible cost and indefinitely into the future, the productivity to provide an acceptable quality of life for a large, rapidly growing, and increasingly demanding human population. Landscape professionals ought, thereby, to be on the front line in addressing this challenge.
   They are uniquely qualified to play a critically decisive role in achieving a timely and stably productive compromise between humans and their landscapes. They must provide urgently needed substance to the currently ill-defined concepts of sustainability, carrying capacity, human ecosystem productivity, and quality of life. Such definition is essential to effective management. They must, as well, develop an understanding of the principles of human ecosystem productivity in preparation for a much-needed leadership role in catalyzing the increased landscape productivity necessary to provide a very large population an acceptable quality of life on a sustained basis.
   Most critically, they must apply the tools of landscape planning to develop systems for monitoring human ecosystem productivity to determine progress toward sustainability as well as its costs. To be useful, this monitoring must occur at local jurisdictional levels where effective management is possible, yet standardized sufficiently that synoptic analyses are possible involving the many remote areas that may affect local sustainability.

AB This paper explores the potential role of summer-active C-4 grasses in temperate areas in Australia from an ecological perspective. The main functional differences between C-3 and C-4 plants are briefly outlined. Taken together, the characteristics and environmental requirements of introduced C-3 perennial pasture cultivars lessen their natural competitive ability except in well-watered and cool habitats. C-4 plants are more competitive under conditions of high temperature and solar radiation. Within the C-4 group, grasses belonging to the subfamily Panicoideae usually prefer humid, wet environments and generally decline in importance with increasing grazing pressure and increased soil nitrogen (N) levels. Genera of Eragrostoideae generally prefer hot, dry habitats; they increase in dominance with increased prating pressure and N availability. These responses give the C-4 group as a whole a wider adaptive range and at the community level provide versatility in responses to changed conditions such as grazing. Based on their preferred zones of natural distribution, it appears that introduced C-3 pasture species are sown widely outside the area where they would be favoured to persist. The ecological impacts of grazing by domestic livestock and pasture improvement are briefly outlined with particular emphasis on changes in botanical composition. There are similarities between changes in Australian grasslands and those reported in South Africa. It is concluded that species which naturally increase in abundance in grazed pastures (such as some genera of Eragrostoideae) would offer considerable advantages for the development of naturally sustainable pastures. Such pasture species would offer a number of side-benefits including reduced rates of pH decline and deep drainage of excess water to water tables. These two problems represent major threats to agricultural sustainability in the temperate zone and both result from the inability of C-3 grass-based pastures to grow actively in summer.

AB Interest in the role of native pasture in production, land protection, and conservation is growing. Native pasture is often complementary to high-input pasture based on introduced perennial grasses, and both fit into a larger whole-farm and farm-family context. This paper presents several wide-ranging propositions which help frame this context in which farmers make decisions about native pasture, and in which budgetary analysis can play a useful role. A case study, based on south-western Victoria, evaluates the profitability of retaining native pasture or replacing it (or rundown pasture) by sowing an introduced perennial pasture. The paper also evaluates sowing native pasture where it is not present. It is concluded for south-western Victoria that sowing introduced perennial pasture is likely to be most profitable, but that retaining remaining areas of native pasture will leave farmers at least as well off in the long term. Sowing native pasture may have a niche role, as seed prices fall. Results are likely to differ when the approach is applied in other regions.

AB This review deals with the role of legumes in native and low-input perennial pastures in temperate Australia. It draws on lessons learnt from the problems associated with legume dominance and proposes development and management strategies to ensure a sustainable role for legumes in pasture systems in the future. The low-input syndrome is defined in geographical and management terms, and the historical role of legumes in pasture development/decline in the higher-rainfall zone of eastern Australia is summarised. In general, while the loss of perennial native grasses is often attributed to the introduction of a vigorous legume, other factors such as invasion of annual (Mediterranean) grasses and broad-leaf species, and the lack of appropriate grazing strategies must also share a significant responsibility for the decline in these species. The proposed characteristics of a stable, low-input pasture system are: a diverse range of species; a high degree of botanical stability; an economic level of production; and, efficient use of resources. The primary roles of legumes in low-input pasture systems are to maintain or increase soil nitrogen (N) levels, and to ensure pastures produce at an economically viable level without incurring major shifts in botanical composition. Suggested strategies for developing legumes specifically for low-input pastures include: selecting more persistent cultivars/species whether annuals or perennials; selecting legumes which are more phosphate (P) efficient and function at lower P levels found in low-input systems; evaluating the ability of legume species to add N to the systems; and, ensuring that cultivar development takes place under realistic sward conditions. The need for a better understanding of legume ecology in low-input perennial grass systems was identified as an important step in developing more stable low-input systems.

TI Deducing the body posture of extinct large vertebrates from the shape of
   the vertebral column
SO PALAEONTOLOGY

ID JUMPING HORSES; STRESSES; FEET
AB Simple measurements were taken from the vertebral column of several extinct and extant terrestrial vertebrates in order to estimate the bending moments in a sagittal plane that could be sustained along the longitudinal body axis. According to theoretical expectations, the estimated patterns of sustainable bending moments prove to differ between bipeds and quadrupeds of different body proportions. In an analysis of the vertebral column of the dinosaurs Plateosaurus and Iguanodon, the former appears as a habitual quadruped, while the latter must have assumed a bipedal posture more frequently or carried most weight on the hindlimbs during quadrupedal locomotion. A separate analysis of the cross sectional areas of the vertebral centra and the lever arms of the epaxial muscles gives further information on the use of the vertebral column during locomotion and reveals aspects of the ecology of the animals under study.

AB The ITE Edinburgh Forest Model, which describes diurnal and seasonal changes in the pools and fluxes of C, N and water in a fully coupled forest-soil system, was parametrized to simulate a managed conifer plantation in upland Britain, The model was used to examine (i) the transient effects on forest growth of an IS92a scenario of increasing [CO2] and temperature over two future rotations, and (ii) the equilibrium (sustainable) effects of all combinations of increases in [CO2] from 350 to 550 and 750 mu mol mol(-1), mean annual temperature from 7.5 to 8.5 and 9.5 degrees C and annual inputs of 20 or 40 kg N ha(-1), Changes in underlying processes represented in the model were then used to explain the responses, Eight conclusions were supported by the model for this forest type and climate.
   (1) Increasing temperatures above 3 degrees C alone may cause forest decline owing to water stress.
   (2) Elevated [CO2] can protect trees from water stress that they may otherwise suffer in response to increased temperature.
   (3) In N-limiting conditions, elevated [CO2] can increase allocation to roots with little increase in leaf area, whereas in N-rich conditions elevated [CO2] may not increase allocation to roots and generally increases leaf area.
   (4) Elevated [CO2] can decrease water use by forests in N-limited conditions and increase water use in N-rich conditions.
   (5) Elevated [CO2] can increase forest productivity even in N-limiting conditions owing to increased N acquisition and use efficiency.
   (6) Rising temperatures (along with rising [CO2]) may increase or decrease forest productivity depending on the supply of N and changes in water stress.
   (7) Gaseous losses of N from the soil can increase or decrease in response to elevated [CO2] and temperature.
   (8) Projected increases in [CO2] and temperature (IS92a) are likely to increase net ecosystem productivity and hence C sequestration in temperate forests.

AB An important assumption of many environmental decisions is that some patterns or combinations of land cover are optimal or more preferable to others. Management plans frequently seek to change the structure of a landscape to realise particular management goals, because it is recognized that the spatial arrangement of elements in a land cover mosaic control the ecological processes which operate within it. This study reviews some of the tools available to those who need to describe and understand the spatial structure of landscapes. In particular, it examines the way in which quantitative measures, or indices, can be used and what contribution they might make to the management of forested landscapes in the UK. The paper discusses the way in which the different landscape indices can be used to assess the spatial implications of the various design guidelines that have been proposed to promote sustainable forms of forestry. it is concluded that while progress has been made in the development of a range of landscape pattern measures, and in our understanding of the factors constraining their use, there is a pressing need for further research into the relationship between landscape pattern and ecological process.

DT Article
AB This report covers changes in the UK astronomy community between 1988 and 1993. The main conclusions are as follows:
   (1) The human resources situation has not deteriorated as badly as was predicted in 1988. The total population has risen by about 7 per cent, owing to the intake of more students from overseas, and the academic population has remained roughly constant.
   (2) The introduction of early retirement programmes, replacement of jobs falling vacant and the creation of posts in the new universities have enabled the age distribution of the population to adjust by allowing a higher appointment rate in 1988-1993 than was possible in the previous five years.
   (3) Nevertheless, three additional new positions per year are still required, across the whole of astronomy and space science, to bring the total to the 15 new appointments per year required to achieve a stable sustainable population with a lower peak in the age distribution.
   (4) The newly graduating PhD students, post-doctoral researchers and fellows who leave the astronomical community require more help with reorientation, career restructuring and networking with industry, so that they can be retained within the economic base of this country.

TI Revitalizing the inner city: A holistic approach
SO REVIEW OF BLACK POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
AB Michael Porter's ''Competitive Advantage of the Inner City'' focuses on the key role of private sector businesses in revitalizing and reclaiming the competitiveness of inner-city America. He provides a welcome opportunity to rethink the issue of inner-city revitalization. His views on the role of affirmative action programs and the benefits of private business initiative are valuable contributions to the current debates on these issues. However, if the ultimate objective of inner-city development is sustained revitalization of all positive aspects of the inner-city community, then we need to add a few other dimensions to Porter's model. This essay focuses on a more holistic approach that not only aims to Create opportunities, but also to raise the expectations of the people, to forge bonds of community and trust, to improve social justice and equality, and to establish a sense of accountability and ownership within the community. It argues that sustainable, long-term solutions to the complex and wide-ranging problems faced by the inner city can perhaps be best achieved by broad-based community building efforts. This involves the pooling of resources and a commitment by government, community based organizations, local residents, and private businesses.

TI Initiative for a competitive inner city: Prospectus
SO REVIEW OF BLACK POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
AB Responding to the disappointing efforts to revitalize America's inner-city economies, Professor Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School, an internationally recognized authority on competitive strategy, created the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City in 1994. The Initiative is founded on the premise that a sustainable economic base can only be created in the inner city as it has been elsewhere, through private for-profit initiatives and investment based on economic self-interest and genuine competitive advantage instead of on artificial inducements, government mandates, or charity.
   The Initiative's mission is to foster healthy economics in America's inner cities that create jobs and opportunity for local residents. To do so, the Initiative carries out research on inner-city economic opportunities and disseminates the findings to policy-makers in the public and private sectors as well as to the general public. The Initiative also provides critical assistance to inner-city businesses in a limited number of cities, demonstrating through first-hand experience that inner-city businesses can grow and generate jobs without government subsidies or mandates.
   Headquartered in Boston, the Initiative has launched programs in Boston, Baltimore, and Oakland.

TI Making comparative advantage work for economic opportunity
SO REVIEW OF BLACK POLITICAL ECONOMY
LA English
DT Article
AB Michael Porter's ''The Competitive Advantage of the Inner City'' is one of the most important articles in the field of economic and community development authored in the last ten years. All development policymakers and professionals should look closely at the piece, reflect on its message and decide how best to respond to its many recommendations. The article provides a needed correction to the prevailing emphases in the fields of economic and community development. It is animated by an appropriate sense of urgency. It also begins at the right starting point: the problem of jobs. Porter recognizes that the essential prerequisite for generating more and better employment opportunities is the creation of a sustainable, export-oriented economic base. He asks some tough questions about the effectiveness of past approaches and offers a number of appropriate criticisms of traditional approaches, such as the real estate model, the location incentive model, die social conscience model, and others. But it is not a complete and holistic framework for inner-city development. Indeed, it insufficiently addresses the challenge of ensuring that investments in economic clusters, business sectors, and anchors (for instance, ports, downtowns, etc.) work for greater economic empowerment and opportunity.

AB Ecology and sustainability have produced new challenges to traditional argumentation in urban planning. In addition to the rhetorical approach informed by Perelman's 'new rhetoric', the recent changes can be analysed by using more traditional philosophical argumentation critique, which is also in line with recent developments in argumentation theory. The state of the art in planning is analysed in this article through a case study of an architectural competition for 'ecological housing' held in Helsinki in 1995. The analysis illustrates the way that environmentalism produces new discursive means of justification, but not necessarily new types of urban planning.

DE household egg production; food security
AB A simple method of keeping laying hens has been developed with the aim of improving family nutrition through the provision of high quality egg protein at low cost. A unit is kept at a family's home and provides on average six eggs per day for daily household consumption after a number of eggs have been sold to cover the daily cost of feeding the hens. Hens are purchased at point of lay and are kept for 52 weeks during which time they would lay approximately 260 eggs under natural light. They are then sold for human consumption and the money used to purchase new point of lay pullets. The scheme is sustainable requiring no additional capital outlay, has a positive effect on household food security and could probably be successfully replicated in other African countries.

AB Helmeted guineafowl Numida meleagris populations in KwaZulu-Natal which once provided some of the best gamebird hunting in Africa have declined significantly over the past 15 years. This study investigated, by means of a questionnaire survey, the apparent collapse of guineafowl populations in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands and Drakensberg regions, and the potential agricultural causes thereof. The number of pesticides used, their toxicity levels, and the proportion of land under cultivation can be used to discriminate significantly between extinct and declining versus stable and increasing guineafowl populations, being higher in the former populations. These results suggest that efficient, intensive farming practices have not only compressed the period in the farming year over which food is available to the guineafowl, but also reduced the suitability of farmlands as wildlife habitat. Remedies are suggested to resuscitate declining populations and optimize their long-term preservation for potential sustainable utilization. Recommended management actions include the judicious use of pesticides and the creation of suitable habitat at the landscape scale.

AB Questionnaire surveys and catch inspections were employed to estimate the current annual yield to an informal Donax serra fishery and to assess the opinions of clam collectors as to the initiation of a commercial clam fishery. The current fishery is entirely recreational, without a subsistence component. It accounts for no more than 2% of the standing stock and less than 7% of the maximum sustainable yield. Existing regulations appear to be adequate for managing this fishery, despite frequent contraventions. Current participants in the recreational clam fishery are strongly opposed to a commercial harvest and the establishment of such an enterprise in the area would have to accommodate the requirements of recreationalists.

AB Training of veterinarians in animal resource management in Uganda have so far over-depended on traditional professional profiles based on conventional utilisation patterns. Critical analysis of existing resource-flows and innovative design of more appropriate and integrated utilisation models will be required to meet future increased quantitative and qualitative demands from resources and veterinary resource personnel. Ecological epidemiological and socio-economic approaches to integrated and sustainable utilisation must be given priority and have to be supplemented by conventional veterinary intervention. Examples of more appropriate demand-driven intervention approaches are provided. Practical field training supported by experts is crucial to realise utilisation opportunities.

DE benefit sharing; conflicts; conservation; equitable; local communities;
   management; ownership; resources; wildlife
AB African wildlife represents a unique type of terrestrial biodiversity whose current and future importance should not be underestimated. However, the future of wildlife in Africa is threatened as the largely protectionist approaches to conservation of this resource, which have been used for many years, are no longer viable. Local communities have had little or no role to play in the conservation of wildlife although they suffer from the inconveniences of sharing the same ecosystem with wildlife and receive a negligible share of the benefits that accrue from wildlife. Consequently, there is growing conflict between local communities and wildlife, whereby wildlife is not considered a priority form of land use since it does not offer immediate benefits to the local communities. In this paper we examine the issue of equitable sharing of benefits (and costs) of wildlife conservation in Africa, and the problems associated with local participation in the management of this resource with specific reference to Kenya and Zimbabwe. We further explore the issue of wildlife ownership and how this affects the local people's willingness to provide land for wildlife and hence its sustainable conservation. It is concluded that involvement and support of local communities in wildlife conservation is a prerequisite to effective and long-term conservation of wildlife and wildlands as part of the terrestrial biodiversity conservation. We propose that it is possible to reconcile the conservation of wild resources with economic development and human welfare so as to ensure that African countries with these resources have an incentive to ensure their long-term management and survival. New strategies for sustainable management of wildlife must address the issues of ownership as well as effective institutions and mechanisms of ensuring equitable sharing of benefits that accrue from wildlife.

AB The world swine population produces about 1.7 billion tonnes of liquid manure annually. At an application rate of 20 tonnes per hectare, this could fertilize about 85 million hectares of land annually. Storage and disposal of this material presents a challenge to producers because of the potential for environmental pollution. However, because swine manure contains essential plant nutrients, use of swine manure as a soil amendment for crop production is a practical method to solve the disposal problem. The composition and effectiveness of swine manure as a source of plant nutrients depends on several factors including type of ration fed, housing system, method of manure collection, storage and handling. Research has shown that manure application increased soil N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Na. However, heavy or excessive application of manure increased leaching of NO3-N, P and Mg. Swine manure is reported to be effective in increasing the yields of cereals, legumes, oilseeds, vegetables and pastures, and in increasing plant nutrient concentration, especially N, P and K. The efficient use of swine manure can be an agronomically and economically viable management practice for sustainable crop production in temperate regions such as the Canadian prairies where the swine industry is expanding rapidly.

AB The new ethic of sustainable development reinforces and extends the main principles of water resources management. Computer-based decision support systems are explored in order to identify their role in the implementation of these principles into water resource management practice. The presentation is divided in two parts. This article starts with the general definition of sustainable development. A set of principles is then identified and a short discussion of three main subsystems (ecological, economic, and social) follows. The main discussion is devoted to decision support systems (DSS) and their role in sustainable development. Discussion of DSS characteristics, architecture, and main components is provided, with special emphasis on the modifications required to address the principles of sustainability. A second article in this issue presents four successful case studies of decision support systems for sustainable management of water resources.

AB The new ethic of sustainable development extends the main principles of water resources management. Computer-based decision support systems are explored in order to identify their role in the implementation of these principles into water resource management practice. The first part of this research (see the previous article in this issue) has demonstrated that sustainable development is a global concept that needs to be made reality in any component of every decision support system to be developed for successful management of water resources. This article presents four successful case studies of decision support systems (DSSs) for sustainable management of water resources. Development of a DSS for sustainable water resource management is seen as a process, and while the issues covered in these four examples are the priorities in their respective domains it is certain that new issues will emerge in different fields of application. So, what is presented here is thus a snapshot of current best efforts.

AB Highly weathered soils in the tropics display nutrient deficiencies, especially of phosphorus (P) in low-activity clay soils. The objective of this work is to evaluate P distribution in soil fractions (>8 mm, 2-8 mm, 0.25-2 mm, 0.10-0.25 mm, < 0.10 mm) and to study the effect of management practices on P sustainability and availability. Surface and subsurface soil samples were taken from three different situations: virgin soil, degraded plantation of Ilex paraguariensis Saint Hil. (yerba mate), and a similar plantation consociated with Pennisetum purpureum Schumach (elephant grass), used as a mulch.
   For virgin soils, the highest P values were present in the < 0.1 mm fraction, where the organic-clay complex is more stabilized. Degraded agroecosystem presented low phosphorus values in the lines of the crops (rows) due to extraction of foliar nutrients with the harvests. Interrows (spaces between the lines of the crop) also had low P due to erosion phenomena. The influence of elephant grass was to increase P values in all fractions. This effect was remarkable in the >8 mm fractions; macroaggregates P is associated with decomposable material which is related to short-term fertility. Its beneficial action was also observed below the soil surface. Protecting the soil with mulch improved P sustainability in 'yerba mate' agroecosystems.

AB Environmental damages due to very intensive cropping systems do exist. A lot of people think it is necessary to prohibit the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as well as in developped and developping countries. If so, global production would dramatically decrease while human population is increasing. The objective of feeding population of the world could not be met, particularly in Africa. On the other hand, crop modelling shows that theoretical potential plant production in the world is sufficient, if environmental damages are avoided. Future challenge is double : increasing food production and protecting the environment. Different ways to achieve this goal are analyzed. Increasing food production only in developped countries is environmentally and economically not praticable because of high cost and social damages in developping countries. Each country has to increase its own production, particularly in the South. But adopting the very intensive cropping systems existing in the North is not possible. The challenge is to be able to increase crop production in each place, taking into account biophysical, sociological, economical and political peculiarities. In some places, existing extensive cropping systems cause damages to the environment, because population pressure lead to increase cultivated areas, consequently reducing fallow and pasture of forest areas : these systems are not sustainable if not intensified. In other places, even in the South, water pollution results from excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides. A new paradigm is proposed to take into account this great diversity of situations the <<Doubly Green Revolution>> will allow to define adapted and sustainable cropping systems. Scientific results obtained along last century and including recent results in biotechnology, will be at the basis of these new systems.

AB The major source of aquatic animal production is based on fisheries. Currently, a significant portion of the fishery resources is used for non-food purposes. One of the first steps towards rational exploitation of the natural fishery resources should be to limit such abuse and address the needs of an increasing global population. The challenge for the fishery industry is to develop methods for early and reliable prediction of stock availability and fluctuations in order to maintain a sustainable supply. With the continuing decline in fishery resources, aquaculture is slowly becoming an interesting alternative for the supply of animal protein of high nutritional value. Aquaculture, like any other human activity can have adverse effects on the environment. In this context, the semi-intensive farming systems prevailing in the tropical areas should be encouraged, substantiating them with scientific knowledge on the nutrient flow in such confined ecosystems. In some instances of intensive culture systems, progress has been made in aquaculture waste management by applying adequate nutritional strategies. Such an approach should be extended to other cultured species. Be it production for profit or production for food, sustainable aquatic animal production is intimately connected with all human activities, in as much as all these activities invariably have an effect on water quality. Hence, greater consideration is needed towards a general strategy of protecting the aquatic ecosystem at all levels.

We describe a model for doing so which emphasizes a team approach, minimizes the burden on clinicians, and uses brief counseling by allied professionals, videos, written materials, and telephone calls to augment clinician advice. The model has been implemented in several diverse settings including outpatient, inpatient, and dental clinic managed care; fee-for-service dentistry and pediatric practices; and planned parenthood clinics. Data from several randomized trials support the effectiveness of the approach. The brief, low-intensity interventions derived from the model appear to be sustainable on a routine basis in many settings.

ID COVER
AB Simulated long-term impacts of different cropping systems are evaluated and analyzed in terms of the tradeoffs among net returns and different components of environmental quality. The cropping systems are modeled after the BARC Sustainable Agriculture Demonstration Farm. EPIC was used to obtain crop yields, soil erosion, and the environmental fate of nitrogen, phosphorous, and herbicides in response to weather and management practices over a simulated 30 year period. This procedure provides a way to estimate the environmental impact of cropping rotations, and to analyze the tradeoffs between competing objectives, whether they are farm income, erosion control, or the reduction of multiple hazards. The results indicate that the no-till rotation provides the greatest net returns, followed by the conventional rotation, The net returns on the two cover crop rotations are lowest. In terms of environmental impacts, no-till rotation dominates all other rotations with lowest nitrogen loss, and the covercrop rotations perform best in terms of erosion and phosphorous loss. However because herbicides are necessary to control weeds in no-till, the pesticide hazard index is very high, suggesting a tradeoff between pesticide hazard and other environmental considerations. To provide decision makers with better information, an environmental hazard index was constructed to analyze the tradeoffs between potential chemical contamination and net returns, Depending on preference structure, any one of three rotations could be preferred: no-till; manure at medium application rates; and cover crop without fertilizer.

AB Vegetable production in the Cameron Highlands of Malaysia has expanded over the past 25 years and has been implicated in the increase in sedimentation in reservoirs in the region. The present study was executed to evaluate current methods, patterns and profitability of vegetable production; study the causes, environmental impact and externality cost of soil erosion; assess the effectiveness and adoption of soil conservation and management practices; determine the extent of adoption of integrated pest management methods; and elicit farmers' perceptions regarding the main constraints in vegetable cultivation. Recent changes in land use within the area are quantified by a geographical information system, Landsat imagery, a digital elevation model and a 1992 farm survey of 10% of the farmers. Farmers modify the natural environment by mechanical excavations and other earthworks, and compensate for the negative effects of soil erosion on productivity by extensive use of irrigation, chicken manure, lime, and inorganic fertilizers. The preparation of broad platform terraces, cut out of the natural slope, is a major source of soil erosion which is estimated at 24 t ha(-1) year(-1) on average. However, on a per event basis, soil loss may be as high as 155 t ha(-1) per event. Terraces are resurfaced periodically because of impoverished soil and reducing yields. Bench terraces, while reducing erosion, are rare owing to labor shortages. With the exception of polyethylene rain shelters, other agronomic practices do not substantially reduce soil erosion. Recommendations are made regarding the timing of land clearing and resurfacing of terraces, and suggestions for interventions that may improve catchment management are offered. The value of the negative externalities imposed on the Electricity Board as a result of sedimentation in waterways and reservoirs is estimated at M$ 2 X 10(6) per year, or less than 4% of the total annual gross value of vegetable production in the CH. However, soil erosion resulting from vegetable cultivation in the CH is likely to cause other negative off-site effects that cannot easily be quantified, including adverse effects on public health as a result of run-off of chemicals, loss of wildlife habitat, and potential loss of tourism.

AB Allelopathic inhibition typically results from the combined action of a group of allelochemicals which, collectively, interfere with several physiological processes. The objectives of this paper are to summarize research that illustrates the joint action of allelochemicals, and to provide evidence that both the amount and detrimental action of these compounds depends on the extent of associated abiotic and biotic stresses. Allelopathy is strongly coupled with other stresses of the crop environment, including insects and disease, temperature extremes, nutrient and moisture variables, radiation, and herbicides. These stress conditions often enhance allelochemical production, thus increasing the potential for allelopathic interference. In the paradigm of interactions, the data indicate that crops are more sensitive to allelopathy when moisture, temperature, or nutrient conditions are less than optimal. For example, the inhibition threshold concentration for ferulic acid to affect seedling growth was reduced with even minor moisture stress (psi = -0.15 MPa) or a growth temperature at the higher end of the normal range for a species. Under greenhouse conditions, additive inhibition resulted from the joint action of ferulic acid with low levels of alachlor [2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl)acetamide], atrazine [6-chloro-N-ethyl-N'-(1-methylethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine], or trifluralin [2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzenamine]. Interactions of multiple stresses in crop environments will determine the relative impact of allelopathy. Allelopathy-stress interactions also have implications for herbicide and residue management strategies, crop rotations, biological control measures, and tillage practices that can contribute to a more sustainable agriculture.

AB One of the most urgent enabling measures for sustainable forest development is the valuation of the resource for the full extent of benefits that can be provided. The total economic valuation (TEV) framework was applied to the peat swamp forests of North Selangor, and the TEV was estimated for a range of management options. A variety of methods, such as market prices, damage avoided cost approach, replacement cost approach and production-function effect, were used in the study. The results demonstrate that there are sufficient economic reasons at the local and national level for the shift to be made towards improved sustainable forest management. For the shift to more sustainable options to be actually adopted, however, there is a further requirement for new international financial mechanisms. Nevertheless, it would be unwise for Malaysia, or any developing country, to await international transfers before pursuing sustainability paths, especially if this wait undermines its own resources and economy.

AB A sustainable global strategy for energy and the environment should be based on two fundamental precepts: the effective harnessing of ambient energy (that originating from either incident insolation or gravitational forces between the Earth and the Moon); the employment of processes that ensure the harnessed energy is used efficiently, for example, via CHP plant or fuel cells, and in general through well designed and operated, and usually thermally insulated systems. If present trends persist, the world may experience by the middle of the twenty-first century severe difficulties in meeting from fossil fuels its requirements for energy. Thus the UK needs to avoid acting exclusively for the short term, and to devise and soon implement a long-term strategy for energy and environmental. This report identifies the constraints on British energy policy and assesses future prospects for various energy sources, including their environmental impacts. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd

ID COMMONS DILEMMA
AB A Hypercard-based computer simulation is described here that allows testing and projections about decision making in commons dilemmas. Although the program applies to many different types of value tradeoffs, it focuses on issues related to the harvesting (and overharvesting) of natural resources. In particular, it uses the Atlantic fisheries to look at conflicts between satisfying immediate needs and protecting long-term sustainability. The program's calculations and projections are based on variables including fish stocks, replenishment rate, average household expenses, value per ton of fish, amount of fishing per year, number of competitors, harvesting strategy of competing decision makers, actual fish caught per year, yearly income, and the levels of harvesting that would maintain a sustainable level of the resource. The multimedia interface includes on-screen movies, moving graphs of results, still photos, cartoon animation, and audio inst ructions. This simulation program provides an engaging way of collecting data on decision making in social dilemmas and is also well suited to public/educational presentations.

ID REFORM
AB Educators frequently lament the limited effect research has on educational practices. Special educators often are frustrated by the observation that there appears to be a haphazard or inverse relationship between popular intervention procedures and reliable research data. Addressing research-to-practice issues effectively requires getting researchers to do better research and getting policymakers to make better choices. Better research is characterized by trustworthiness, useability, and accessibility. In addition, research-based procedures should involve minimal risk of harm, be practical and sustainable, be believable and socially valid, be implemented with a high degree of fidelity, and be accompanied by systematic training programs. Consensus must be built among influence producers, knowledge producers, regulation producers, and knowledge consumers regarding needed research and criteria for selecting interventions. Future research should be directed toward finding ways to suppress the tendency to accept unsubstantiated claims for methods and materials and to construct a culture of support for research-based practices. Special attention should be given to finding ways to maintain research-based practices after they have been taught.

AB Opschoor and Reijnders (1991) propose a simple structure for the development of physical indicators of sustainable development. It begins with the development of two types of environmental indicators: one describing the pressure being placed on the environment, and one describing the effects of this pressure. The sustainability indicator then measures the distance between current or predicted conditions, as described in these simple 'state' indicators, and a reference condition.
   The reference condition is equated to sustainability. Specification of this reference requires the making of explicit choices as to the types of environmental change. It implies setting standards which make the criteria for sustainability explicit.
   The power of this simple construct is demonstrated using three examples. The first Sustainability indicator comprises a pressure indicator describing acid deposition in the Netherlands and a reference condition based on ecosystem sensitivity to this deposition. The second comprises an effect indicator describing species composition in the Dutch North Sea and a reference condition based on past species composition before this ecosystem was adversely affected by pollution, overfishing, etc. The third indicator deals with cadmium accumulation in Dutch soil. It identifies two criteria for sustainability, one constraining additions of cadmium to soil and one specifying soil quality. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB For comparison and assessment of project-effects, in the case of interventions undertaken in developing countries, there is a requirement for the definition of a scale against which activities can be measured and verified in evaluating their contribution towards ''sustainability''. In order to create such a scale, indicators for sustainable development have to be identified. The UNESCO-Jakarta office has been actively involved in the process of defining indicators for environmentally sound and sustainable development (ESSD) in the region of south and southeast Asia. A UN inter-agency working group was established to define a list of areas for the elaboration of ESSD indicators to be used as a common framework for evaluating development activities in terms of environmental issues. During meetings of this working group the UN agencies actually involved with the issue provided suggestions which were then analysed by UNESCO and combined to an outline of ESSD indicators. The input of all UN agencies has been analysed in order to classify the suggested ESSD indicators using a structural outline developed by UNESCO covering dominant environmental processes. A summary has been derived which takes into account the suggestions made by the different UN agencies. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Governments throughout the Asia-Pacific region during the 1990s are increasingly seeking ways to develop research policies that target national socio-economic objectives, within an overall framework of 'sustainable development'. However, the concept of sustainable development varies from country to country and so do indicators for accounting for economic, research and development data. Research indicators in most countries remain disconnected from national strategies for sustainable development. Given the importance of research investment for social, economic and technological development, it is important to develop a model for connecting this particular investment to strategies for sustainable development.
   During the past five years the Centre for Research Policy (CRP) has been involved with many countries throughout the Asian region in developing indicators and information systems for monitoring and driving national research policies. This work has been carried out under the auspices of the UNESCO Science and Technology Policy Asian Network (STEPAN), for which CRP provides the regional focal point. The Australian government has recently commissioned CRP to carry out a study in order to develop a working definition of research relevant to ecologically sustainable development (ESD) and to develop a methodology to determine and assess indicators of the nature and level of research relevant to ESD. Practical aspects of the development of these indicators in Australia are outlined and the possible integration of these with other R&D indicators is discussed in the context of developments in the Asia-Pacific region.

AB While students of Ecological Economics discuss at length the social and environmental dysfunction associated with the standard economic model (why things go wrong?) and provide generous counsel on how to make things right, there has been singular lack of formalism in the concept of ''right'' and ''wrong''. This paper explores the ontology of sustainable development (SD) indicators within a general context of economic theory and conservation principles, (Mirowski 1989). These principles are then married to entailment properties of general systems structure, (Rosen, 1991). Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd

AB We examine the relationship between socioeconomic equity in opportunity and sustainability, as reflected in patterns of food production and fertility. Our analysis spans various levels of social organization, from within the household (gender- and age-related equity) to relations among households (of different material wealth), among regions (particularly rural vs. urban), and among nations (rich and poor). Our preliminary results in this complex area suggest that increasing equality of opportunity at each of these levels can help to increase food production and to lower fertility rates, through varied mechanisms. Working toward such equity constitutes a ''no regrets'' strategy for transitioning to a sustainable society and increasing Earth's carrying capacity for human beings, as measures to reduce the growing disparity between rich and poor have merit on ethical grounds alone. An important caveat, however, is that equity in consumer lifestyles within and between nations cannot be achieved globally by leveling up to consumption from the bottom, Runaway consumption in rich countries must be curbed as part of an effort to reduce the scale of human enterprise to below carrying capacity while still permitting needed development among the poor.

AB After deploring the mystification of the term ''sustainability'' and tendencies to conflate it with society's desiderata, we desegregate three types of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental. After clarifying these three linked and overlapping concepts, and construing them with ''sustainable development,'' we distinguish quantitative throughput growth from qualitative development, and mention intergenerational equity and scarcity of natural capital that together lead to the definition of ''environmental sustainability'' by the output/input rule, i.e., keep wastes within assimilative capacities; harvest within regenerative capacities of renewable resources; deplete non-renewables at the rate at which renewable substitutes are developed.
   After distinguishing development from sustainability and from growth, the paper describes the concept of natural capital and uses the concept to present four alternative definitions of environmental sustainability. Next, the paper presents criteria for analyzing environmental sustainability and uses the Ehrlich-Holdren framework in which ''Population,'' ''Affluence,'' and ''Technology'' are examined separately. The paper then nuances the I = PAT identity and starts to disaggregate the components of sustainability into more dynamic formulations. The final section describes how one large development agency, the World Bank, is endeavoring to incorporate these new principles into its operations.

AB Ecosystem models often follow the mass flow of matter (e.g., carbon, nutrients, trace metals, and contaminants) through food webs. Many ecosystem models (approximate to 75% in a survey of recent literature) assume that carbon allocated to growth is a constant fraction of consumption. I use a simple predator-prey model to demonstrate that the method of allocating consumed carbon to predator biomass (as a constant fraction or as a variable based on bioenergetics) can greatly affect the predicted dynamics of carbon and other matter. I then evaluate the potential disparity in the two carbon allocation methods by comparing predictions of constant and bioenergetics-based assimilation versions of a Lake Ontario pelagic food web model under hypothetical management scenarios. Given current lake productivity and salmonid stocking, the version with constant assimilation efficiency predicted 22% more alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) biomass than the bioenergetics-based version at year 2005. When these models were calibrated to produce similar whole-lake adult sport fish biomass, the constant assimilation model predicted 27% less alewife biomass at year 2005 than the bioenergetics-based version. The two approaches predicted opposite directions of change in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations of stocked sport fish as their growth rates declined. Differences in the predicted PCB concentrations were as much as 450% when lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) growth rates declined 60%. Assuming constant carbon assimilation may be acceptable for models of biomass when interest is only in one trophic level or where growth rates are static. However, constant assimilation efficiencies are inappropriate for models of trophic interactions (e.g., predictions of predation rates and prey sustainability), nutrient recycling, contaminants, trace metals, or changes in productivity.

AB The recent Forum in this journal, Perspectives on Ecosystem Management, prompts a comment that may seem obvious: ecology, and associated environmental disciplines are, and will become more so, the undergirding sciences for ecosystem management-just as the health sciences are for medicine. But, the readiness of ecology for such applications is a matter of debate among leaders in the field, while it is being taken for granted, in terms of limited research support, by landscape managers. The ongoing manipulations (e.g., production, conservation, restoration) on federal lands can be a vehicle for needed research at management scales of space and time-if ecological scientists bring a consensus to, and initiate, collaborative planning with federal officials for a strategy to implement ecosystem management.

AB A fundamental step in integrated environmental assessment (IEA) is the choice of an assessment framework. The usual attempt to develop integrated assessments of different options is to apply a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), which is an important part of the IEA, but at the same time is one of its weakest points. One should note that this paper does not aim at presenting new advances on specific issues of CBA. The present paper has as a main objective to analyse the role of CBA in the IEA framework, in particular: (1) to make explicit the economical, philosophical and mathematical assumptions on which CBA is based; (2) to discuss the main characteristics and consequences of these assumptions; (3) to test the consistency and compatibility of such an axiomatic system. It is thought that this is useful above all for non-economists involved in IEA studies.

AB While extinctions of individual species are part of a normal cycle, the current rate of extinctions should be a concern to us all. The maintenance of biological diversity is important for utilitarian reasons, quality oi life considerations, and because biodiversity is important to sustainable regional economies. Single-species approaches are too limited to protect biodiversity at the landscape, habitat, and watershed levels. New approaches are necessary to deal with the complexity of biological diversity. The administration is using provisions in the Endangered Species Act to bring about broader multispecies habitat protection. The ecosystem approach provides a framework for ensuring that ecological considerations are taken into account, along with economic and social factors, and that all interested parties are able to participate in the decision-making process.

ID EXTINCTIONS; POLICY
AB The term biodiversity describes the array of interacting, genetically distinct populations and species in a region, the communities they comprise, and the variety oi ecosystems of which they are functioning parts. Ecosystem health, a closely related concept, is described in terms of a process identifying biological indicators, end points, and values. The decline of populations or species, an accelerating trend worldwide, can lead to simplification of ecosystem processes, thus threatening the stability and sustainability of ecosystem services directly relevant to human welfare in the chain of economic and ecological relationships. The challenge of addressing issues of such enormous scope and complexity has highlighted the limitations of ecology-as-science. Additionally biosphere-scale conflicts seem to lie beyond the scope of conventional economics, leading to differences of opinion about the commodity Value oi biodiversity and of the services that intact ecosystems provide. In the face of these uncertainties, many scientists and economists have adopted principles that clearly assign burdens of proof to those who would promote the loss of biodiversity and that also establish ''near-trump'' (preeminent) status for ecological integrity. Electric utility facilities and operations impact biodiversity whenever construction, operation, or maintenance of generation, delivery, and support facilities alters landscapes and habitats and thereby impacts species. Although industry is accustomed to dealing with broad environmental concerns (such as global warming or acid rain), the biodiversity issue invokes hemisphere-wide, regional, local, and site-specific concerns all at the same time. Industry can proactively address these issues of scope and scale in two main ways: first, by aligning strategically with the broad research agenda put forth by informed scientists and institutions; and second, by supporting focused management processes whose results will contribute incrementally to the broader agenda of rebuilding or maintaining biodiversity.

AB The project on Biodiversity Uncertainties and Research Needs (BURN) ensures the advancement of usable knowledge on biodiversity by obtaining input from decision makers on their priority information needs about biodiversity and then using this input to engage leading scientists in designing policy-relevant research. Decision makers articulated concerns related to four issues: significance of biodiversity; status and trends of biodiversity; management for biodiversity; and the linkage of social, cultural, economic, legal, and biological objectives. Leading natural and social scientists then identified the research required to address the decision makers' needs and determined the probability of success. The diverse group of experts reached consensus on several fundamental issues, helping to clarify the role of biodiversity in land and resource management. The BURN participants identified several features that should be incorporated into policy-relevant research plans and management strategies for biodiversity. Research and assessment efforts should be: multidisciplinary and integrative, participatory with stakeholder involvement, hierarchical (multiple scales), and problem- and region-specific. The activities should be focused regionally within a global perspective. Meta-analysis of existing data is needed on ail fronts to assess the slate of the science. More specifically, the scientists recommended six priority research areas that should be pursued to address the information needs articulated by decision makers: (1) characterization of biodiversity, (2) environmental valuation, (3) management for sustainability-for humans and the environment (adaptive management), (4) information management strategies, (5) governance and stewardship issues, and (6) communication and outreach. Broad recommendations were developed for each research area to provide direction for research planning and resource management strategies. The results wilt directly benefit those groups that require biodiversity research to address their needs-whether to develop policy, manage natural resources, or make other decisions affecting biodiversity.

ID PERTURBATIONS
AB Sound ecosystem management meshes socioeconomic attitudes and values with sustainable natural resource practices. Adaptive management is a model for guiding natural resource managers in this process. Ecosystems and the societies that use them are continually evolving. Therefore, managers must be flexible and adaptable in the lace of uncertainty and lack of knowledge. To couple good science to management, it is important to develop goals, models, and hypotheses that allow us to systematically learn as we manage. Goals and models guide the development and implementation oi management practices. The need to evaluate models and test hypotheses mandates monitoring, which feeds into a continuous cycle of goal and model reformulation, This paper reviews the process of adaptive management and describes how it is being applied to oak/pine savanna restoration at Necedah National Wildlife Refuge as an illustration. Our aim is to help managers design their own adaptive management models for successful ecosystem management.

AB The Western Governors' Association (WGA) includes both the public lands states with their issues and the plains states, which are 9856 privately owned. WGA deals with most legislation affecting biodiversity, whether the effect is direct or tangential. It will probably not be possible, or desirable, for one entity to be in charge of biodiversity conservation. The Endangered Species Act, public lands laws, agricultural laws, water law, environmental laws, and funding legislation all affect biodiversity conservation and the responsibility for it. None of them on their own are enough, and most can cause harmful unintended consequences for biodiversity. The experience of western stales in developing consensus principles for reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act provides an example of common-sense ways to improve management of biodiversity, notwithstanding the complexity and large stakes involved. The WGA's proposed changes call for increasing the role of states, streamlining the act, and increasing certainty for landowners and water users.
   To achieve sustainable conservation for biodiversity, the better question is not ''Who is/should be in charge?'', it is ''How do we get this done?'' To answer this, we need goals, guidance, and bottom lines from federal laws, and management and oversight at the state level, but they all need to support local on-the-ground partnerships. Sustainable conservation requires the active participation of those who live there. WGA's experience in coordinating the Great Plains Partnership as well as its work with watershed efforts shed light on what to expect. Multilevel partnerships are not easy and require a different way of doing business. The ad hoc, site-specific processes that result do not lend themselves to being legislated, lit into organizational boxes, or scored on a budget sheet. They do require common sense and a longterm perspective.

AB Corporations own approximately 25% of art private land in the United States and, therefore, play an essential role in protecting biodiversity and maintaining natural habitats. The Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC) is a unique joint Venture between conservation organizations and corporations to utilize corporate lands for ensuring biodiversity. The following case studies demonstrate how corporations have helped ensure healthy ecosystems and provided critical leadership in regional efforts. Amoco Chemical Company's Cooper River Plant has been instrumental in developing a cooperative project that involves numerous corporations, plantation owners, private citizens, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and community groups to develop a comprehensive, ecosystem-based management plan for part of the Cooper River in Charleston, South Carolina, USA. The second case focuses on the Morie Company, a national sand quarry operator headquartered in southern New Jersey, USA. Morie Company is working with WHC, community groups, the Pinelands Commission, and other state regulatory agencies to explore sustainable development opportunities for companies within the Pinelands regulations. The third case takes us to DuPont Company's Asturias, Spain, site. A win-win success story of improved habitat and cost savings is the result of DuPont's concern for the environment, ability to work with a variety of groups, and willingness to consider innovative restoration techniques. The fourth case discusses Consumers Power Company's Campbell Plant in West Olive, Michigan, USA, In addition to implementing projects that contribute to biodiversity, Consumers Power has developed an environmental education field station to teach others about the importance of natural habitats. The final case highlights Baltimore Gas & Electric Company's efforts to maintain habitat for endangered species at their Calvert Cliffs site in Maryland.

AB This paper discusses the use of slaughterhouse sludge. On a yearly basis approximately 3-4 million tons of pig and poultry slaughterhouse sludge is produced in Europe. The current uses of sludge are not very favourable because of their environmental drawbacks. An alternative processing method, e.g. high temperature/short term pasteurization followed by lactic acid fermentation, is tested to yield a microbiologically safe and chemically stable wet feed constituent for pigs. Biochemical and chemical aspects of slaughterhouse sludge were investigated to assess Process-Integrated-Safety-Assurance. Feeding experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of pasteurized and subsequently fermented slaughterhouse sludge on the health and performance of fattening pigs. It was concluded that this kind of processing will minimize environmental pollution, thus achieving a more sustainable animal production.

AB Forest certification is the identification and recognition that a forest management system and the specific forest to which it is applied has met agreed-to standards and requirements. The relatively recent interest in certification stems from three intertwined roots. These are social, market-place and professional. It was the concept of sustainable development in the late 1980s which provided the soil in which the roots would flourish. The development of certification schemes has varied depending on whether or not the focus was on a forest product or the forest and its management. The use of external independent audits as central to the assurance of credibility for the certification process is generally accepted. Differences and disagreements about certification have related mainly to what was being certified, the process of developing standards, and who would control certification. All certification schemes must have international credibility if they are to address market-place concerns, and therefore they must be trade-neutral. Within the jurisdiction within which they operate, they should be equally applicable to all forest conditions and ownerships. The initiation of forest certification is a watershed for Canadian forestry and foresters.

AB Certification requires an independent third party verification, commonly called an audit, to ensure that all components of a certification standard have been met. Field visits are an essential element to the Certification audit; however, the degree of field verification during the audit may vary depending on the objectives of the Sustainable Forest Management System. A key issue will be determining the proper balance between systems evaluation and field verification. Field audits establish credibility with the forest manager, the public and customers in addition to providing opportunities for training and public participation.

AB Sustainable forest management is the goal of most foresters and of the informed public and it is the main mission of the Commonwealth Forestry Association. Certification of forest products is a recent market phenomenon, driven partly by Non-Government Organizations and partly by retailers; it is largely a western initiative with parallels in agricultural and pharmaceutical products. Certification does not guarantee sustainability - it only defines what the buyer demands, like lumber dimensions. Environmental or social certification is a contractual specification and the European market seems currently to be the furthest forward with such schemes. Without such market pull, interest in certification would collapse. There are now many initiatives world wide; the Forest Stewardship Council began as an accrediter of independent certifiers, but countries are now developing their own criteria and especially seeking approaches through the International Standards Organization (ISO), an ISO 14000 or ISO 9000 approach, The relevance of certification to many smaller tropical Commonwealth countries is limited, since international trade is of little concern, and many newcomers to the international market have not yet adopted certification requirements. The challenge for the future is to find norms of country-specific good forest stewardship and certifiers are now turning their attention to other objects of trade.

AB The S.N.B. Woodlot Owner Organizations are in the process of developing a Sustainable Forest Management Plan for the approximately 400,000 ha of productive forest land owned by more than 6000 woodlot owners in southern New Brunswick.
   The Canadian Standards Association Protocol is being used as the guiding document in this process. S.N.B. is nearly mid-way through the process with a tentative schedule and target of 15 February 1997 to have the first draft of the system ready for review, approval and implementation by 1 April 1997.
   The experience continues to be one of many challenges, not only for the woodlot owner organizations and the woodlot owners themselves, but for the many other stakeholders who have been or will be provided the opportunity to participate. The CSA Protocol provides one of the first frame-works for all the players to ''walk their talk'' in the veal management of a real forest with everyone's interests being facilitated. It also provides the players with the opportunity to demonstrate that they do know what they are talking about and to share that understanding with others to achieve the balances required within sustainable limits.
   The CSA Protocol provides challenges in itself. Staying ''true to the process'' may be the secret to addressing those challenges. In this presentation we shall examine these challenges more specifically.

SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE

AB The need to integrate the conservation of biological diversity with social and economic goals is one of the world's most important challenges today. British Columbia's large area and variety of terrains and climates support extensive and diverse forest ecosystems. Historically, the harvesting of timber for forest products has been a primary factor in developing BC's social services and infrastructure. While forest products remain highly important to BC's economy, in recent decades increased environmental awareness has also brought a higher recognition of the richness of BC's biological legacy. Today, BC's forests must be managed sustainably to meet a wide range of management objectives and public demands. The necessary transition in management, which is still underway, has involved extensive public input and significant actions by government. These actions include the development of initiatives designed to conserve biodiversity through land-use planning - which identifies areas for protection and for harvesting - and through the legislated regulation of forest practices in areas suitable for harvesting. All the demands on the land base, and the capability of the land to meet various combinations of these demands, must be considered in determining allowable annual timber harvests.
   BC has made considerable progress in ensuring sustainability in forest management, but recognizes the evolutionary nature of this management and the inevitability of further change.

ID SCENARIOS; ENERGY; FUTURE
AB Sustainable development is a highly complex problem area, which will probably call for major changes of industrialized societies in the long run. How could futures studies contribute to a policy forming process directed to these problems? And what kind of knowledge about the future is most needed? It is argued that a backcasting approach, due to its problem-solving character, is well suited to these kinds of long-term problems. Fundamental theoretical assumptions behind backcasting are traced. One conclusion is that the merits of backcasting should be judged in the context of discovery rather than in the context of justification. Also, if one is inclined to see teleology as a specific form of understanding, beside causality, then backcasting becomes interesting. Backcasting studies typically aim at providing policy makers and an interested general public with images of the future as a background for opinion forming and decisions.

DE peninsular Malaysia; flood hazards; sustainability; hazard-adaptation
AB Rapidly-industrializing, developing countries face increasing environmental disaster potential. Rising disaster losses are an indicator of non-sustainable development. Analysis of flood hazard in peninsular Malaysia exemplifies these problems. Malaysia has a rapidly-growing economy and evidence suggests that the flood hazard is worsening largely because of rapid urbanization and development. This is revealed by analysing trends in five 'flood hazard factors': variables which explain flood disaster potential. mood risk, exposure and damage potential are all increasing. High levels of poverty in flood plains suggest that peoples' vulnerability to floods is not being reduced. A large proportion of interviewed flood-prone households have low incomes, especially in eastern peninsula locations, and reported flood damages are high. Indigenous household flood adjustments, including 'stilt houses', limit flood vulnerability especially in the rural east. Unfortunately, modernization threatens traditional life-styles and erodes indigenous hazard-adaptations. State response is heavily engineering-oriented and is failing to address development-induced flood hazard potential. Policies are required which marry hazard reduction to poverty reduction and sustainable development.

ID COMPLEMENTARITIES
AB Today's dynamic markets and technologies have called into question the sustainability of competitive advantage. Under pressure to improve productivity, duality, and speed, managers have embraced tools such as TQM, benchmarking, and reengineering, Dramatic operational improvements have resulted, but rarely have these gains translated into sustainable profitability. And gradually, the tools have taken the place of strategy.
   In his five-part article, Michael Porter explores how that shift has led to the rise of mutually destructive competitive battles that damage the profitability of many companies. As managers push to improve on all fronts, they move further away from viable competitive positions.
   Porter argues that operational effectiveness, although necessary to superior performance, is not sufficient, because its techniques are easy to imitate. In contrast, the essence of strategy is choosing a unique and valuable position rooted in systems of activities that are much more difficult to match.
   Porter thus traces the economic basis of competitive advantage down to the level of the specific activities a company performs. Using cases such as Ikea and Vanguard, he shows how making trade-offs among activities is critical to the sustainability of a strategy.
   Whereas managers often focus on individual components of success such as core competencies or critical resources, Porter shows how managing Jit across all of a company's activities enhances both competitive advantage and sustainability. While stressing the role of leadership in making and enforcing clear strategic choices, Porter also offers advice on how companies can reconnect with strategies that have become blurred over time.

ID GROWTH-PARAMETERS; NATURAL MORTALITY
AB Monthly length-frequency data of green tiger prawns from April 1985 to August 1990 were analyzed to estimate the von Bertalanffy growth curves and related parameters. The mean asymptotic carapace lengths (L(infinity)) and growth constants (K) over 5 seasons were 36.6 mm and 1.6 yr(-1) for males and 51.2 mm and 1.7 yr(-1) for females, respectively. Annual total mortality rates (Z) from 1985/86 to 1989/90 ranged from 2.7 to 6.5 yr(-1) for males and from 2.8 to 6.8 yr(-1) for females. The mean exploitation rates calculated using the mean natural mortality rates (M) of 2.5 yr(-1) for males and 2.4 yr(-1) for females showed that the male green tiger prawns in Kuwait waters were under exploited, whereas the catch of females was very close to the sustainable yield. Chi-square tests indicated that the sex ratio was close to one for adults (CL greater than or equal to 26 mm), but significantly favoured males for recruits (CL < 26 mm). A major recruitment was detected from June/July in all seasons and a minor recruitment in some seasons in August/September. The relative yield-per-recruit (Y'/R) reached the optimum at the length-at-first capture (L(c)) of 25 mm CL for males, and increased as L(c) increased for females. The observed mean L(c) values were 23.4 mm for both males and females. The Y'/R under the current exploitation level is close to the maximum sustainable yield for females, but lower for males. More fishing effort could be exerted to exploit males, but doing so may not be biologically or commercially possible with current trawling practices.

TI Milling reduces the goitrogenic potential of cassava
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCES AND NUTRITION
LA English
DT Article
ID PROCESSED CASSAVA; THIOCYANATE; CYANOGENS
AB Cyanide exposure from consumption of insufficiently processed cassava has been implicated in aggravating iodine deficiency disorders (IDD). The cyanide metabolite, thiocyanate (SCN) may interfere with iodine (I) uptake of the thyroid gland. A study on 217 women in an IDD endemic area in western Tanzania showed that 98% consumed cassava daily. Total and visible goitre rates were 72.8% and 13.3%, respectively. Median urinary iodine was 3.6 mu g/dl indicating moderate iodine deficiency. Processing methods which remove cyanogens from cassava roots have changed with time. Urinary thiocyanate (mean; 128 mu mol/l) was moderately increased, but women who frequently milled cassava had significantly lower urinary thiocyanate levels. This indicates that mechanical milling could reduce the goitrogenic potential of cassava and we conclude that IDD in the studied area is mainly due to iodine deficiency and sustainable iodine supplementation should be given highest priority.

TI Sustainability of private capital flows: Comparing China with Mexico
SO ISSUES & STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE China; Mexico; foreign direct investment; foreign debts; equity flows
AB This paper attempts to explain the varying degrees of sustainability of private capital flows (PCFs) to China and Mexico, the two largest recipient developing countries of such flows in recent years. It tackles the question by comparing both the composition and causes of the flows. In using the first approach, PCFs to China were found to be more sustainable than those to Mexico because the former have consisted mainly of direct investment and loans, whereas most of the latter have been portfolio equity flows. Another explanation suggested by the second approach is that PCFs to China are mainly due to more sustainable factors such as the country's huge size, the rapid growth of its domestic economy, its cheap labor, its far-reaching real domestic policy reforms, and its high savings rates. On the other hand, in the Mexican case, less durable factors such as external influences and domestic credit policy changes play an important role.

TI Soil water and temperature patterns in an arid desert dune sand
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSECT; MOISTURE; HILLSLOPE; RAINFALL; RECHARGE
AB Under arid natural conditions, soil water content governs and limits the number and size of perennial plant species. Thus, plant-available soil water is the main constraint for sustainable control of desert encroachment. To evaluate possibilities for re-vegetation of bare sand surfaces, soil water and temperature patterns for typical sand dunes in a desert climate were investigated. Bare and vegetated soil transects were selected for observation of soil water content and temperature. The investigated soil transects covered crest-to-crest spacings (about 60 m horizontally and 15 m vertically) in a shifting sand dune area. Observations were made at Shapotou field research station bordering the Tengger Desert in Northwestern China. The paper presents two-dimensional properties of soil water content (0.1-3.0 m depth) and temperature (0-1.0 m depth) before and after rainfall. Rainfall (15-22 mm) affected soil water distribution down to 1.5-2.0 m and temperature distribution down to 1.0 m. Soil water appeared to be transported through the apparently highly pervious and homogeneous sand along the dune slopes. High water contents and, thus, infiltration occurred mainly at the non-sloping parts, i.e. the dune crests and bottoms. Rainfall changed the temperature patterns from a mainly horizontally layered appearance before the rainfall to increasingly vertically shaped patterns.

SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE biodiversity; convention; biotechnology; culture collections; WFCC
AB The coming into force of the Convention on Biological Diversity has led to a series of discussions aiming to clarify its implementation, A number of uncertainties exist at the microbial level and there is a lack of awareness of the role played by microorganisms in ecosystem function. There is moreover a great lack of knowledge about the number of species of microorganisms that exist, their distribution, stability in the environment and intricate interactive roles. Conservation and use of biological material for sustainable environmental management are major issues. Specialist microbiological input into the debate is required to ensure that provisions made for national programmes are appropriate and practicable at the microbiological level. The Articles of the Convention of special relevance to microbiologists are listed and discussed, The role of microbial culture collections within the framework of the Convention is considered. The difficulties and uncertainties of conservation and study of microorganisms in their habitat (in situ) increase the need for ex situ conservation in microbial culture collections. The World Federation for Culture Collections plays a coordinating role with regard to expertise, information, training and the management and operation of microbial resource centres, It has the potential for providing a special interest Clearing House Mechanism for the support of the Convention.

Under these circumstances, shifts in foreign capital hows and anticipation of a banking-system bailout may produce large imbalances between stocks of financial assets and foreign reserves, threatening the sustainability of currency pegs. Econometric analysis suggests that half of Mexico's reserve losses could be accounted for by these phenomena. Large financial imbalances are also fertile ground for self-fulfilling-prophesy crises which lead devaluations to produce deep recessions. These difficulties can be partly remedied by appropriate policies.

AB This paper explores the extent to which the Mexican government's inability to roll over its debt during December 1994 and January 1995 can be modeled as a self-fulfilling debt crisis. In the model there is a crucial interval of debt for which the government, although it finds it optimal to repay old debt if it can sell new debt, finds it optimal to default if it cannot sell new debt. If government debt is in this interval, which we call the crisis zone, then we can construct equilibria in which a crisis can occur stochastically, depending on the realization of a sunspot variable. The size of this zone depends on the average length of maturity of government debt. Our analysis suggests that for a country, like Mexico, with a very shea maturity structure of debt, the crisis zone is large and includes levels of debt as low as those in Mexico before the crisis.

AB China, with one of the largest grassland and pastoral areas of the world, is placing major effort on sustainable modernization of its rangeland livestock industry, One widely discussed structural change involves development of a cattle feedlot industry with grazing lands oriented to a cow/calf system, However, economic analyses of alternatives have not been carried out, The objective in this article is to evaluate the economic feasibility and benefits to sustainability from shifting from fattening cattle on rangelands in Inner Mongolia to fattening in feedlots in the Beijing area, The method is economic budgeting of costs and returns for both systems combined with comparison of protein and energy requirements for each of them, It is concluded that grazing land producers would obtain more net income from selling weaned calves rather than fattened animals, Furthermore, although 14,230 Meal of metabolizable energy and 738 kg of crude protein are required per 4-year old male sold at slaughter weight by grazing land fattening, a feedlot fattened male would require only 5,670 Meal of energy and 371 kg of protein, Additional evaluations of improved cow/calf systems indicate that considerable advances can be made by improving the efficiency of China's cattle industry.

TI Application of management system with sub-working groups varying in
   rotation for mountainous forests in Japan
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this paper is to examine the possibility of application of the management system with sub-working groups varying in rotation for mountainous forests. This management system has been devised on the basis of the German ''fliegende betriebsklasse''. The forests under this system are divided into several subdivisions termed ''sub-working groups'', and one of the sub-working groups is regarded as a ''sustainable production facility'' on an appropriate rotation basis, and the others are regarded as ''maintenance facilities'' varying in rotation according to damage conditions. If the damage occurs in such forests, the forest manager interchanges the damaged stands in the sub-working group regarded as the sustainable production facility with sound stands in the sub-working groups regarded as the maintenance facilities in order to reduce the disorder of the system caused by the damage. Judging from the application methods of this system to the Kyushu Electricity Inc. Forest, this system will be able to apply to sugi plantations suffering from wind damage under clear-cutting system in japan.

TI Reference points for optimal fish stock management - A lesson to be
   learned from the Northeast Arctic cod stock
SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB In the North Atlantic the Icelandic, the North Sea, and the Newfoundland cod stocks are currently overexploited. Overexploitation also characterised the Northeast Arctic cod stock, but effective management measures introduced in 1990 and the years thereafter have brought this stock within safe biological limits. The Northeast Arctic cod stock is transboundary and shared between Norway and Russia, As guidelines for a sound management strategy of this cod stock in the future, reference points for management are discussed. As a point of departure, a management strategy which fulfils the objectives for fishery policy stated by Norway is analysed. These objectives, focusing on sustainable harvesting, increased profitability and the role of the fishery as employer of labour in rural districts are fundamental in most of the world's fishery nations.
   The ''optimal'' strategy is defined as the one which fulfils these in the best way possible. The natural variations are discussed and the biological and economic yield's dependence upon the rate of exploitation are analysed. The analysis shows that the size of the spawning stock should be no less than 500 000 tonnes and that highest yield is obtained through a rate of exploitation of around 17-30% (equivalent to a fishing mortality of about 0.20-0.40). A spawning stock size of 500 000 tonnes should therefore serve as a ''limit reference point'' and a fishing mortality of about 0.20-0.40 should serve as a ''target reference point'' in the management of Northeast Arctic cod.
   The method described may be applied to other demersal stocks to help establish target and limit reference points in order to conduct a sound management. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Attaining sustainable development has significant implications for population age structure, family structure and the wellbeing of elderly women. If one of the primary goals of sustainable development is reducing fertility to attain a population growth rate which can be supported by the Earth's resources, then working toward sustainable development will lead to an aging population. This demographic change coupled with other impacts of working toward sustainable development could significantly affect the status and wellbeing of elderly women. Drawing on examples primarily from the Asian setting, this paper will examine population aging and what this demographic change may mean for elderly women in developing areas.

TI The economic impact of transport infrastructure provision: A review of
   the evidence
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT
LA English
DT Article
AB The economic impacts of transport infrastructure have been extensively debated in Great Britain in recent years. Positive impacts are generated by the construction of infrastructure, although these are usually less marked for civil engineering schemes compared with other forms of construction, Transport infrastructure is an essential contributing factor in the industrial development of economies, but once infrastructure networks have been created economic impacts arising from the provision of additional infrastructure capacity will be small on average unless there are significant technological discontinuities. In such a steady-state situation, the long-term macro-economic impacts of transport infrastructure provision are difficult to prove and many of the benefits can be secured by government more cost-effectively with a different mix of policies, Notwithstanding these conclusions, infrastructure provision has an essential contribution to make to the quality and sustainability of life in societies and the attainment of environmental goals.

TI Shallow groundwater in the northeast arid zone of Nigeria
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY

DT Article
DE alluvium; shallow aquifers; water resources
ID RECHARGE
AB The natural resources of the northeast arid zone of Nigeria have been the subject of a recent five-year, European Union-funded research programme, carried out in support of rural development initiatives in the area. The shallow groundwater resources of the extensive river floodplain alluvial aquifers, and of the interfluves or uplands, have been an important focus of the research. The main issue in relation to sustainable development of these resources is the estimation of their recharge.
   Recharge to the alluvial aquifer of the Yobe river downstream of Gashua is shown to be limited by an extensive clay cover overlying the aquifer. As a consequence of this the main mechanism of recharge is channel seepage, vertical infiltration being severely restricted. If, as is thought by most consultants, this is the only source of recharge to the area as a whole, then it is shown that recharge to the area amounts to less than 1 mm/a. This is probably less than the present abstraction from the shallow aquifers.
   The paper challenges the current presumption that rainfed recharge to the shallow aquifers beneath the upland is nil. Observations from other parts of the Sahel are used to show the typical magnitudes of water table decline which have coincided with the Sahel drought (early 1960s to date). These rates of decline cannot be explained by increases in abstraction. They can however be explained by significant reductions in recharge (of several mm/a) over the period in which rainfall has reduced, and this in turn implies recharge values significantly greater than zero in the very recent past, or to date. Detailed studies by the first author in the Manga Grasslands of north east Nigeria, in which recharge of 30-60 mm/a was estimated, are used to exemplify the likely situation in at least some parts of the upland.
   Ignorance or uncertainty of both the natural replenishment processes, and of the impact of climatic and anthropogenic changes, is no basis for sound water resource management policy. Because of the importance of establishing a more sound understanding of the recharge processes in the northeast arid zone, an outline programme of further research is presented.

TI Assessing uncertainty and risk in exploited marine populations
SO RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY

DT Article
ID STOCK ASSESSMENT; RECRUITMENT; FISHERIES; MANAGEMENT; TRENDS
AB The assessment and management of exploited fish and invertebrate populations is subject to several types of uncertainty. This uncertainty translates into risk to the population in the development and implementation of fishery management advice. Here, we define risk as the probability that exploitation rates will exceed a threshold level where long term sustainability of the stock is threatened. We distinguish among several sources of error or uncertainty due to (a) stochasticity in demographic rates and processes, particularly in survival rates during the early life stages; (b) measurement error resulting from sampling variation in the determination of population parameters or in model estimation; and (c) the lack of complete information on population and ecosystem dynamics. The first represents a form of aleatory uncertainty while the latter two factors represent forms of epistemic uncertainty. To illustrate these points, we evaluate the recent status of the Georges Bank cod stock in a risk assessment framework. Short term stochastic projections are made accounting for uncertainty in population size and for random variability in the number of young surviving to enter the fishery. We show that recent declines in this cod stock can be attributed to exploitation rates that have substantially exceeded sustainable levels. Published by Elsevier Science Limited.

AB The evolution of the biosphere reserve concept both derives from experiences of ifs practical application and can be seen as a response to wider trends in the fields of conservation and resource management Two trends of particular importance have been, the evolution of the concept of sustainable development and the growing recognition that local people should be involved in the management of protected areas. This review traces the evolution of the concept from 1970 to the present with a focus on two related elements: the outer zone of the biosphere reserve and the involvement of multiple entities-especially local communities-in administration and management, particularly in the United Stares. Its conclusion considers the major shifts in emphasis deriving from the International Conference on Biosphere Reserves in March, 1995.

AB Scientific uncertainties about ecosystem processes and greater awareness of the need for environmental care are sources of public anxiety over forest management. Partly because of this, the negative impacts of poor forestry practices are often emphasized, overlooking the achievements in sustainable forestry. The forest estates should be viewed and managed as a continuum so that the overall need for production of wood and the protection of environmental values can be met. We need practical goals of forest management. One goal should be to ensure that the trend in forest productivity is nondeclining or is positive through successive rotations and harvests, while maintaining and enhancing the quality of the soil resource base in perpetuity. The conflicts about the use of native forests for wood harvesting, while maintaining all conservation values, can be lessened if the value of each forest is ranked within a stale ranging from wood production to conservation. The growing demand for wood and concerns for land care ran be met in part by expanding plantation forestry. Questions concerning management strategies for sustainable forestry are global in scope, but the genesis and application of practices for achieving this are local and are based fundamentally on the soil. The expectation of developing soil-based sustainability indicators can be realized only if the expectation is backed by substantial research linking changes in soil properties, ecosystem processes, and productivity at the landscape level. Challenges are many and include interdisciplinary approaches to research and forest management, application to ensure economic prosperity, and positive approaches to communication.

AB Human population growth places increasing demands on the world's forests. Sustaining these forests will depend to a considerable extent on sustaining soil structure and function. Traditional scientific concerns about sustaining timber production focused largely on soil fertility, but recent interest has focused attention on the plant and animal community and on ''biodiversify''. Neither of these approaches is satisfactory on its own. They should be replaced with an ecosystem analysis approach that includes the biotic and abiotic components. The most fundamental issue in sustainable forest management is the long-term productive capacity of individual sites, which is determined to a considerable extent by the availability of soil resources. Understanding the sustainability of site productivity requires knowledge of the determinants of leaf area and its photosynthetic efficiency, and of the allocation of net production. Keys that determine production ecology in boreal and cool temperate forests include low soil temperature, slow rate of litter decomposition and the resultant character of the forest floor, and, in some areas, impeded soil drainage; these lead to limitations on nutrient availability. Natural disturbance influences these factors and thereby plays a vital role in maintaining productivity and several measures of biological diversity. Without stand-replacing disturbances, closed forest may not be the climax vegetation in many western and northern Canadian landscapes. While forests and soils should be protected from ''damage'', sufficient disturbance should be sustained to respect the disturbance-related ecology of these forests. Ecological site classification and use of ecosystem-level management simulation models are important for the design of appropriate disturbance regimes.

AB Sustaining forest soil productivity is a common goal of forest landowners in the Southeast, but determining the effects of forest management practices on soil and site quality has not been easy, An unbiased measurement is needed to monitor sustained soil and site productivity. Growth cycle comparisons, traditional measures of forest productivity, are not very timely, are often biased, and do not always account for changes in soil quality due to management. This was demonstrated by comparing growth curves of two successive loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) rotations, and by comparing growth curves influenced by two site preparation treatments within the last rotation. The growth cycle comparison between rotations was not a definitive indicator of sustained soil quality because stand response could have been confounded by differences in genotype and vegetation management from the first to the second rotation. Stand responses due to soil treatment in the last rotation were confounded by the influence of different levels of competing vegetation, Because stand response is a function of many confounding non-soil factors as well as soil quality, soil sustainability and the effects of management should be determined by measuring soil properties and processes directly.

ID REGENERATION
AB Efforts to make tourism a more sustainable option have been focusing increasingly on a community development approach, but an analysis of the differences between traditional community economic development and community tourism development clearly shows that tourism continues to be driven by levels of government rather than community interests, A closer look at the interests that influence decision making, or for that matter non-decision making, with respect to tourism development also points out the level of rhetoric that surrounds 'community involvement' in the process, while perpetuating many of the biases found in the system, There is a great need to evaluate the implementation of so-called community-driven tourism development plans to determine to what extent the local residents truly share in the benefits supposedly derived from increased visitation, since it is quite clear that they support the majority of the costs associated with tourism.

DE national park; visitor survey; conservation
AB Since the introduction of ecotourism to Kibale National Park in 1992 its visitor numbers have risen to about 5000 per annum, creating the need for proper planning and management, A visitor survey - the first major study to be carried out in Uganda - was therefore conducted with the aim of assessing visitor characteristics. The survey found that over 90% of visitors were from overseas and many were on vacation and visiting for the first time, Their visits were planned and they came mainly to view the chimpanzees, the main attraction at Kibale, Most visitors felt the recreational facilities at Kibale were of low standard and several changes were proposed, but some visitors indicated that the park should be kept as it is, It was concluded that these views should be considered in the planning and management of Kibale if sustainable ecotourism is to prove a realistic goal, Greater visitor control has been proposed as well as further research into visitor behaviour.

AB Ecology is a subject where theoretical predictions are often difficult to test experimentally in the field. To address this challenge, the Ecological Society of America suggested exploiting large-scale environmental management decisions in a scientific way. This 'adaptive management' constitutes one of the purposes of the Sustainable Biosphere Initiative. Meanwhile, in the current context of the biodiversity crisis, translocations and particularly reintroductions of threatened species are becoming more numerous. It is time for ecologists and wildlife managers to collaborate on these unique opportunities for large-scale studies.

DT Article
AB This examination of the recent history of the fishing sector in Chile shows that in this sector, which has played an important role in Chile's export success, short-term growth was achieved at the cost of long-term sustainability, with negative implications for those involved in the industry. This case raises the more general issue of the importance of regulatory frameworks in the promotion of natural resource exports. ''Neoliberal'' policy frameworks, which generally assume that self-regulating markets produce better results than explicit efforts to modify market results, have been increasingly adopted by developing countries. Analyses of the implications of these policy frameworks for the long-term sustainability of growth based upon natural resource exports have not grown along with the popularity of the policies themselves. This article is an effort to redress the imbalance. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Concerning the protection of environment pig producers face more and more problems. On the one hand there is the use of manure as a fertilizer. On the other hand there are odor and ammonia emissions. Scientists have to provide farmers technologies for a ''sustainable'' pig production without affecting animal welfare and economic aspects.
   Most of the ammonia is emitted during storing (about 30 %) and land spreading (about 50 %) of manure; technologies for a reduction are available. The importance of the ammonia emissions with the exhaust air is often overestimated. Low impulse air inlet systems in connection with a correctly designed underfloor extraction of exhaust air provides good inside air quality with reduced ammonia emissions. Bioscrubbers for air purification are not state of the art.

AB This paper focuses on smaller roads on the outskirts of cities. The aim was to provide information covering the traffic on them and the spatial effects of their emissions on soils and the transfer of contamination in the groundwater. This information is the basis for questions of soil protection linked to questions of sustainable development in road planning. The study is based on a field trial analysing four different sites in Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia) for a period of one year. It was conducted within the scope of the research and development proposal financed by the Federal Minister of Traffic Affairs-'The establishment and assessment of the effects of roads on the ecological factors soil and water'. To link the contamination of the soils to the groundwater it was decided to study the quality of seepage water in the unsaturated zone of the soils. The program of measuring and analysing included the periodic taking of soil samples at fixed intervals. Seepage water samples were also taken and analysed every 10 days. At the same time climatological data determined by the topography were measured.

AB Plants with specific resistance to a single class of herbicides have been genetically engineered by introduction of genes encoding rationally designed mutant acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) enzymes. Suitable substitution mutations were identified from a three-dimensional model of an AHAS-inhibitor complex. The structural model was generated based on homology to pyruvate oxidase and an imidazolinone inhibitor was positioned in the proposed binding site using structure-activity data for this class of herbicide. Biochemical analysis of the mutant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli enabled iterative optimization of the mutant genes. Expression of recombinant proteins in tobacco plants conferred resistance in vivo. The novel approach coupling molecular modeling and molecular biology has many advantages over traditional random mutagenesis and selection methods and will be crucial to the future development for environmentally safe and sustainable agricultural systems.

AB The parameters which influence electrochemically facilitated transport of electroinactive ions across conducting electroactive polymer membranes have been investigated. The design of membranes and the materials used as well as transport cells and systems have been addressed to improve selectivity and flux. Polypyrrole-para-toluenesulfonate (PPy-pTS) was compared with the copolymer of pyrrole with 3-carboxy-4-methylpyrrole (PPy/PCMP-pTS) and their different chemistries resulted in different membrane selectivities for ions. Platinum mesh was found to be the most suitable auxiliary electrode material and its placement in the cell chamber(s) facilitated ion incorporation/expulsion at the membrane working electrode. This enhanced the flux of ion transport. The flux can also be further enhanced by narrowing the distance between the membrane working electrode and the platinum mesh auxiliary electrode(s), and/or by stirring to improve the hydrodynamics. An alternative cell design, namely a dual membrane flow through cell, also proved to be more efficient for ion transport. Good connection geometry to the membrane as well as the application of a square wave pulsed potential waveform to the membrane was found to be essential for achieving high and sustainable flux in ion transport.

TI Nutrient cycling in integrated rangeland/cropland systems of the Sahel
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID FARMING SYSTEMS; SOIL; NITROGEN; CATTLE; GROWTH
AB In the Sahel of West Africa, the productivities of rangelands, croplands and livestock are inextricably linked. Cattle, sheep and goats graze rangelands and crop residues, and their manure/urine is used to fertilize crops. Rangelands provide important feeds during the manuring period, resulting in a net nutrient transfer from rangelands to croplands. This paper examines the sustainability of nutrient transfers in integrated rangeland/cropland systems of the Sahel by examining the impact of grazing on rangeland vegetation structure and floristic composition, the impact of livestock on nutrient balances of rangelands and croplands, and the role of livestock in offsetting nutrient deficits through manuring. Rangeland nutrient balances are in equilibrium (inputs = offtakes) whereas croplands lack the internal capacity to replenish nutrient offtakes in grain (as food) and crop residues (as feed). Although soil nutrient mining is of general concern for the Sahel, local management practices of some farmers (e.g. corralling animals overnight on fields between cropping seasons, use of fertilizers) offset cropland nutrient deficits. The number of additional livestock, and their feed requirements needed to supply sufficient manure to offset cropland nutrient deficits, depend on rangeland and cropland productivity, livestock production goals, and management strategies of farmers. Livestock must be managed so they do not deplete the nutrient supply of rangelands in order to increase the manure supply for improving cropland productivity. Sustained rangeland productivity in the Sahel will depend largely on producing alternative feeds derived mostly from croplands. Land use and tenure policies that inhibit livestock mobility and, therefore, farmers' access to the manure of pastoralists herds, will greatly undermine the resilience of Sahelian rangelands, and increase the need for other external nutrient inputs such as fertilizers to prevent declines in soil fertility and crop yields.

AB On the western slopes of Reunion Island, the trends in cropping systems for perfume pelargonium are causing serious erosion problems, This paper reviews the causes of these trends, presents the consequences of this deterioration, and assesses the agro-ecological solutions by means of cover plants and hedging with agroforest species, Firstly, the short term effects of cover plants (Lotus uliginosus, Pennisetum clandestinum) associated with the pelargonium crop are considered. Using rainfall simulation, it is shown that such associations have immediate effects in controlling erosion, although runoff is not significantly reduced, The more long-term effects of this type of cover are then compared with pelargonium monoculture on bare soils, and with pelargonium in rotation with stable crops. The effect of hedging along plot boundaries is also observed. Descriptions of soil profiles highlight the advantages of plant cover, in improving soil structure and biological activity, Near hedges, the same tendencies are even more marked, Soil hydraulic conductivity, measured in the various situations, confirms the complementarity of cover plants and hedges in association. The plant cover reduces erosion, with only a slight increase in water infiltration. At the same time, soil under hedges gives rise to very high water conductivity which should enable a large proportion of runoff water to be absorbed.

AB The effect of prescribed fire on soil nutrients in Arizona chaparral is limited even though prescribed fire is used extensively as a management tool. Concentrations of exchangeable NH4+-N and NO3--N and extractable P were studied under two Arizona chaparral shrubs growing on a Lithic Ustorthent soil before and after a prescribed fire. The results show exchangeable NH4+-N increased from 5.19 to 48.74 mg kg(-1) and extractable P increased from 5.38 to 14.55 mg kg(-1) in the surface horizon. NH4+-N increased from 5.39 to 71.62 ntg kg(-1) under Cercocarpus betuloides and from 5.23 to 36.10 mg kg(-1) under Quercus turbinella, while extractable P increased from 5.80 to 22.62 mg kg(-1) under C. betuloides and from 5.46 to 14.58 mg kg(-1) under Q. turbinella. The difference in soil nutrient status between species after prescribed fire is due to the amount of litter accumulated and the nutrient concentration difference in the litter and standing biomass of these two species. The majority of N and P is lost owing to volatilization of litter and biomass, yet small but significant amounts of N and P are translocated down and condensed in the surface soil. The condensation of N and P along with ash deposition increased soil fertility after the prescribed fire, which is essential to the long-term productivity and sustainability of Arizona chaparral ecosystems.

SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB A controversial debate is going on about the steps necessary to ensure sustainable economic development in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Social Democratic Parry (SPD) demands a national environmental plan with binding data for the consumption of resources and land as well as for pollutant loads. However this would mean going the way of an economy managed by ecology. A decision along these lines would hardly be able to make Germany, as a location of industrial production, fit for the increasingly tougher international competition.
   The federal government assigns priority to a concept of small steps in climate protection. At the Environmental Summit in Berlin in the spring of 1995, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised a 25% decrease of German carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions between 1990 and 2005. By international comparison with initiatives for CO2 reduction this is an ambitious target On the one hand, it contains a binding quantitative promise where most countries avoid such verifiable statements; on the other hand the reduction rate promised is relatively high. Worldwide, a major success is seen in the possibility for the industrialized countries merely to stabilize their CO2 emissions.
   Even though considerable progress has been made in this country since the early nineties, the CO2 reduction level envisaged for political reasons remains threatened Compared to 1990 as the base line year, CO2 emissions in the Federal Republic by the middle of this decade have been reduced by more than 130 million tons, i. e. 13%. However, this decrease is due to the drastic decline in particularly CO2-intensive production processes in the new German federal states. In Eastern Germany, especially the use of lignite, with its relatively high carbon dioxide fractions, has been reduced.
   A number of aspects need to be taken into account. The reductions promised in voluntary agreements for cooperation between industry and the federal government are an important step in the right direction. Energy tares based on emissions should be introduced only on the basis of a calculable schedule, in small steps and, if possible, in an internationally harmonized approach in order to protect long-term investments. In this way, longer-term incentives could be offered in the interest of environmentally benign innovations and investments already at the stage of industrial planning.
   Should nuclear power, which produces no CO2 emissions, be abandoned on political grounds, the national costs of such a switch would be likely to reach amounts in the double or three-digit billions. The operation of German nuclear power plants at present allows some 150 million tons of CO2 to be avoided annually. If new reactors could be built in the future without ally political obstacles, additional CO2 savings potentials could be mobilized.

AB Using an Australian focus to explore theoretical and policy issues of wider concern, this article examines linkages between public policy and the science of ecology. This is done within the broader framework of sustainability, emphasizing the problem of decision making in the face of 'uncertainty'. Insights from the ecological, risk, sustainability and policy literatures are used. The sustainability-uncertainty problem is characterized, and the adequacy of existing policy support techniques and approaches noted, particularly the precautionary principle. The problem is further defined using the notion of ignorance. The treatment of ignorance and uncertainty in ecology is discussed. We suggest that the science of ecology has had a limited influence on policy formulation and discuss the basis of this using biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management as examples. We conclude by considering challenges for handling risk, uncertainty and ignorance in ecological science for policy formulation. We emphasize the need for improved communication between the science and policy communities, greater recognition of the limits of quantitative techniques in addressing uncertainty, and contingency planning.

AB Managing forests for sustainable use requires that both the biological diversity of the forests and a viable forest industry be maintained. A current approach towards maintaining biological diversity is to pattern forest management practices after those of natural disturbance events. This paradigm hypothesizes that ecological processes will be maintained best where active management approximates natural disturbance events. The forest management model now used in most sub-boreal and boreal forests calls for regularly dispersed clearcuts no greater than 60-100 ha in size. However, the spatial characteristics of the landscape produced by this model are distinctly different from the historic pattern generated by wildfire, which was heretofore the dominant stand-replacing process in these forests. Wildfire creates a more complex landscape spatial pattern with greater range in patch size and more irregular disturbance boundaries. Individual wildfires are often over 500 ha put leave patches of unburned forest within them. The combination of these attributes is not present in recent clearcuts. Allowing a proportion of larger (i.e. >500 ha) harvest units may provide distinct economic advantages that could outweigh the opportunity costs of leaving some patches of forest behind. For the forest type examined, further evaluation of modelling forest harvest patterns more closely after the patterns created by wildfire is required as it may achieve a good balance and strike a suitable compromise between certain ecological and economic objectives of sustainable development.

AB Poor adoption of sustainable pre-rice green manure technology by lowland farmers is frequently associated with unreliable legume performance under adverse environmental conditions such as marginal soils, short photoperiod, and unfavorable hydrology. A series of field and microplot experiments were conducted at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in 1991 and 1992 to screen and evaluate 12 promising flood-tolerant legumes for adaptation (N accumulation and biological N-2 fixation) to a range of environmental stresses, frequently encountered in rice lowlands. Legumes belonging to the genera Sesbania and Aeschynomene were grown for 8 weeks at 10x10 cm spacing: (1) in a fertile control soil and in four marginally productive irrigated lowland rice soils (sandy Entisol, P-deficient Inceptisol, acid Ultisol, and saline Mollisol); (2) during short- (11.7 h) and long-day (12.3 h) seasons in a favorable irrigated lowland soil; and (3) in an aerobic soil (drought-prone rain-fed lowland) and a deep-flood-prone lowland soil (1 week seedling submergence). A large variability in N accumulation was observed among legume species and across different environments, ranging from less than 1 to over 70 mg N plant(-1). The nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa) accounted on average for 82% of total N accumulation. Sesbania virgata was least affected by unfavorable soil conditions but its Ndfa was the lowest among the tested species (less than 60%). Stem nodule formation did not convey a significant advantage to legumes grown under adverse soil conditions. However, flooding reduced N-2 fixation less in stem-nodulating than in solely root-nodulating species. Most species drastically reduced N accumulation under short-day conditions. Aeschynomene afraspera and S. speciosa were least affected by photoperiod. The considerable genetic variability in the germplasm screened allows the selection of potentially appropriate legumes to most conditions studied, thus increasing N accumulation in green manures.

TI Runoff losses of surface-applied metribuzin as influenced by yard waste
   compost amendments, no-tillage, and conventional-tillage
SO BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY

AB Soil erosion has been shown to result in decreased crop yields and reduced agricultural sustainability (Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station Technical Bulletin, 1989; Littleboy et al., 1992; and Craft et al., 1992). To address the problems associated with soil erosion, Congress passed the Food Security Act in 1985. To comply with this law, farmers must implement conservation plans on highly erodible land to ''significantly reduce'' erosion rates.
   One widely used method of soil conservation is no-tillage agriculture. But water runoff is reduced under conservation tillage and infiltration increases, possibly resulting in more pesticide movement through the unsaturated zone into the groundwater (Gish et al., 1991 and Donigian and Carsel, 1987). Most research suggests that pesticide sorption to soil is primarily a function of pesticide partitioning into the soil organic matter rather than adsorption into the total soil mass (Karickoff et al., 1979). The addition of commercially composted yard waste when mixed with soil to increase the organic carbon content and adding to soil surface to reduce erosion and water runoff may reduce pesticide loading to groundwater compared to no-till.
   Surface applied organic mulches in general have been shown to reduce soil erosion (Adams, 1966; Kramer and Meyer, 1969; and Vleeschauwer et al., 1978). Yard waste compost in particular has been shown to reduce erosion when surface applied (Ettlin and Stewart, 1993). Since beneficial uses are needed for yard waste compost (BioCycle Guide to Yard Waste Composting, 1989a and 1989b), adding compost to high value horticultural fields should provide a beneficial use for an ever increasing waste product.
   Research comparing pesticide runoff in no-till versus conventional-till have been mixed. Kenimer et al. (1987) concluded that no-till may reduce pesticide loading to surface water while Sauer and Daniel (1987) reported no significant differences. Both reported that any reduction in pesticide runoff is due to reduced water runoff (pesticide runoff concentration was found to be larger in no-till). A compost amended soil should also show the benefit of reduced runoff compared to conventional-till and may show reduced pesticide runoff concentration compared to no-till due to pesticide sorption to organic carbon.
   Metribuzin [4-amino-6-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-3-(methylthio)-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one] has the potential to be transported into the environment(USEPA, 1992, exhibit 4-1 and USEPA, 1985) and it is used to control broadleaf weeds in tomato production (University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service, 1992). The use of yard waste compost to reduce erosion will be beneficial in horticulture due to the value and scale of production.
   The objectives of this research were to study the influence of three soil treatments: 1) yard waste compost amended soil with compost added to soil surface after rototilling, CA; 2) no-till, NT and; 3) conventional-till, CT on metribuzin concentration and loading to surface water via runoff and in sediment

AB Long-term data sets include sedimentary fish-scale paleochronologies, faunal surveys from the 1800s, and the records of game fish catches maintained by the Tuna Club at Avalon since 1898. These data suggest a mode of low-frequency biological variability over a cycle of 50 to 70 years that is associated with alternation of warm and cold physical regimes. The very warm conditions in the northeastern Pacific Ocean since 1976 seem similar to conditions experienced from about 1850 to 1870 Coastal pelagic fish abundances since 1930 indicate an orderly sequence of four or five dominant species through these cycles that is very similar to the order and timing of fluctuations in catches of similar pelagic fishes in Japanese waters. The consistency and predictability of this rotation and the biological relationship to low-frequency fluctuations in physical conditions are important areas for further research. These patterns of low-frequency variability result in boom-and-bust fisheries, and pose serious problems for ''sustainable development.''

AB We used CANSAR (Catch-at-age ANalysis for SARdine, an age-structured stock-assessment model) and a wide range of data to estimate biomass and recruitment of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) off California and northern Baja California during 1983-95. Daily egg production method (DEPM) spawning biomass estimates and an abundance index from CalCOFI data based on generalized additive models were important new sources of information. Biomass (344,000 MT of sardine age 1+ during July 1995, CV = 33%) increased by 28% year(-1). Fishing mortality (particularly for older ages) after 1991 was high and probably not sustainable under average environmental conditions. DEPM data for sardine during 1986-88 and 1994 may have underestimated spawning biomass due to incomplete coverage of spawning habitat. There was a modest potential for bias in the DEPM data due to nonrepresentative sampling of young age groups by survey gear. On the basis of experience with DEPM data for sardine and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), we make suggestions about how DEPM data should be used for fish stock assessment and fishery management. Size-at-age declined during 1983-95 and was significantly correlated with sardine biomass.

DE urban transport; transport mode choice; public transport; regional

AB The paper summarizes the changes in modal transport choice behaviour that occurred in the Toronto region between 1986 and 1991. The evidence presented shows that the region has become more dependent on automobile travel, making the sustainable transport targets adopted by Canada even more difficult to achieve. These changes are analyzed in terms of (i) changes in the size of the socio-demographic market segments that influence modal transport choice, (ii) changes in the choice probabilities of these market segments, and (iii) changes in the spatial structure of the Toronto region. The socio-demographic changes during the 1986-1991 period are less favourable to public transport and the probabilities of selecting public transport for the journey to work have decreased substantially for most of the market segments. The paper shows the overwhelming influence of development density on modal transport choice and the beneficial influence of adjacent high density employment and residential densities on the use of nonmotorized travel. The paper argues that the excessive auto-dependency of the Toronto region is likely to change only if high density suburban development forms are created and comprehensive road and parking pricing schemes introduced.

AB Maintaining soil fertility and sustaining or increasing crop yield is of worldwide importance. Many factors impact upon the complex biological, chemical and physical processes which govern soil fertility. Changes in fertility caused by acidification, declining levels of organic matter, or P and K status may take many years to appear. These properties can in turn be affected by external influences such as atmospheric pollution, global change, or changes in land management practice. Long-term experiments provide the best practical means of studying changes in soil properties and processes and providing information for farmers, scientists and policy makers. This paper shows how the experiments run at Rothamsted in southeast England continue to provide data which are highly relevant to today's agriculture and wider environmental concerns. Examples are given of how crop yield is affected by soil organic matter, by pests and disease and by P nutrition. The effect of atmospheric pollution on soil acidity and the mobilization of heavy metals are also examined. The need for making better use of existing long-term experiments is stressed.

AB Long-term experiments like those at Rothamsted in southeast England offer the best practical means of studying the effects of land management or global change on soil fertility, sustainability of yield or wider environmental issues. For the data from such experiments to be of use, farmers, scientists and policy makers must be certain of their validity. This is best assured by the rigorous management of the experiment, by ensuring that any changes are carefully considered and that all operations are well-documented. A steady flow of well-interpreted, published data is also essential. This paper gives examples of how the long-term field experiments at Rothamsted have been managed and how modifications have been made to ensure their relevance to modem agriculture.

AB Contemporary agricultural research is founded upon short-term controlled studies to examine, screen, and rank performance of genetic improvements or managerial processes. This approach has performed admirably in support of the resource-intensive, high-yield paradigm which has guided agricultural development since the second World War. Changes to this paradigm, which may occur in response to economic, societal, or environmental issues, may require increased emphasis on farm-based, system-oriented research to complement the experiment-station-based research which has proven so successful to date. Corresponding changes to the form, structure, intent, and ultimately, the beneficiaries of agricultural research are discussed.

AB The sustainability of conservation tillage is dependent on the extent of changes in weed community composition, the usage of herbicides, and the development of integrated weed management (IWM) strategies, including biological weed control. The objective of this paper is to review research on conservation tillage and weed management in light of these factors. Recent Canadian research has found that changes in weed communities due to the adoption of conservation tillage are not necessarily those expected and were not consistant by species, location, or year. Changes reflected the use of different selection pressures, such as different crop rotations and herbicides, within the studies to a greater extent than weed life cycle groupings. Therefore, research that determines the reasons for change or the lack of change in weed communities is required to provide the scientific basis for the development of IWM strategies. Documented herbicide usage in conservation tillage varies from less than to more than conventional-tillage systems. Potential to reduce herbicide usage in conservation-tillage systems exists: Furthermore, the herbicides used in western Canada are different from those causing ground water contamination in the United States, are less volatile, and are used at lower rates. The presence of surface crop residues in conservation tillage may provide a unique environment for classical and inundative biological control agents. Some insects, fungi, and bacteria have the potential to survive to a greater extent in undisturbed plant residues. Residue management and conservation tillage systems are evolving in Canada. Research must keep pace by providing weed management strategies that enchance the sustainability of these systems.

AB The zero-tillage and minimum-tillage technologies, which are now being rapidly adopted in many areas of western Canada, have made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the soil resource. As a measure of economic viability of these practices this study uses the Top Management Model to simulate the 5-yr ending equity given stochastic prices and yields for a consensus farm in central Saskatchewan. Simulations are used to compare a minimum disturbance, zero-tillage system to a more conventional direct-seeding system. At 1994 crop and input prices, and a 10% yield advantage, zero-tillage systems compared favourably with conventional direct-seeding system. The relative crop yield and glyphosate price are key determinants to the short-run profitability of adopting zero-tillage technologies with fuel price having a smaller influence. When the switch to zero tillage allows a net reduction in machinery stock, this simultaneously increases the profitability, and reduces the financial risk for the producer. We conclude that in areas of Saskatchewan where zero-tillage systems provide a yield advantage, producers will continue to adopt these systems as an economically viable means of sustaining their soil resource.

AB Soil conservation and sustainability concerns, and a lack of markets for crop residues, have left producers with few alternatives for cereal residue export beyond cattle feed or livestock bedding. With the increasing producer use of minimum and zero-tillage systems, the management of crop residues has become an important issue. Opportunities for residue removal may exist provided markets are developed for the material and long-term soil sustainability concerns are addressed.
   Recent research on the effect-of residue removal in Saskatchewan has shown that there is little or no impact on soil organic matter provided adequate fertilization is practised and tillage is reduced. Assuming that 750 kg ha(-1) of retained residue is adequate for erosion protection in reduced tillage systems, significant quantities of residues may be available for export from the Black Soil zone. The economic returns to producers are such that residue export is an attractive diversification option.

AB Concerns about environmental sustainability and economic survival have changed tillage practices significantly in western Canada. This study examined the effects of conventional (CT), minimum (MT), and no-tillage (NT) management on the economic performance of hard red spring wheat (Triticium aestivum L.) or durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) production when grown in fallow-wheat (F-W) and continuous wheat (Cent W) rotations, over a period of up to 12 yr (1982-1993) on three soil textures in southwestern Saskatchewan. Our results show little short-term economic incentive for producers to adopt NT management practices. Production costs were similar on the three soil textures, averaging $141 ha(-1) for F-W and $224 ha(-1) for Cont W. Total costs for Cent W systems averaged 10 to 13% higher for NT compared to CT. For F-W systems, total costs for NT averaged 29% higher than for CT on the silt loam, and 14% higher on the heavy clay. Also for F-W systems, costs for NT averaged 23, 12, and 17% higher than for MT on silt loam, sandy loam, and heavy clay soils, respectively. Although conservation tillage (MT and NT) provided savings in labor, fuel and oil, machine repair, and machine overhead (compared to CT), these savings were more than offset by greater expenditures for herbicides. On the silt loam, net returns were highest for Cent W (CT) and lowest for F-W (NT) at wheat prices greater than $147 t(-1); at lower wheat prices, F-W (CT) and Cent W (CT) provided the highest and about equal net returns. On the sandy loam, F-W (MT) consistently earned the highest net return; F-W (NT) ranked second highest, while Cent W systems ranked lowest. On the heavy clay, F-W (MT) and Cent W (CT) provided the highest net return at wheat prices greater than $147 t(-1), while at lower wheat prices F-W (MT) ranked highest. In our study, the relatively poor economic performance of conservation tillage, particularly NT, for monoculture wheat production was due to a combination of higher input costs and the lack of significant yield advantages with MT and NT management.

AB In recent years, New Zealand has undergone fundamental economic, institutional and administrative restructuring, One outcome of this has been the implementation of the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA), Fundamental to the RMA is sustainable management of natural resources at a regional scale, However, there are no prescriptive definitions for sustainable management in the act; rather the act allows regional and local government flexibility in developing policy and plans for economic development and environmental preservation, Recognizing the importance of biculturalism in New Zealand society; a further requirement of the Act grants Maori a significant role in the management of natural resources, Within this institutional context, Waitakere City, located on the western margin of the Auckland region, has adopted the principles of Agenda 21, The City Council has designated itself as an eco-city with a ''greenprint'' for future development and growth, A significant component of Agenda 21 is the explicit recognition of indigenous rights, Within its development plans, Waitakere City has adopted Maori concepts for resource management specifically for environmental preservation, water quality and sustainable management, This paper discusses the cross-cultural dynamics of natural resource management in Waitakere City, The first section describes the role of Agenda 21 and RMA in creating the eco-city and its relationship to the greater Auckland region, The second part examines the influence of biculturalism in implementing the goals of the eco-city, The final part considers the arenas in which the principles for sustainability with regard to Maori will be tested in the future.

AB Mainstreet Cascadia is a band of urban development stretching from the Canadian city of Vancouver, British Columbia to the US city of Eugene, Oregon, The rate and pattern of urbanization there have produced deep public concern over growth related problems and negative environmental consequences, City and regional plans have been prepared in response to these conditions with the common goal of promoting more sustainable urbanization. Some cities in the area already exhibit elements of sustainable urbanization and census data indicate these places are measurably different from other places. Demographic and market trends suggest the plans can be successfully implemented. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB The International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) is a new and innovative strategy developed by countries and nongovernmental partners as a means to implement the recommendations on coral reefs and related ecosystems found in Agenda 21 and other international agreements. The ICRI uses a multilevel (international, national, regional, and local), participatory (both top-down and bottom-up) approach based on partnerships formed among many different sectors and stakeholders to promote capacity building, research and monitoring and sustainable use and management of coral reefs and related ecosystems (mangroves and sea grass beds). The ICRI builds on the principles related to coastal zone management and sustainable development-partnership integration, coordination, and participation. The ICRI has been effective in creating political will and momentum among many different sectors and facilitating the development of an international agenda with priorities for coral reefs. An analysis of ICRI's effectiveness to date is provided along with recommendations for its future success.

TI Foreign aid, structural adjustment, and public management: The
   Mozambican experience
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB In looking at the case of Mozambique under structural adjustment, this article argues that the particular combination of fiscal restraints imposed by financial programming, and the proliferation of decentralized project-based management, together proved to be a potent mixture which failed to reconstruct a coherent pattern of state action. The problem lies in the increasing dominance of foreign aid and in the uneasy interplay between programme aid on the one hand and project aid on the other, as competition from projects wins resources away from regular state programmes, with very little prospect of such projects becoming self-sustainable in the absence of the continued infusion of foreign aid.

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE ecological economics; uncertainty; fiscal instruments; political
   dimensions
AB Research on energy taxation is often based on purely theoretical deductions. This paper stays closer to the real world, using empirical data and interpreting results in a political-economic setting of risk and uncertainty. Economic growth in developing countries will boost energy demand, increasing the risk of shortages of oil and natural gas half-way through the next century, and of coal towards the year 2100. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that emissions of CO2 trigger harmful climate changes. A timely introduction of regulatory taxes will reduce demand for fossil fuels and accelerate the introduction of sustainable technology. The empirical results presented show, moreover, that such taxes may claim a substantial part of the rent on energy extraction for the energy-importing countries. It is argued that optimal control and the avoidance of displacement effects require a tax affecting marginal use, with exceptions to safeguard competitive positions. Exceptions may be scaled down as the jurisdiction is enlarged.

AB The paper explains how to design eco-sustainable technologies, following the pathway from 'high-tech' to 'clean/er tech' and to ecologically as well as societally sustainable 'eco-tech'. 'Eco-principles' are derived from the ecosphere, representing the intelligence of nature as the result of evolution, and serve as guideline for the general eco-restructuring of technology and many other areas of society, e.g., education and landscapes. Indices for the estimation of sustainability with its four dimensions (economical, social, ecological and technical) are presented, the sustainable livelihood security index (SLSI), the sustainable process index (SPI) and a general index (SI) are formulated. Case studies illustrate the achieved ecological sustainability by applying the SPI in case of bioprocesses for industrial productions: drinking water denitrification, control agents in agriculture and polymers comparing the biological with the chemical production.

AB Many of today's grazing ecosystem management problems require a predictive understanding of the interactions between ecological processes acting across different spatiotemporal scales with complex soil, vegetation, climate, topographic and geologic characteristics. Due to complexity of ecosystems and the incomplete nature of empirical data for specific relationships involved in ecosystem dynamics, resource managers usually select management strategies without complete information or knowledge. Such vagueness in real world situations is also an obstacle to understanding and modeling ecosystem dynamics by means of conventional mathematical and computer simulation techniques. Modeling, simulating, and analyzing actual ecosystems can be significantly improved if modeling is extended to deal with imprecise and vague variables, relationships, and events. In this paper, a simulation model combining fuzzy imprecision with probabilistic uncertainty is formulated to study climate-plant-herbivore interactions in,grassland ecosystems. This approach provides a unifying simulation framework to integrate numerical data, linguistic statements, and expert experience. The model includes treatment of imprecise and vague input variables as fuzzy variables, use of fuzzy arithmetic in equations when fuzzy and probability numbers are involved, and replacement of some of the relationships in the dynamic systems either with fuzzy conditional statements, or with fuzzy algorithms. The temporal patterns of herbivore population and primary production for a laissez-faire, extensive system in both Australia and China are modeled. The consistency of results obtained from the two simulations suggests the underlying mechanisms for semi-arid grassland ecosystems are those included in the model. Models combining fuzzy sets to quantify subjective parameters and traditional mechanistic techniques can be used to form a basis of long-term managerial policies for a sustainable grassland ecosystem.

AB The political economy of agriculture literature increasingly focuses research on production-consumption relations of different agro-food systems. This paper examines contextual pressures facing orchardists in the globally oriented apple complex of Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. The paper details the emerging political economy of orcharding in the crisis conditions of the 1990s under the joint influences of globalization forces, interest in sustainability principles, and disruptive natural hazard events. New regulatory politics embracing apples is implicated in attempts to reinsert the regional apple complex into the global fresh fruit industry. Developments in Hawke's Bay are shown to be embedded in wider processes (including those of regulation) stretching across nations and are affected by conflicting spatialities of operational geographies of agents. Accommodating the risk of the apple sector appears to be closely tied to supportive networking in which investors are gradually refashioning the apple sector into a buyer- or consumer-driven production complex.

TI Risk assessment in the regulatory process for wetlands
SO ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
LA English

ID MILLTOWN RESERVOIR; RIPARIAN FORESTS; RIVER; MONTANA
AB This paper presents an ecosystem-based approach to risk assessment in freshwater wetlands. The key concept in this approach is that the primary biotic and abiotic components that determine the structural and functional characteristics of wetlands are inseparable. Each component should be identified and its contribution to ecosystem functions or human values determined when deciding whether a stressor poses an unreasonable risk to the sustainability of a particular wetland. Understanding the major external and internal factors that regulate the operational conditions of wetlands is critical to risk characterization. Determining the linkages between these factors, and how they influence the way stressors affect wetlands, is the basis for an ecosystem approach. Adequate consideration of wetland ecology, hydrology, geomorphology, and soils can greatly reduce the level of uncertainty associated with risk assessment and lead to more effective risk management. In order to formulate effective solutions, wetland problems must be considered at watershed, landscape, and ecosystem scales. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

TI Islands of sustainability: A bottom-up approach towards sustainable
   development
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA English
DT Article
ID INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY; REGIONAL-GEOGRAPHY
AB In this paper we introduce the concept of 'islands of sustainability'. The basic assumption is that the development towards sustainability can be introduced starting from sustainable 'islands'. An island is an area where sustainability is reached at a local or regional level. Exchange activities within the regional network and with the environment are key points in creating an island of sustainability. One of the main theses is that the concept of sustainability addresses not only the interactions between the economic system and the ecosphere but also structural aspects of the anthropogenic system, such as the economic diversity and economic connectedness. Hence, sustainability is linked to the complexity of the regional network. In order to attain sustainability the intensity, the speed, and comprehensiveness of internal and external interactions, as well as the connectedness of the regional network, have to be changed. In this paper we examine the regional system. The structure, elements, interactions, and boundaries of the regional system are discussed in detail. This systems analysis is the basis of the definition of islands of sustainability. Once we reach sustainable development within islands, we then turn our discussion to the change of the whole unsustainable economic system. Islands of sustainability can be seen as 'troublemakers' which infiltrate the whole unsustainable system and act as cells of development.

AB The introduction of community based reproductive health care programmes in Tanzania integrated within primary health care (PHC) programmes is discussed. These programmes should address safe motherhood, fertility awareness and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including AIDS. It is argued that the proposed primary reproductive health care programmes will only be sustainable if community participation is achieved, and if combined with improved woman and child health programmes. Sensitized communities, who have learned how to prioritize the problems identified and the appropriate actions to take, will have to be linked at the local level with well trained and supervised health workers, having proper equipment and supplies. A limited number of measurable indicators should give feedback on progress at any given time to both communities and health workers on mutually agreed objectives. The requirements demanded for these programmes add to the difficulties of a health service which experiences already considerable financial and other constraints. Major improvement in the financial support will be needed to raise quality and confidence in the health care system. Supplementation of domestic resources by considerable long-term external donor assistance is essential for filling the resource gap. Further, a more efficient and effective use of resources is required. This makes substantial health system reform and reallocation of public spending important, as well as consistent and coordinated support for district health systems.

SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH

ID CROPPING SEQUENCE
AB Integrated nutrient supply of inorganic and organic sources is of great importance for maintenance of productivity in intensive cropping systems. This study evaluated the integrated use of chemical fertilizers and the organic sources of farm yard manure (FYM), wheat straw, and green manure on the long-term productivity of an irrigated sorghum (Sorghum-bicolor (L.) Moench)-wheat (Triticum aestivum (L.) emend. Fiori & Paol) system at three semiarid sites. The results showed the possibility of substituting 50% of the N requirement for sorghum by FYM without adverse effect on productivity. Substitution of N fertilizer by wheat straw and green manure generally reduced yields of both sorghum and wheat. Integrated nutrient supply increased soil organic carbon and available N compared to application of all nutrients through fertilizers. It had a variable effect on available P status and reduced the decline in available K. Available soil S, Nln, and Fe increased, while available Cu and Zn remained unaffected. Because the integrated nutrient supply increased soil fertility, it is suggested for use in an irrigated sorghum-wheat system in order to maintain productivity.

AB 1. Repeatability is important in determining how traits are affected by selection, but it is largely unstudied for most physiological characters other than locomotory performance. We examined the repeatability of aerobic capacity, measured as maximum O-2 consumption (Vo(2max)), in Red Junglefowl, Gallus gallus. Vo(2max) is an integrated index of metabolic performance that can be intuitively linked to fitness because it sets the upper limit to sustainable power output.
   2. We used mass residuals to determine Vo(2max) repeatability in adult birds, and across growth from 28-day-old chicks to reproductively mature adults. We measured Vo(2max) during brief episodes of intense exercise in motorized running wheels. Minimal resting metabolism (Vo(2mr)) was measured in adults to provide an estimate of factorial aerobic scope (Vo(2max)/Vo(2mr)) We also examined the influences of sex and infection by a common intestinal nematode, Ascaridia galli, on Vo(2max)
   3. There were no gender differences in adult Vo(2mr) or in the Vo(2max) of chicks. However, the Vo(2max) of adult males was considerably greater than that of adult females. Factorial aerobic scopes were 9 . 6 and 5 . 6 for adult males and females, respectively. Higher scope in males may be an adaptation to support intense, prolonged intermale aggression. Infection with A. galli significantly depressed the mass and Vo(2max) of chicks but had no effect on adults.
   4. The Vo(2max) of adult junglefowl was highly repeatable over periods up to 180 days. In contrast, we found no repeatability of Vo(2max) across ontogeny for birds tested initially as chicks and again as adults. The lack of repeatability was not influenced by sex or infection status.

AB The coastal zone in Kuwait has been under a considerable pressure from conflicting land uses since the early 1960s, as well as from the destruction and oil pollution caused by the Gulf War. To avoid further damage and to protect the coastal heritage it is essential to adopt an environmentally sustainable management process. This paper shows how the study of coastal geomorphology can provide a sound basis for sustainable planning and management. Based on coastal landforms, sediments and processes, the coastline of Kuwait was divided into nine geomorphic zones. These zones were grouped into two main geomorphic provinces. The northern province is marked by extensive muddy intertidal flats and dominated by a depositional and low-energy environment. The southern geomorphic province is characterised by relatively steep beach profiles, rocky/sandy tidal flats and a moderate to high-energy environment. The study has demonstrated that pollution, benthic ecology and other environmental conditions of the coast are a function of coastline geomorphology, sedimentology and related processes. The geomorphological information was used to determine the coastal vulnerability and to assess the environmental impacts of development projects and other human activities. Several strategies were outlined to integrate the geomorphic approach into the management of the coastal resources.

AB This paper gives a short overview of early analog computing in Sweden in the 1940s and 1950s. Being a small country, Sweden tried to catch up with the development of computing that had been going on in the United Stales and elsewhere during World War II, and in the 1950s Sweden was pioneering this technology By the late 1960s, Sweden was one of the most computer-intensive countries, with a successful domestic computer industry. Unable to maintain a sustainable general computer production, some small sectors of Swedish computer R&D have prospered. In the concluding remarks, I suggest that the concept of ''technological niches'' is a useful tool, both analytically and for technology policy-making.

AB This research is concerned with the problems that may arise in paying for the costs of secondary school places in developing countries, which have experienced a rapid increase in primary school enrolments since the World Conference on Education for All at Jomtien. Many, but not all, of these countries are in sub-Saharan Africa. Case studies are being conducted six African and Asian countries. The basic argument is that cost structures, which may have been appropriate for systems that had low gross enrolment ratios and modest transition rates from primary to secondary are unlikely to be sustainable as enrolments become universalised. The challenge is to identify opportunities to expand quality secondary schooling to meet new needs while reducing costs to levels which can be afforded. Access to and quality of secondary schooling is likely to dominate the educational planning agenda in many developing countries in the early part of the twenty-first century.

AB Remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) are two important tools in developmental planning. This study demonstrates their application in sustainable rural development planning especially for people at the grass root level, the farmers, in the Bahal-Singhani area of Bhiwani district, Haryana, in north-western India. A holistic approach was adopted considering the production and the conservation functions of the ecosystem. Remotely sensed data were utilized to assess the natural resources of the area. A thorough analysis of climatic, socio-economic and natural resources conditions was made. A set of rules was formulated and all the information was integrated to prepare realistic action plans. These action plans have found wide acceptance due to their practicability and soundness.

AB A population of Garden Warbler was studied in a natural habitat in the Urseren valley (1500 m a. s. l.) for 7 years. The aim of this study was to describe the migration phenology and to evaluate if a self-sustainable population of this long distance migrant can exist under unfavourable climatic conditions. In spring, the Garden Warblers arrive about 3 weeks later, but in late summer they leave their territories at the same time as their conspecifics in the lowlands. Possible consequences of the restricted breeding period for juvenile development and migration schedule are discussed. In the study area, a very high breeding density (25 territories/10 ha) was recorded. The birds show a remarkable breeding and natal site fidelity (48 % of adults and 6 % of nestlings returned the following year). The overall breeding success was 48 %. The main causes of failure were predation and bad weather events. The latter were responsible for the annual fluctuations of breeding success. In conclusion, this study confirms that self-sustainable populations of this long-distance migratory species exist in mountain habitats.

AB The nodulation, nitrogen fixation and nitrogen uptake of four pigeonpea genotypes belonging to extra shot? duration, shea duration and long duration maturity groups grown on an Inceptisol were studied to examine why, despite the poor nodulation of pigeonpea in this soil, it still produces greater yields than in Alfisols and Vertisols. The percentage nitrogen derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) was estimated by N-15 natural abundance and N-difference methods using a long duration sorghum as the non-fixing reference crop. In general, nodulation of pigeonpea in the Inceptisol was much lower than that reported in Alfisols and Vertisols. The above-ground dry matter ranged from 3.1 to 17.1 t ha(-1) while the N uptake ranged from 62.3 to 215 kg ha(-1). The fallen plant parts of pigeonpea genotypes ranged from 1.4 to 4.9 t ha(-1) and their N contents ranged from 25 to 84 kg ha(-1). The estimates of percentage Ndfa obtained by the two methods were different. Those obtained by the N-15 natural abundance appeared more appropriate as the delta(15)N of sorghum harvested along with short duration pigeonpea and later when it was mature did not change significantly. The extra short duration pigeonpea genotype ICPL 84023 contained very little N from atmospheric N-2, while the shea duration pigeonpea cv. ICPL 151 had 17% Ndfa and the long duration genotypes ICPL 366 and T7 had up to 36% Ndfa. It can be concluded that one of the causes of high yields of pigeonpea on Inceptisols compared to Alfisols and Vertisols despite poor nodulation could be the high N supplying capacity of these Inceptisols. Strategies have been suggested as to how pigeonpea genotypes grown in Inceptisols could improve their nodulation and nitrogen fixation and thus better contribute to a sustainable agriculture.

AB A benefits transfer exercise is performed to give a spatial representation to the total economic value of the Rio Brave Conservation Area in north western Belize. The methodology investigates the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to calibrate economic values from alternative sites for transfer to the site of interest. This is achieved by first mapping the ''strength'' or ''quality'' of the natural capital assets in the Rio Brave, then using these maps to re-calibrate benefit estimates from alternative sites. The results of this process are ''economic value maps'', showing the benefit value of natural capital assets in two-dimensions. Given the growing interest in the feasibility of transferring benefit estimates the paper demonstrates how GIS may be a powerful vehicle for comparing site characteristics prior to transferring values. The methodology also adds a spatial dimension to existing resource accounting frameworks. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB The emergence of the ecosystem health paradigm coincides with calls for more holistic, systems-based approaches to agricultural management. Ecosystem health incorporates medical analogies and procedural steps to evaluate and ''treat'' natural and controlled ecosystems, including agroecosystems. The conceptual basis for determining ''health'' in an agroecosystem context is still in the early stages, and hence, may benefit from other systems-based agricultural and ecological research approaches.
   Bodies of scholarship pertaining to ecological integrity, agroecology, agricultural systems and farming systems research, reviewed here, vary in terms of their application scale, dimension and potential utility in assessing the health of agroecosystems. Seven system properties are revealed among these approaches which lend themselves to a health interpretation. Five of these-stability, resilience, diversity/complexity, efficiency and equitability-are useful as a basis for defining agroecosystem health. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB Cover crops have become a viable option for sustainable agriculture because of contributions to soil fertility and improved crop performance. This paper focuses on weed control and summarizes present knowledge of the contribution of cover crops to managing weeds in sustainable agricultural systems. Residue from winter annual cover crops provides early-season weed suppression but not full-season weed control. Living mulches that are effective at controlling weeds also will require management to prevent excess competition with the cash crop. Elimination of herbicides is not a realistic objective for using cover crops. Rather, herbicides should be considered a tool for managing cover crops and optimizing their potential for improving soils and sustaining agricultural production.

AB Government farm programs directly and indirectly affect the economic viability of alternative systems of farming, and thus affect farmers' choices among alternative weed management strategies. The primary objective of farm policy since the 1930s has been to increase agricultural productivity, both for the short run benefit of farmers and the long run benefit of food and fiber consumers. Past policies have supported and subsidized highly specialized systems of farming that are inherently dependent on commercial chemicals for weed control. A shift in public priorities toward agricultural sustainability, which balances the goals of productivity with resource conservation and environmental protection, is changing government farm programs. Future farm policies are likely to support more diverse systems of farming and more integrated systems of weed management.

AB Refugia from trapping are believed to be important to support a long-term sustainable harvest of Canada lynx (Lynx lynx), but long-term studies in unharvested areas are lacking. We studied lynx population characteristics in relation to snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) densities in a 301 km(2) refugium in the Yukon Territory between 1986 adn 1994. Lynx carcasses were collected from adjacent trapping concessions for analysis of attributes of the harvested population. Hare density peaked in summer 1990 and began to decline in the winter of 1990-91. Lynx density in March varied with hare density from 2.7/100 km(2) in 1987 to 44.9/100 km(2) in 1991-92. The lynx population doubled annually for 4 years when reproduction and kit and adult survival were high, and immigration balanced or exceeded emigration. High mortality and emigration characterized the lynx decline. Proportions of breeding adults were 100% most years, including the first year of declining hare densities, but zero in the following 2 years. Yearling females reproduced only in the 2 years of highest hare numbers. Kit survival, which was 0% in 1986-87, peaked at 75% for kits of adult females and 26% for kits of yearlings in 1990-91. Emigration peaked annually from March-June, was lowest Sept.-Oct., and was not sex-biased. At least 16% (n=22) of emigrants were trapped or shot. Seventeen lynx (14M, 3F) emigrated 100-1100 km. Annual natural mortality rates were under 11% for the first 6 years of study, including 2 years of hare decline, 60% in 1992-93 and 25% in 1993-94. The carcass sample contained 36% fewer kits, 40% more yearlings, and 4% fewer adults than were present on the study area, reflecting the lower birth and survival rates of kits of yearling females and trapping bias. Mean annual lynx home range size did not vary with hare density, until 1992-93 when male ranges increased markedly, and 1993-94 when female ranges increased. We recommend a network of permanently assigned untrapped areas to facilitate normal lynx population responses to changing snowshoe hare densities, to prevent local extinctions, and to maximize lynx harvests over a complete population cycle.

AB Water management in European States is currently undergoing a series of major shifts linked to changing user and consumer demands, the increasing role of European Union legislation and, critically, the need to address sustainability in water uses, These shifts have a spatial expression, A comparative analysis of recent water management practice in two Member States of the EU, France and Britain (England and Wales), reveals both a new territorial focus in water management, as existing structures and institutions of water policy adapt to the changing environmental agenda, and the development of an integrated approach at the local level based upon river catchments.

DT Article
AB In 1990, the Queensland Government initiated an Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) program in response to community concerns about the sustainability of the states' natural resources, This paper outlines the characteristics of this new policy approach and reviews the progress of ICM implementation in the Johnstone River catchment (JRC) on the wet tropical coast (WTC) of Queensland. Conceptual and process aspects of ICM are detailed and the technical, economic and institutional environment in which ICM operates in the JRC are discussed, Mechanisms are presented to facilitate the implementation of the institutional and individual change required to translate the ICM philosophy and its associated planning activities into meaningful outcomes for stakeholders.

AB There is still a dearth of appropriate and adequate land survey and large-scale mapping coverage in many countries to facilitate more effective land-related planning, development and management. This situation, in relative terms, applies to both developed and developing countries. Fortuitously, technology is now available and accessible to expand land surveys and the production of large-scale maps at the scales required to support planning and sustainable land development and management. What is now required is official public policy recognition, the attribution of a higher level of priority to this issue, and the allocation of adequate resources to implement an expanded production programme of large-scale maps of cities, towns and villages to facilitate more appropriate settlements and other related land development planning.

ID GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES; SEDIMENT
AB Land-use changes affecting Mediterranean mountains represent the intensification of use in valley bottoms, accompanied by land-use conflicts, and a generalized abandonment of the hillslopes, which in the past were perfectly integrated in the system of land management. Farmland abandonment, reforestation, diminution of the livestock pressure and substitution of cereal crops by meadows are the most outstanding features of the recent land-use changes. The question is whether the new spatial organisation is in accordance with a longterm policy of sustainable development in mountain areas. The results obtained confirm that farmland abandonment on steep slopes - and the resulting colonization of old fields by a dense shrub cover - and afforestation contribute to control both soil erosion and surface runoff. As a result some of the most important rivers and alluvial fans have recently stabilized their sedimentary structures.

AB Control theory provides methods to calculate optimal control of agricultural ecosystems based on dynamic models. Optimization problems formulated with these models can focus either on small time scales (one vegetation period) or significant larger scales (crop rotations). Performance criteria are developed which include sustainability in addition to economic criteria.
   An aggregated model simulates crop growth and soil nitrogen dynamics in an ecotope. An optimal control problem is defined with fertilizing as control variable and solved for several performance criteria. Optimization results show that both, acceptable yields and drastic reduction of environmental side effects can be achieved.

AB The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, a multiple-use marine protected area covering some 344,000 km(2), extends from low-water mark along much of the Queensland coast out to the Coral Sea. The area encompassed within the park's outer boundaries is managed as a single ecosystem through agreements between the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government relating to Marine Parks and Island National Parks. The advantages of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park model of large area management fall under the heading of ecosystem management: managing for ecologically sustainable use, including recognition and balancing of all interests and legitimate extractive activities, and providing for protection of significant areas where resource extraction is prohibited, The model includes legislative support of the complementary management arrangements of stare and federal agencies (e.g., fisheries agencies). Disadvantages of the model include the geographical restriction of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to marine areas (major impacts undoubtedly arise on the mainland), the magnitude of resources required to manage such a large area adequately, the difficulties of having several agencies involved in management, and legislative requirements. On the balance, however, large area management is a more rational and forward-looking method of achieving ecologically sustainable use.

AB The present paper generalizes the Weitzman/Hartwick approach to national income accounting. We first establish a close general relation between the current value Hamiltonian of an optimal control problem and the optimal value of the objective integral if the time argument does not enter the constraints and enters the objective function only as a discount factor. This result is applied to a simple economic model covering most models found in the literature on national income accounting involving pollution and non-renewable resources. We critically review the usefulness of net national product as a welfare indicator and as an indicator for sustainability.

AB This paper aims at positioning spatial development at the crossroads of the conflicting needs for spatial mobility and spatial sustainability. Such tensions have explicitly been recognized in recent local, national and international policy documents. A reconciliation of such antagonistic driving forces in our modern network economy requires a solid theoretical framework in which the relevant force fields are depicted and in which the uncertainties inherent in any attempt at steering human behavior in space are explicitly recognized. This requires an analytical framework in which relevant scenarios are systematically projected on a model structure describing the above mentioned force field. This paper will try to offer an operational methodology for coping with the above mentioned conflicting issues in planning for sustainable spatial development. Particular attention will be given to the spatial scale of analyzing sustainable development. The methodology will be illustrated by presenting empirical results from a case study undertaken in the western part of the Netherlands, the so called Randstad.

AB The enchytraeid fauna has been measured on 6 pasture soils (4 hill pasture, 2 dairy), 2 mixed cropping soils, 2 Kiwifruit orchard soils, and one native forest soil. Enchytraeid numbers were highest in the Kiwifruit orchards and the hill pastures and lowest on the dairy pasture and the native forest. There was no correlation of enchytraeid numbers with pH. All the agriculturally modified soils had a Fridericia-Lumbricetum oligichaete fauna, whereas the native forest soil had megascolecid earthworms and enchytraeids of the Mesenchytraeus-Cernosvitoviella type. The enchytraeid fauna is sensitive to changes in management, both in terms of total population numbers and species composition. However, the difficulties of measurement and identification limit their usefulness as routine bioindicators for sustainable management.

AB Managed fallows which recover nutrients more rapidly than natural secondary vegetation may improve the performance of shifting agriculture systems operating under inadequately long fallow cycles. Our objective was to construct nutrient balances for the soil, vegetation, and litter compartments of six planted leguminous fallows and natural secondary vegetation during 53 months. The fallows were planted on a previously cultivated Ultisol (Acrisol) in the Peruvian Amazon and included : Centrosema macrocarpum (Centrosema), Pueraria phaseoloides (Pueraria), Stylosanthes guianensis (Stylosanthes), Desmodium ovalifolium (Desmodium), Cajanus cajan (Cajanus), and Inga edulis (In,oa). In addition, in the natural fallow treatment secondary vegetation was allowed to establish and grow naturally. Quantities of extractable P, K, Ca, and Mg, total N, and organic C in soil to a 45 cm depth, and macronutrients in aboveground biomass, roots, and litter were estimated at fallow planting, at 8, 17, and 29 months afterward, and at fallow clearing (53 months). Total N stocks increased by 10% in the Stylosanthes, Desmodium, Pueraria, and Inga treatments, but changed little in the Cajanus, Centrosema and natural fallows. This difference was largely due to greater net increases in both soil and vegetation compartments in the former group of treatments. In the Inga, Desmodium, and natural fallows, total stocks of P and K at 53 months were about 40% to 80% greater and 12% greater, respectively, than initial values, but Ca and Mg stocks were reduced by 25% to 40%. In the other treatments, there was generally little change in P stocks, but large (30% to 60%) reductions in K, Ca, and Mg during the course of the fallow. Although there were net decreases of stocks of P, K, Ca, and Mg in soil in all treatments during the fallow, storage of P and K in vegetation and litter in the Inga, Desmodium, and natural fallows offset losses of these nutrients from soil. These treatments also tended to accumulate more Ca and Mg in biomass and litter than the other treatments. These results suggest that leguminous fallow vegetation that accumulates large amounts of biomass may increase N, P, and K stocks, but that incomplete recuperation of Ca and Mg may limit the sustainability of short-rotation fallow-based systems on acidic, infertile soils.

AB Traditionally solid waste management has evolved as mainly the removal of municipal wastes by hauling them out of the city boundaries and dumping them 'there'. This is in conformity with the 'out of sight out of mind' philosophy. However, with the ever increasing tonnage of refuse due to the expansion of urban centers, which implies increased collection, transportation and disposal costs, recycling is currently accepted as a sustainable approach to solid waste management, This paper reports on the findings of a study, conducted in the city of Dar es Salaam between the years 1993 and 1995, on the scavenging activities and recycling trends of some selected items in Dar es Salaam. Apart from the discussions on existing solid waste generation rates (2000 tonnes/day), composition (60%, being organic/or vegetable matter) and their management in Dar es Salaam, the paper also presents data obtained through a survey of Vingunguti dump site and other waste collection centers. It was established that there are currently about 600 solid waste scavengers in Dar es Salaam, approximately 109 of whom operate at Vingunguti dump site and others at 14 different collection centers, Many of them opted for scavenging due to unemployment. The study findings indicate that their average monthly income exceeded the official minimum wage (at the time of study) enabling them to support their families. This demonstrates the potential of recycling to generate gainful employment with implied lower crime rates among the unemployed. Recycling activities in the city were observed to be not only a critical source of raw materials for small-scale industries, in the absence of which they would cease to operate, but also a widely accepted environmentally friendly technology for solid waste management. Out of 294 tonnes of studied waste materials (paper, metal, plastic, glass and textiles) only 4 tonnes are recovered and recycled. The remaining 290 tonnes/day of recyclable material are left to pollute the environment or are collected and transported for final disposal and, therefore, unnecessarily contribute to the shortening of the life span of the dump site. Finally, the paper gives some recommendations for improved recycling activity so as to make it an important means of reducing the overall volume of waste materials to be transported and deposited in the Jump site and at the same time provide a potential opportunity for employment for unskilled workers.

DE ecologically sustainable societies; social values; dissipative
   structures; self-organizing evolution
AB This paper describes an approach to policy intervention aimed at achieving sustainable relations between humans and their ecosystems. Following the Introduction, Section 2 defines an ecologically sustainable and economically healthy society, and advances the premise that the achievement of sustainable societies is impossible without the reorientation of social values. Sections 3 and 4 summarize the main principles of the theory of dissipative structures and add an ecosystem basis to this paradigm to develop a conceptual model for the purpose of evaluating alternative forms of intervention to influence the evolution of a society along a sustainable and healthy path. Section 5 outlines a methodology for assessing, evaluating, and tracking the system's transition from its current state to one that is within the acceptable definition of sustainable functioning. The final section proposes application of this approach to policy development problems in the Gulf of Maine ecosystem.

AB Growth of traffic increasingly threatens the economic life of larger cities. To cope with these problems, The Netherlands' government has developed a policy based on the concept of a sustainable society. In a sustainable society, all developments meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. In the design of transport systems, this means the traffic problems are not passed down to future generations. This calls for a new vision of transport, a new policy, a different balance, and the political will to change. This policy entails setting limits to the adverse effects of traffic and transport growth, limits on air pollution, limits on land use, limits on energy consumption, and limits on road hazards. Transport policy should also continue to ensure good access, but not necessarily for the private car. Vehicles use therefore has to be influenced. The overall issue involves curbing unnecessary car use and promoting public transport and the bicycle, while maintaining the existing road infrastructure adequately.

AB A simple model that describes growth in terms of physical and physiological processes is needed to predict growth rates and hence the productivity of trees at particular sites. The linear relationship expected between absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (phi(pa), MJ m(-2)) and dry mass production (G(t)); i.e., G(t) = epsilon phi(pa), where epsilon is the radiation utilization coefficient, was fitted to three years' data from five Western Australian Eucalyptus globulus Labill. plantations for which monthly growth measurements, leaf area indices, weather data and soil water measurements were available. Reductions in growth efficiency relative to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation were associated with high vapor pressure deficits (D, kPa) so the relationship between monthly aboveground biomass increments and D was used to calculate utilizable phi(pa), Plotting cumulative aboveground growth against utilizable phi(pa) gave strong linear relationships with slope epsilon. Values of epsilon ranged from 0.93 to 2.23 g dry mass MJ(-1) phi(pa). The variation could not be explained either in terms of soil water content in the root zones, because all plantations appeared to have access to groundwater, or in terms of soil chemistry. A value of epsilon approximate to 2.2 is considered near the maximum likely to be applicable to Eucalyptus plantations. An interesting peripheral finding was a strong relationship between allometric ratios and soil phosphorus; this, if confirmed elsewhere, will be of considerable value in converting biomass increments to wood production. There was also a strong negative relationship between the average ratio of leaf/total aboveground biomass and soil nitrogen content.

AB Sustainability in agricultural production is not necessarily the consequence of the level of production intensity. Of major importance - beside sociological and economical aspects - is the productivity of the soil and this means the continuity of soil functions where are mainly determined by the organic matter content and on the cycles of nutrients and water.
   Modern technology, alongside traditional tools and implements, offers a wide range of equipment for the different field operations with increasing precision. An important aspect is the sensitive and situation appropriate selection and utilization of farm machinery to improve the input/output relation, to save energy and resources, to reduce the use of chemicals by either substituting them or by demand and target orientated application and to control and reduce negative side effects, aiming at our common target: Sustainability at a high level of productivity.

AB In the Ghibe valley, south-west Ethiopia, a tsetse control trial using deltamethrin-impregnated targets was started in May 1990. The mean relative density of the main vector, Glossina pallidipes, fell from 2.1 flies per trap per day in the 12 months prior to introduction of tsetse control to 0.41 flies per trap per day in the 12 months after tsetse control was initiated. The annual mean prevalence of Trypanosoma congolense infections in cattle fell from 32% in the 2 years before tsetse control to 13% in the 2 years following deployment of targets. The largest reduction occurred in the first quarter of 1991 when the mean monthly trypanosome prevalence was 5%. There was also a decrease of approximately 75% in the estimated rate of relapse of trypanosome infections in cattle after treatment with diminazene aceturate. However, in June 1991, socio-political disturbances occurred in Ethiopia and were associated with substantial thefts of targets. Following these thefts, the mean relative density of G. pallidipes rose from 0.41 flies per trap per day in the period May 1990-April 1991, to 1.29 flies per trap per day in the period April 1932-March 1993. Associated with this rise, the mean trypanosome prevalence in cattle increased from 13% in the period May 1991-April 1992 to 28% in the period May 1992-April 1993. This was similar to the mean trypanosome prevalence in cattle during the pre-control period. Thus, while effective tsetse control methods can be used to reduce the transmission of trypanosomes their long-term impact is dependent on their sustainability.

TI The conservation cycle in the cities of the developing world:
   Implications for authenticity and policy
SO URBAN GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
ID URBAN CONSERVATION; INNER-CITY; GENTRIFICATION; PRESERVATION
AB Urban conservation in developing countries takes place despite limited funds, strong forces of deterioration, and the lack of popular and private-sector support. These challenges contribute to the existence of a conservation cycle in which policies evolve from an emphasis on monuments, to largely cosmetic enhancement schemes, to area-improvement projects, and, finally, to more ambitious removal programs. The four stages of the cycle are illustrated with reference to the historic center of Quite, Ecuador. Escape From the cycle to a condition of sustainability is achieved when the private sector is motivated to invest on a scale that generates permanent upgrading. This motivation becomes possible with the area scheme and is a virtual certainty if removal measures come to dominate conservation policy. However, progress through the cycle diminishes the traditional heterogeneity of social groups and ways of life that characterize the historic centers. Reference to the concept of authenticity highlights the tension between architectural conservation, a changing human environment, and the meaning placed in that environment. Although interpreting the meaning of conservation presents problems for policymakers, an improved awareness should contribute to a more sensitive policy.

AB Conventional location/allocation models for solid waste management usually focus on the economic optimization. However, the siting of important facilities, such as landfills, incinerators and transfer stations, in the solid waste management system still encounters several other limitations which must be considered through the use of optimization techniques. This paper presents sustainable waste management strategies in which the decision makers may put forward their views on material recycling and the assimilative capacity of the environment for two major factors; air pollution control and leachate impact. A mixed integer programming model with the framework of dynamic optimization is applied to achieve such a goal. (C) 1996 ISWA

AB The conflict among environmental and economic goals is a constant problem that always bothers the decision makers in regional planning. Besides, the uncertainties regarding the fuzzy goals in decision making and the impreciseness of parameter values in a system always create additional difficulties in management planning and analysis. This paper develops a new approach, a grey fuzzy multiobjective linear programming (GFMOLP) method, for the evaluation of sustainable management strategies for systems analysis. In particular, it demonstrates how uncertain messages of the planning objectives can be quantified by specific membership functions and combined through the use of grey numbers in a multiobjective analytical framework. It is verified that such an approach can successfully reflect system complexity and generate more flexible and robust management policies. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB The conflict between environmental protection of reservoir water quality and economic development by different uses of land within a watershed is a problem that constantly bothers the public officials in regional planning. Besides, the uncertainties regarding to the fuzzy goals in decision making and the impreciseness of parameter values always create additional difficulties in systems analysis. This paper applies the grey fuzzy multiobjective linear programming (GFMOLP) method for the evaluation of sustainable management strategies for optimal land development in a reservoir watershed. In particular, it demonstrates how uncertain messages in water resources management systems can be quantified by specific fuzzy membership functions and grey numbers in a multiobjective analytical framework. A case study of the planning for land-use programs in the Tweng-Wen reservoir watershed in Taiwan was prepared for the purpose of demonstration. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Sustainable rangeland management will require successional strategies to deal with the expanding weed problem. These strategies must be consistent with the view that plant communities are dynamic and technology is used to enhance the natural processes and mechanisms that direct vegetation change. The goal is to shift the dynamics toward a desired plant community. A unified conceptual model is necessary to direct the development and application of successional weed management systems. We propose using a resource management model as a conceptual basis for successional weed management. This model is based on the primary causes of succession: site availability, differential species availability, and differential species performance. This model provides the mechanistic framework necessary for developing successional weed management systems and it is meant to enhance communication among rangeland weed managers and scientists.

TI Meeting the challenge of railway injury in a South African city
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; FATALITIES
AB Background Efficient and safe transport infrastructure is vital for economic growth in developing countries. The city of Cape Town, South Africa, has an extensive rail network with high levels of injury and violence. We investigated the reporting and frequency of railway injuries and examined their reduction through a range of interventions.
   Methods We analysed railway injury and death reporting by Cape Town's rail utility, state mortuaries, and a regional trauma survey. The data were obtained over 2.5 years, and the use of more than one data source was necessary to increase the size of the data pool and to determine underreporting.
   Findings There were 379 railway-related deaths and 505 serious injuries during the study period. Most deaths (190) were train-pedestrian collisions, and the fatality rate on the metropolitan lines was about 60 per 100 million passenger journeys. There was substantial under-reporting by the rail utility of both fatal (20% under-reported) and non-fatal injuries (at least 24%). Many injuries occurred during peak commuting times and alcohol played an important part, especially in pedestrian fatalities.
   Interpretation Our results demonstrate the importance of a comprehensive, sustainable railway injury surveillance system to promote safety engineering and law enforcement in a metropolitan rail system.

AB Shifting agriculture is a main contributor to deforestation in the humid tropics. Substitution of managed falloffs using cover crops is a possible alternative to natural fallow that may contribute to more sustainable farming systems via more efficient nutrient cycling. Our objective was to determine the rate of decomposition and nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) release patterns resulting from two managed fallow periods (12 or 18 mo) for Desmodium adscendens (Sw.) DC. (syn. D. ovalifolium Guillemin & Perrottet) and Pueraria phaseoloides (Roxb.) Benth, (tropical kudzu) grown on Typic and Aquic Dystropept soils at two locations in the Bolivian Amazon. Dry matter disappearance and nutrient release rates from decomposing cover crop residues were monitored using 1-mm mesh nylon bags. The longer managed fallow (18 mo) reduced the decomposition rate of both cover crops. After 30 wk, residues remaining from 12-mo managed fallows averaged 24% for desmodium and 16% for pueraria, whereas residues from 18-mo managed fallows averaged 53% for desmodium and 32% for pueraria. Similar to dry matter disappearance, cover crops grown for 12 mo released nutrients faster than those grown for 18 mo. Nutrient release patterns between sites were similar. By 30 wk, nutrient percentages remaining in desmodium vs. pueraria grown for 12 mo at Site 1 were 46 vs. 17% N, 17 vs. 9% P, 4 vs. 2% K, 36 vs. 20% Ca, and 30 vs. 21% Mg. Similar proportional differences in release patterns were observed for all nutrients except Ca for 18-mo managed falloffs. These results indicate a greater potential for asynchrony between crop nutrient demand and cover crop residue nutrient release for 12- vs. 18-mo managed falloffs, and more so for pueraria than desmodium.

AB Proposals for stand regeneration and tending are made for the following very simplified types of pure stands: Spruce suited to the site, spruce nor suited to the site, pine, beech. These proposals correspond on one hand to the actual bad economical situation of forest enterprises, and on the other hand to the public demands on forests as well. As a result the transformation of pure spruce stands which are not suited to the site is attributed the highest priority. On the other hand referring to pure spruce stands which are suited to the site, the transformation to mixed spruce-beech stands is regarded as a less important investment.

DT Article
AB Tanzania's Eyasi-Yaeda basin is unique in its cultural and biophysical heritage. However, the challenges and issues confronting the land and people of the Eyasi-Yaeda basin are common throughout much of dryland Africa. Land scarcity, in-migration, changing land and resource use, and unclear land tenure and ownership arrangements create a complex array of issues. Considering the Eyasi-Yaeda basin as a microcosm of these challenges and issues, key environmental management and policy concerns are outlined and examples provided. Specific areas addressed include the implications of tenure and ownership systems, resource control and participation in planning, and their relation to sustainable dryland resource management.

AB Fast growing Eucalyptus trees are grown in Congo for industrial purposes, on a very poor sandy savanna soil. The sustainability of such land use is questionable, particularly regarding nutrient availability. Among the lacking nutrients, nitrogen (N) deserves special attention as N status is supposed to be improved by N-fixing trees. To assess N changes in tree plantations, N cycling was studied in Eucalyptus and Acacia stands and compared to the native savanna.
   Nitrogen accumulation in vegetation and soil, together with N flows in the ecosystem, were estimated. It was assumed that the difference between N amounts in Acacia stands and in Eucalyptus stands was an estimate of the amount of N fixed symbiotically in the former.
   The results showed that 800-1000 kg N ha(-1) were accumulated during 7 years in Acacia stands. Nitrogen fixation was higher in Acacia auriculiformis than in Acacia mangium.
   Nitrogen cycling through litter fall was high in Acacia stands, up to 170 kg ha(-1) per year, and low in Eucalyptus and Pinus stands. However, in Eucalyptus stands, slow litter decay and reduced N release from decaying litter resulted in a relative accumulation of organic N in the forest floor.
   Decrease in N content was observed in organomineral fractions under the trees. In top-soil(0-10 cm)N mineralization was higher in tree stands than in savanna and total N decreased significantly under 7-year-old Eucalyptus. Under older Eucalyptus, decreasing N content of organic matter was shown by the increase in C/N ratio. Under Acacia, soil N increase was significant in the older stands studied but not in the younger ones, and fixed N accumulated in trees and in the forest floor first. The implications of these observations are discussed.

AB Surgery in the South Pacific is different in many respects from surgery in Australia and New Zealand. It is primarily the surgery of trauma, infection, advanced malignancy, hollow-tube obstruction and congenital abnormalities. Specific tropical infections such as tuberculosis, typhoid, pigbel and amoebiasis occur regularly but constitute only a small proportion of all cases. The patients tend to be young, rural and poor, and often present late because access to surgical services is limited. The treatment patients receive is also compromised by a lack of resources - the result of underfunding and inefficient administration. Standards for appropriate surgical practice should be determined in-country and based at least on surgical audit and clinical studies. Even though Western diseases are emerging in the tropics, the best management may sometimes be different. Training of national surgeons is a priority if a sustainable surgical service is to be established. Such training is more effectively carried out in the home country, or at least in one with similar pathology and problems, rather than overseas. Project aid should support these schemes and encourage regional co-operation through the Fiji and Papua New Guinea medical schools. There remains an important role for visiting surgical specialists, but they need to ensure that they transfer skills and encourage the professional development of promising local doctors rather than simply focusing on treating patients.

AB This discussion focuses on discontinuities in both natural and technological systems caused by the introduction of exotic species into areas which they would not have been able to reach without human assistance or other alterations to native communities. The case histories of both the Asian clam and the zebra mussel are particularly instructive because of their recent introductions and the dramatic impact they have had on both natural and technological systems. Control of these mollusc species in technological systems (e.g. water intake systems) is effective to a degree but requires constant attention and utilization of resources. If control is neglected there could be extremely serious consequences. At present, no inexpensive means exist for controlling their effects, and further geographical distribution in North America is highly probable. The mollusc case histories do not appear to be linear and, in some instances, may not be continuous. Some importations of exotic species were deliberate (such as the gypsy moth, Porthetria dispar), but their escape into natural systems has often been 'accidental' or, a less charitable person might say, careless. A viable strategy for coping with discontinuities is elusive. Discontinuities will, undoubtedly, have a major effect on the possibility of sustainable use of the planet or, to use the currently popular term, sustainable development.

AB Biotechnology receives increasing attention in special development projects of international donors. External funding of biotechnology research could, however, adversely affect the sustainability of national research, national research priorities and relations between the different research institutes. To fully benefit from external sources, developing countries need to develop a strategy based on a thorough understanding of the relationship between the transfer of foreign technology and the development of a local technological capability.

AB Ecological certification of forest products is a rapidly developing market-based incentive for better forest management. Improved forest management can be an important component of tropical conservation and development strategies. To provide a solid biophysical basis for certification programs, however, research is needed on the ecological and silvicultural consequences of different forest management practices. The current criteria for certification are generally based on sustainability of timber harvest volumes, protection of hydrological functions, maintenance of soil productivity and forest structure, and minimization of the deleterious impacts of forest management on non-commercial plants and animals. Some criteria and the field indicators used in their assessment apply equally well to most forests, whereas others are only appropriate for certain forest types, stands, or species. Tropical biologists can contribute to the processes of refining eco-certification criteria and selecting ecologically meaningful indicators of good forest management that can be readily assessed and monitored. participation of tropical biologists in the design of ecological certification protocols will improve credibility of the process and promote better forest stewardship.

AB Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) regenerates in areas of erosion on high terraces and in forest killed by flooding and deposition of alluvial sediments in the Chimanes Forest, Bolivia. These hydrological disturbances are patchy, and only one of five stands of mahogany that we inventoried was regenerating. Mahogany survives these disturbances significantly better than the common tree species. The long time between disturbances appears to favour late maturation. Mahogany trees allocate little photosynthates to reproduction until they are very large emergents, at least 80 cm in diameter. The episodic nature of the regeneration sites means that mahogany stands are composed of one or a few cohorts, which are vulnerable to overharvesting, particularly with the current use of a minimum cutting diameter to regulate harvest. The delayed onset of fecundity means that the small trees that escape harvest are not very fecund, resulting in minimal seed input to logged forest. Only 7-9% of the gaps created by logging contain natural regeneration after 20 + yr. A successful management plan for mahogany would entail a monocyclic harvest, with a rotation age of 100 + years, the estimated time that it rakes for trees to achieve commercial size in natural forest. Since the number of seed trees that will be left is small, they should be concentrated in sites that are likely to he conducive to natural regeneration, such as near rivers and flood damaged forest. Seed production will be maximized for a given basal area (opportunity cost to loggers) if trees c. 110 cm dbh are selected as seed trees. The mahogany stocks in the Chimanes Forest are nearly exhausted, but the findings of this study could be used to help rebuild the mahogany populations, or to design management plans for the commercial species that have similar ecologies to mahogany.

AB The development of a strategy for the sustainable management and conservation of mahogany is an urgent priority. Such a strategy should be based upon clear information about the extent of genetic differentiation within and between populations, and on an understanding of the processes maintaining this variation. At present, such information is very limited for mahogany. Preliminary data are presented from two genetic tests of Swietenia macrophylla King (Meliaceae), indicating significant differences between provenances and half-sib progenies in both growth and from characteristics. In addition, the use of molecular markers for the characterization of genetic resources of mahogany is discussed. On the basis of the results available, the impacts of deforestation and logging activities on genetic resources are evaluated. Although both deforestation and selective logging may deplete genetic resources, no quantitative information on the extent of such depletion in mahogany is currently available. Additional research is therefore required before clear guidelines can be provided for the sustainable management of mahogany. (C) 1996 The Linnean Society of London

DT Article
AB One of the first priority areas among joint East/West research programs is the rational use of natural resources and sustainable development of regions. In the boreal zone of North America and Eurasia, forests are economically very important, at the same time being highly vulnerable to disturbances. Because of its size and ecological functions, the boreal forest and fire - its most dynamic disturbance factor - play an important role in ecosystem processes at a global scale. This paper provides an overview on the role of boreal forest fires on ecosystems, atmosphere, and climate.

SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
DE adiabaticity; emergy; exergy; thermodynamics
AB Self-organizing activity of ecosystems can be investigated by means of different so-called goal functions. Emergy (Odum, 1988) and exergy (Jorgensen, 1992) have been proposed to account for embodied quality and organization of systems. The meaning of emergy and exergy as work potential indicators is stressed: they appear to be suitable measures of work potential until the resource is used up, while they seem to be incomplete indicators when the process is considered in the larger perspective of the surrounding environment. If the biosphere viewpoint is considered, i.e. the maintenance of the equilibria developed over millennia of self-organization, adiabatic correction terms have to be taken into account, in order to evaluate the shift of the system far from the sustainable steady state.

DE energy policy; energy future; hydrogen fuel
AB The world energy economy is poised for a sweeping shift away from imported oil and environmentally damaging coal during the next few decades, despite the belief by most energy planners that the future will probably see a continuation of past trends, Pushed by the need to stabilize the earth's climate, and pulled by the investment opportunities that beckon, the world's economies are beginning to move more rapidly toward more efficient, decentralized and cleaner energy systems, Among the changes expected are a new generation of lightweight, super efficient electric cars that can be re-fuelled at home; the rapid conversion of coal and nuclear plants to efficient gas turbines; a new generation of mass produced wind and solar generators that are cost competitive with the most advanced fossil plants; tiny fuel cells and rooftop solar panels that allow people to generate their own electricity; and the gradual emergence of hydrogen as the world's main energy carrier, supplanting oil and natural gas, The paper envisions an energy scenario in which carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere stabilize during the next half century, as called for in the Rio Climate Treaty.

AB A bottom-up energy system optimization model is used to support policy planning for the sustainable use of energy. The methodology of the Finnish EFOM model is presented, including the description of biomass use for energy, power and heat generation, emissions and the end use of energy. The common modelling framework used in many similar models has been enhanced by thoroughly adapting the model to the characteristics of the Finnish energy economy and by some methodological improvements. An important submodel for the energy intensive pulp and paper industries has been incorporated in the model. The model has proven to provide useful results for actual policy planning. The results from scenarios on strategies to reduce CO2 emissions point out that the implementation of effective national policy measures for the abatement of CO2 emissions appear to be difficult in Finland, although technical solutions with reasonable costs exist.

ID SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB The production and import of fertilizer have previously been identified as the major source of three separate European environmental problems related to nitrogen compounds. In order to obtain a picture of the changes in the anthropogenic nitrogen flows needed for a solution, the effectiveness of several more radical interventions is estimated using Substance Flow Analysis (SFA). A selection of rigorous technical measures is expected to reduce the atmospheric deposition of N compounds to a level that seems acceptable for the EU as a whole, and will reduce the anthropogenic input of N compounds into the North Sea well below the agreed level of 50% of the present load. The third problem, the pollution of groundwater with nitrates, would remain unsolved. Resolution of this last problem requires radical changes in the agricultural sector, reducing agricultural output substantially. Two directions are explored by assessing the impacts of the extremes: termination of industrial fertilizer use to combat the problems at the source, and abolition of the entire stock-breeding sector to increase agricultural efficiency radically. These changes do contribute to a solution of the groundwater problem, but imply either greater dependence on imported food, or a major change in food consumption patterns, from animal towards vegetable products. The current EU population and diet are incompatible with the absence of environmental problems. The question then arises, how does acceptance of the draconian measures required to solve such an environmental problem weigh up against acceptance of the fact of having to cope with contaminated groundwater?

SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION

DE deforestation; protection; Honduras; incentives; policies
AB Attitudes and incentives of people living around protected areas are widely considered to constrain successful management of these areas. Two contrasting protected areas in Honduras, a Biosphere Reserve of high biodiversity rainforest, and a cloud forest providing essential environmental services to the capital city, are analyzed in terms of their management problems and the strategies used for their protection. The response at the national level to the issues raised in these case studies is then assessed, focusing on the impact of government policies, legal changes affecting land tenure and use, and the role of state institutions in protected area management. The case studies indicate that while the non-government organizations (NGOs) have tried to promote a more participatory approach to conservation (with mixed success), the Honduras Government has tried to follow a more regulatory approach but without the resources and political will to implement it effectively. Opportunities have been missed to provide positive incentives for protection, for example in the area of eco-tourism and community-based natural forest management in situations where this would appear to be a viable option. The participatory approach has also been complicated by policies and land legislation which have sent out negative or ambiguous signals to local communities. Above all the case studies show how critical local attitudes are to the achievement of conservation objectives, and demonstrate the need for positive economic incentives that link development with conservation in buffer zones and surrounding areas.

ID ENVIRONMENT
AB The cultural norms or core values for sustainable development are an amalgamation of core social values and core environmental values. Widely-shared core social values became strikingly articulated following the Second World War via such instruments as the 1948 Genocide Convention and the 1948 Human Rights Declaration. By contrast, widely-shared core environmental values did not surface until some two decades after the Second World War, being first clearly expressed in the 1972 Stockholm Declaration, to be followed by the 1982 World Charter for Nature and, more recently, by the 1992 Rio Declaration. I find that whereas the emerging core social values have until quite recently been essentially innocent of environmental concerns, the emerging core environmental Values have been from the start generally couched in social terms.
   Key ethical issues regarding the cultural norms underlying sustainable development include the questions of how to strike a proper balance between anthropocentric and ecocentric justifications; and a proper apportionment of the global biosphere between humankind and the other life on earth. Several lines of evidence suggest to me that the environmental and social strands of widely-shared core values for sustainable development are beginning to merge, and that there has begun to occur a slow but progressive development in mainstream thinking toward a recognition of an unbreakable link between social development anal environmental conservation.
   A number of major stumbling blocks to the achievement of sustainable development exist of course, amongst them the imbalance between human numbers plus needs and available natural resources, the prevalence of totalitarian and corrupt regimes, and the ineffective system of peaceful world governance. Despite obstacles to sustainable development, a trend towards a commitment to it seems evident in such components of society as governments, intergovernmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, academia, religious bodies, and grass-roots movements.

AB Approximately 780 million people world-wide are chronically undernourished, and past gains in food production have been associated with environmental problems, yet global demand for cereals is projected to increase by 56% and for meat by 74% between 1990 and 2020.
   The international Food Policy Research Institute has developed the view that every person in the world can have access to sufficient food to sustain a healthy and productive life, that malnutrition can be abolished, and that food can originate from efficient, effective, and low-cost food systems that are compatible with sustainable use of natural resources. Moreover, IFPRI has concluded that these conditions can be achieved by the year 2020, if the world commits itself to specified changes in behaviour, priorities, and policies. Pn order for these changes to occur, sustained action is needed in six areas: (1) strengthening the capacity of developing-country governments; (2) investing more in poor people; (3) accelerating agricultural productivity; (4) assuring sound management of natural resources; (5) developing competitive markets; and (6) expanding and realigning international development assistance. We have the knowledge and the capacity to meet the food needs of every person without damaging the environment. What is needed is political will and commitment on the part of all members of society to take the required action.

ID WATER-QUALITY; ESTUARY; FOOD
AB Water quality impacts to and from intensive shrimp aquaculture in Thailand are substantial. Besides the surface and subsurface salinization of freshwaters, loadings of solids, oxygen-consuming organic matter, and nutrients to receiving waters are considerable when the cumulative impacts from water exchange during the growout cycle, pond drainage during harvesting, and illegal pond sediment disposal are taken into account. Although just beginning to be considered in Thailand, partial recirculating and integrated intensive farming systems are producing promising, in somewhat limited, results. By providing on-site treatment of the effluent from the shrimp growout ponds, there is less reliance on using outside water supplies, believed to be the source of the contamination.
   The explosion in the number of intensively operated shrimp farms has not only impacted the coastal zone of Thailand, but has also resulted in an unsustainable aquaculture industry. Abandonment of shrimp ponds due to either drastic, disease-caused collapses or more gradual, year-to-year reductions in the productivity of the pond is common. To move Thailand towards a more sustainable aquaculture industry and coastal zone environment, integrated aquaculture management is needed. Components of integrated aquaculture management are technical and institutional. The technical components involve deployment of wastewater treatment and minimal water-use systems aimed al making aquaculture operations more hydraulically closed. Before this is possible, technical and economic feasibility studies on enhanced nitrification systems and organic solids removal by oxidation between production cycles and/or the utilization of plastic pond liners need to be conducted. The integration of semi-intensive aquaculture within mangrove areas also should be investigated since mangrove losses attributable to shrimp aquaculture are estimated to be between 16 and 32% of the total mangrove area destroyed between 1979 and 1993.
   Government policy needs to devote as much attention to sustainability issues as it has on promoting intensive pond culture. Such a balanced policy would include training and education monitoring and enforcement, rehabilitating abandoned ponds, managing land use within the coastal zone, more community involvement and government reorganization to eliminate overlapping jurisdictions among agencies.
   As integrated aquaculture management becomes more the practice than the exception, less risk of crop failure to the industry and reduced discharge loadings from intensively managed shrimp ponds to receiving waters can be expected. Projected limitations on growing and marketing shrimp in the future, such as scarcity of land and broodstock, continued disease outbreaks, negative publicity, regulatory enforcement, water treatment and solids disposal costs, and increased competition from growers in other Asian countries will also drive the government and the industry towards adopting integrated aquaculture management.

AB Soils of the area (42 sq. km) adjacent to the chemical combine ''Khimvolokno'' in Mogilev city (Belarus) have been investigated. Sampling sites were concentrated along 11 radii in the 3-km-wide zone around the combine. The rate of substrate-induced and basal soil respiration have been determined in fresh samples, with a subsequent calculation of the metabolic coefficient. Agricultural land use types are shown to affect the soil microbiological properties stronger than the polluting fallout. A system of indices is proposed for the ecologic-microbiological soil monitoring, it permits revealing and assessing the anthropogenic targets on the soil, as well as giving forecasts and advice for sustainable land use.

TI Experimental validation of an ATM traffic control framework in the
   EXPLOIT testbed
SO EUROPEAN TRANSACTIONS ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper deals with the experimental investigation of a preventive traffic control framework for ATM networks as implemented in the EXPLOIT Testbed. This framework comprises a Usage Parameter Control (UPC) function and a Connection Admission Control (CAC) function. The obtained measurement results are complemented and compared with simulation studies and analytical results. For several On/Off traffic types it is shown that the implemented UPC function enforces both the Peak Cell Rate (PCR) and the Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR) simultaneously. By measuring the cell loss ratio as a function of the number of multiplexed sources, admission boundaries for a given network performance objective can be found and compared with the implemented CAC function based on the convolution algorithm. It appears that network performance objectives can be guaranteed, while exploiting most of the possible multiplexing gain in a network with small buffers like the EXPLOIT Testbed. Finally, it is shown that the two co-operating functions constitute a traffic control framework which is robust against traffic contract violations as well as worst case traffic utilising the contracted UPC function tolerances maximally at both the cell level and the burst level.

ID MORPHOEDAPHIC INDEX; NILE PERCH
AB Sustainable fishery yields of Lake Victoria dagaa, Rastrineobola argentea, a silvery zooplanktivorous cyprinid, are estimated in the absence of catch/effort and survey data. The starting point is an estimate of sustainable yield of a fish in another large lake in the region, the baseline lake. This is used to estimate the potential yield of a fish occupying an analogous niche in a second lake, the target lake. Several baseline lakes may be used to provide results for the target lake. A new approximate model scales fish yield in baseline and target lakes according to the ratio of the logarithm of primary productivity. We modify this model to account for differences in productive capacity in the two taxa by scaling the result according the ratio of Phi' values, the auximetric growth parameters.
   Here we employ sustainable fishery yields of freshwater sardines, Limnothrissa and Stolothrissa, from Lakes Tanganyika and Kariba as the baselines for the model. For Lake Victoria dagaa, the validity of linking primary production and zooplanktivore production one trophic level removed in the food web is considered a reasonable approximation. The principal uncertainties in applying the model are evaluated and estimated quantitatively using a bootstrap procedure derived from error distributions of the model input parameters. Rastrineobola population biomass estimated from the model's fishery yield results is very similar to previously published values. The potential sustainable yield of 5.18-8.14 t km(-2) in relation to recorded 1990 landings of 1.24 t km(-2) (84 000 t over the whole lake, and the latest data available to us) suggests that catches may be safely doubled with minimal risk. Although this finding is sensitive to the accuracy of the catch records, it is in accord with the small number of other estimates.

   sustainable development; landscape management; policy processes
AB The regions of the world most uniformly and extensively modified by human activities are the temperate zones. Settlement and development of these productive and hospitable regions have a long history and have often resulted in dramatic impacts on biological diversity, Temperate and boreal forest ecosystems have not avoided these impacts. Impacts on biodiversity have occurred at the ecosystem, species, population and genetic levels. The geographic range of many species has been reduced, and in a number of cases species have become extinct. The extent of remaining old growth forest varies from less than 1% in western Europe to about 25% in New Zealand. In Australia, only about 2-3% of the old growth, temperate eucalypt forests on the most productive soils remain since European occupation of the continent in 1788, and these ecosystems are considered to be endangered.
   Given a broad definition of temperate forest ecosystems that includes various types of boreal forest in the Northern Hemisphere, approximately 2 billion ha of these ecosystems remain globally. By area, the majority of these forests occur in Russia (41%) and in North America (32%). The nature of these ecosystems, their biological productivity, complement of biological diversity, and use by humans varies considerably within and between major geographic regions. In general, most temperate and boreal forest ecosystems are poorly protected in conservation reserves and many are increasingly used for wood production to supply regional, national and international demand. Many conflicts have arisen over the conservation and management of these forests in the past few decades.
   This paper introduces the concept of sustainable development and briefly considers some of the policy processes concerned with the conservation of biological diversity and sustainable management in temperate and boreal forests. The International Forest Conference, from which the papers presented in this journal issue arise, is then described and the main findings of the papers summarised. Issues that need more attention include: how to adequately assess biodiversity from the local to the regional scale and integrate this information in a manner useful for landscape planning and management; how to develop policy processes that are genuinely open to community evaluation and scientific peer review; what is a sufficient precautionary approach to forest use given the uncertainties and risks arising from imperfect knowledge, predicted climate change and unforeseen events; and, how the needs of indigenous forest peoples can be best accommodated in the sustainable development of temperate and boreal forests. In addition, much more time needs to be dedicated to external strategies that will help relax many of the increasing demands that humans place on temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Without the latter, scope to enhance forest conservation and management and adapt over time may be limited.

AB Australia's old growth eucalypt forests are unique, exhibiting a long evolutionary history compared with temperate ecosystems on other continents. By global comparison, alpha, beta and theta diversity in eucalypt forests is also very high; these ecosystems generally support a high number of species per site and the change in species and genotypes between sites and regions appears high. This has major implications for forest management if biodiversity conservation is a serious management goal. I consider the legacies of forest uses such as clearing, fragmentation, modification and degradation, and present some priorities for reform in forest conservation and management.
   Many of the forestry activities in eucalypt forests in eastern Australia are not ecologically sustainable. These practices result in significant impacts on biodiversity and are detrimental since they can destroy and modify complex forest landscapes, ecosystems and the natural environmental heterogeneity of systems; destroy, prevent or hinder ecological processes that are the basis for species' persistence and evolution; destroy or significantly modify the habitat of species; and destroy individual organisms and significantly modify populations and assemblages of species. Many components of eucalypt forest biodiversity are threatened, including various biological and ecological processes, many vertebrate and invertebrate fauna, and ecosystem diversity. One fundamental concern is the impact of harvesting on populations of species and intraspecific genetic diversity. Many current forestry activities not only increase the likelihood of the extinction of forest species, they also modify the evolutionary potential of species.
   The challenges posed by old growth eucalypt forest management in Australia are unique and by virtue of historical events, lie with our generation. To our advantage is an appreciation of what reforms are required, the availability of adequate knowledge and technology, and an understanding of what is at stake. A move towards ecologically sustainable forest use in Australia's remaining eucalypt forests requires a combination of initiatives including an enhanced conservation reserve network, and markedly enhanced protective measures in unreserved forest ecosystems, irrespective of land tenure. Significant reductions in logging quotas and major changes to current codes of forest practice are required if stated biodiversity conservation goals are to be achieved. Institutional reforms are required to support these changes as is support for long term ecological research and monitoring.

AB During recent millennia the biodiversity patterns of the Danish forests have changed. Many of the rare or threatened species in Denmark are related to habitats characteristic of natural forest ecosystems. By comparing the structure and dynamics of natural and managed forests the following key elements related to biodiversity were identified: woody debris, forest heterogeneity, (successional) continuity and water. To incorporate these elements into modem forest management, a change in attitude and practice is needed. Education and training will be an important part of this move towards sustainability.

AB There is widespread agreement throughout the countries of the world from government, industry and the public that the conservation of forest biodiversity and sustainable use of forests are of critical priority, Now that broad ethical support for biodiversity conservation has been achieved, the development and implementation of practical approaches is the next step. Currently, conservation activities are diverse and lack integration, resulting in confusion, In this paper we develop a multi-element conceptual framework to draw to ether conservation components and provide an overall integrative structure. In addition, we argue that scientists need to be involved in the development of human value systems that will deal with the ethics of forest resource use, As well, they need to work towards the recognition and adoption of biodiversity conservation as a continuous ongoing process rather than an end product.

AB Numerous studies over the past 15 years have investigated relationships between the distributions of arboreal and ground-dwelling mammals and environmental, structural and leaf compositional variables in the temperate Eucalyptus forests of southeastern and northeastern New South Wales, Australia. This paper draws together the general trends emerging from these studies and identifies some clear messages for the future modelling of regional biodiversity in these forests.
   The studies on arboreal mammals (all are marsupials in these forests) reviewed here generally fall into two broad categories: those that conclude that the nutrient status of forests is the prime determinant of habitat quality for arboreal marsupials and those that put equal or greater emphasis on variables related to structural characteristics of forests. Recent studies suggest a hierarchical model that is consistent with both of these emphases. They postulate that a proportion of temperate eucalypt forests, regardless of their climatic or structural characteristics, cannot support permanent populations of arboreal marsupials, especially leaf-eating species, due to low food quality and/or high phytochemical toxicity. Above a postulated nutritional or phytotoxicological 'threshold', food quality is adequate and other variables, including climatic and structural ones, apparently interact to determine habitat quality. Hence, differences in the extent to which different studies sample regional environmental variability, the range of nutrient status and forest structure, are likely to greatly affect which variables appear most significant in models of habitat requirements.
   Structural characteristics (measured as habitat complexity) of the forest have emerged as explanatory variables for the ground-living mammals also, Variables such as nutrients, lithology, terrain and climate exhibit a different trend to that seen for arboreal marsupials. Relative abundance of small ground-dwelling mammals is negatively correlated with site nutrient status as indicated by nutrient concentrations in tree foliage. Small mammals are present at all measured nutrient levels, but their abundance falls substantially as habitat complexity decreases. The influence of nutrients is masked in habitats of high complexity, there being no relationship with nutrient status. Many ground-living mammals occur across the gradients of lithology, terrain and climate, although there is wide variation in relative abundance for some species.
   The importance of structural variables for explaining distributions of both arboreal and ground-living fauna in eucalypt forests indicates that adequate modelling of habitat requirements for these fauna can only be achieved if surveys obtain adequate data on forest structure to encompass gradients in seral stage and disturbance history. The present-day mammalian fauna of the southeastern Australian forests has been influenced strongly by the effects of urbanisation, clearing for farming, forestry activities and fire on forest structural complexity and nutrient dynamics as well as by predation by introduced carnivores. While modelling with respect to broadly defined climatic and terrain variables might be useful for broad-scale spatial prediction of faunal distributions, such models are unlikely to provide descriptions of habitat requirements or predictions of impacts of forest management at a scale necessary for sustainable management of faunal biodiversity.

AB The biological impact of forest tree reproductive processes and the extent of management practices of seed orchards and nurseries on the genetic representation of new forests, are discussed in a holistic fashion. All the steps in tree reproduction, their timing and duration, and how seeds are used to produce new plants for artificial regeneration, especially in containerized nurseries, are intimately related, cumulative, and bear directly on the genetic composition of the seedling crop. These processes and their interactions need to be more fully understood to maximize genetic gain, and for the sustainability of genetic diversity.

TI Guidelines for the protective role of forests in avalanche formation
SO FORSTWISSENSCHAFTLICHES CENTRALBLATT
LA German
DT Article
AB 1. The significance and value of avalanche protection forests for our alpine valleys.
   The value of indispensable avalanche protection forests can be measured by comparison of their cost with the cost of construction of avalanche struts, which are, however, only a very unsatisfactory substitute.
   2. Varying importance and need for tending of avalanche protection forests.
   Avalanche protection forests which are absolutely necessary are specified in the new Swiss Forestry Laws as forests which fulfil a particular protective function: they are forests on steep slopes ''where a direct threat to people or substantial property arises from the dangers of avalanches, landslides, erosion, rock or mudslides''. In such cases the cost of upkeep of these forests is covered, in the main part, by public revenues. Other protection forests - for example those in remote valleys which are not populated all the year round - only qualify for minimum tending measures: ''Measures of minimal care and upkeep of protective functions are those that are limited to securing a sustainable stability of stock; any wood is to be used on the spot or left lying, provided that this incurs no danger.'' For this particular project category, a practical guide has been developed for planning and implementing the necessary tending measures.
   3. How the forest protects against avalanche starts and the necessary silvicultural goals.
   The main protective mechanisms of the forest to prevent avalanches will be presented. The necessary silvicultural goals are described in detail in the above-mentioned guide on minimal tending measures. Minimal as well as desirable condition of stands is given with regard to the stability requirements for every type of site and specifically for the most important characteristics of stands.
   In the protection forest category ''minimal tending measures'' it suffices to fulfil minimal goals; here the ideal goals have a directing function, somewhat like a compass. In protection forests with important protective functions, however, the ideal goal is striven for, which requires correspondingly more intensive tending measures.
   4. Tending principles for avalanche protection forests
   Silvicultural measures for the tending of avalanche protection forests are, above all, stabilizing measures.
   In view of the fact that subalpine forest development is outside human control, it is a question of early support for stabilizing tendencies and prophylactic measures which combat destabilizing tendencies in development, i.e. providing natural help aimed at self-help.
   It is essential to respect the frequently changing mosaic of sites and this requires a high level of observation and good observational abilities.
   By comparison with the original natural forest, the present day protection forest is mostly anthropogenically influenced secondary forest. The disturbances in stability of autoregulating mechanisms that have been caused must be identified and corrected.
   Stability maintenance of mountain forests should be as natural as possible and based on the standards of the natural forest populations.
   5. Prerequisites and framework for functional tending of avalanche protection forests
   The principal problem in the tending of protection forest today stems from game damage. This must be reduced to a level where all tree species native to the site in question can exist without additional protective measures.
   The signs of new forest decline (loss of vitality) must be taken seriously and we must develop a less technocratic manner to deal with this natural foundation of life.
   The long-term means must be secured to finance the necessary tending measures. As far as the public sector is concerned, the controllability of these tending measures must be guaranteed.

AB The maintenance of the protective functions of the forests is of vital importance in the alpine country of Liechtenstein. The quantitative and qualitative preservation of the forests are therefore deemed a goal of utmost priority. The objective of forest management embraces all activities intended to preserve multiple use forest ecosystems which are able to satisfy certain human needs as regards forest goods and immaterial forest services on the one hand and the needs of plant and fauna species as regards conservation and amelioration of living space and living conditions on the other. Decisive instruments implement to this sustainable forest management are an overall policy pinpointed in the multiple functions plan and an adjusted system of financial compensations and contributions.

AB Knowledge of rates of release of base cations from mineral dissolution (weathering) is essential to understand ecosystem elemental cycling. Although much studied, rates remain enigmatic. We compared the results of four methods to determine cation (Ca + Mg + K) release rates at five forested soils/sites in the northcentral U.S.A. Our premise was that multiple approaches, each with their own specific strengths and weaknesses, would yield a ''best'' overall estimate. We used (1) a cation input-output budget on a pedon scale; (2) trends in elemental and mineral depletion in silt-size particles; (3) a laboratory batch dissolution technique, with the results adjusted for field conditions; and (4) a steady-state soil chemistry model, PROFILE. The soils included a loamy sand Typic Udipsamment, a sandy loam Spodic Udipsamment, a fine sandy loam Typic Dystrochrept, a very fine sandy loam Glossic Eutroboralf, and a clayey Glossic Eutroboralf. Weathering rates varied among both soils and methods, and neither methods nor soils could easily be grouped; the data spanned a continuum with overlapping ranges of least significant differences. Although the assumptions necessary for some methods were better suited to specific soils, we rejected only one method-soil combination as being inappropriate (input-output budget for the clay). Mean release rates for the sum of cations ranged from 470 eq ha(-1) yr(-1) for the clayey soil, to 460 for the fine sandy loam soil, to 430 for the very fine sandy loam soil, to 375 for the sandy loam soil, to 195 for the loamy sand soil. These rates are lower than those reported for similar soils in the literature because most reported rates are based on watershed studies. Our low rates of cation release within soil pedons, the ultimate source of nutrient ions for plant growth, has implications for estimated nutrient budgets and long-term soil sustainability.
