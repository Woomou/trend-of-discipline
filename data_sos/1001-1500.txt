AB In this note, we describe the stationary equilibria and the asymptotic behaviour of an heterogeneous logistic reaction-diffusion equation under the influence of autonomous or time-periodic forcing terms. We show that the study of the asymptotic behaviour in the time-periodic forcing case can be reduced to the autonomous one, the last one being described in function of the 'size' of the external perturbation. Our results can be interpreted in terms of maximal sustainable yields from populations. We briefly discuss this last aspect through a numerical computation.

AB Reference models, often called core models are developed in various application domains. Until now, no computational support exists for the task of verifying the conformity between such core models and their domain models. The approach developed at Bamberg University uses Semantic Web technologies to examine whether or not a domain model is a derivation of a core model. This ontology-based conformity verification supports an iterative modeling process in which core or domain models are modified. Inference services as provided by ontologies can be used to analyze the relationships between core and domain models. For example, it is possible to formally prove which specific relations hold between two types of models and compare the result with the intentions of the domain experts involved in the modeling. As a consequence, knowledge not explicitly represented is revealed. In case that the domain model does not conform to the core model, an interpretation of the inference results is provided in ordinary language giving the domain experts hints on how to modify either the core model, the domain model or both. We evaluated our approach by applying it to a core model and a domain, hence national model from the cadastral domain. Conformity was verified between the core cadastral model proposed by [Lemmen, C., van der Molen, P., van Oosterom, P., Ploeger, H., Quak, W., Stoter, J., et al. (2003). A modular standard for the cadastral domain. In Proceedings of digital earth 2003: Information resourcesfir global sustainability: knowledge, netivorks, technology, economy, society, natural and human resources, policy and strategy. Brno, Czech Republic, pp. 108-117] and the Greek cadastral model [Tzani, A. (2003). Object-oriented modeling of the Greek Cadastre. Master's thesis, School of Rural and Surveying Engineering of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki], which both are results of research activities related to the European COST Action G9 "Modeling Real Property Transactions". Although our approach to conformity verification was only evaluated with the cadastral models, it can be used for conformity verification in various applications domains due to its generality.

AB Urban land-use planning and management are in constant mutation throughout the world. With sustainability as a goal, the use of participative GIS is becoming more and more in demand. Given the willingness of local authorities to test participatory models and instruments, this paper presents an original implementation of information and communication technologies to support public participation.
   A system for monitoring urban functionalities (SMURF) was created for supporting participatory planning and management in African cities. The software instrument consists of a geographic database and of spatial indicators, for sharing information, editing information, and evaluating city development. To collect and update data, the model begins with the gathering of the data from each stakeholder, who, in return, gets a better knowledge of the land and a planning support tool. However, the implementation of these technologies presents several challenges: create an adapted interface, elaborate a relevant set of data and indicators, manage the data, and institutionalize the instrument.
   After an introductory presentation of the context and use of information technologies for the management of African cities, this paper focuses on SMURF and its components. It then shows the experimental application of the software in the city of Thies, Senegal, before concluding with a more general discussion on the relationship between technology, information, knowledge, and participation.

AB We investigate factors that influence an auditor's accuracy in knowing how subordinates, peers, and superiors view his or her own technical competence (metaperception). Extant literature on reputation management in auditing contexts depicts preparers of audit workpapers as strategic agents (subordinates) who stylize workpapers and engage in behaviors that enhance their reputations with reviewers (superiors). These superiors, in turn, are represented as strategically engaging in coping behaviors in response to such stylization attempts. One of the necessary conditions for auditors to enhance their reputations on a sustainable basis is accurate metaperception. We report the results of an experiment that investigates determinants of auditors' metaperception accuracy. Our participants comprise teams of audit partners, managers, and seniors who work together in the field. Each auditor performs two tasks of varying complexity and then predicts whether other team members can accurately perform the task and how other team members assess his or her performance on the tasks. Results show that accuracy in knowing what others think of one's technical proficiency (metaperception) is generally high, particularly when the predictor auditors are partners and managers; however, metaperception accuracy is asymmetric and varies depending on the predictor auditor, the target auditor being predicted, and task complexity. Implications are discussed.

AB This paper explores insecticide use in fields cropped with conventional or Bt cotton varieties in a smallholder farming area (Makhathim Flats, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa). The study was carried out during the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 growing seasons as part of a broader survey based on daily monitoring of a sample of smallholdings. The adoption of Bt cotton led to a decrease in pyrethroid use, but the level of insect resistance of this cultivar was not sufficient to completely drop this pesticide from the spraying programme. On the other hand, organophosphates were still being applied in substantial amounts, thus raising questions as to the impact of Bt cotton adoption on farmers' health. The overall economic results obtained with Bt cotton were slightly positive despite the low cotton yields obtained in the Flats during our survey. Bt cotton adoption did lead to labour savings, but the extent of this gain was not as high as expected. In conclusion, cropping Bt cotton in Makhathim Flats did not generate sufficient income to expect a tangible and sustainable socioeconomic improvement due to the way the crop is currently managed. Adoption of an innovation like Bt cotton seems to pay only in an agro-system with a sufficient level of intensification. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Drought is a worldwide constraint to dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production. The objective of this research was to determine the response of three dry bean landraces and 13 cultivars evaluated under non-stressed (NS) and intermittent drought-stressed (DS) environments at Kimberly, Idaho in 2003 and 2004. The NS received seven irrigations in 2003 and five in 2004, and DS only four in 2003 and two in 2004. Most water use occurred within the top 0.5 m soil in both the NS and DS. Drought reduced biomass and seed yield, harvest index, and seed weight. Maturity was delayed in severe drought, but was similar or shortened by 1 to 6 d under moderate drought. Mean seed yield was reduced by 62% in 2003 and by 27% in 2004. Common Red Mexican and CO 46348 had high seed yield in both NS and DS environments, whereas 'Matterhorn' and 'Othello' yielded comparatively high under DS but moderately in NS environment. Drought resistance was inadvertently reduced from Common Red Mexican landrace to intermediate levels in 'NW-63' and 'UI 239' released in 1979 and 1993, respectively, and more recently released 'LeBaron' (1999) and 'UI259' (1996) were susceptible. Conversely, drought resistance was increased in newer pinto (Othello 1986; CO 46348) and great northern (Matterhorn 1998) releases compared to the landraces and older cultivars tested for those market classes. Seed yield in NS and DS was positively correlated. Seed yield was also correlated with harvest index in DS and NS. All early maturing cultivars except Othello (e.g., UI 59, US 1140, Common Pinto, Topaz, UI 320, and LeBaron) were susceptible. Common Red Mexican did not have any reduction in seed weight due to drought stress. Drought resistant genotypes should be used for determining irrigation frequency, amount of water to be applied, and mechanisms of resistance and for identifying, mapping, and pyramiding favorable genes for dryland and irrigation-assisted sustainable production systems.

AB Colleagues from around the world contributed to this paper, all via e-mail. This was in response to a solicitation I made of those who aligned themselves with the Crop Ecology, Management, and Quality division of Crop Science Society of America (CSSA Division C-3). I asked for their nominations of the most important developments and/ or issues impacting their profession during the past 50 yr. Their responses were used to develop a top 10 list. Ranking within the list was based on frequency of nominations (i.e., professional recognition). The list was: no. 10, alternative crops and alternative uses for crops (18 nominations); no. 9, improved water management (20 nominations); no. 8, improved mechanization (31); no. 7, precision technology (global positioning system, GPS, and geographical information system, GIS) (32); no. 6, a shift of the Land Grant purpose and domain to industry and the launching of big ag (35); no. 5, conservation tillage (CT) (40); no. 4, the environmental movement and sustainability (43); no. 3, government programs and policies (45); no. 2, substitution management or the replacement of crop rotations and animals with chemicals (96); and no. 1, improved crop genetics, whether via conventional plant breeding or bioengineered crops (112). In addition to the top 10, there were 10 other nomination categories that received a total of 72 bids; these are noted in the text.

AB Two-year data from terminal study conducted to evaluate post-weaning growth and carcass traits of Texel, Suffolk and Columbia sired offspring were used to evaluate the effect of breed on cultural energy expenditure of lamb production. Each year whiteface ewes (n = 82) composed of primarily Polypay x Dorset ewes were exposed to Texel, Suffolk or Columbia rams for 35 days in the breeding season. The ewes were wintered outdoors on average-quality lucerne hay according to NRC (1985) requirements and were not provided any concentrate during late gestation or lactation. A total of 279 lambs were born with an average of 1.7 lambs per ewe and weaned lambs were used in the study. The lambs were weaned on average at 70 days of age and lambs from each sire breed were placed either in feedlot or on pasture. Texel and Suffolk sired lambs had higher weaning weight than Columbia sired lambs (P < 0.01). Lambs in the feedlot were fed shelled maize and pelleted protein supplement. Lambs on pasture grazed for 63 days and received 455 g concentrate daily and later they were placed in the feedlot. For the cultural energy analysis, pasture establishment and maintenance, feed in feedlot and on pasture, transportation, labour, machinery, electricity and other inputs were calculated and corresponding values for each input were obtained from literature. It was assumed for the analysis that 20 percent of ewes were culled and lambs sold after weaning were included in the analysis. Texel and Columbia breeds had a higher energy input per kg live weight than Suffolk breed (P < 0.04). There was no difference between breeds in terms of energy input per kg carcass (P > 0.4). Suffolk breed had a lower cultural energy ratio for the protein energy output than Columbia and Texel breed (P > 0,02). Energy output ratio defined as kjoule input/kjoule output was better for Suffolk breed and it was different from that of Columbia and Texel breed (P < 0.03).

AB This article discusses the experience of six conditional cash transfer programmes in Latin America, a model of social safety-nets which has grown to dominate the social protection sector in the region during the past decade. While they have been generally successful in terms of achieving their core objective, it is still not clear whether these programmes constitute the most cost-efficient or sustainable solution to the development bottleneck they seek to address. Furthermore, the almost exclusive focus on the human capital accumulation of children leads to missed opportunties in terms of impact on household welfare and the broader rural development context.

AB Aims To explore Pakistani and Indian patients' experiences of, and views about, diabetes services in order to inform the development of culturally sensitive services.
   Design Qualitative, interview study involving 23 Pakistani and nine Indian patients with Type 2 diabetes recruited from general practices and the local community in Edinburgh, Scotland. Data collection and analysis occurred concurrently and recruitment continued until no new themes emerged from the interviews.
   Results Respondents expressed gratitude for the availability of free diabetes services in Britain, as they were used to having to pay to access health care on the Indian subcontinent. Most looked to services for the prompt detection and treatment of complications, rather than the provision of advice about managing their condition. As respondents attached importance to receiving physical examinations, they could be disappointed when these were not offered by health-care professionals. They disliked relying on interpreters and identified a need for bilingual professionals with whom they could discuss their diabetes care directly.
   Conclusions Gratitude for free services in Britain may instil a sense of indebtedness which makes it difficult for Pakistanis and Indians to be critical of their diabetes care. Health-care professionals may need to describe their roles carefully, and explain how different diabetes services fit together, to avoid Pakistani and Indian patients perceiving treatment as unsatisfactory. Whilst linkworker schemes may meet patients' need to receive culturally sensitive information in their first language, work is needed to assess their effectiveness and sustainability.

ID BULL TROUT; TELEMETRY; RIVER; PATTERNS; STREAM
AB Human-induced habitat alteration is one of the main causes of the decline of freshwater fish populations. The watershed of the River Bidasoa (Spain) is an example of heavily fragmented habitat. The local brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) population is disturbed, with evidence of poor recruitment as well as low adult densities in the main stem. Forty male and female adult migratory trout were tagged with external or internal radio transmitters and released. Fixed stations with data loggers and mobile antennae were used with daily surveys to track fish movements during the migration and spawning period (3 months). Migration distances did not exceed 10 km, and half of the fish never entered a tributary in the study area. Fragmentation because of weirs on the main stem apparently prevented fish from reaching their spawning destination. Fish that entered the tributaries were first confronted with an accessibility problem because of low discharge. However, each fish chose one tributary, without making attempts to run up in other tributaries. Once in the tributary, fish were restrained in their upstream movements by dams. The study area appeared to be isolated from the vast upper part of the watershed. Within the study area, upper parts of tributaries also seemed strongly disconnected from the main stem. This study illustrates the negative impact of river fragmentation on S. trutta migration pattern. Population sustainability can be directly affected through the low availability of spawning grounds for migratory fish. Long-term effects of fragmentation may cause reproductive isolation within watersheds, which in the case of trout also means isolated phenotypic population units.

CHAMAEDOREA (XATE) IN THE GREATER MAYA MOUNTAINS AND THE CHIQUIBUL FOREST RESERVE, BELIZE: AN ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF A NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCT. Economic Botany 60(3):265-283, 2006. Of the twelve species of Chamaedorea palm recorded for Belize, three are of international economic value because their cut leaves (xate) are traded in the floricultural industry. Traditionally, Belize has not harvested xate, the industry being based in Mexico and Guatemala. However a decline in wild xate stocks in these countries means Guatemalan leaf harvesters now illegally harvest xate in Belize. To assess the local abundance of the Belizean Chamaedorea resource, its economic value, and the extent to which it has been illegally harvested, 209 plots measuring 20 meters (m) by 20 m were established in the Greater Maya Mountains (GMM) in western Belize, which includes the Chiquibul Forest Reserve (CFR). We estimate that 37.8 million leaves with a value of U.S. $0.3 million to xateros have been extracted from the CFR. The standing export value is calculated as U.S. $1.8 million for the CFR and U.S. $5 million for the GMM.

AB Best-practice environmental policy often suggests co-management of marine resources as a means of achieving sustainable development. Here we consider the impacts of superimposing co-management policy, in the form of territorial user rights for fishers over an existing traditional community-based natural-resource management system in Chile. We consider a broad definition of co-management that includes a spectrum of arrangements between governments and user groups described by different levels of devolution of power. We used participatory rural appraisal techniques and questionnaires to understand the mechanisms that underpin the traditional management system for the bull-kelp "cochayuyo" (Durvillaea antarctica). Traditional management was based on the allocation of informal access rights through a lottery system. This system was controlled by a complex web of traditional institutions that were shown to be successful in terms of equity and resilience. Using a similar approach, we analyzed the effects of superimposing a government-led co-management policy into this traditional system. Two major effects of the new policy were encountered. First, traditional institutions were weakened, which had negative effects on the levels of trust within the community and intensified conflict among users. Second, the management system's adaptive capacity was reduced, thereby jeopardizing the ecosystem's resilience. Our results suggest that the devolution of power to this kind of fisher community still has not reached the level required for fishers to legally address the local deficiencies of the Chilean co-management policy. Additionally, legal adjustments must be made to accommodate traditionally managed ecosystems that offer benefits comparable to those mandated under the formal policy. A fuller understanding of the interactions between co-management and traditional institutions can help us to identify ways to promote resilience and facilitate equal access by mitigating the potential negative effects of co-management policy and informing its future implementation.

TI Developing sustainable energy policies for electrical energy
   conservation in Saudi Arabia
SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE energy policies; energy coservation; Saudi Arabia
AB Towards the end of 1998, the Saudi Arabian electricity sector embarked upon a major restructuring program. One of the aims of the program is to achieve sustainable performance. Although progress has been made, a number of challenges remain, including high demand growth, low generation capacity reserve margins, inefficient energy use, absence of time-of-use tariffs, and the need for large capital investments to meet current and future expansion.
   Electrical energy consumption in Saudi Arabia increased sharply during the last two decades due to rapid economic development and the absence of energy conservation measures. Peak loads reached nearly 24GW in 2001-25 times their 1975 level-and are expected to approach 60 GW by 2023. The total investment needed to meet this demand may exceed $90 billion.(1) Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop energy conservation policies for sustainable development.
   Current sustainable policies, particularly those pertaining to energy conservation, led to peak load savings of more than 871 MW in 2001, mainly as a result of collaborations between the Ministry of Water and Electricity and the Saudi Electricity Company. In the long term, however, unless sustainable energy policies are developed at a national level, such efforts will be largely ineffective. To address this, policies and programs are being developed for public awareness, energy regulation and legislation, and energy information and programming.
   If energy conservation is taken into account, the forecast demand can be reduced by 5-10%. This is equivalent to 3-6 GW of additional capacity, which represents a possible $1.5-3.0 billion saving over the next 20 years. Typically, investment in energy efficiency is 1%, of utility sales revenues, which for a country like Saudi Arabia could be $15-60 million p.a. If only savings on air conditioning are considered, the return on investment is equivalent to 400-500 MW p.a. of generating capacity-a saving of up to $0.25 billion p.a.
   In this paper, the major challenges facing the Saudi electrical power sector in implementing sustainable development are discussed and analyzed. The paper also looks at a number of developed countries and examines their experiences with energy conservation programs. The paper highlights current Saudi programs and experience for promoting awareness and participation in energy conservation. Strategies and major policy measures for energy conservation in Saudi Arabia are proposed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE emissions scenarios; climate change; global warming
AB We discuss energy efficiency and renewable energy (EE/RE) investments in Eritrea from the strategic long-term economic perspective of meeting Eritrea's sustainable development goals and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. EE/RE are potentially important contributors to national productive capital accumulation, enhancement of the environment, expansion of energy services, increases in household standard of living, and improvements in health. In this study, we develop a spreadsheet model for calculating some of the national benefits and costs of different levels of investment in EE/RE. We then present the results of the model in terms of investment demand and investment scenario curves. These curves express the contribution that efficiency and renewable energy projects can make in terms of reduced energy sector operating expenses, and reduced carbon emissions. We provide demand and supply curves that show the rate of return, the cost of carbon emissions reductions vs. supply, and the evolution of the marginal carbon emissions per dollar of GDP for different investment levels and different fuel-type subsectors.

DT Article
DE sustainable transport; climate change; backcasting; carbon dioxide;

ID ENERGY; FUTURE
AB In this paper an image of a sustainable transport system for Sweden in 2050 is outlined. The emissions per capita in this image may be generalized to a global population of 9 billions, and still be consistent with a stabilization of the carbon dioxide concentration at 450ppm (parts per million). Swedish transport energy use per capita is 4.6MWh in the image, compared to 12.5MWh at present. The aim is, first, to widen the perspective of sustainable transport futures and, second, to provide a basis for present decisions in areas characterized by a high inertia, e.g. regarding infrastructure and the built-up environment. All transport generated by the lifestyles of Swedish residents are included. The reduction of energy use in the image is primarily achieved by an introduction of energy efficient vehicles and a conscious combination of IT-services and urban planning. The latter aims at increasing functional accessibility while reducing commuting. A prioritization of leisure travel to structurally-enforced travel gives the possibility to increase leisure travel per capita by one third. However, this is contingent on a 50% reduction of per capita car travel in cities. Given the set-up target, it may be concluded that the need for new arterial road capacity in cities often is negligible, even with a considerable population increase. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Traditional resource management (TRM) systems in tropical forests can provide insights on sustainable resource use, but despite the growing prevalence of degraded tropical forest habitats, few studies have assessed the relationships between TRM and conservation in these environments. In Hawaii, the traditional gathering of native wild plants used for hula (chants and dance) and lei (garlands) is carried out in forests increasingly dominated by alien invasive species. Ethnographic methods and exploratory experimental harvests were employed to examine: gathering of hula plants in the past and present, ecological impacts of contemporary gathering practices of three important native hula species in alien-dominated forests, and relationships between traditional practices and past and modern conservation. Past gathering traditions included practices to increase and conserve hula plant populations. Harvest of Microlepia strigosa fern fronds significantly decreased M. strigosa cover over the short term. Cover of alien species significantly increased after frond-harvest of Sphenomeris chinensis. Regeneration of the fruit-harvested shrub, Melicope anisata, was significantly negatively correlated with the level of understorey invasive species. These results suggest that in Hawai'i's alien-dominated forests, gathering of some species may increase spread of alien invasive species or exacerbate regeneration problems caused by invasive species. However, some expert cultural practitioners have adapted traditional practices to ensure hula plant conservation by incorporating weeding of alien invasive species into their protocols. The re-strengthening and adaptation of traditional Hawaiian knowledge and social institutions to the modern context can provide opportunities to improve conservation of Hawai'i's culturally-important native plants and their habitats.

TI A theory of environmental virtue
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB If claims about which character traits are environmental virtues are to be more than rhetoric, there must be some basis or standard for evaluation. This naturalistic, teleological, pluralistic, and inclusive account of what makes a character trait an environmental virtue can be such a standard. It is naturalistic because it is consistent with and motivated by scientific naturalism. It is teleological because character traits are evaluated according to how well they promote certain ends. It is pluralistic because those ends are both agent-relative and agent-independent. It is inclusive because it counts environmentally justified, environmentally responsive and environmentally productive virtues as environmental virtues. This theory of environmental virtue provides the basis for the development of a typology of environmental virtue that includes virtues of sustainability, virtues of communion with nature, virtues of respect for nature, virtues of environmental activism, and virtues of environmental stewardship.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID AESTHETICS
AB The sustainability movement, currently gathering considerable attention from architects, derives much of its moral foundation from the theoretical initiatives of environmental ethics. How is the value of sustainability to mesh with architecture's time-tested values? The idea that an ethic of sustainability might serve architects' efforts to reground their practices in something that opposes consumer values of the marketplace has intuitive appeal and makes a certain amount of sense. However, it is far from obvious that the sustainability movement provides a strong enough conceptual framework for an entire design philosophy. This issue is complicated by two different sustainable design outlooks which parallel two conceptions of environmental ethics: the practical and the radical. Nevertheless, sustainability need not resort to the philosophical excess of its radical branch to help foster a new public-spiritedness.

AB Understanding effects of flow alteration on stream biota is essential to developing ecologically sustainable water supply strategies. We evaluated effects of altering flows via surface water withdrawals and instream reservoirs on stream fish assemblages, and compared effects with other hypothesized drivers of species richness and assemblage composition. We sampled fishes during three years in 28 streams used for municipal water supply in the Piedmont region of Georgia, U.S.A. Study sites had permitted average withdrawal rates that ranged from < 0.05 to > 13 times the stream's seven-day, ten-year recurrence low flow (7Q10), and were located directly downstream either from a water supply reservoir or from a withdrawal taken from an unimpounded stream. Ordination analysis of catch data showed a shift in assemblage composition at reservoir sites corresponding to dominance by habitat generalist species. Richness of fluvial specialists averaged about 3 fewer species downstream from reservoirs, and also declined as permitted withdrawal rate increased above about 0.5 to one 7Q10-equivalent of water. Reservoir presence and withdrawal rate, along with drainage area, accounted for 70% of the among-site variance in fluvial specialist richness and were better predictor variables than percent of the catchment in urban land use or average streambed sediment size. Increasing withdrawal rate also increased the odds that a site's Index of Biotic Integrity score fell below a regulatory threshold indicating biological impairment. Estimates of reservoir and withdrawal effects on stream biota could be used in predictive landscape models to support adaptive water supply planning intended to meet societal needs while conserving biological resources.

AB With the prediction by the United Nations that 60% of the world's population will live in cities by the year 2030, it is apparent that the immediate global future is one of urbanisation. Central to the issue of sustainability must therefore be the increasing domination of the city. Determining the sustainability of a city and the effect the city has on global sustainability must be considered from two perspectives that are largely analogous to Castells' bi-polar conflict between "the Net" and "the Self" [Castells, M., 1996. The Rise of the Network Society, vol. 1, first ed. Blackwell Publishers, Oxford, UK]. Cities must reconcile the conflict between being part of a competitive global city network and satisfying the day to day requirements of their own inhabitants. This dual perspective of cities and sustainability is examined in this paper with a view to determine an appropriate model for what may constitute a contemporary sustainable city. What are the defining characteristics that would ensure a city can not only survive in a manner acceptable to its current and future inhabitants, but also in a way that will not undermine the abilities of other cities and regions around the world to also remain sustainable?

AB The need for better techniques, tools and practices to analyse ecological and economic systems within an integrated framework has never been so great. Many institutions have made tremendous efforts in the implementation of sustainable environment management based on 'integrated' approaches, as opposed to that of late 20th century's in-depth knowledge or'reductionism' concepts. However, achieving sustainable environment management seems remote, as our understanding of ecosystem response to human influence is insufficient to predict the environmental outcome of proposed development activities. This has left environmentalists and land developers wrangling over the reliability of current environmental modelling techniques, assessment methodologies and their results. As a result, ecosystems continue to deteriorate with commensurate biodiversity loss. The paper elaborates on how self-organising map (SOM) methodologies within the connectionist paradigms (connectionist paradigms refer to the late 20th century neural network architectures) of artificial neural networks (ANNs) could be applied to disparate data analysis at two different scales: regional (using river water quality monitoring data to evaluate ecosystem response to human influence) and global (for modelling of environmental and economic system data and trade-off analysis) within an integrated framework to inform sustainable environment management.

AB This pilot project determines the potential for growing Cool Climate Grapes, high yield pasture and blue gum across Gippsland (Victoria, Australia), and the likely shift in that potential as projected climate change occurs in the region. It provides an indication of the information that can be generated combining Land Suitability Analysis and climate change scenarios. By considering the changing suitability of a few key agricultural enterprises in this region, the project offers an important direction for the agricultural elements of the Victorian Greenhouse Strategy. This pilot project utilises Land Suitability Analysis (LSA) developed by the former Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) under the National Land and Water Resources Audit of Australia and further enhanced with Local Government and Catchment Management Authorities across Victoria. This modelling technique allows for an assessment of impacts on a wide range of commodities beyond the historic focus of cropping and pasture models. Following a series of workshops with agronomists, soil scientists, climate scientists, strategic planners and growers, a series of maps/overlays were prepared for Gippstand showing potential suitability of blue gum plantations, Cool Climate Grapes and high yield pasture, as an initial illustration of the methodology. This potential suitability has since been adjusted/modified using a variety of climate change scenarios developed by CSIRO Climate Impacts Group, resulting in an assessment of the change in potential suitability for each enterprise at years 2020 and 2050. The resultant work can be analysed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to consider change over time and space in the region. Combined with changes in water availability, this may act as an innovative and powerful decision support tool for policy makers in government and industry. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Models that implement the bio-physical components of agro-ecosystems are ideally suited for exploring sustainability issues in cropping systems. Sustainability may be represented as a number of objectives to be maximised or minimised. However, the full decision space of these objectives is usually very large and simplifications are necessary to safeguard computational feasibility. Different optimisation approaches have been proposed in the literature, usually based on mathematical programming techniques. Here, we present a search approach based on a multiobjective evaluation technique within an evolutionary algorithm (EA), linked to the APSIM cropping systems model. A simple case study addressing crop choice and sowing rules in North-East Australian cropping systems is used to illustrate the methodology. Sustainability of these systems is evaluated in terms of economic performance and resource use. Due to the limited size of this sample problem, the quality of the EA optimisation can be assessed by comparison to the full problem domain. Results demonstrate that the EA procedure, parameterised with generic parameters from the literature, converges to a useable solution set within a reasonable amount of time. Frontier "peels" or Pareto-optimal solutions as described by the multiobjective evaluation procedure provide useful information for discussion on trade-offs between conflicting objectives.

AB Water quality survey was undertaken to study the current status of water quality of some lentic habitats of Dharwad, Haveri and Uttar Kannada districts, to provide a baseline data, comprising study of their main physical and chemical characteristics and also to evaluate the recent limnological changes those have occurred over a time period in some lentic habitats. Trophic status was also analysed. Present study reveals that Unkal lake, and B.K. Shigigatti tank of Dharwad district, Timmapur, Hosalli, and Krishnapur tanks of Haveri district are fast progressing towards hypereutrophication. Of the other tanks, Galgi tank of Dharwad district, Gudgur, Hanamapur, Medleri, and Kadkol tanks of Haveri district have reached the eutrophic stage. The anthropogenic activities, sewage and fertilizers used in agricultural fields appear to be the major causes of the eutrophication in these tanks. If the habitats have to be preserved for their intended use, sustainable and holistic management measures for the remediation of the tanks are an immediate necessity.

AB Complex interaction between anthropogenic activities, air quality and human health in urban areas, such as in Cracow sustains the need for the development of an interdisciplinary and integrated risk-assessment methodology. In such purpose, we propose a pilot study performed on asthmatics and based on a combined use of a biomarker, such as metallothionein 2A (MT-2A) in the characterization of human exposure to one or a mixture of pollutants and of Geographical Information Systems (G.I.S.) which integrates climatic and urban anthropogenic parameters in the assessment of spatio-temporal dispersion of air pollutants. Considering global incidence of air pollution on asthma and on peripheral blood lymphocytes MT-2A expression should provide a complementary information on biological risks linked to urban anthropogenic activities. Such study would help for the establishment of a sustainable development in urban areas that can maintain the integrity of air quality and preserve human health. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   consumption: Lifestyle change and environmental policy
SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS

AB We analyse the impacts of a change in consumers' preference for Novel Protein Foods (NPFs), i.e. a lifestyle change with respect to meat consumption, and the impacts of environmental policies e.g. tradable emission permits for greenhouse gases (GHGs) or an EU ammonia (NH3) emission bound per hectare. For our analysis we use a global applied general equilibrium (AGE) model that includes consumers' lifestyle change, different production systems, emissions from agricultural sectors, and an emission permits system. Our study leads to the following conclusions. Firstly, more consumption of NPFs assists in reducing global agricultural emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (N2O) and NH3. However, because of international trade, emission reduction does not necessarily occur in the regions where more NPFs are consumed. Secondly, through lifestyle change of the 'rich', the emission reduction is not substantial because more 'intermediate' consumers will increase their meat consumption. Finally, for the same environmental target the production structure changes towards less intensive technologies and more grazing under environmental policy than under lifestyle change.

   the internal resistance by impedance Spectroscopy

AB An upflow microbial fuel cell (UMFC) system with a U-shaped cathode inside the anode chamber was developed and produced a maximum volumetric power of 29.2 W/m(3) at a volumetric loading rate of 3.40 kg COD/(m(3) day) and an operating temperature of 35 C while feeding sucrose continuously. The Coulombic efficiency decreased from 51.0% to 10.6% with the increase in the volumetric loading rate from 0.57 to 4.29 kg COD/(m(3) day). In addition, the lab-scale UMFC maintained soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies exceeding 90% and volatile fatty acid concentrations of similar to 40 mg/L, indicating efficient wastewater treatment. The analysis of impedance spectroscopy, generated by fitting experimental data into an equivalent circuit, revealed that at a volumetric loading rate of 3.40 kg COD/(m(3) day) the overall internal resistance was 17.13 ohm. This internal resistance was composed of electrolyte resistance (8.62 ohm), charge-transfer resistance (7.05 ohm), and diffusion resistance (1.46 ohm). Electrolyte resistance dominated throughout the entire range of loading rates. In addition, impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that both the anodic and the cathodic charge-transfer resistances were important limiting factors. To further improve the power output of the UMFC, we must reduce the electrolyte resistance by optimizing reactor configuration, reduce the anode charge- transfer resistances by selecting superior anodic microbiota, and reduce the cathodic charge- transfer resistance by exploring sustainable and efficient catalysts.

AB Electrodialysis with bipolar membranes (EDBM) is a kind of technology that integrates solvent and salt dissociation. It can realize salt conversion without second salt pollution or provide H+ and OH-/alkoxide ions in situ without salt introduction. Thus, it inherently possesses economical and environmental benefits. Moreover, its technological compatibility gives rise to new functions when it couples with other technologies, such as complexion, ion exchange, extraction, and adsorption. In view of the above peculiarities, EDBM has found many interesting applications in chemistry, food processing, biochemical industries, and environmental protection. However, its development has been restricted by such factors as lack of recognition of its contribution to industrial ecology, high membrane cost, insufficient research investment, and scarce operation experience. This paper compiles an introduction to this technology from the perspective of industrial ecology and conducts an extensive examination into EDBM applications. Its purpose is to gather synergic strength from academia, industry, and government to perfect EDBM for sustainable development.

AB It is very important to efficiently study and use genetic diversity resources in crop breeding and sustainable agriculture. In this study, different sampling methods and sample sizes were compared in order to optimize the strategies for building a rationally sized core collection of Chinese soybean (Glycine max). The diversity in the core collection captured more than 70% of that in the pre-core collection, no matter what sampling methods were used, at a sampling proportion of 1%. Core collections established with both simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker data and agronomic traits were more representative than those chosen on an independent basis. An optimal sampling method for a soybean core collection was determined, in which strategy 'S' (allocating accessions to clusters according to the proportion of square root of the original sample size within each ecotype) was used based on SSR and agronomic data. Curve estimation was used to estimate the allelic richness of the entire Chinese soybean germplasm and a minimum sample size for a core collection, on which a sampling proportion of about 2% was determined to be optimal for a core collection. Further analysis on the core collection with fourteen agronomic traits and allelic constitution at 60 SSR loci suggested that it highly represented the entire collections both on genetic structure and diversity distribution. This core collection would provide an effective platform in proper exploitation of soybean germplasm resources for the study of complex traits and discovering important novel traits for crop genetic development.

AB A team of U.S.- and China-based geographers examines the relationship between China's economic development and its environment by modeling the effects of energy, transport, and trade on local air pollution emissions (sulfur dioxide and soot particulates) using the Environmental Kuznets model. Specifically, the latter model is investigated using spatial econometrics that take into account potential regional spillover effects from high-polluting neighbors. The analysis finds an inverted-U relationship for sulfur dioxide but a U-shaped curve for soot particulates. This suggests that soot particulates such as black carbon may pose a more serious environmental problem in China than sulfur dioxide.

AB The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the ways in which creating and sustaining authentic inclusion requires significant alterations to more than the programmatic regularities that characterize schools (Sarason, 1996).
   Data from ethnographic case studies of inclusive schools in the United States, United Kingdom and Portugal are drawn upon to illustrate significant features that characterize these schools. The multiple dimensions of their inclusive cultures include both implicit and explicit assumptions, values and beliefs that are shown to be central to the ways school staff interact with one another and students.
   Although the analysis presented in this paper illustrates the importance of understanding the multiple dimensions of school cultures for the operation of inclusive schools, it also highlights the limits of a purely cultural analysis. Educators faced with threats to the sustainability of the vision articulated by the Salamanca statement will also need to understand and respond to the broader political contexts operating in the 21st century.

AB Regional development strategies should be based on the sound assessment of regional resources, as well as on forming dynamic capabilities aiming to develop the resource configurations in order to form regional competitive advantage. In this study, the concept "regional development platform" is used as a tool for assessing the regional potentials on which sustainable, competitive advantage could be built. The Regional Development Platform Method (RDPM) is presented as a tool for designing and managing a regional innovation system. It consists of eight phases, in which the underlying potential in the region is explored and the exploitation of the potential organized. The experiences gained from applying the RDPM in the Lahti region, Finland, are used to illustrate the article.

AB Time orientation, as a psychological determinant of sustainable behavior, is addressed in this paper. One hundred and seventy-seven individuals in two Mexican cities responded to a questionnaire investigating future orientation (i.e. the tendency of some people to establish and achieve goals and to plan strategies for meeting long-term obligations) and sustainable behavior, indicated by the self-report of water conservation practices. The relationship between these two factors was estimated within a structural equation model (SEM), which revealed that future orientation significantly and positively affects sustainable behavior. Between-group contrasts have not revealed significant differences in future orientation and water conservation given by economic income, gender and educational level. However, younger individuals (< 18-year-old) were significantly less future-oriented than older people, while persons living in a city experiencing water scarcity tended to engage more frequently in water conservation practices.

AB This study argues that coordination of electoral cycles among European Union (EU) member states and greater similarity in the partisan bias of their governments would make their membership in the single currency easier and cheaper by harmonizing their fiscal policies and would thus contribute to the sustainability, of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). This argument is supported by applying a two-step least squares regression analysis to a cross-section of 325 dyads among 26 European countries. The article adds to the debate on the sustainability of the EMU with wider country and criteria coverage than is available in most of the existing literature, and by considering endogenous optimal currency area criteria as well as political variables within a single framework. It also contributes by studying the effects of political variables on real exchange rates and by applying a methodology that corrects estimates for the endogeneity of variables.

AB Biological soil characteristics such as microbial biomass, community structures, activities, and functions may provide important information on environmental and anthropogenic influences on agricultural soils. Diagnostic tools and detailed statistical approaches need to be developed for a reliable evaluation of these parameters, in order to allow classification and quantification of the magnitude of such effects. The DOK long-term agricultural field experiment was initiated in 1978 in Switzerland for the evaluation of organic and conventional farming practices. It includes three representative Swiss farming systems with biodynamic, bio-organic and conventional fertilization and plant protection schemes along with minerally fertilized and unfertilized controls. Effects on microbial soil characteristics induced by the long-term management at two different stages in the crop rotation, i.e. winter wheat after potato or corn, were investigated by analyzing soil bacterial community structures using analysis of PCR-amplified rRNA genes by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. Application of farmyard manure consistently revealed the strongest influence on bacterial community structures and biomass contents. Effects of management and plant protection regimes occurred on an intermediate level, while the two stages in the crop rotation had a marginal influence that was not significant.

AB This paper presents and analyzes an endogenous growth model with public capital and progressive taxation. Two versions are considered: The first version assumes that the budget of the government is balanced at each point of time. The second allows for public debt but asserts that the ratio of the primary surplus to gross domestic income is a positive linear function of the debt/income ratio, which guarantees that public debt is sustainable. The paper then derives necessary conditions for the existence of a sustainable balanced growth path for the analytical model. Further, simulations are undertaken in order to gain insight into growth effects of varying the slope of the tax schedule and in order to find how the tax scheme affects the dynamics of the model.

DE fiscal sustainability; generational accounting; OECD method;
   sustainability indicators
AB Based on an empirical application for Germany, we compare two methods of measuring fiscal sustainability: the generational-accounting approach and the OECD method. In a first step, we show that the two methods can be transformed into one another. Hence, the indicators of generational accounting can be used for the OECD method and vice versa, thus enlarging the set of sustainability indicators for both methods. in a second step, we discuss these indicators with respect to their theoretical deficiencies, tangibility, and sensitivity. Finally, we come to the conclusion that a combination of indicators stemming from both approaches can give a more general and understandable description of fiscal sustainability and satisfy a strictly defined condition of sustainability at the same time.

ID MODELS
AB The exploitation status of white croaker Micropogonias furnieri in southem Brazil is assessed using a production model constructed according to three hypotheses of stock discreetness: an isolated stock in southern Brazil; a straddling stock shared between Brazil and Uruguay; and a straddling stock shared among Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. Estimates of virgin stock size and maximum sustainable yield were more sensitive to the hypothesis assumed correct, the posterior means varying respectively from 177,648 to 1,007,256 tonnes and from 7459 to 38,677 tonnes. Estimates of stock status in relation to management reference points were more robust to the uncertainties in stock discreetness and indicate that the species in currently overfished (biomass at 60% of B-msy) and under heavy overfishing (F between approximately 2 and 6 times higher than F-msy). Results suggest that the relative stability of catches in the region occurs at the expense of a steady decline in stock abundance and that concerted management actions by the three countries are needed to bring the stock to safer levels of exploitation.

AB Background. There is a long tradition of community-based rehabilitation for treatment of severe malnutrition: the question is whether it is effective and whether it should be advised for routine health systems. Objective. To examine the effectiveness of rehabilitating severely malnourished children in the community in nonemergency situations.
   Methods. A literature search was conducted of community-based rehabilitation programs delivered by day-care nutrition centers, residential nutrition centers, primary health clinics, and domiciliary care with or without provision of food, for the period 1980-2005. Effectiveness was defined as mortality of less than 5% and an average weight gain of at least 5 g/kg/day.
   Results. Thirty-three studies of community-based rehabilitation were examined and summarized. Eleven (33%) programs were considered effective. Of the sub-sample of programs reported since 1995, 8 of 13 (62%) were effective. None of the programs operating within routine health systems without external assistance was effective.
   Conclusions. With careful planning and resources, all four delivery systems can be effective. It is unlikely that a single delivery system would suit all situations worldwide. The choice of a system depends on local factors. High energy intakes (> 150 kcal/kg/day), high protein intakes (4-6g/kg/day), and provision of micronutrients are essential for success.
   When done well, rehabilitation at home with family foods is more cost-effective than inpatient care, but the cost effectiveness of ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF) versus family foods has not been studied. Where children have access to a functioning primary health-care system and can be monitored, the rehabilitation phase of treatment Of severe malnutrition should take place in the community rather than in the hospital but only if caregivers can make energy- and protein-dense food mixtures or are given RUTF. For routine health services, the cost of RUTF, logistics of procurement and distribution, and sustainability need to be carefully considered.

AB Background. Concern Worldwide is an international humanitarian nongovernmental organization that piloted and is now implementing and researching community-based therapeutic care (CTC) approaches to managing acute malnutrition. Experience in several countries suggests that there are key issues to be addressed at the international, national, regional, and community levels for community-based treatment of acute malnutrition to be sustainable.
   National level. At the national level there must be demonstrated commitment to a clear health policy and strategy to address outpatient treatment of acute malnutrition. In addition, locally available, affordable ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) must be accessible.
   Regional level. At the regional level a functional health system and appropriate capacity for service provision are required. Integration of outpatient services should be viewed as a process with different levels of inputs at different phases depending on the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH). There is a need for indicators to facilitate scale-up and scale-back for future emergency response.
   Community level. Strong community participation and active screening linked to health service provision at the local level is paramount for sustainable assessment and referral of severe acute malnutrition.
   Future challenges to sustain community-based therapeutic care. Key challenges to the sustainable treatment Of severe acute malnutrition include the development of locally produced RUTF, development of international standards on local RUTF production, the integration of outpatient treatment protocols into international health and nutrition guidelines, and further operational research into integration of community-based treatment Of severe acute malnutrition into health systems in nonemergency contexts.

   production; growth
AB Reduced impact logging in an eastern Amazonian terra firme forest left more than half of the next crop trees growing at a rate corresponding to a rotation of more than a century to attain 60-cm dbh. Two years after the logging, in 20 ha of the logged forest, tree competitors around crop trees were eliminated. Competitors were defined as trees whose crowns overtopped crop trees, those within 2 m of them, and trees as tall as or taller than the crop trees closer than indicated by a basal area of 15-25 m(2)/ha, depending on their summed diameters. During the subsequent 5.7 years, increment of the liberated crop trees was 20% greater than that of comparable crop trees left in another 20 ha of the same logged forest without liberation. Had the competing trees been identified at the time of the logging the 5.8/ha that were merchantable could have increased the yield from 25 m(3)/ha to as much as 43 m(3)/ha. This added harvest should have more than paid the entire cost of the liberation, including the elimination of the remaining unmerchantable, trees. Additionally, a prospective reduction of 25% in the wait for the next harvest, as compared with logging only, would have been created. Where the economical sustainability of tropical wood productivity and quality is a goal, the wisdom of neglect of liberation is questioned. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon accounting, forest health monitoring and sustainable management of the subtropical dry forests of Puerto Rico and other Caribbean Islands require an accurate assessment of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and stem volume. One means of improving assessment accuracy is the development of predictive equations derived from locally collected data. Forest inventory and analysis (FIA) measured tree diameter and height, and then destructively sampled 30 trees from 6 species at an upland deciduous dry forest site near Ponce, Puerto Rico. This data was used to develop best parsimonious equations fit with ordinary least squares procedures and additive models fit with nonlinear seemingly unrelated regressions that estimate subtropical dry forest leaf, woody, and total AGB for Bucida buceras and mixed dry forest species. We also fit equations for estimating inside and outside bark total and merchantable stem volume using both diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) and total height, and diameter at breast height alone for B. buceras and Bursera simaruba. Model fits for total and woody biomass were generally good, while leaf biomass showed more variation, possibly due to seasonal leaf loss at the time of sampling. While the distribution of total AGB into components appeared to remain relatively constant across diameter classes, AGB variability increased and B. simaruba and B. buceras allocated more carbon into branch biomass than the other species. When comparing our observed and predicted values to other published dry forest AGB equations, the equation developed in Mexico and recommended for areas with rainfall > 900 mm/year gave estimates substantially lower than our observed values, while equations developed using dry forest data from forest in Australia, India and Mexico were lower than our observed values for trees with d.b.h. < 25 cm and slightly higher for trees with d.b.h. > 30 cm. Although our ability to accurately estimate merchantable stem volume and live tree AGB for subtropical dry forests in Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands has been improved, much work remains to be done to sample a wider range of species and tree sizes.

AB The pressure to attain sustainable primary production necessitates that novel alternatives to issues such as pest management are researched and developed. Given this context we tracked (using Malaise traps) the changes in diversity and abundance of native wasp parasitoids (belonging to the superfamily Ichneumonoidea, comprising the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae) in three field trials comprising mixed plantings of Eucalyptus and/or Acacia. Our aim was to examine the influences of time since planting (determines architectural complexity), tree species composition and presence/absence of understorey vegetation (i.e. vegetational complexity) on populations of Ichneumonoidea. In the trial referred to as "GES1" the diversity of wasps increased from 10 to 37 morphospecies in the 3 years following planting; over this time some of the trees were estimated to have undergone an approximate 2.7-fold increase in height. In the plantings comprising Eucalyptus and/or Acacia in the proportions 10:90, 38:62 or 100:0, respectively ("GES2"), there was a tendency for Ichneumonoidea to be more abundant in arboreta in which the composition of Eucalyptus and Acacia was more closely matched (i.e. 38:62 eucalypts to acacias) compared to arboreta in which trees of one or other of the two genera dominated (i.e. 10:90 and 100:0 eucalypts to acacia). We also report a tendency for Ichneumonoidea to be less abundant in the halves of the third planting ("GES3") where understorey vegetation had been killed with herbicide. Our results were in accordance with the general ecological principle that greater habitat complexity favours greater species diversity. We suggest that increasing the vegetational complexity of commercial Eucalyptus plantations in ways that favour desired species of Ichneumonoidea could be a means of enhancing the biological control of incipient populations of pest insects.

TI A life cycle environmental and economic assessment of optimum value
   engineering in houses
SO FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Public concern that wood-frame construction overly stresses the forest resource has led some to advocate a reduction in the use of wood. Possible activity toward that objective includes total substitution of wood with alternative materials, a design choice already invalidated on an environmental basis by life cycle assessment (LCA). Another response has been the reinvigoration of the optimum value engineering (OVE) concept, also called advanced framing. This is a careful approach to wood design meant to reduce the volume of wood in a building, and to reduce waste. Advocates of OVE assume an environmental benefit from any wood reduction; however, OVE has never been scientifically established as environmentally preferable to conventional framing; literature on OVE has only quantified the cost savings in materials. This LCA study compared a best-practice Canadian house with one using up to 50 percent less wood, and found little or no environmental benefit; an important factor in these results was the need to incorporate non-renewable products to replace the functionality of the removed wood. Next, a house that combined some elements of efficient framing with maximum use of renewable content (e.g., cellulose insulation in place of fiberglass, wood windows in place of aluminum windows, and wood siding in place of vinyl siding) was compared to the conventional house, and showed strong environmental benefits. These data provide a good argument for maintaining, not decreasing, the renewable content in a house, provided that public confidence in sustainable forestry in North America is continually improved.

AB Lamiophlomis rotata (Lamiaceae), a perennial medicinal herb, is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. A total of 188 individuals from eight natural populations of L. rotata in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (four from Tibet, two from Yunnan, and two from Qinghai) were analyzed using intersimple sequence repeats (ISSR) and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) techniques. Our results revealed that the level of genetic variation in L. rotata was relatively high (P = 94.85%, I = 0.440 +/- 0.220, H-T = 0.289 +/- 0.028). Three genetic groups corresponding to the three geographic regions were detected, suggesting significant geographic structure. Our results suggest that the highly structured geographic pattern found in L. rotata might represent diverging evolutionary processes associated with the uplifting of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Quaternary climatic oscillations. These findings imply that as many populations as possible should be preserved in situ for the conservation of this species. Given their genetic variability and peripheral distribution, Qinghai and Yunnan populations should be assigned priority for conservation. Optimal harvesting strategies, domestication and tissue culture of L. rotata should be developed as soon as possible to guarantee its sustainable use.

AB Environmental justice research has of late expanded beyond its' original focus on the distribution of environmental 'bads' to debate injustices at a wide array of sites and scales. Despite this expansion, the applicability of an environmental justice framework to seemingly apolitical and banal expressions of environmental concerns remains open to question. This paper argues that environmental justice struggles can be located in the mundane environmental politics of Singapore, by employing a performative rather than rights-based approach to both justice and politics. It draws on qualitative research into volunteers' practices in one Singaporean environmental organisation, and asserts that through their focus on experiential learning and re-inscribing 'developmental' spaces as spaces of care and justice, volunteers seek to redress the social, political and environmental injustices replete within the spatial politics of Singapore.

AB The reshaping of South African cities is being guided by policies aiming to build socially and environmentally just communities. Despite widespread commitment to this goal, there is little consensus on what it means and how it should and could translate into practice. The paper shows that despite the emphasis on environmental justice and building sustainable communities in policy, the institutional context for implementation (including expert driven and deliberative approaches) do not always deliver on this mandate. Consequently, policy outcomes do not reflect those of the communities and households it is meant to serve, raising challenging moral and ethical questions for institutions involved in environmental governance. This paper shows how the institutional context of environmental assessment combined with the role played by the values held by environmental practitioners charged with influencing decision-making result in the perpetuation of environmental injustices. The lack of a clearly defined profession and professional body, reflecting a diversity of values, debating, regulating, defining and defending a set of principles to guide decision-making in cities is identified as a possible reason for the lack of congruence between the values reflected in policy with those held by the communities these interventions are intended to serve. The resulting value added by sustainable cities interventions in the light of this mismatch is therefore questionable, raising challenges regarding international calls for local action as well as an increasing policy focus in South Africa on the local level as the agent of political and spatial transformation of cities.

AB Through a critique of existing regeneration literatures the paper points to the close relationship between regeneration and sustainable development. It suggests that the economic aspects of sustainable development have tended to dominate: leading to the neglect of nature in both regeneration and sustainable development, with regeneration having a principal focus on socio-economic issues in urban settings. To address these lacunae we suggest the need for a more environmentally sensitive regeneration theory. Using this approach the paper draws on recent in-depth research in three post-industrial coalfield areas where regeneration processes operate in the form of community forest projects. It provides a critical perspective on these regeneration processes, integrating theory with empirical data and highlighting how nature is drawn into broader economic and social processes of regeneration. In conclusion, using forestry initiatives as examples, we reflect on the conceptual dissonance apparent in regeneration theory and practice, and point to theoretical insights that could enable a more critical regeneration theory; more beneficial outcomes to regeneration processes; and an improved understanding of the relations between nature, capital and community in regeneration processes and sustainable development.

TI From market to multifunctionality? Land stewardship in Australia
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL

DE Australia; agricultural sustainability; ecosystem services;

ID POST
AB Recent assessments of Australia's land and water resources have revealed widespread patterns of serious decline, much of it directly associated with agricultural practices. The environmental degradation associated with agriculture has both biophysical and socioeconomic underpinnings. While there have been calls to attend to the sustainability 'crisis' of Australian agriculture, policy settings remain firmly locked onto a productivist trajectory. We consider the implications of contemporary policy settings for farmland sustainability against the background of debates as to the meaning of 'multifunctionality'. The discussion is then turned to the Land Stewardship project, a strategic policy initiative within the State of Victoria that was looked to as a means of redressing environmental degradation in agricultural landscapes while also being attentive to rural community and economic issues. Towards the end of the paper we reflect on the question of how the Land Stewardship project aligns with theorizations of multifunctionality.

TI Managing sustainable farmed landscape through 'alternative' food
   networks: a case study from Italy
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
LA English

   networks; 'adopt a sheep' scheme; rural development

AB This paper focuses on a case study of an 'alternative' food network based in the Abruzzo National Park, Italy, to explore how ideas of sustainable farmland management can be expressed through broader understandings of developing networks of care concerned with local economies and societies, high-quality specialist food products, particular 'traditional' farming practices and livestock breeds, as well as the ecology of a farmed landscape. The scheme allows customers, internationally as well as in Italy, to 'adopt' a milking sheep on a large mountain farm. In return, adopters are sent food products from the farm. The adoption scheme is inter-twined with an agri-tourism project which provides accommodation, runs a restaurant and engages in educational activities. The scheme is the result of the individual initiative of its founder, and is associated with a strongly expressed ethical position concerning the value of sustaining valued local rural landscapes and lifestyles, and the importance of 'reconnecting' urban dwellers with rural areas, farming and 'quality' food production. Yet the localness of the scheme is sustained through wider national and international networks: volunteer and paid workers are drawn from several European countries, funding has been acquired from the EU LEADER programme, and internet and transport technologies are essential in connecting with and supplying an international customer base. The broader economy of care instanced in this case study draws attention to a need to develop strategies for sustainable farmland management constructed around wider programmes of social, economic and cultural, as well as environmental, concern.

AB There has been particular interest in 'alternative' food over the last 10 years, with many policymakers and researchers throughout the Minority World following a growing number of consumers and producers in supporting organic farming and a host of,alternative' food networks. To date, there has been a tendency for theory and policy to emerge somewhat divorced from the grounded practices and experiences of producer-suppliers themselves within these networks. Urging a shift from 'alternativity' to 'sustainability' as a more critical and valuable tool to analyse food networks, this paper draws upon in-depth ethnographic research with small-scale producer-supplier case studies in south Wales and southern Ontario. In so doing it explores often overlooked voices and stories within sustainable food discourses. Focusing on the value of farmer-led understandings and responses, the paper highlights important implications for policymakers and consumers and outlines future research on sustainable food networks.

TI Source zone natural attenuation at petroleum hydrocarbon spill sites -
   I: Site-specific assessment approach
SO GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID GROUNDWATER; PLUME; CONTAMINANTS; PROGRESSION; DEFINITION
AB This work focuses on the site-specific assessment of source zone natural attenuation (SZNA) at petroleum spill sites, including the confirmation that SZNA is occurring, estimation of current SZNA rates, and anticipation of SZNA impact on future ground water quality. The approach anticipates that decision makers will be interested in answers to the following questions: (1) Is SZNA occurring and what processes are contributing to SZNA? (2) What are the current rates of mass removal associated with SZNA? (3) What are the longer-term implications of SZNA for ground water impacts? and (4) Are the SZNA processes and rates sustainable? This approach is a data-driven, macroscopic, multiple-lines-of-evidence approach and is therefore consistent with the 2000 National Research Council's recommendations and complementary to existing dissolved plume natural attenuation protocols and recent modeling work published by others. While this work is easily generalized, the discussion emphasizes SZNA assessment at petroleum hydrocarbon spill sites. The approach includes three basic levels of data collection and data reduction (Group I, Group II, and Group III). Group I measurements provide evidence that SZNA is occurring. Group II measurements include additional information necessary to estimate current SZNA rates, and group III measurements are focused on evaluating the long-term implications of SZNA for source zone characteristics and ground water quality. This paper presents the generalized site-specific SZNA assessment approach and then focuses on the interpretation of Group II data. Companion papers illustrate its application to source zones at a former oil field in California.

LA German
DT Article
AB The Bavarian network-project "sustainable management of contaminated sites in consideration of natural attenuation" was fully allocated by the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environmental Public, Health and Consumer Protection (StMUGV, former StMLU) with funds amounting to 2.24 million Euros. The two-year research network-project began in June 2001 and ended in May 2003. In addition to the universities of the six subprojects, representatives of partner engineering companies, regional authorities and administration groups were also actively involved. One of the objective targets was to identify the general conditions under which we can find sufficient natural attenuation potential, using innovative methods and investigation techniques. The results have been entered into an application-oriented guide for the implementation of natural attenuation measures, which will be available for regional authorities and engineering companies. The present contribution is intended to be an introduction to the following published subprojects: RUTTINGER et al. (2006), HANAUER et al. (2006), MARCZINEK et al. (2006) and PRECHTEL et al. (2006). It describes the targets, structure, organisation and the subprojects of the Bavarian network-project "sustainable management of contaminated sites in consideration of natural attenuation" providing an overview as well as some basic definitions.

AB The aim of this research is to contribute to the development of public transport services for a heavily car-dependent society. The paper investigates, through a set of actual empirical data, an optimal structure to improve the bus system and contribute to the sustainable development of the city of Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The analysis is based on a computer FORTRAN program to simulate the optimum bus stop spacing based on the field-collected data. It concludes that many of the requirements of an adequate bus system might be provided by appropriate bus stops and that these should be incorporated as part of the bus priority measures in the City of Riyadh.

AB While the importance of urban management in achieving sustainable urban development is increasingly recognised as being significant by urban managers and the general public, there is still a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding in China about the substance of urban management, which impedes effective implementation. This paper examines some of the problems encountered in urban management practice in Chinese cities, and highlights the importance of a holistic conceptual understanding, and a strategic model for enhancing urban management capacities in the Chinese context. Focusing on a case study of Guangzhou Development District (GDD), the paper demonstrates that the application of a set of measurable evaluative criteria for assessing urban management performance is useful in improving urban management practice.

AB Four decades of clinical and basic research have laid a solid base for clinicians to choose the best possible treatment for patients with melanoma. There has been a relative and absolute decrease in mortality despite increasing incidence. However, this decline in mortality is primarily the result of programs for primary and secondary prevention, not therapeutic advances. Conventional and high-dose immunomodulatory regimens and cytostatic therapy have failed to improve the prognosis. Whether the high-dose interferon-a therapy introduced by Kirkwood et al. 2001 can produce sustainable improvement in cure rate is controversial. Further developments such as treatment with recombinant cytokines (especially IL-2 and GM-CSF), specific blockade of neoplastic signal transduction and vaccination are the central issues in current research. In the future the task will be to offer an highly individualized therapy plan, based on specific prognostic and risk criteria defined in molecular genetic parameters. Indiscriminate use of newer therapeutic approaches is simply not affordable in this age of shrinking financial resources for health care.

TI Access, equity and the role of rights in health care
SO HEALTH CARE ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article

ID NEW-ZEALAND; BYPASS SURGERY; CRITERIA; SYSTEM
AB Modern health care rhetoric promotes choice and individual patient rights as dominant values. Yet we also accept that in any regime constrained by finite resources, difficult choices between patients are inevitable. How can we balance rights to liberty, on the one hand, with equity in the allocation of scarce resources on the other? For example, the duty of health authorities to allocate resources is a duty owed to the community as a whole, rather than to specific individuals. Macro-duties of this nature are founded on the notion of equity and fairness amongst individuals rather than personal liberty. They presume that if hard choices have to be made, they will be resolved according to fair and consistent principles which treat equal cases equally, and unequal cases unequally.
   In this paper, we argue for greater clarity and candour in the health care rights debate. With this in mind, we discuss (1) private and public rights, (2) negative and positive rights, (3) procedural and substantive rights, (4) sustainable health care rights and (5) the New Zealand booking system for prioritising access to elective services. This system aims to consider: individual need and ability to benefit alongside the resources made available to elective health services in an attempt to give the principles of equity practical effect. We describe a continuum on which the merits of those, sometimes competing, values-liberty and equity-can be evaluated and assessed.

DT Article
DE HIV/AIDS; care; gender; home-based care; caregiver
ID ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; AIDS; HIV
AB This review explores the specific issues that cluster around the provision of 'care' in the context of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. We argue that the economic concept of the 'care economy' provides a useful lens through which to view the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as it illuminates the increased labour, time and other demands placed upon households and shows that the assumptions on which norms and expectations of care provision are based are increasingly being challenged. While some strides are being made in policy and programming around HIV and AIDS-related care, much more needs to be known and done to enable individuals, families and households to survive in a world shaken by AIDS. Care, we argue, provides fundamental public goods. A strategy of simply downloading responsibility for care onto women, families and communities can no longer be a viable, appropriate or sustainable response. And this is no less true in this current era of expanding treatment options for people living with HIV and AIDS. Our analysis suggests that there are two distinct but inter-related areas for policy intervention and development. The first concerns international health policy and we argue that the international 'care agenda' needs to incorporate an understanding of the care economy into its frameworks and strategies for action, giving particular focus to the caregiver. The second area encompasses a broad national healthcare policy agenda, where a range of public, private and non-governmental sector actors come together with common purpose to ensure that households affected by HIV and AIDS are protected and enabled to survive.

AB Background: Acute hospital general medicine services care for ageing complex patients, using the skills of a range of health-care providers. Evidence suggests that comprehensive early assessment and discharge planning may improve efficiency and outcomes of care in older medical patients.
   Aim: To enhance assessment, communication, care and discharge planning by restructuring consistent, patient-centred multidisciplinary teams in a general medicine service.
   Methods: Prospective controlled trial enrolling 1538 consecutive medical inpatients. Intervention units with additional allied health staff formed consistent multidisciplinary teams aligned with inpatient admitting units rather than wards; implemented improved communication processes for early information collection and sharing between disciplines; and specified shared explicit discharge goals. Control units continued traditional, referral-based multidisciplinary models with existing staffing levels.
   Results: Access to allied health services was significantly enhanced. There was a trend to reduced index length of stay in the intervention units (7.3 days vs 7.8 days in control units, P = 0.18), with no change in 6-month readmissions. in-hospital mortality was reduced from 6.4 to 3.9% (P = 0.03); less patients experienced functional decline in hospital (P = 0.04) and patients' ratings of health status improved (P = 0.02). Additional staffing costs were balanced by potential bed-day savings.
   Conclusion: This model of enhanced multidisciplinary inpatient care has provided sustainable efficiency gains for the hospital and improved patient outcomes.

ID TROPICAL DEFORESTATION; CARBON; MANAGEMENT; REGROWTH; NATIONS; AMAZON
AB Neither the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) nor the Kyoto Protocol include a satisfying mechanism for reducing the substantial emissions from deforestation which are responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is acknowledged that planting forests, for example through afforestation and reforestation in the Clean Development Mechanism, clearly provides an opportunity to sequester carbon in vegetation and soils. However, it takes decades to restore carbon stocks that have been lost as a result of land-use changes. Reducing the rate of deforestation is the only effective way to reduce carbon losses from forest ecosystems. As negotiations on a post-Kyoto agreement have already started the authors argue that a complete and fair post-Kyoto regime will have to expand existing regulations by creating a framework to encompass all land-use and forest-related changes in carbon stocks. Developing countries administer the majority of the world's environmental resources and provide a vital global public good by maintaining environmental assets. However, with increasing pressure on development and the use of resources, developing countries can hardly be expected to provide these services free. Therefore, they will have to be integrated into a more comprehensive incentive framework which also rewards forestry conservation, sustainable forest management and afforestation. The authors discuss how an incentive system for the protection of forests can be included in a future climate regime. Different design choices are considered and two recent approaches to reward developing countries that avoid further deforestation are compared: the 'compensated reduction of deforestation' approach and the Carbon Stock Approach.

TI The WTO in crisis: lessons learned from the Doha negotiations on the

SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB Even before the Doha Round of international trade talks in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) had been suspended in July 2006, there was little sign of progress in the negotiations on the relationship between WTO rules and multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). If the Round is resumed, this and many other important issues on the WTO agenda will have to take a back seat while the big ticket items-agriculture and market access-are resolved. Meanwhile, governments acting outside the WTO will continue to agree to new MEA commitments that relate to trade policy without a clear understanding of how the design and implementation of those commitments is affected by WTO rules. This article examines some of the options for governments to clarify the relationship between WTO rules and ME As, both inside and outside the WTO. It sets out the nature and experience of the relationship, before examining ways in which governments in the WTO and in the UN system could work towards better global governance of trade and sustainable development.

DT Article
AB The extreme volatility of global energy markets since the early 2000s has prompted the Commission of the European Communities to issue a new Green Paper, 'A European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy'. This important document seeks to identify the main steps EU members need to take to enhance their energy outlooks. The first section in this article discusses the concept 'energy security'. This is followed by an examination of Europe's energy mix (oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear power and renewables). The third section analyses European efforts to establish and strengthen energy partnerships with Russia, the Caspian Sea region and the Middle East. In other words, the article seeks to examine Europe's efforts to diversify its energy mix and energy sources. The main argument is that stability and predictability in energy markets are shared goals between producing regions and major consumers.

DE nature-oriented reforestation; natural regeneration; sample plot based
   inventory; tree species composition; North Eastern Vietnam
AB This paper presents the results of a systematic sample plot based inventory in two smallholder reforestation projects in North Eastern Vietnam. The projects were implemented from 1995 to 2005 and applied a nature-oriented approach to reforestation with the ultimate goal of restoring near-natural forest ecosystems for sustainable utilisation. At the end of the reforestation activities, data in 1 422 permanent,, systematically distributed sample plots of 250m(2) size have been collected and entered into a database. The results of the inventory show that already in early stages of forest establishment dynamic natural processes occur that are able to transform plantations towards near-natural forest stands in the long run with very promising qualitative and quantitative development. Precondition is that forest establishment is from the Outset oriented at the goal of establishing near-natural forest stands and that these processes are deliberately allowed to take place.
   In planted stands, these processes lead to a higher number of species and higher densities as originally planted. Planted Pinus massoniana stands quickly develop towards mixed pine/indigenous broadleaf stands. Planted indigenous broadleaf stands merge with natural regeneration towards near-natural mixed broadleaf stands. In stands established by means of natural regeneration, high densities and natural Succession processes lead to a very satisfactory quality development and fast growth. The number of target trees in natural regeneration stands is 200/ha on average. Young natural regeneration stands with trees > 10 cm DBH have with 20.1 m(3)/ha a higher volume than young Pinus massoniana stands with 15.5 m(3)/ha.

AB Major changes in the ownership and administration of forests in Romania have taken place since 1991. As well as restitution of properties nationalised in 1948, substantial privatisation of state forests has been undertaken and subsequently major policy and institutional changes are transforming forest ownership. This process of change has added pressure to forest resources which, although now facing new opportunities, also face increased threat to their continuation. This paper identifies the main changes to forest administration and ownership and the accompanying issues. It presents both the constraints which need to be worked around alongside the developmental priorities for the forestry sector in Romania, this highlighting the importance of intensification and diversification in development strategies in order to continue to sustainably manage forest resources irrespective of new ownership structures.

   development; urban transportation
AB Urban sustainable development (SD) is a key concern of policy and decision-makers. As a result, numerous sustainability studies have been commissioned by government agencies that have led to the recommendation of suites of indicators to assess a host of related socio-economic and environmental issues. Many of these indicators have been described in concept only and a major challenge for science remains in translating verbal indicator descriptions into quantifiable measures. A Landsat-based Canadian national urban land database is being generated at the Canada Centre of Remote Sensing along with a set of urban sustainability indicators as value-added information to support informed transportation energy policy decision-making. This paper addresses indicator quantification, using the remote-sensing derived urban land use data, in the context of urban transportation-related energy consumption resulting from urban sprawl. Our work on quantification of sustainability indicators involves extraction of information about the characteristics of urban form (density, compactness and land use mix) and analysis of its impacts on land use efficiency, transportation and the environment. A generalized methodology for the categorization of indicators is presented based the level of information input and sophistication Of Computation needed for their quantification. Four indicators are discussed (population density, compactness, travel mode index and probability of travel distance) that span the category spectrum. Each indicator presents unique challenges in achieving its quantification in the form of information integration, analytic formulation or modeling. Example results for the cities of Ottawa-Gatineau and Calgary provide a preliminary insight into the difficulties in utilizing indicators for inter-city sustainability comparisons.

AB In this paper, we propose an exploited single-species discrete population model with stage structure for the dynamics in a fish population for which births occur in a single pulse once per time period. Using the stroboscopic map, we obtain an exact cycle of the system, and obtain the threshold conditions for its stability. Bifurcation diagrams are constructed with the birth rate (or harvesting effort) as the bifurcation parameter, and these are observed to display complex dynamic behaviors, including chaotic bands with period windows, pitchfork and tangent bifurcation, nonunique dynamics (meaning that several attractors or attractor and chaos coexist), basins of attraction and attractor crisis. This suggests that birth pulse provides a natural period or cyclicity that makes the dynamical behaviors more complex. Moreover, we show that the timing of harvesting has a, strong impact on the persistence of the fish population, on the volume of mature fish stock and on the maximum annual-sustainable yield. An interesting result is obtained that, after the birth pulses, the population can sustain much higher harvesting effort if the mature fish is removed as early in the season as possible.

AB The increasing pressures in the environment and the environmental social awareness have produced the need for studying interactions between the sectors of the economy and the environment. For a more comprehensive evaluation of sustainability and growth, the field of financial accounting needs to be expanded in order to comprise the use of natural resources and losses in the production process. The paper examines and proposes the cost-benefit analysis model as a useful estimation method of environmental revenues and costs incurred in Greece. These revenues and costs will appear in the profit and loss account statement. Environmental tax is an important cost for all industries with sustainable growth. Taxes are imposed on the natural units, which have a determined negative effect on the environment. Moreover, this paper examines the inherent interaction between the environment and the economic performance of enterprises by adopting environmental management and information green accounting systems.

AB HYVOLUTION is the acronym of an Integrated Project "Non-thermal production of pure hydrogen from biomass" which has been granted in the Sixth EU Framework Programme on Research, Technological Development and Demonstration, Priority 6.1.ii, Sustainable Energy Systems. The aim of HYVOLUTION: "Development of a blue-print for an industrial bioprocess for decentral hydrogen production from locally produced biomass" adds to the number and diversity of H-2 production routes giving greater security of supply at the local and regional level. Moreover, this IP contributes a complementary strategy to fulfil the increased demand for renewable hydrogen expected in the transition to the Hydrogen Economy. The novel approach in HYVOLUTION is based on a combined bioprocess employing thermophilic and phototrophic bacteria, to provide the highest hydrogen production efficiency in small-scale, cost-effective industries. In HYVOLUTION, I I EU countries, Turkey and Russia are represented to assemble the critical mass needed to make a breakthrough in cost-effectiveness.

AB Germany's energy supply status shows both an accumulation of unsatisfactory sustainabilities putting the nation's energy security at risk, and a hopeful sign: the nation's supply dependency on foreign sources and the accordingly unavoidable price dictate the nation suffers under is almost life risking; the technological skill, however, of the nation's researchers, engineers, and industry materializes in a good percentage of the indigenous and the world's energy conversion technology market.
   Exemplified with the up and coming hydrogen energy economy this paper tries to advocate the 21st century energy credo: energy policy is energy technology politics! Energy source thinking and acting is 19th and 20th century, energy efficient conversion technology thinking and acting is 21st century.
   Hydrogen energy is on the verge of becoming the centre-field of world energy interest. Hydrogen energy is key for the decarbonization and, thus, sustainabilization of fossil fuels, and as a storage and transport means for the introduction of so far unoperational huge renewable sources into the world energy market.-What is most important is hydrogen's thermodynamic ability to exergize the energy scheme: hydrogen makes more technical work available (exergy) out of less primary energy! Hydrogen adds value. Hydrogen energy and, in particular, hydrogen energy technologies, are to become part of Germany's national energy identity; accordingly, national energy policy as energy technology politics needs to grow in the nation's awareness as common sense! Otherwise Germany seems ill-equipped energetically, and its well-being hangs in the balance.
   Never in the anthropogenic energy history a novel energy was added to the mix because any one of the "old" energies neared its depletion point and were to replaced; in each case the addition took place because of technological advantages of the novel energy! The novel secondary energy hydrogen will not be any different, it is entirely depending on existing technologies bolted together or on newly developed ones.

ID CYCLE COST-ANALYSIS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; PRODUCT; MODEL
AB Goal, Scope and Background. This paper is concerned with a life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCQ by the use of the waste input-output (WIO) quantity- and price model of air conditioners with different energy efficiency at the use phase (high-end, lowend and average models) that were available in Japan as of winter 2002. The functional unit is an air conditioner of the 2.5kW type that is used for 10 years, and then subjected to an end-of-life (EoL) process that is consistent with the Japanese law on the recycling of appliances.
   Methods. This is the first simultaneous application of the WIO methodology to an LCA and LCC over the entire life-cycle of a product including the use phase, and represents a methodological extension (in the sense of considering the use phase) and integration (in the sense of a simultaneous application) of previous studies by us (Kondo and Nakamura, Int J LCA 2004, Nakamura and Kondo, Ecol Econ 2006). The main body of data is provided by the WIO table for the year 2000, an update of the previous table for 1995 that was used in the above WIO studies. Compared with the WIO table for 1995 that consisted of only about 80 industry sectors, the current one consists of about 400 industry sectors, and includes air conditioner as a separate sector. The data on the purchase price and efficiency of air conditioners indicate wide variations: the cheapest one (the lowend model) costs half of the most expensive one (the high-end model), but its efficiency is about half of the latter.
   Results and Discussion. When the cost in the use and EoL phases is included, the low-end model becomes the most expensive one, and the high-end model with the highest purchase cost the least expensive. This reversal of the relative cost levels is attributed to the difference in the efficiency in the use phase. A sensitivity analysis indicates that a reduction of the electricity price in the use phase by about 40% does not alter the significant superiority of the high-end model over the low-end model. In spite of the largest amount of input in the production phase, the high-end model performs the best in terms of both global warming potential (GWP) and landfill, while the low-end model performs the worst. The use phase generates the largest amount of waste for landfill across the three models, the largest component of which is flyash generated from coal firing power plants. A possible internalization of externality in the form of carbon tax was found to work in favor of the high-end model. The cost advantage of the high-end model, however, is sensitive to the rate of discounting of future costs: discounting at 15% diminishes its advantage over the low-end model.
   Recommendation and Perspective. The results indicate the effectiveness of the pricing based on the life cycle cost for achieving sustainability, that is, for promoting the shift of the demand away from appliances with low environmental performance to the one with higher environmental performance. Acceptance by society of pricing based on life cycle costing would require, among other things, an economywide standardization of the LCC concept (in a manner analogous to ISO-LCA) that can be used complementary to ISO-LCA.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. Sustainability is a well recognised goal which is difficult to manage due to its complexity. As part of a series of sustainability management tools, a Product Sustainability Index (PSI) is translating the sustainability aspects to the organization of vehicle product development of Ford of Europe, thus allocating ownership and responsibility to that function. PSI is limiting the scope to those key environmental, social and economic characteristics of passenger vehicles that are controllable by the product development organisation.
   Materials and Methods. The PSI considers environmental, economic and social aspects based on externally reviewed life cycle environmental and cost aspects (Life Cycle Assessment, Cost of ownership / Life Cycle Costing), externally certified aspects (allergy-tested interior) and related aspects as sustainable materials, safety, mobility capability and noise. After the kick-off of their product development in 2002, the new Ford S-MAX and Ford Galaxy are serving as a pilot for this tool. These products are launched in Europe in 2006. The tracking of PSI performance has been done by engineers of the Vehicle Integration department within the product development organization. The method has been translated in an easy spreadsheet tool. Engineers have been trained within one hour trainings. The application of PSI by vehicle integration followed the principle to reduce the need for any incremental time or additional data to a minimum. PSI is adopted to the existing decision-making process. End of 2005, an internal expert conducted a Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) study for verification purposes using commercial software. This study and the PSI have been scrutinized by an external review panel according to ISO 14040 and, by taking into consideration the on-going SETAC, work in the field of LCC.
   Results. The results of the Life Cycle based indicators of PSI as calculated by non-experts are fully in line with those of the more detailed expert study. The difference is below 2%. The new Ford Galaxy and Ford S-MAX shows significantly improved performance regarding the life cycle air quality, use of sustainable materials, restricted substances and safety compared to the previous model Galaxy. The affordability (Life Cycle Cost of Ownership) has also been improved when looking at the same engine types. Looking at gasoline versus diesel options, the detailed study shows under what conditions the diesel options are environmentally preferable and less costly (mileage, fuel prices, etc.).
   Discussion. The robustness of results has been verified in various ways. Based also on Sensitivity and Monte-Carlo Analysis, case study-specific requirements have been deduced defining criteria for a significant environmental improvement between the various vehicles. Only if the differences of LCIA results between two vehicles are larger than a certain threshold are the above-mentioned results robust. Conclusions. In general terms, an approach has been implemented and externally reviewed that allows non-experts to manage key environmental, social and economic aspects in the product development, also on a vehicle level. This allows mainstream functions to take ownership of sustainability and assigns accountability to those who can really decide on changes affecting the sustainability performance. In the case of Ford S-MAX and Galaxy, indicators from all three dimensions of sustainability (environment, social and economic) have been improved compared to the old Ford Galaxy.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. Based on this positive experience, it is recommended to make, in large or multinational organizations, the core business functions directly responsible and accountable for managing their own part of environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainability. Staff functions should be limited to starting the process with methodological and training support and making sure that the contributions of the different main functions fit together.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. This paper discusses the merging of methodological aspects of two known methods into a hybrid form applied to water supply systems. Water shortages are imminent due to scarce supply and increasing demand in many parts of the world. In California, this is caused primarily by population growth. As readily available water is depleted, alternatives that may have larger energy and resource requirements and, therefore, environmental impacts must be considered. In order to develop a more environmentally responsible and sustainable water supply system, these environmental implications should be incorporated into planning decisions.
   Methods. Comprehensive accounting for environmental effects requires Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), a systematic account of resource use and environmental emissions caused by extracting raw materials, manufacturing, constructing, operating, maintaining, and decommissioning the water infrastructure. In this study, a hybrid LCA approach, combining elements of process-based and economic input-output- based LCA was used to compare three supply alternatives: importing, recycling, and desalinating water. For all three options, energy use and air emissions associated with energy generation, vehicle and equipment operation, and material production were quantified for life-cycle phases and water supply functions (supply, treatment, and distribution). The Water-Energy Sustainability Tool was developed to inform water planning decisions. It was used to evaluate the systems of a Northern and a Southern California water utility. Results and Discussion. The results showed that for the two case study utilities desalination had 2-5 times larger energy demand and caused 2-18 times more emissions than importation or recycling, due primarily to the energy-intensity of the treatment process. The operation life-cycle phase created the most energy consumption with 56% to 90% for all sources and case studies. For each water source, a different life-cycle phase dominated energy consumption. For imported water, supply contributed 56% and 86% of the results for each case study; for desalination, treatment accounted for approximately 85%; for recycled water, distribution dominated with 61% and 74% of energy use. The study calculated external costs of air pollution from all three water supply systems. These costs are borne by society, but not paid by producers. The external costs were found to be 6% of desalinated water production costs for both case studies, 8% of imported water production costs in Southern California, and 1-2% for the recycled water systems and for the Northern California utility's imported water system. Conclusion. Recycling water was found to be more energy intensive in Northern than in Southern California, but the results for imported water were similar. While the energy demand of water recycling was found to be larger than importation in Northern California, the two alternatives were competitive in Southern California. For all alternatives in both case studies, the energy consumed by system operation dominated the results, but maintenance was also found to be significant. Energy production was found to be the largest contributor in all water provision systems, followed by materials production. The assessment of external costs revealed that the environmental effects of energy and air emissions caused by infrastructure is measurable, and in some cases, significant relative to the economic cost of water. Recommendation and Perspective. This paper advocates the necessity of LCA in water planning, and discusses the applicability of the described model to water utilities.

AB The evaluation and selection of industrial projects before investment decision is customarily done using marketing, technical and financial information. Subsequently, environmental impact assessment and social impact assessment are carried out mainly to satisfy the statutory agencies. Because of stricter environment regulations in developed and developing countries, quite often impact assessment suggests alternate sites, technologies, designs, and implementation methods as mitigating measures. This causes considerable delay to complete project feasibility analysis and selection as complete analysis requires to be taken up again and again till the statutory regulatory authority approves the project. Moreover, project analysis through above process often results sub-optimal project as financial analysis may eliminate better options, as more environment friendly alternative will always be cost intensive. In this circumstance, this study proposes a decision support system, which analyses projects with respect to market, technicalities, and social and environmental impact in an integrated framework using analytic hierarchy process, a multiple-attribute decision-making technique. This not only reduces duration of project evaluation and selection, but also helps select optimal project for the organization for sustainable development. The entire methodology has been applied to a cross-country oil pipeline project in India and its effectiveness has been demonstrated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Tonle Sap water-related crisis mainly concerns governance, and at both the local and cross-boundary levels the crisis requires a more integrated and comprehensive solution than is the case at present. This paper addresses the institutional challenges of this basin from three levels: international collaborative facilitation and resource mobilization toward sustainable development of the Mekong region; national and local institutional matters; and participatory issues. The results show that new governance principles such as a holistic institutional approach and upstream downstream relationship, transparency and accountability, public participation and decentralization, gender and equity, and separation of incompatible administrative functions, etc., are much needed in the Mekong and Tonle Sap Basins. The governance should have a greater emphasis on broader policy and planning, and more strategic approaches and attention to equity, sustainability and poverty alleviation.

AB The starting point of the policy analysis of the Tonle Sap Area in Cambodia was the Mekong Agreement of 1995. It specifies three development goals for the Mekong Basin: economic growth, poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. The possibilities to find combinations of sector policies for achieving these often conflicting goals were analysed systematically using a probabilistic, Bayesian network model. Four policy scenarios were constructed, one promoting each of the three development goals separately and one integrated, compromise scenario. The results indicate that a compromise policy is possible, being radically more balanced and acceptable than any of the policies that target only one of the three goals at a time.

TI Rules, roles and rights: Gender, participation and Community Fisheries
   management in Cambodia's Tonle Sap Region
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT

DT Article
AB In the Tonle Sap Region, Community Fisheries ( CFs) have been recently constituted by the Cambodian Government to address the needs for local and sustainable management of fisheries resources. Local women are being urged to participate in these institutions by various state and nonstate programmes. However, actual social conditions and practices of people demonstrate that women are not actively involved in de facto fisheries management with its complex mosaic of rules, rights and roles. Inserting women into this programme by only addressing poverty reduction and conservation goals without recognizing actual gender/social inequalities, may inadvertently reproduce existing gender hierarchies instead of actually transforming them.

TI Ecosystem management of the Tonle Sap Lake: An integrated modelling
   approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT

DT Article
ID CAMBODIA
AB The monsoon floods of the Mekong River are a key driver of the Tonle Sap Lake ecosystem. This pulsing system together with a large floodplain, rich biodiversity and high annual sedimentation and nutrient fluxes from the Mekong makes the lake one of the most productive fresh water ecosystems in the world. The livelihoods of people living in and around the Tonle Sap are strongly dependent on the lake's natural resources. An integrated modelling system, supported with primary data collection and analysis, has been developed for the Tonle Sap to assess the impacts of planned developments on the lake's ecosystem and riparian communities. Understanding the ecosystem processes and tools for predicting the development impacts are essential for Integrated Water Resources Management, as well as for sustainable basin-wide planning, and national and regional policy-making.

TI The difficult match between a territorial policy instrument and the
   industry-centred tradition of French agricultural policies: the Land
   Management Contract (LMC)
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Between 1999 and 2002, the Land Management Contract (LMC) programme was the principal mechanism implemented by France in response to the demands of the European Rural Development Regulation. It was presented as a territorial policy instrument, at the service of sustainable development that set out to encourage the multifunctionality of agriculture. However, the mid-term evaluation of the programme revealed that its conditions of implementation did not make it possible to fully achieve these ambitions. While it may have helped to make the principle of the contractualization of subsidies more generally accepted and legitimized the notion of the environment as a criterion in the definition of agricultural policies, more often than not, the definition frameworks of these contracts were restricted to the agricultural sphere alone and their target public to the relatively limited fringe group of farmers who were already familiar with the workings of the departmental institutions in charge of agricultural development. This paper sets out to not only describe some of the limitations of this programme but also its positive repercussions. Both are important factors if we want to approach national and European agricultural policy in terms of territorialization and with due consideration for rural development issues. The LMC was the main instrument of the Agriculture Framework Law of 1999 that embodied a 'new approach to the management of public action' via a policy that 'takes into account the economic, environmental and social functions of agriculture and participates in land management with a view to sustainable development, as stipulated by the first article of the Agriculture Framework Law of 9 July 1999.

SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL

DT Article
AB Education can generate knowledge and foster a change in attitude provided that people feel individually and collectively responsible for the state of the environment. San Juan Nuevo Parangaricutiro is an internationally recognised indigenous community located in western Mexico that manages its forest sustainably through a community-based forest enterprise. However, recent research has shown that both children and young people from the community show little interest in participating in forest activities or working in forest enterprise and have a poor standard of environmental knowledge. Our research project assessed the environmental learning process of 32 high-school pupils in three settings: at school at home and in a forest enterprise. The opinions of teachers and adults of teaching subjects which focus on communal forest management were collected using various methods (questionnaires, observation and interviews) and analysed. The results show that school and home alike are important places for learning. However, environmental issues were not much addressed in the school-room or in conversations between parents and children. Furthermore, no connection between the activities of the forest enterprise and the school curriculum was found.

AB Between 2001 and 2004, with the aim of restoring the natural biodiversity of a protected area, the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) was reintroduced into the Montevecchia and Curone Valley Regional Park (northern Italy), where it had been extirpated by human persecution. The project was combined with the reduction of badger damage on railway tracks allowing at least a pair of badgers per year and to move animals whose translocation would have been anyhow imposed by precautionary measures. Four badger family groups (a total of 12 animals) were trapped and moved to an acclimatisation enclosure located in the middle of the release area. Post-release monitoring was carried out by both radio-tracking and indirect methods. The average group range size (1.58 km(2)) was similar to reports from favourable districts in Britain, supporting the contention that badgers can thrive in this area. Radio-tracked badgers selected woods, while urban areas and cultivated field were avoided. Although results indicate that the badger has actually established in the Park, with badger field signs currently spread on 40% of the protected area, more monitoring is needed to determine whether it is at sustainable levels or if more translocation should be considered.

AB Genetic diversity was analysed in a putative autochthonous brown trout (Salmo trutta fario L.) population (Monterivoso Stream, Tyrrhenian Apennine Slope) by means of seven microsatellite loci and PCR-RFLP of two mitochondrial (ND1 and 14 ND5/6) and one nuclear (LDH-C1*) locus. Monterivoso data were compared to those obtained analysing populations of the same basin (Nera River) and of the Po basin; Irish populations were used as a source of Atlantic strain brown trout. Haplotypes distributions, heterozygosity, F-statistic and UPGMA analyses indicated a genetic diversification between these populations, suggesting a widespread alteration of the genetic structure due to repeated stocking with allochthonous material, mainly of Atlantic origin, that has partially polluted the Monterivoso population. This population appeared to be constituted of Mediterranean strain samples and might represent a residue of an indigenous pool: it shows high specificity characteristics and it is genetically separate from the others observed and from populations of the Adriatic slope of the Apennines. This population should be employed in managing and breeding programmes finalised to an eco-sustainable restocking of brown trout in the Nera River Basin, with periodic monitoring by genetic analyses.

TI Charlotte-Mecklenburg successfully integrates field operations by
   managing individual and organizational strengths
SO JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB To optimize its field operations, the Charlotte-Meck-lenburg Utility Department (CMUD) merged its water distribution and wastewater collection work groups into a single division. The success of this integration began with an understanding that it is critical to have the right people-an organization's most valuable resource-in the right roles. Performance at a level of excellence is possible only when people are engaged and working in areas that suit their natural strengths. CMUD's challenge was to maximize the potential of its staff, to identify potential leadership in the organization, and to create a work environment that employees do not want to leave. The key to CMUD's success was using a strengths-based approach to build an organization that facilitates managing the organization's knowledge and resources for longterm sustainability.

AB The paper analyses the productivity of marketing cooperatives incorporating environmental inputs/outputs. In the European agriculture, expectations for attaining sustainable and competitive agriculture rely to a great extent on the cooperative sector's ability to adapt to new market conditions. These challenges have led marketing cooperatives in the fruit and vegetables sector to consider improvements in productivity and sound environmental performance. The study analyses the total factor productivity related to environmental variables in this sector using a parametric-stochastic approach and panel data on Spanish cooperatives over the period 1994-2002. Additionally, the determinants of environmental productivity are examined econometrically. The estimates obtained show an increase in efficiency for the period under study and a relationship between productivity changes and management factors, such as labour quality, capital intensity and environmental spillover.

AB Pinon (Pinus edulis)-juniper (Juniperus monosperma)-ecosystems increased substantially in the western USA during the 20th century. Sustainability of these ecosystems primarily depends on soil quality and water availability. This study was undertaken with the objective of assessing the effect of tree species on soil physical quality in a semi-arid region in the western part of Sugarite Canyon, northeast of Raton, Colfax County, NM (37 degrees 56'32"N and 104 degrees 23'00"W) USA. Three cores and three bulk soil samples were obtained from the site under the canopy of three juniper, Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) and pinon trees for 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths. These samples were analyzed for particle size distribution, soil bulk density (rho(b)), water stable aggregation (WSA), mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and stocks. Sand content was greater under juniper (48%) than oak (32%), whereas clay content followed the opposite trend. The rho(b), WSA, MWD, pH and EC were similar under juniper, pinon, oak canopies for both depths. Estimated (from Philip and Green and Ampt infiltration models) and measured water infiltration parameters did not vary among these sites and were in accord with the values for rho(b), WSA and MWD. The SOC concentrations and stocks were greater under oak (43.1 Mg ha(-1) for 0-10 and 37.5 Mg ha(-1) for 10-20 cm depths) than pinon (23.3 Mg ha(-1) for 0-10 and 18.5 Mg ha(-1) for 10-20 cm depths). The TN concentrations were greater under oak (3.4 g kg(-1)) than pinon (1.7 g kg(-1)) for the 0-10 cm depth only. Accumulation of detritus material under tree canopies reduced soil compaction and crusting caused by raindrop impact and increased SOC, and TN concentrations, and water infiltration. Coefficients of variation ranged from low to moderate for most soil properties except infiltration rate at 2.5 h, which was highly variable. Overall, soil quality for each site was good and soil aggregation, water infiltration and SOC concentrations were high, and Soil rho(b) was low. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Finance is grease to the economy. Therefore, we assume that it may affect corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the sustainability of economic development too. This paper discusses the transmission mechanisms between finance and sustainability. We find that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between financial development and sustainable development but there are various - often indirect - linkages. It appears that most of the literature concentrates on the role of public shareholders when it comes to changing corporate policy and performance in a more sustainable direction. However, this focus neglects the potential impact of the credit channel and private equity on a firm's non-financial policies and performance. These very powerful mechanisms can govern business policies and practices. Therefore, there appears to be much more scope for finance to promote socially and environmentally desirable activities and to discourage detrimental activities than has been acknowledged in the academic literature so far.

AB This paper investigates an under-researched relationship, that between corporate social performance (CSP) and geographical diversification. Drawing upon the institutional and stakeholder perspectives and utilising data on a sample of large UK firms, we develop a set of empirical models of CSP, and find evidence of a significant contemporaneous positive relationship between the two for some types of social performance and in some regions of the world. Specifically, the dispersion of activities is associated with improvements in community performance so long as operations do not extend to Eastern Europe, and with improvements in environmental performance in so far as operations extend to Western, but not Eastern, Europe. However, we find that geographical diversification has no impact on employee-related aspects of social performance, i.e. the relationship between geographical diversification and social performance varies significantly across different components of social performance. Overall, we provide evidence that firms shape their social performance strategies to their geographical profile. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The sustainability of coconut palm Cocos nucifera Linnaeus 1753 groves
   in coastal Ghana
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE coastal erosion; coconut palm Cocos nucifera; deforestation; Ghana;
   local livelihoods
AB Coconut groves have been described as important, historic resources of Ghanaian coastal agro-ecological zones. Although some recent surveys have revealed serious declines in coconut groves because of disease, woodcutting, settlement expansion, and coastal erosion, few studies document the situation of coconut groves within the larger socioenvironmental context of the Ghanaian coastal and inland agro-ecosystem. This paper uses an integrated methodology based on time series aerial photographs, ecological and GIS analysis, and age- and gender-based social surveys, to document the cultural biogeography of coconut groves in a case study of coastal Ghana. Although there is evidence of deforestation, moderate coconut conservation was also documented. It is concluded that long-term assessments, including forecasting, are possible if based on an integrated framework. This provides an effective complement for informed policy.

TI Natural and anthropic coasts: challenges for coastal management in Spain
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Beaches; coastal development; management; geomorphology; anthropic coast
AB The coastline of Spain exhibits a range of large-scale natural geomorphic features that vary according to natural dynamics, sediment supply and antecedent topography. Measurable human influence on coastal sedimentary systems of Spain has existed for several thousand years in the form of sediment supply and river regulation but the nature and scale of tourism-related development on the coast over the past fifty years has led to a situation where humans are the dominant geomorphic agent in many sedimentary coastlines. The very existence of these 'anthropic' coastal systems is dependent on continued human intervention and their near-future coastal evolution is more dependent on management decisions than natural processes. They arc used as an extension of the urban space and are regarded in a similar way to urban parks (nourishment, for example, is justified on the basis of creating recreational space). The transformation of large stretches of the coast into anthropic coastal systems implies a reliance on continuing favourable economic conditions for sustainability during normal energy conditions. Existing and ongoing urban development adjacent to such coasts, however, has increased the risk associated with future major storm or tsunami events.

ID STABILIZATION; POLICY; MODEL
AB In this paper we identify the main determinants of the exchange rate regimes in transition economies (TEs). We use an ordered logit model for the official (de jute) and the actual (de facto) exchange rate classifications and find that the de facto regimes describe better the exchange rate strategies implemented in TEs. In addition, economic size and geographical concentration of trade are important determinants of exchange rate regimes. Furthermore, consistent with the sustainability hypothesis, countries experiencing increasing inflation and having higher budget deficits favor flexible regimes. Moreover, having a more developed financial sector increases the likelihood of choosing floating exchange rates. Finally, we find that countries with stronger governments and higher political stability favor pegs. Journal of Comparative Economics 34 (3) (2006) 484-498.

TI A method to define breeding goals for sustainable dairy cattle
   production
SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE breeding objective; desired gain index; sustainability
ID SELECTION INDEXES; DERIVATION; TRAITS
AB The objective of this study was to present a method to define breeding goals for sustainable dairy cattle production by adding nonmarket values to market economic values for functional traits in the breeding goal. A nonmarket value can represent the value of improved animal welfare or societal influences for animal production. The nonmarket value for mastitis resistance, conception rate, and stillbirth were derived based on how much farmers or breeding companies were willing to lose in selection response for milk yield to improve functional traits. The desired response for milk yield corresponding to a given percent loss was obtained using desired gain indices. By allowing a 5% loss in the selection response for milk yield, the nonmarket value was found to be EURO40.4 for mastitis resistance, EURO16.1 for conception rate, and EURO-9.7 for stillbirth. The nonmarket value increased proportionally with increasing loss in the selection response for milk yield, but the selection response was lower for conception rate than for mastitis resistance because of differences in market economic value and heritability. To increase the response for conception rate, the nonmarket value was also derived for 2 situations, in which the desired responses for milk yield, mastitis resistance, and conception rate were specified. The method can be used to define breeding goals for sustainable production and to increase the response for traits that are at critically low levels. When defining breeding goals for sustainable production, breeding organizations should predict the selection response based on market economic value and add nonmarket value for traits with unacceptable selection

TI Indigenous knowledge and intellectual property: A sustainability agenda
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS

ID BIODIVERSITY; COPYRIGHT; RIGHTS
AB The paper argues that the current ways of protecting intellectual property are limited in their scope for recognizing indigenous rights to indigenous knowledge. Indigenous knowledge is often defined as being holistic and collectively owned, and an appropriate protection should allow for maintaining the cultural and physical environment that has generated it.
   After examining the failure of the patent system to recognize indigenous input (using examples from the US Patent and Trademark Office), the analysis is directed towards alternatives. The world's first case of indigenous intellectual accreditation through the partnership between Mt Romance (Australian sandalwood company), Aveda (US-based multinational cosmetics corporation) and the Kutkabubba community (represented by the Songman Circle of Wisdom), is presented. The accreditation allows for the indigenous people to be recognized as traditional owners of the land, and for their care and knowledge about the sandalwood trees. It also gives them a share of the profits made from the contemporary use of the pure sandalwood oil.
   The paper argues that sustainability, and indigenous sustainability in particular, provides a conceptual framework for a change in the way of protecting intellectual property. This implies that appropriate policies should be put in place for businesses to feel responsible towards the community.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY

AB Ecological sanitation has been shown to be economically feasible and environmentally sustainable. However, cultural factors affecting the choice of sanitation solutions have not yet been sufficiently investigated, particularly not in Muslim communities. To understand the perceptions of rural Muslim communities regarding alternative sanitation systems, members of households, key informants and women and men's focus groups in Machaki village in the district of Karak, North West Frontier Province (NWFP), were interviewed. A menu of both ecological and conventional sanitation options was put forward for consideration. All respondents were strongly opposed to the urine-separating latrines and in favor of flush toilets. They see any form of latrines as an age-old fashion, backwards and a matter of taboo, while flush toilets are considered prestigious and desirable. Muslim practices of anal cleansing together with the strict religious prohibition of contact with urine and faeces are factors influencing the reluctance towards latrines. The physical appearance of faeces and urine in latrines is repulsive to people. However, the material is less objectionable once it has disappeared in water and relocated to a treatment site. The rural community showed interest in the construction of improved sanitation consisting of flush toilets and an underground sewerage system and recycling of plant nutrients from urine and faeces through treatment in constructed wetlands. The study underlines the importance of incorporating cultural preferences in the planning of improved sanitation, particularly when designing low-cost ecological systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ID COVER
AB The study forms an example on monitoring and understanding urban dynamics by using remotely sensed data. The selected region is a rapidly urbanizing district of the mega city Istanbul, Gaziosmanpasa, whose population has almost doubled between years 1990 and 2000. The significance of this district besides its urban sprawl is that 61% of its land lies within the boundaries of an important drinking water reservoir watershed of the mega city, the Alibeykoy Reservoir. The land-use/cover changes that has occurred in the years of 1987 and 2001 are analyzed by utilizing a variety of data sources including satellite images (Landsat TM image of September 1987 and Landsat ETM+ image of May 2001), aerial photographs, orthophoto maps, standard 1:25000 scale topographic maps, and various thematic maps together with ground survey. Land-use changes are analyzed on the basis of protection zones of the reservoir watershed and the conversion of bare land and forests to settlements are clearly observed despite the national regulation on watershed protection. The decline of forests within the protection zones was from 69% to 63.6% whereas the increase in settlements was from 0.8% to 3.9%. The associated impact of establishing new residential sites with insufficient infrastructure is then linked with the water quality of the reservoir that has already reached to Class III characteristics regarding the recently revised national legislation stating that any class exceeding Class II cannot be used as a drinking water supply that in turn, had consequences on regulating the water services such as upgrading the existing water treatment plant. The paper aims to help the managers, decision-makers and urban planners by informing them of the past and current land-use/cover changes, to influence the cessation of illegal urbanization through suitable decision-making and environmental policy that adhere to sustainable resource use.

ID REGIONALISM
AB European Union (EU) policy-makers use the single European market as a model for extending the global trade liberalization agenda, specifically to encompass flanking issues ranging from environmental sustainability to labour market regulation to social protection. They thus seek to transform the traditional multilateral trade liberalization agenda into a more comprehensive framework for global economic integration. The problem is that the single market has succeeded primarily insofar as it is European and not global in scope. Although multilateral negotiations have reduced tariffs and quotas, they are much less successful at embracing a wider agenda. Three conclusions are suggested: global trade liberalization should focus on a shallow agenda of economic issues; any `deeper' pattern encompassing labour market, social, and environmental concerns is more likely to succeed at the regional level (or in bilateral agreements); and the challenge for the future is to resolve disputes between national, bilateral, and regional institutions perhaps best through the World Trade Organization (WTO).

AB Food composition provides an important link for biodiversity and nutrition. Biodiversity at three levels-ecosystems, the species they contain and the genetic diversity within species-can contribute to food security and improved nutrition. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) are leading a new international initiative on biodiversity for food and nutrition under the umbrella of the Convention of Biological Diversity. The overall aim is to promote the sustainable use of biodiversity in programmes contributing to food security and human nutrition, and to thereby raise awareness of the importance of this link for sustainable development. Further research is needed to increase the evidence base by filling our knowledge gaps with better inventories and more data on composition and consumption. If nutrient analysis and data dissemination of the various food species and intra-species diversity are systematically undertaken, national information systems for food and agriculture will be strengthened and can be used to form the basis for priority setting and national policy making. For nutrition, this will mean introducing more compositional data on biodiversity in national food composition databases and tables; developing and using dietary assessment instruments that capture food intake at the species and variety/breed level; and allowing food labelling that encourages awareness of food plant varieties and food animal subspecies. Nutrition and biodiversity feature directly the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): halve the proportion of people who suffer from hunger; and ensure environmental sustainability. In combination. a nutrition and biodiversity initiative provides the very foundation for achieving these MDGs. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI DESIGN STRATEGIES FOR GREEN PRACTICE
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB INTRODUCTION
   Should green buildings not only work differently, but also look, feel, and be conceived differently? The emergence of LEED accreditation as the leading form of environmental performance monitoring and its associated points and checklist format can mask the necessity for architectural projects to have focused and effective design strategies that integrate sustainability with the design process. Green accountability does not always go hand in hand with architectural quality: a good building is certainly not necessarily a green building, while a green building is not always a good work of architecture. So it becomes important to recognize the unique character and possibilities in each project and then to develop environmentally responsive concepts that support and enhance the form of the architecture. This article discusses the current context for "Green Design Practice" through a series of quite different design assignments where the focus is upon enabling the design to emerge from the recognition of the "environmental and sustainability potential.".

TI THE AVENUE OF IDEAS: A SUSTAINABLE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING EXPERIMENT
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB INTRODUCTION
   The metropolitan area of Tucson, Arizona is a repository of traditions for dwelling in extreme conditions, as well as an incubator for new ideas about desert architecture. It is also a place with a long history of poverty and struggle for existence against harsh natural elements.
   With these conditions in mind, the City of Tucson partnered with five non-profit housing providers to build on one avenue an array of affordable housing prototypes that demonstrate to the public a variety of building systems that work to stabilize interiors from the diurnal temperature swings through insulation or thermal mass. Beginning in 1997, local non-profit housing providers designed and constructed sixteen residences representing five different methods of building low cost housing that comfortably mitigates the summer heat and winter chill. The last of the residences was completed in 2003; all are currently inhabited and in constant use. This article proposes a comparison of the environmental control strategies, building methods, costs, and energy usage of the five different systems as they were brought to fruition in the sixteen residences.
   Included in the construction methods are: insulated concrete block, foam blocks with concrete-filled cavities, light-gauge steel framing with foam block infill panels, straw bales, and rammed earth. The first four types use insulation as the means of stabilizing interior comforts while the last method relies upon thermal mass. The residences each enclose between 1000 and 1150 square feet of conditioned space and have similar solar orientations. Additionally, each of the homes was inspected during construction by the Tucson Electric Power Company and is guaranteed to provide comfort at a specific monthly cost. The site planning for the sixteen parcels conserves a natural drainage swale as an unbuildable area and promotes roof water collection and retention. A plant survey identified significant native species, which were tagged and protected during construction.
   Platted as a sixteen-parcel subdivision, this avenue of experimental residences aims to demonstrate to the citizens of a rapidly growing metropolis some of the possibilities for living within their means while adhering to an ethical stance regarding the local and global environment.

TI HUNZINGER CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LEED CI REMODEL: GREEN THROUGH THE EYES
   OF THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB INTRODUCTION
   Leadership takes on many forms in an industry as challenging as construction. For more than 20 years, Hunzinger Construction Company conducts an annual strategic planning process whereby we take a hard look at our industry and develop tactical initiatives designed to challenge the status quo and be responsive to the ever-changing environment in which we conduct our business. Significant outcomes from this process have been (a) the development of a Total Quality Management process and commitment (Q(3)) where we engage our clients, specialty subcontractors/vendors/suppliers, and employees in the culture of quality awareness in every aspect of our project delivery systems, (b) the development and funding of Hunzinger Construction University (HCU) with the goal of providing continuous improvement of the skills of our people to make us a better company, and (c) researching emerging markets that we believe are key to the success and growth of our company.
   Additionally, we participate in a national PEER Review Group that provides quarterly sessions with eight similar non-competing firms from every corner of the nation. Given the breadth of the participating firms and the depth to which the process delves into bow each firm conducts itself in its respective marketplace, this PEER group activity stands out as one of the strongest drivers of our continued success and growth. This prestigious group, made up of the President/CEOs of each of the participating firms, spends a great deal of time discussing trends in the industry and looks for meaningful ways that each can react to changing trends and remain on the leading edge of new developments. It was from this forum that the subject of green building came to light and Hunzinger Construction Company embarked on a commitment to internally challenging our culture to be true to the precepts of sustainable design and construction as we moved into our second century. We saw this as yet another success driver and an ability to continue to differentiate ourselves in a very competitive marketplace, while responding to the ever-growing trend of green building.
   We began our journey by becoming a corporate member of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and the Wisconsin Green Building Alliance. Once these were in place, we hosted a USGBC Workshop in September 2004 to introduce the concept not only to staff members, but also extended the invitation to our Q3 partners, as well as the design and engineering community. The workshop was sponsored by HCU and was conducted by a USGBC trainer. Our goal was to provide a proper kick-off to our commitment, position us favorably in the marketplace, and begin to educate our team on the importance of sustainable design and construction.
   As a follow-up to the initial HCU event, President John C Hunzinger and Executive Vice President James R. Hunzinger challenged all of our professional staff to obtain LEED Accredited Professional status. To achieve this goal, HCU sponsored company-wide training activities and study groups to insure that our people were well versed and prepared to pass the professional examination. To date, more than 65% of our professional staff has achieved LEED AP credentials, and we have over 20 additional LEED trained professionals among our ranks that are available to our clients for consultation in the early stages of project development.

   Making an evaluation and selection of alternative building designs is a critical issue facing many organizations. The selection of greener building designs is an important aspect of this process. Making the wrong choice can prove to he very costly as organizations try to uncover a designs potential for success from an economic and sustainable perspective. Recently, the issue of green construction and building design has grown in interest. However, the topic of sustainable building design selection remains an area of lesser investigation that has not seen much progress in the field of sustainable building design. The purpose of this article is to help organizations more effectively select and evaluate the relative sustainability of building designs using a multi-criteria decision model the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) that has been applied to many areas of managerial decision making. More specifically, we structure a decision hierarchy for alternative sustainable building design selection based on the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System(tm) requirements and making a business case for selection of a specific design. We provide an illustrative application that can be implemented as part of a larger research and design decision support system.
   We will now present some background on the discussion of organizational decision making and making business cases.

TI BUILDING DESIGN STRATEGIES AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO ENERGY PERFORMANCE
   FOR LEED CERTIFICATION
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB INTRODUCTION
   Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a national set of standards put forth by the U. S. Green Building Council in 1994 that was intended to inspire building designers to plan greener, more sustainable buildings. LEED offers up to ten points for improved energy optimization performance. It should be noted that achieving these ten points is time consuming, complex, and expensive. This research is a case study that details the process of using a computer simulation study as a building energy optimizing tool in order to achieve these optional points. Determination is made as to how many LEED points can be obtained when basic strategies such as window performance and daylighting are integrated into one energy optimized building design. The results show that well-established energy conservation methods achieve as few as two or three LEED energy points, thereby possibly offering a disincentive for designers to attempt this difficult challenge. These fundamental efforts to achieve energy optimized building design are the first steps toward high performance building design and offer a fundamental solution to the substantial, negative environmental impacts caused by buildings today.

TI PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THREE DIFFERENT FACADE MODELS FOR SUSTAINABLE
   OFFICE BUILDINGS
SO JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development issues are currently the driving forces of many building projects. The building facade is critical for the architectural expression and has a large affect upon large parts of the buildings environmental performance. This study investigates the advantages of using multidimensional computer aided modeling and simulation to produce a sustainable facade design. A first step towards green building design is to establish a list of parameters which can then be used as design criteria, e.g. en viron mental performance, thermal visual and acoustic comfort, etc. Computer simulation and an analysis of recent projects in Hong Kong can help to determine the performance according to these design parameters whilst environmental impacts due to energy consumption are considered to be an important design parameter, it is also important for comfort criteria to be considered.

DE LEED; high Volume fly ash concrete; green engineering
AB Although fly-ash as a partial replacement for cement has been utilized for many years, its use has been almost exclusively used in low volume percentages such as 10% or 20% cement replacement. This paper looks at high volume percentage replacements from 40% to 70%. A mini-mix study revealed that 50% and 60% cement replacement percentages were the best candidates for full scale testing. The environmental benefits included a 25% reduction in smog, human health, and fossil fuel reduction compared to the same element built with 100% Portland cement mix. The economic benefits included a 15% capital cost reduction and a 20% life-cycle cost reduction when compared with a 100% Portland cement mix. Full scale testing included a complete mix design in addition to the construction of four concrete infrastructure products. The products built included an alley panel and curb and gutter sections in the City and county of Denver, a precast manhole and lid, and a twin tee prestressed girder. Although cement products are just one of many materials used in the construction of the built environment, its production has a large impact on the environment. Lowering the embodied energy of multiple types of construction materials will have a significant effect on sustainable urban development. Symbiotic recycling of waste material, such as fly ash in concrete, back into the built environment can help reduce materials on the input side and pollution on the output side of the hulk material flow of an urban city.(4)

DT Article
DE LEED; sustainability; green building; unintended consequences
AB Unintended consequences invariably accompany regulations and standards. This study examined whether the LEED rating system creates any negative inadvertent environmental effects and, if so, what they are. In effect, can doing something that is not sustainable ever help a project get a higher score? The research tool consisted of semi-structured interviews with construction management personnel responsible for the LEED aspects of projects. The study looked at specific LEED certified projects around the southeastern United States. These interviews gathered project specific information about the company responsible for building, the interviewees experience and views, and the general project. Most importantly, the interviews collected data on any instances of negative unintended environmental effects. Of the 16 projects considered, two included cases of unintended effects. Both cases resulted from situations in which the project location made the otherwise beneficial LEED requirement inappropriate. The study recommends ways to help prevent other similar instances of negative unintended effects. Ultimately, sustainability is best advanced by using LEED certification as an aid not an objective in the journey towards environmentally friendly buildings.

AB This article presents an account of global resource extraction for the year 1999 by material groups, world regions, and development status. The account is based on materials flow analysis methodology and provides benchmark information for political strategies toward sustainable resource management. It shows that currently around 50 thousand megatons of resources are extracted yearly on a global scale, which results in a yearly global average resource use of around 8 tonnes per capita. Assuming further growth in world regions not yet close to the levels of resource use in the industrial cores-such as India or China-numbers could easily double once these parts of the world come to fully incorporate the industrial mode of production and consumption. This article contributes to information on resource use indicators, complementing and enriching information from economic accounting in order to facilitate political measures toward a sustainable use of resources.

AB This article presents an assessment of energy inputs of the European Union (the 15 countries before the 2004 enlargement, abbreviated EU-15) for the period 1970-2001 and the United States for 1980-2000. The data are based on an energy flow analysis (EFA) that evaluates socioeconomic energy flows in a way that is conceptually consistent with current materials flow analysis (MFA) methods. EFA allows assessment of the total amount of energy required by a national economy; it yields measures of the size of economic systems in biophysical units. In contrast to conventional energy balances, which only include technically used energy, EFA also accounts for socioeconomic inputs of biomass; that is, it also considers food, feed, wood and other materials of biological origin. The energy flow accounts presented in this article do not include embodied energy. Energy flow analyses are relevant for comparisons across modes of subsistence (e.g., agrarian and industrial society) and also to detect interrelations between energy utilization and land use. In the EU-15, domestic energy consumption (DEC = apparent consumption = domestic extraction plus import minus export) grew from 60 exajoules per year (I Ej = 10(18) J) in 1970 to 79 Ej/yr in 2001, thus exceeding its territory's net primary production (NPP, a measure of the energy throughput of ecosystems). In the United States, DEC increased from 102 Ej/yr in 1980 to 125 Ej/yr in 2000 and was thus slightly smaller than its NPP Taken together, the EU-15 and the United States accounted for about 38% of global technical energy use, 3 1 % of humanity's energetic metabolism, but only 10% of global terrestrial NPP and I I % of world population in the early 1990s. Per capita DEC of the United States is more than twice that of the EU-15. Calculated according to EFA methods, energy input in the EU and the United States was between and one-third above the corresponding value reported in one-fifth. conventional energy balances. The article discusses implications of these results for sustainability, as well as future research needs.

AB In this paper, we re-examine the long-run sustainability of budget deficits, when fiscal policy is conducted as a non-linear process. Our empirical methodology makes use of recent developments on threshold cointegration that consider the possibility of a non-linear relationship between government expenditures and revenues. The analysis is applied to the case of Spain, a country that has recently accomplished an important fiscal consolidation. Overall, our results suggest the presence of significant non-linear effects in Spanish fiscal policy, so that fiscal authorities would cut deficits only if they are 'large', which would assure in turn their long-run sustainability.

AB This work is part of a wide study related to the structural behavior of concretes prepared by substituting natural aggregates with recycled aggregates from building demolition. In this work, recycled aggregates coming from an industrial crushing plant in which rubble are suitably treated were employed in substitution of ordinary aggregates. In order to evaluate the real-scale behavior of reinforced recycled-aggregate concrete, several beam-column joints were manufactured, then cured in open air at a temperature of approximately 20 degrees C in order to simulate the real conditions of the building site. Subsequently, they were submitted to low-cycle loading, characterized by a load history containing few cycles but having a large range of bond reversal stresses in order to simulate real structures subjected to earthquake or high winds. In this way, the ductility of joints, made of either ordinary or recycled-aggregate reinforced concrete, could be investigated and compared. The results gave experimental evidence of the suitability of recycled-aggregate concrete for structural use, although some measures in the structural design of the joint should be taken.

AB This artcile describes the results obtained from a tick survey conducted in Haller park along the Kenyan coastline. The survey aimed at evaluating tick-host associations, assessing tick population density, and providing baseline information for planning future tick control and management in the park. Ticks (2,968) were collected by handpicking from eight species of wildlife and by dragging in 14 selected sites within the park. A considerable proportion of ticks were also collected from leaves, stems, and bark of most dominant trees, namely, Casuarina equisetifolia L. (Forst. & Forst.), Cocos nucifera L., Adansonia digitata L., Musa paradisiaca L., and Azadiracta indica Adr. Juss. Dragging was conducted in sites predominantly occupied by Cynodon dactylon L. (Pers.), Cenchrus ciliaris L., Stenotaphrum dimidiatum L. (Kuntze.) Brongn., and Brachiaria xantholeuca Hack. Ex Schinz Stapf. and Loudetia kagerensis K. Sebum. Hutch. Eight tick species were identified, and the collection included Rhipicephalus pravus Donitz 1910, Rhipicephalus pulchellus Gerstacker 1873, Hyalomma marginatum rufipes Koch 1844, Amblyomma gemma Donitz 1910, Amblyomma hebraeum Koch 1844, Amblyomma sparsum Neumann 1899, Amblyomma nuttalli Donitz 1909, and Boophilus decoloratus Koch 1844. Given that the identified tick species are known to parasitize humans as well as livestock, there exist risks of emergence of zoonotic infections mediated by tick vectors. In the recreational environment of Haller park, where tick vectors share habitats with hosts, there is a need to develop sustainable and effective tick control and management strategies to minimize economic losses that tick infestation may cause.

AB Operation at sub-critical fluxes can be used to control membrane fouling. The original definition of the critical flux stated that operation was sub-critical if no or negligible fouling occurred. Over time there has been a relaxing of the criteria and many now consider a low rather than zero rate of fouling to be indicative of sub-critical operation especially when dealing with complex feeds. Here the region of low fouling is termed "nominally sub-critical". Unwashed yeast, washed yeast and extra polymeric substance (EPS) suspensions were filtered at controlled fluxes to investigate the role of cells and soluble components in nominally sub-critical conditions using ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF) membranes. As the UF membrane could not be effectively cleaned it was not used in the later part of the study. Tracking of membrane resistance, R*(m) of the 0.2 mu m M membranes was continued through the whole study. After the initial increase, R*(m) rises very slowly, increasing on average only 0.4% after each experiment and cleaning cycle. For the MF membranes, the rate of fouling increased with increasing feed concentration, increasing membrane pore size and decreasing shear stress. The effect of increasing shear stress was to reduce the amount of reversible fouling but the irreversible component was invariant with shear stress for the range studied. Also the rate and reversibility of fouling were found to be sensitive to changes in pH. The sum of the rates of transmembrane pressure (TMP) rise for washed yeast cells and EPS suspensions were in all cases found to be lower than that for unwashed yeast. The origin of the additional resistance is discussed and other relevant literature reviewed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As part of a research project focusing on the development of a sustainable biocatalytic process for production of chiral secondary alcohols, the pervaporative separation of ethanol from ethanol/ethyl acetate/1-methoxy-2-propanol/1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate-mixtures through a commercial PVA-based membrane was investigated. Separation behavior of this mixture was studied in a range of mol fractions (10-70%), temperatures relevant for biocatalytic conversions (35-55 degrees C) and downstream pressures (35-200 mbar).
   Pervaporation of the non-diluted multicomponent mixture was shown to be strongly influenced by interactions between the permeants and the membrane. Investigation of these interactions contributed to the understanding of the mass transport mechanism of this mixture. Overall, high fluxes were obtained, but small differences between the fastest permeating species were found. The fastest permeating species was ethanol, ethyl acetate or 1-methoxy-2-propanol depending on the feed composition. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potency of the inducers of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), acibenzolar-s-methyl, DL-alpha-amino-n-butyric acid (AABA), DL-beta-amino-n-butyric acid (BABA), gamma-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA), p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), riboflavin, and salicylic acid (SA), in reducing reproduction of Meloidogyne javanica and Rotylenchulus reniforms in pineapple was investigated. All inducers were applied as foliar sprays to 1-mon-old pineapple plants (20 ml/plant) grown in 22-cm-diam. pots in the greenhouse. Two days after application, 10,000 eggs of M. javanica or R. reniformis were inoculated onto the plants. Six months after inoculation, nematode reproduction was measured. Acibenzolar decreased R. renformis egg production by 58% compared to the nontreated control (P <= 0.05). Acibenzolar, BABA, and riboflavin reduced M. javanica egg production by 60% to 64% compared to the nontreated control (P: 0.05). The point in the pineapple SAR pathway that each compound activates may explain the differing results between M. javanica and its giant cells and R. renformis and its syncytia. Foliar application of acibenzolar at 100 and 200 mg/liter decreased by 30% and 60%, respectively, the number of M. javanica eggs as compared to the nontreated control. Fresh shoot weight of pineapple treated with 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/liter acibenzolar was reduced by 1.2%, 3.3%, 9.9%, and 33% compared to the nontreated pineapple, respectively (P: 0.05). Foliar application of acibenzolar may activate intrinsic resistance of pineapple to M. javanica and R. reniformis and may have a role in the sustainable management of nematodes in pineapple.

AB Increasingly, manufacturers are making radical changes in management practices and investing heavily in advanced technologies as they attempt to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Organizations seeking to implement these changes should have an internal environment that emphasizes knowledge assimilation and sharing and creates continuous learning capability, i.e., absorptive capacity. This study reviews the construct of absorptive capacity, develops a valid and reliable instrument to measure it, and examines its impact on the organization's ability to assimilate innovative manufacturing technology and management practice. To illustrate the links, this study tests the relationships among absorptive capacity, time-based manufacturing practices, and value to customer. Structural equation modeling, applied to a relatively large sample (n = 303), indicates strong, positive, and direct relationships between absorptive capacity and time-based manufacturing practices, and between time-based manufacturing practices and value to customer. The managerial implications of these empirical findings are also discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable development came onto the American planning scene with a flourish in the 1990s. It was hailed as the new planning paradigm, and cases began appearing in the literature that highlighted communities making progress toward sustainability. Noticeably absent from the literature, however, has been an examination of whether the concept is resonating across the rest of the country, and if so, how. This study attempts to address that deficiency through a survey of planning directors across municipalities and counties in Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. Findings of the study indicate that a general familiarity with the concept of sustainable development exists but that it has not been accepted as a new or different standard for planning practice.

AB The paper shows that the increase in the US current account deficit since 1997 was financed by Emerging Market economies, EMs. Since 2001 a large share of the funding was carried out by the official sector, taking mostly the form of accumulation of international reserves. The paper argues that (1) if official funding is stopped or reversed, the private sector in EMs is likely to provide offsetting funds, preventing the US to go through a Sudden Stop episode; and (2) in the unlikely event that global saving collapses, the brunt of the adjustment is likely to be borne by EMs, e.g., through Sudden Stops, and flight to quality likely to ensure the US a smooth transition, i.e., a soft landing.

AB In this paper I review four perspectives on global imbalances: the standard analysis questioning their sustainability and three views skeptical of this conventional wisdom. I raise questions about the internal consistency, conformance with the facts, and predictive content of each of the arguments challenging the mainstream analysis of U.S. current account sustainability. Moreover, I show that several of these objections to standard sustainability arithmetic are incompatible with one another. (c) 2006 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

DE sustainability of US current account; dollar depreciation; international
   monetary system; US economic hegemony
AB The American twin deficits are back. One obvious cost is a possible hard landing. A less obvious possibility is that imperial overstretch could eventually cost the US its global hegemony. This paper addresses many challenges to the twin deficits view that have been offered: the Starve the Beast rationale for the budget deficit, the straw-man question of whether the budget and current account deficits are always twins, the wishful thinking that the US has an investment boom, the correct point that private saving is low as well as public saving, the claim of a global savings glut, the observation that global financial markets are big, the hope that valuation effects or unmeasured services as world banker will allow Americans to continue the exorbitant privilege of consuming at others' expense indefinitely, and the proposition that China will happily buy dollars indefinitely. When all novel viewpoints are considered, one is still left with the reality of an unsustainable path of high budget deficits, low national saving, and high current account deficits.

AB True collaboration among large federal agencies is rare, as is that among large and influential national foundations. The collaboration between two major government health agencies (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Resources and Services Administration) and three major health foundations (the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the CDC Foundation) to create the Management Academy for Public Health is unprecedented in public health over the past quarter century. We attribute this success to the unique combination of a strong foundation of relationships between the partners and a commitment to generative dialogue throughout the design and implementation of the program, The success and sustainability of the Academy derive directly from these critical success factors, serving as an exemplary model for future collaborative endeavors.

ID DEPRESSION; COSTS
AB The need for behavioral healthcare for the poor and indigent is well documented in rural North Carolina, and integrated behavioral healthcare-that is, mental health screening and treatment offered as part of primary care services-has proven a very. effective and efficient method to improve patients' health. In 2000, the Buncombe County Health Center (BCHC) began a grant-funded program treating depressed patients in its public health clinics and school health programs. The Health Center used the opportunity to send a team to the Management Academy for Public Health to learn business principles that could be applied to the-challenge of sustaining this program as part of its ongoing public health service delivery for the county. Using their business plan from the Management Academy, the BCHC sought funding from various stakeholders, and, through their support, was able to institute a fully integrated behavioral health program in 2004. The BCHC has now joined forces with other partners in the state to address statewide policy changes in support of such programs. These efforts are an example of how, a community health center can apply entrepreneurial thinking and strategic business planning to improve healthcare and effect wide-ranging change.

AB Peer Power is an innovative school-based program that trains high school students as health educators and mentors for middle school students. The program was designed to produce positive health behavior changes in youth and reduce long-term incidence of chronic diseases of the heart and lung. This program, developed at the Management Academy for Public Health, has been successful in receiving grant funds and has demonstrated positive behavioral changes in youth in the areas of physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco use. Peer Power has far exceeded the anticipated outcomes and proven to be a catalyst for improved health behaviors throughout the community. Positive unintended consequences of Peer Power include the development of an effective social marketing campaign, reduction in tobacco sales to minors, and an increase in smoke-free restaurants in Dare County. Benefits received by Management Academy participants are evident through improved business and administrative skills at the Dare County Department of Public Health, the number of new and innovative programs that have succeeded in securing grant funds, and the sustainability of the programs developed.

TI Tracking farmland conversion and fragmentation using tax parcel data

LA English
DT Article
DE differential use taxation; farmland conversion; fragmentation; land use
   change
ID AGRICULTURAL LAND; OPEN SPACE; EXTERNALITIES; PRESERVATION
AB Analyses of farmland conversion typically rely on data that has been aggregated to a county level. However, the pattern of farmland conversion at the individual parcel level could have important implications for the sustainability of agricultural operations within a limited geographic area. This paper uses data on farm parcels that have withdrawn from Tennessee's differential assessment program to track farmland conversion at the individual tax parcel level for a single east Tennessee county. The pattern and pace of farmland conversion is described over an 18-year period and a metric from the habitat fragmentation literature-edge density-is used to quantify the extent to which this conversion has increased the fragmentation of the county's remaining agricultural lands. Edge density, as used in this paper, provides a relative measure of the extent of the interface between agriculture and other land uses. The results suggest that agricultural lands became more fragmented every year for which data was available, although the extent of this increase varied substantially from one year to the next. More specifically, while conversion to residential use increased fragmentation, conversion to both commercial and industrial uses tended to decrease fragmentation. The data and methodologies employed in this paper, although relatively new to the farmland conversion literature, could prove to be valuable tools in analyzing the conversion of agricultural lands and in designing policies to ameliorate the adverse effects of such conversion.

ID WASTE
AB This study applies the material flow analysis (MFA) of Cadmium to evaluate municipal solid waste (MSW) management policy in Taiwan.
   In 2002, the Cd flow in Taiwan was approximately 441.2 tons, mainly contributed by the Cd in nickel-cadmium batteries (60.15%) and plastics (33.45%). 415.6 tons of Cd entered the MSW treatment system from consumers. However, aside from the Cd emitted into the atmosphere (0.4 tons) and the Cd in incinerator ash (15.1 tons), the recycled Cd was 5.2 tons, representing a recycling rate of 1.2%. Moreover, instead of being effectively used, the recycled Cd is often casually deposited in the environment. Currently, Taiwan's Cd MFA data indicates that the MSW treatment is mainly performed by incineration, which does not conform to the main principles of sustainable development. To achieve a more sustainable policy, recycling and/or restriction of nickel-cadmium batteries and plastics turn out to be important issues.

AB A 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetate ([EtMeIM][TA]) ionic liquid was investigated as an inner solvent for ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) actuators reinforced with multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The ionic liquid has a higher ion conductivity, a lower viscosity, and a wide electrochemical window compared to most organic solvents. The surface of the MWCNT was modified with an acid mixture to facilitate its homogeneous dispersion in a nanocomposite. The ion conductivity of the IPMC increased with the MWCNT loading. In a dry actuation, the sustainability of deformation under a DC potential and the durability of the IPMCs containing an ionic liquid were significantly improved compared to conventional IPMCs with water. In particular, the MWCNT nanocomposite IPMC displayed a larger displacement under a high frequency.

ID FICUS-INDICA; SHEEP
AB The cultivation of cactus pear requires low input and is therefore conducive to a sustainable system that will increase the efficiency and economic viability of the small and medium-sized farms of low-income farmers. The aim of this study was to determine fruit and plant characteristics of the 10 most commonly grown cactus pear cultivars in South Africa under rain-fed, subtropical conditions. Skinners Court favoured vegetative growth. The fruit of Gymno Carpo had below average total soluble sugars. Roedtan had high cladode yield, while producing fruit of good quality, especially high total soluble sugar values, and quantity. Turpin and Meyers proved to have the highest fruit yield, fruit mass, cladode yield and number of cladodes pruned per plant. These cultivars can therefore be planted for both fruit production and for harvesting of cladodes for animal feed. (c) 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI Analyzing the impacts of microscale urban attributes on travel: Evidence
   from suburban Adelaide, Australia
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT-ASCE

DT Article
ID LAND-USE; CHOICE; MODE; AREA
AB Metropolitan Adelaide in Australia is dominated by low-density suburbs with an extensive and large road supply, which brings with it car-dependent lifestyles that are ultimately unsustainable in the longer term. Changes are needed to make a city such as Adelaide less car-dependent toward a city that relies on more sustainable transport modes for its day to day urban travel needs. This paper presents the results from a comparative study of travel patterns among residents of four suburban residential areas in metropolitan Adelaide. Using existing datasets together with inventory data of urban environment characteristics from original fieldwork, this paper examines to what extent there are associations between various attributes of a particular urban location as they relate to travel behavior and household socio-economics. The findings derived from multinomial logit models show that suburban development pattern and design attributes can potentially create shifts in transport modal split suggesting that microscale urban features should be given more attention in transport policy making.

   Colombia, and Ghana
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB While there is no standard definition for sustainable transportation, several adopted definitions reflect that a sustainable transportation system should be effective and efficient in providing safe and equitable access to basic economic and social services, promote economic development and support environmental integrity. Critical priorities, standards, and constraints for attaining sustainable transportation may be different, however, in different countries depending on prevailing socioeconomic conditions and political and administrative institutions. This study develops four case studies to characterize some of the major transportation system sustainability issues in developed and developing economies. The cases demonstrate that while transportation sustainability issues revolve around similar issues, the actual process of identifying and addressing pertinent issues to promote transportation system sustainability may involve widely different priorities and constraints that should influence how standards are developed to promote successful movement toward sustainability in the international community.

DT Article
AB The US Agency for International Development (USAID) works within the overall purpose of US foreign assistance to improve the lives of the citizens of the developing world. Through partnerships with other agencies, organizations, and governments, and using its field offices around the world, USAID strives to develop local capacity and thus build sustainable development. Two specific USAID programs pertinent to veterinary medicine are global health and agriculture. In the area of global health, veterinarians can aid USAID's work to improve the quality, availability, and use of essential health services that specifically target maternal and child health, HIV/AIDS, family planning and reproductive health, infectious diseases, environmental health, nutrition, and other life-saving areas. The challenge of making the agricultural sector in a developing country more productive is a critical one for USAID and a clear area for input from the veterinary profession. Animal agriculture is the largest single sector of agricultural economies in most developing countries, and livestock remains a critical component of poverty alleviation. There are educational requirements that benefit anyone working at USAID and can be met prior to admittance to a DVM program, as part of a DVM curriculum, or in post-graduate training/employment, such as proficiency in a foreign language; environmental sciences background; familiarity with accounting and management techniques; expertise in foreign animal diseases, zoonotic diseases, epidemiology, food safety, and nutrition, as well as the application to human health of those areas; an advanced degree such as an MPH; and management experience. Appropriately trained veterinarians can make enormous contributions to USAID's global efforts to improve the health and agriculture sectors of developing nations.

AB Providing a sustainable and improved water service to the increasing urban population across the developing world remains one of the biggest challenges towards meeting the water target set out in the millennium development goals. increasingly, the application of marketing principles to water services is being promoted as an essential requirement for providing a sustainable water service. in this study, the theory of reasoned action was employed in examining the factors that underpin the behaviour of the urban poor towards paying for improved water services. The findings show that both perceived social pressure and household's attitude have similar importance in predicting and explaining households' intention to pay for improved water services. Concern for a more comfortable life was the most important predictor of households' attitude, while "the family" was the most important referent group. The major determinants of households' intention to pay for improved water services were the reliability of the service and the time of supply. The study showed that there is scope for marketing improved water services using a social marketing approach. However, focusing on hygiene-related benefits is unlikely to have a significant influence on the urban poor's intention to pay for improved water services.

ID WOLVES; GUJARAT; PARK
AB The Indian gray wolf Canis lupus pallipes is the major large carnivore in the plains of Karnataka, India. We carried out a study on its distribution and status from November 2001 to July 2004. We estimated 555 wolves occupying about 123 330 km(2) of the state. In the past 40 years, wolves have disappeared from the southern plateau from an area of about 31 801 km(2). Their distribution is now largely restricted to the north-eastern dry plains. The wolf has also disappeared in recent years from some 'protected areas' such as Melkote Temple Wildlife Sanctuary, and their present population is largely found in 'non-protected' areas. Blackbucks are the only natural prey of wolves in Karnataka, but their density in most parts of the state is extremely low. The major prey species is domestic livestock, especially sheep. The available 'remote area' (forests or rocky terrains) in the wolf-occupied regions determined the status of the wolf. Killing of adult wolves and pups was common throughout the range of the wolf. However, such killings were made largely by local sheepherders with small sheep holdings and not by nomadic shepherds who maintained large sheep herds. The forests in the north-eastern parts of the state exist in small patches every few kilometers. Because each wolf pack ranges over large distances and is by and large a commensal species, we propose that the management of these small forest patches, considering them as components of a larger landscape, is the only effective conservation practice for the wolf. Although existing locally in low densities, because of a large ranging area of a single pack, the seemingly isolated wolf packs can become parts of a large metapopulation, providing a sustainable population.

AB Bathymetric survey and physico-chemical analysis of Mansar Lake, located in the Himalayan foothills in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, India, were carried out to assess water quantity and quality. The bathymetric survey indicated that Mansar Lake, with a surface area of 0.59 x 10(6) m(2) at present outflow level, has a maximum depth, length and width of 38.25 m, 1204 m and 645 m, respectively. The lake mean width is 490 m, mean depth is 21 m, and mean slope of the lake floor is 0.14 m(.)m(-1). The storage capacity of the lake up to present outflow level is 11.57 x 10(6) m(3). Vertical variation of temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, hardness and alkalinity suggest that Mansar Lake undergoes complete mixing during January and February and is stratified in other months. Calcium, magnesium and sodium are the dominant cations, and bicarbonate the dominant anion. Analysis of chemical parameters shows that the lake water is of`Ca-Mg-HCO3-CO3 type. Phosphate concentration > 0.03 mg(.)L(-1) in the Mansar Lake water indicated that the lake is eutrophic. Suitable measures have been suggested for sustainable management of Mansar Lake.

AB Understanding the effects of land use change on soil properties is important for soil quality improvement and sustainable land use. In this study, six land use types including wasteland (WLD), cropland (CLD), abandoned land (ABD), artificial grassland (AGD), shrubland (SLD) and woodland (WOD) were selected to analyse the effects of land use types on soil nutrient in the Anjiapo catchment in the western part of the Loess Plateau in China. Significant differences were found in soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate nitrogen (NON) (P < 0.01) between the six land use types. Our study also showed that land use types have different effects on soil nutrient storage, and vegetation restoration may improve soil nutrients and soil quality. While crop plantation can significantly decrease soil fertility, the trend can be reversed by cropland abandonment and afforestation. It is recommended that more C input, alternative cultivation practices, vegetation restoration and education and techniques training of local farmers could be used to improve soil conditions and to advance the sustainable land use and local development in the loess hilly area in the Loess Plateau of China.

AB Choices in project approach affect the continuation of soil and water conservation (SWC) after project withdrawal, and thus the sustainability and cost effectiveness of the project. A SWC project was carried out in southern Mali between 1986 and 1998. Its features were the promotion of cheap and simple SWC measures, a participatory village extension approach with limited use of incentives, and the incorporation of the SWC programme in an existing Malian extension service. By 2000, farmers in half the 5000 villages in southern Mali had been trained in SWC. By 2002, erosion-control measures had been installed in 94 percent of the villages in southern Mali by 46 per cent of the farmers and in 15 per cent of the fields. Though external donor support has stopped, farmer adoption is steadily continuing and spreading to untargeted villages. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Farm animal breeders are facing challenges. More and more powerful technologies are at their disposal for creating genetic change. At the same time, society is concerned about the impact of breeding practices and the use to which new technologies are being put. European breeders must compete in a global market. To meet these challenges, European farm animal breeders have conducted three projects to contribute to sustainable and transparent farm animal breeding and reproduction. In "Farm animal breeding and society", an overview is presented of farm animal breeding in Europe and its technical, ethical, legal and consumer constraints and possibilities. In 'SEFABAR', European breeders, scientists and socio-economists have worked towards sustainable breeding and reproduction scenarios. In 'CODE-EFABAR', breeders aim to develop, with experts on ethics, communication and certification, and in close contact with NGOs, farmers' organisations and policy makers, a Code of Good Practice for farm animal breeding and reproduction organisations. Along this Code of Good Practice organisations will be able to explain their goals and practices to the public in a transparent way. This paper reviews these projects. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The study examines the long-run sustainability of OECD current account balances. For this purpose, tests for current account stationarity and then cointegration between exports and imports are based on recently developed panel data methods that offer increased power over existing time-series techniques. Unlike existing panel studies on this topic, this study utilizes techniques that enable the examination of sustainability for individual panel members. The first stage of the investigation relies on a novel approach to unit root testing whereby tests for stationarity are conducted within a seemingly unrelated regression framework. The second stage involves the estimation of the long-run relationship between exports and imports by a range of recently developed panel data techniques advocated by Pedroni. Using a panel of 11 OECD countries, the results from these techniques suggest that sustainability is present in six countries at most. Also, sustainability is generally a characteristic of the non-Euro countries. These results can be contrasted with existing group mean unit root and cointegration tests that indicate sustainability for the group as a whole.

ID FISHERIES
AB Among the relatively few decisions taken by heads of States and government at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in September 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa, was the time-bound objective to restore degraded stocks to productive levels in its Plan of Implementation. The paper examines the evidence leading to this decision and the broadening of cognitive maps it implies. In particular, it documents how public archiving of research results and other knowledge sources particularly those accessible through the Fish Base (www.fishbase.org) and Sea Around Us (www.seaaroundus.org) websites has been effective in enabling citizens in addition to specialist publics to counteract shifting baselines and monitor progress against the WSSD plan. The increased targeting and cost-effectiveness of research efforts and the social benefits of public research spending this implies militates for the extension of such approaches to other groups as an enabling mechanism for WSSD decisions on restoring marine ecosystems by 2015.

AB Sustainable management of wild fish stocks by means of catch quotas requires reliable data on fishing mortality. Norwegian authorities have attempted to ensure the reliability of this data through catch report procedures and a ban on dumping. The reliability of data on fishing mortality depends on the fishers' compliance with these regulations. This article outlines the main factors that govern compliance and non-compliance in the Norwegian pelagic fisheries. Data was generated during fieldwork in the offshore pelagic fishing fleet.

AB Myers and Worm claim that their analyses of catch rates following the commencement of industrial longline fishing for tuna and billfishes show that these longline fisheries rapidly depleted the abundance of these large oceanic predators by 90% (Myers RA, Worm B. Rapid worldwide depletion of predatory fish communities. Nature 2003;423:280-3). Their analyses were published in a high profile science journal along with an accompanying press release, which then attracted substantial international media focus and public attention. This media focus in turn has been used as a base for advocating major marine policy changes for pelagic tuna fisheries (e.g. a minimum of a 50% reduction in catches and establishment of extensive marine reserves). However, among numerous scientific experts involved in tuna and pelagic fishery research substantial concerns exist that Myers and Worm's analyses provide a misleading picture of the status of large predatory pelagic fishes. These concerns are reviewed using data from the Indian Ocean for illustrative purposes and indicate that the initial longline catches were not responsible for a rapid depletion of the main tuna and billfish stocks nor were they threatening the overall sustainability of these stocks. However, the status of a number of theses stocks is of concern as a result of large increases in catches in more recent years. The debate sparked by Myers and Worm's paper should not distract from the critical problem of developing and implementing effective international management policies. In addition to implications for fishery management, the publication, peer-review, scientific response and publicity process associated with the publication of Myers and Worm's paper are discussed. Concerns are raised that if these become standard practices for articles in high profile science journals that this would undermine the trust placed in such journal to provide an accurate and well-balanced representation of the most important new scientific findings and in their role to inform policy decisions based on these findings.

ID UNDERWATER OBSERVATIONS
AB The Atlantic sea scallop is the most important molluscan shellfish species commercially harvested in the United States. The species is sought for the large white circular adductor muscle (the "meat") that holds the two valves of the animal together. In North America, the 'meat' is generally the only part of the scallop that is landed and eaten although the meat only accounts for about a third of the animals visceral weight. In 2004 U.S. landings of sea scallop meats totaled 29,374 metric tone. The value of the U.S. scallop harvest in 2004 ($321 million) was only exceeded by crabs ($447 million) shrimp ($425 million), and lobster ($344 million) Harvesting problems in the wild capture scallop fishery have a long history of being addressed with technical gear-related solutions. Recent advances include larger rings and twine tops, turtle chin mats, and changes to the drag frame. Management strategies and gear design must work together for sustainable fisheries.

   modelling; Senegal
AB In Sahel, land and resources are used, according to the seasons, by various actors with interests sometimes difficult to conciliate. This spatial competition for the access to the natural resources induces a set of processes leading to overgrazing and conflicts for the access to water. In such a complex agro-sylvo-pastoral context, acquiring and formalizing knowledge about the practices and rules which govern. the system are essential to help and accompany the rural populations towards the sustainable management of their environment. Among the new modelling tools coming from the field of Artificial Intelligence, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are now widely used to tackle the issue of integrated natural resource management. The increase in popularity of ABMs is partially due to their intelligibility, not only by scientists from various research fields, but also by stakeholders. It then becomes easier to build an understandable representation of the system as an "artificial world" and to perform simulations in order to collectively test and discuss various scenarios about the resource management. This paper describes an ABM which has been designed to formalize the interactions between the biophysics dynamics of the natural resources and the socio-economic factors driving the land-use dynamics around the drilling of Thieul village in the sylvo-pastoral area of Ferlo (Senegal).
   The first results show that rainfall still plays an extremely significant role in the pastoral system despite the drilling of boreholes. Paradoxically, steady rainfall over long periods of time can lead to negative effects on the relations between herders and farmers. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An agent-based bioeconomic fishery model was developed to assist in the design and evaluation of management instruments in an input controlled fishery. The agent-based structure of the model enables the choice of management instruments to be tailored specifically to account for the competitive 'race to fish' and input substitution behaviour observed in input controlled fisheries. The optimal season length and capital investment in the absence of market failure is determined by assuming there is only one agent in the fishery that can internalise all future benefits resulting from sustainable harvest levels. This is then compared with a number of agent-based scenarios, with varying restrictions on fishing inputs, where each individual agent seeks to maximise its own fishing returns subject to the behaviour of other agents. While the results are for a hypothetical fishery, the model provides estimates of the economic cost of this market failure, which in turn provides a benchmark against which the cost of management can be compared.

AB It has been well documented that vacuum or modified atmosphere packaging materials, made from polyethylene- or other plastic-based materials, have been found to improve the stability and safety of raw or further processed muscle foods. However, recent research developments have demonstrated the feasibility, utilization, and commercial application of a variety of bio-based polymers or bio-polymers made from a variety of materials, including renewable/sustainable agricultural commodities, and applied to muscle foods. A variety of these bio-based materials have been shown to prevent moisture loss, drip, reduce lipid oxidation and improve flavor attributes, as well as enhancing the handling properties, color retention, and microbial stability of foods. With consumers demanding more environmentally friendly packaging and a desire for more natural products, bio-based films or bio-polymers will continue to play an important role in the food industry by improving the quality of many products, including fresh or further processed muscle foods.

AB This review focuses on how game meat from southern Africa and venison that are increasingly being imported into Europe and the US addresses consumer issues as pertaining to production (wild, free range or intensive production) and harvesting methods, healthiness (chemical composition, particularly fatty acid composition), and traceability. Although African game meat species are farmed extensively, deer species are farmed using extensive to intensive production systems. However, the increasingly intensive production of the cervids and the accompanying practices associated with this (castration, velvetting, feeding of balanced diets, etc.) may have a negative impact in the near future on the consumer's perception of these animals. These alternative meat species are all harvested in a sustainable manner using acceptable methods. All these species have very low muscle fat contents consisting predominantly of structural lipid components (phospholipid and cholesterol) that have high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This results in the meat having desirable polyunsaturated: saturated and n - 6:n - 3 fatty acid ratios. The South African traceability system is discussed briefly as an example on how these exporting countries are able to address the requirements pertaining to the import of meat as stipulated by the European Economic Community.

AB It is considered that consumption of very long chain (VLC, carbon chain length >= 20) n - 3 PUFAs in most Western populations is sub-optimal and benefits in relation to chronic disease would be gained from increased consumption. This review examines the current contribution that meat makes to dietary intake of VLC n - 3 PUFA and given its current low contribution, how ruminant meat may be enriched. Enrichment both directly with VLC n - 3 fatty acids and indirectly by increasing intake by the animals of alpha-linolenic acid (ALNA; C 18:3 n - 3) are considered. Since it now appears that dietary ALNA is a very limited source of VLC n - 3 PUFA in humans, the indirect route is controversial but since some forages-are rich sources of ALNA this route has many sustainability and environmental attractions. Consideration is also given to the increased concentrations of trans and conjugated fatty acids that will arise from enriching ruminant meat with PUFA. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CURRICULUM; PORTFOLIOS; REFORM
AB An innovative medical curriculum at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) has been developed through a highly collaborative process aimed at building faculty ownership and ongoing sustainability. The result is a novel capability-based program that features early clinical experience and small-group teaching, which offers students considerable flexibility and achieves a high degree of alignment between graduate outcomes, learning activities and assessments. Graduate capabilities that focus student learning on generic outcomes are described ( critical evaluation, reflection, communication and teamwork) along with traditional outcomes in biomedical science, social aspects, clinical performance and ethics. Each two-year phase promotes a distinctive learning process to support and develop autonomous learning across six years. The approaches emphasize important adult education themes: student autonomy; learning from experience; collaborative learning; and adult teacher-learner relationships. Teaching in each phase draws on stages of the human life cycle to provide an explicit organization for the vertical integration of knowledge and skills. A learning environment that values the social nature of learning is fostered through the program's design and assessment system, which supports interdisciplinary integration and rewards students who exhibit self-direction. Assessment incorporates criterion referencing, interdisciplinary examinations, a balance between continuous and barrier assessments, peer feedback and performance assessments of clinical competence. A portfolio examination in each phase, in which students submit evidence of reflection and achievement for each capability, ensures overall alignment.

AB Taxus plant suspension cell cultures provide a sustainable source of paclitaxel (Taxol(R)) for the treatment of many cancers. To develop an optimal bioprocess for paclitaxel supply, taxane biosynthetic pathway regulation must be better understood. Here we examine the expression profile of paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway genes by RNA gel blot analysis and RT-PCR in the Taxus cuspidata cell line P991 and compare with taxane metabolite levels. Upon methyl jasmonate (MJ) elicitation (100 mu M), paclitaxel accumulates to 3.3 mg/L and cephalomannine to 2.2 mg/L 7 days after elicitation but neither are observed before this time. 10-deacetylbaccatin III accumulates to 3.3 mg/L and baccatin III to 1.2 mg/L by day 7 after elicitation. The early pathway enzyme genes GGPPS, TASY, and T5 alpha H are upregulated by MJ elicitation within 6 h and continue through 24 h before their abundances decrease. This study reveals the preference for one side of the biosynthetic pathway branch in early taxane synthesis, where transcripts coding for T alpha H are abundant after elicitation with MJ but transcripts encoding the two enzymes for the alternative branch (TDAT and T10 beta H) are not highly expressed following elicitation. Transcripts encoding the enzymes DBBT and DBAT are up-regulated upon MJ elicitation. Their products, 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin III, respectively, accumulate within 6 h of the initial increase in transcript abundance. Importantly, the steady-state levels of the two terminal enzyme transcripts (BAPT and DBTNBT) are much lower than transcripts of early pathway steps. These are potential steps in the pathway for targeted metabolic engineering to increase accumulation of paclitaxel in suspension cell culture. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this paper is to give an insight and a possible explanation of the limitations in the Reverse Bias Safe Operating Area of 100 V Si Power Schottky Diodes. Starting from experiments and going through device simulations and theory a physical explanation of device failure both in short (i.e. isothermal) and long pulse are explained. With the help of the theoretical analysis an improvement of the design is proposed to increase avalanche capability of these devices and preliminary experimental data are reporting a very promising increase of both the maximum sustainable current in avalanche condition and the maximum sustainable avalanche energy in UIS conditions.

TI Examination of the Phoenix regional water supply for sustainable yield
   and carrying capacity
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID RESOURCES
AB Metropolitan Phoenix lacks a current, publicly accessible statement of its water supply front which to evaluate options for growth. This article presents research into the size and sustainability of the regional water supply. It introduces residential carrying capacity as an intuitive measure of the economic size of a water supply and examines entitlements, regulatory programs, and subsidies that constrain existing supplies from supporting new economic uses. The findings are (1) that the Phoenix renewable water supply is, in theory, sufficiently large to meet future regional economic goals and protect many environmental functions if the current context Of entitlements and institutional arrangements is ignored; and (2) that Phoenix needs to engineer new water supply policies instead of new water resources, to avoid large economic and environmental costs in the future.

AB Grazing management practices modify soil structure, which, in turn, alters the behaviour and population dynamics of soil-inhabiting organisms. Monitoring of changes in abundance and richness of soil organisms is vital in determining the sustainability of grazing regimes. In this paper, populations of soil organisms were compared-using abundance and population trends as an indicator of diversity-in two different grazing practices (a) conventional, set stocked (SS) grazing regime and (b) high intensity-short duration (HI-SD) grazing regime and an ungrazed control (c). A thorough sampling of earthworms and arthropods, and an assay of soil microbial biomass and respiration was made in Spring 2004 (September-November), after a pilot sampling of earthworms and arthropods in Autumn 2004 (March-May). Earthworm numbers were found to be unaffected by grazing regimes, however, microarthropod abundance at 0-10 cm soil depth was significantly higher in soil of the HI-SD grazing regime and in the ungrazed control, when compared with set stocking. Microbial biomass and respiration did not differ across treatments. Overall, our results indicate that arthropod abundance reflects the changes impacting on soil structure as a consequence of grazing practice. Evaluation of earthworm populations was not found to be useful in discriminating between the two grazing regimes, because the earthworm numbers were principally affected by rainfall.

AB Growing emphasis on sustainability has increased the demand for information on effects of forest management on species diversity. We investigated the hypothesis that plant diversity is a function of microsite heterogeneity by documenting plant diversity and heterogeneity in canopy cover, light, and soil moisture produced by four silvicultural treatments during the first growing season following treatment: prescribed burning, wildlife retention cut with prescribed burning, wildlife retention cut, and shelterwood cutting. Treatments and controls were randomly assigned within four relatively undisturbed, 70-90-year-old oak-hickory stands. Heterogeneity in canopy cover and photosynthetically active radiation was greatest after shelterwood cutting, whereas the wildlife retention cut resulted in less removal of canopy trees and a smaller increase in heterogeneity of these factors. The addition of prescribed burning enhanced the effects of the wildlife retention cut. Prescribed burning alone had the least impact on heterogeneity of these factors. Soil moisture variability appeared to be independent of treatments. Shelterwood cutting increased first-year herbaceous plant diversity, and this increase was likely due, in part, to increased heterogeneity in canopy cover, light, and seedbed condition. These first-year results partially support the hypothesis that plant diversity is a function of microsite diversity in these forests. Long-term monitoring is underway.

TI Implications of alternative strategies for transition to sustainable

SO NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

AB Fuel cycles employing recycling of actinides in the thermal COmbined NonFertile and UO2 (CONFU)fuel light water reactor (LWR) or fast Actinide Burner Reactor (ABR) plus standard LWRs are compared to the once-through LWR fuel cycle under the assumption of moderately growing worldwide demand for nuclear energy until 2050. The transuranic elements (TRUs) in temporary storage, the TRUs sent to permanent repositories, and the system cost are taken as key figures of merit. The CONFU strategy (standard LWRs plus CONFU LWRs) is shown to reduce the TRU accumulation by similar to 34%, relative to the reference once-through fuel cycle strategy, while the ABR strategy (standard LWRs plus ABRs) exhibits a smaller reduction (by 9%). The CONFU fuel assembly was designed to stabilize the TRU inventory in LWRs with zero TRU incineration rate. Nevertheless, deployment of this concept limits the ex-core TRU inventory. The actinide production in the CONFUs is also reduced by virtue of the loading of 20% of the core with nonfertile actinide fuel pins. On the other hand, the ABR burner, designed to consume the actinides in fertile-free fuel (FFF), has a large net TRU incineration rate and therefore a potential for faster TRU depletion from storage facilities. However, it suffers from a likely delay of deployment, compared to the CONFU, due to the need for more extensive research and development effort. Even when extending the time frame to 100 yr, the fast ABR cannot overcome the disadvantage of its late deployment compared to the thermal CONFU. In part, this is due to the fact that the ABR has a lower TRU destruction rate per gigawatt(electric) than the CONFU because of its higher thermal efficiency.
   Both strategies greatly reduce the total TRU mass destined to the permanent repositories, thus alleviating the burden of licensing a large number of such repositories, and the risk from deliberate or accidental excavation of TRUs from the repositories. The implementation of these strategies requires development of FFF pins for both CONFU cores and fast reactors.
   Economic analyses show that both closed fuel cycles are more expensive than the reference once-through scheme. The total busbar cost of electricity production is expected to be 4 to 5 mills/kW center dot h(electric) (similar to 10 to 12%) larger than the. once-through cycle case if the spent-fuel separation is paid for by electricity sales from the separated fuel. The cost impact will be much less if the necessary funds are collected while the original fuel is irradiated.

AB Louis Bromfield (1896-1956) produced at least two books which should be included in the canon of environmental writing and place him among the ranks of notable literary environmentalists-Pleasant Valley (1945) and Malabar Farm (1948). These books, as well as five other nonfiction works on sustainable agriculture and ecology, deserve to be placed in the literary tradition of Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac. Bromfield himself should be considered to be a forerunner of the philosophies of Wendell Berry, Gary Snyder and Wes Jackson. Bromfield's great success at popular fiction has caused him to be slighted not only by literary critics but also by environmentalist scholars; however several recent critics have asserted that his fiction-much of which is concerned with environmental themes such as encroaching industrialism, despoilation of nature, and alienation of people from the land-as well as his nonfiction, should be reassessed. Placing him in the tradition of Sherwood Anderson, they believe that he has made a substantial contribution to tire American literary canon.

TI The rise of the Labor Party in South Korea: causes and limits
SO PACIFIC REVIEW

ID LATIN-AMERICA; REGULATORY STATE; DEMOCRACY; DILEMMAS; POPULISM; POLITICS
AB The development of the Labor Party in South Korea will depend on whether politics evolves toward democratic deepening or neo-populism. It appears that the rise of the Labor Party in Korea was a political event that resulted from a prevailing current of democratic deepening. It was also a political event born of collective action on the part of civil society organizations and labor in the course of electoral reform. However, if the political regime does evolve in favor of neopopulism, the political conditions that would enable the Labor Party's sustainable development will be radically eroded. The prospects for the Labor Party in Korea might be regarded skeptically in political as well as economic respects.

AB The prolonged irrigation with marginal quality water can cause secondary salinization of soils, which necessitates for better understanding of water management alternatives. Relative performance of sulfuric acid and gypsum is still controversial to counter sodium hazards in soil/water system. As an alternative, sulfurous acid generators (SAG) are also being marketed. But up-till-now, there is not even a single field study published in scientific journals about their efficiency and economical viability for the treatment of saline-sodic water. Therefore, a field study was carried out to compare the effectiveness of SAG and alternate amendments applied on an equivalent basis to grow rice crop. SAG treatment of saline-sodic tube well water decreased only residual sodium carbonate (RSC) from 5.4 to 3.6 mmol(c) l(-1), and had no beneficial effect on its sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) or electrical conductivity (EC). All the treatments kept soil EC and SAR around their respective threshold levels. For paddy yield, SAG, sulfuric acid, and gypsum treatments depicted nonsignificant differences. SAG and sulfuric acid treatments of water were about six times expensive than that of gypsum. It was concluded that soil-applied gypsum, to counter sodic hazards of irrigation water, is economical to sustain irrigated rice in dry regions.

TI Effects of different pretreatments on the germination of different wild
   cherry (Prunus avium L.) seed sources
SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
AB Wild cherry (Prunus avium L.) is an important native hardwood species of Turkey with its high-valued wood. It is also listed as a 'noble hardwood' in Europe with strongly emphasized Conservation, sustainable use and genetic potential. Wild cherry seeds are deeply dormant, and level of dormancy may vary significantly within the species. This causes substantial difficulties during seedling production. The effects of different artificial and natural pretreatments in seed germination of three Turkish wild cherry seed sources was examined. The effects of different 0.1 % C citric acid soaking treatments prior to cold stratification on the seed germination of a separate seed source was also examined. Pretreatments made significant effects on speed of and cumulative seed germination with substantially different seed source responses. Successive periods of complex, warm and cold artificial stratification regimes rather than cold period alone as well as natural stratification substantially improved the dormancy breaking and germination of wild cherry seeds. Seeds from K. Eregli were superior over those of the other seed sources in both speed and cumulative rate of germination. Seeds soaked in 0.1 % citric acid for 48 hours followed by a 90-day cold stratification period enhanced germination significantly, yet longer acid exposures decreased seed germination substantially.

AB Ecologically sustainable disease prevention in intensive monocultures, such as fish farming, is based on the knowledge of the ecology of parasites and the identification of the key proportion of host populations for parasite life cycles. In this paper, we examined the life cycle dynamics of the pathogenic trematode Diplostomum spathaceum at a fish farm during a period of I year, focusing especially on the pattern of infection in the snail host (Lymnaea stagnalis) population, which is the key phase in the parasite life cycle regarding preventative actions. We found that (1) the infection varied seasonally in snails, being highest in late August; (2) the prevalence of infection and the proportion of individuals releasing cercariae were strongly dependent on snail size; (3) the parasite over-wintered in snails as dormant sporocysts and 4) the mortality of infected snails was not likely to differ from uninfected individuals during winter. Furthermore, the seasonality and development of the infection in the snails corresponded to the pattern of infection observed in the tracer rainbow trout caged in the farm area. This pattern of infection also indicated strong spatiality of the infection, probably because of differences in the size of the snail population between the ponds rather than differences in the prevalence of infection. Overall, present results indicate a possibility for late-summer outbreaks of D. spathaceum, but also that snail prevention at farms could be conducted more efficiently by considering both size-dependent infection and the timing of cercarial release.

DE transmigration; diversification schemes; productivity; profitability;

AB Different diversification schemes are practiced by farmers in the different transmigrant villages of Rasau Jaya District, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. To identify the scheme that best satisfies the farm household goals of food security and continuous cash flows on a sustainable basis, 380 farmers were interviewed using both informal and formal survey methods. Raising annual crops and animals was the most common diversification scheme practiced by 75% of the farmers. Only 24% of the farmers were into annuals + perennials + animals and only very few were into annual crops alone or a combination of annuals and perennials. Ten (10) diversification schemes were practiced by 62% of the farmers and they were evaluated based on various measures of productivity, profitability and efficiency Crop yields, total farm productivity, land use efficiency and net income were highest in the diversification scheme involving Rice + Corn + Cow + Native Chicken (R+C+CW+NC) giving a total adjusted yield of 8.23 t/ha. The slack time of the farm household was fully utilized in this scheme which increased labor use efficiency Rice Yield was highest which led to its highest technical efficiency (TE = 0.86). This was due to the application of composted manure. Without applying composted manure, rice grown under submerged field conditions had low technical efficiency (TE = 0.32-0.44) due to its low yield (0.64-0.87 t/ ha). This is because of the low availability of nutrients in the highly acidic peat soils (pH < 5) of the district. To unlock the adsorbed nutrients, many farmers resorted to burning peat soils which needed spraying of herbicide to initially dry the thick weed biomass to facilitate burning.
   Integrating ruminants in rice-based farming systems as in R+C+CW+NC was found to be the diversification scheme that best satisfies the farm household goals of increased farm productivity, food security and continuous cash flows. This farming system could be the key that would make burning of peat soils impractical, thus, conserving the nutrient-rich peat soils of the transmigration villages of Rasau Jaya District, West Kalimantan, Indonesia for long-term productivity.

AB Surface and groundwater resources in the Wonderfonteinspruit (WFS) catchment are of increasing importance as future sources of water supply to a growing population in the region. However, deep-level gold mining over more than a century has impacted adversely both the availability and quality of ground- and surface water. This paper analyses spatial patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics associated with the fluvial transport of uranium. Previous studies found elevated levels of dissolved U along the entire watercourse and also detected significant secondary accumulations of U in fluvial sediments. The degree of sediment contamination seems to be determined less by the distance to the source of U pollution than by the sorption capacity of sediments and certain site-specific mechanisms removing U from stream water. U concentrations in stream water were found to fluctuate by up to several orders of magnitude between two weekly measurements. This highly dynamic behavior of U in stream water is caused by complex interactions of natural and anthropogenic processes differing in frequency and magnitude. Such processes include diurnal and seasonal photosynthesis cycles, rain events, and pumping regimes of mines discharging uraniferous effluents. It is recommended to adjust sampling intervals of existing monitoring systems accordingly, because current protocols systematically underestimate the true extent of stream pollution.

AB In response to the challenges of sustainable development, this paper describes the formulation and application of a framework of catchment-level water resource use and management indicators designed to integrate environmental, economic, and social aspects of sustainability. The framework of nine indicators was applied to the River Clyde catchment in Scotland, using existing secondary data and in a manner that recognized local thresholds and standards, where appropriate. Findings suggested a mixed and relatively complex situation, with encouraging results for water quality and supply, but much room for improvement regarding the preparedness of management systems and opportunities for public participation. The availability of adequate data in a suitable, catchment-level format was a significant problem, although this situation may improve with the advent of new legislation. Discussion of findings also addresses the inherently subjective nature of indicator selection and the opportunities provided by research in this area for greater cooperation and collaboration between natural and social scientists.

AB Take-all of wheat (Triticum aestivum), caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, became a serious problem with the widespread adoption of wheat:soybean double-cropping and minimum tillage farming systems in the southeastern United States during the past 30 years. A longterm crop rotation study was initiated in 1994 with 12 double-cropping sequences incorporating wheat, rye, or canola as the fall-planted crop and soybean or grain pearl millet as the summer crop. Cotton and fallow were included in some summer rotations during the last 2 years of the study. The purpose was to identify sustainable alternatives to the continuous wheat:soybean system that would provide acceptable management of take-all. G. grammis var. tritici cultured on autoclaved oats was incorporated into soil prior to planting the first season's crop. Take-all was severe in rotations with continuous wheat each year. Pearl millet was compatible with the cropping system but did not affect incidence or severity of take-all in a following wheat crop. Soybean or pearl millet had little effect on yield loss due to take-all in a subsequent wheat crop. A 1-year rotation with canola significantly reduced take-all incidence and severity. At the end of the second and third seasons, in those rotations where wheat followed I year of canola, wheat grain yield was the same as that in control plots that bad little or no take-all. Two consecutive years of canola did not suppress take-all or improve wheat yields any more than a single year of canola between wheat crops. Seedling assays for take-all incidence and severity in growth chambers were conducted using soil collected twice each year near the end of each crop's growing season. Results were similar to those observed in the field. However, canola in the rotation had a greater effect in suppressing disease severity than disease incidence. Canola can be a valuable rotational crop for management of take-all in wheat in the southeastern United States.

AB The potential use of sustainable polymer based composites, obtained from renewable resources, is revised in terms of properties and envisaged applications. Using the typical specifications required within the automotive industry as reference, the potential of these composites is evaluated and some alternative routes for property improvement are discussed. Specific examples of the development of biodegradable polymeric composites are presented including the use of different types of matrixes, e. g. starch based blends and poly( lactic acid), and two types of natural reinforcements, i.e. fibres from pine and cellulose. This paper also presents and compares the mechanical properties and morphologies obtained on injection moulding composite parts made with different combinations of biodegradable matrixes and fibre reinforcements subjected to different physical and chemical treatments. The damage caused to the fibres during the compounding and injection moulding processing stages was studied too.

AB This paper explores the regionalization and rescaling of agro-food governance in the context of renewed interest in the territoriality, or respacing, of agro-food markets. Rescaling concerns state processes and multilevel governance. Rural respacing is driven by changes in the agro-food sector brought about by market developments. This paper examines the relationship between respacing and rescaling, through an analysis of the changing agro-food governance in the south-west of England. A case study is provided of the implementation of the Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy in the region. While agro-food policy remains centrally driven in terms of budget resource and strategic lead, the new institutional landscape, combined in this case with the market imperative of respacing, provides an opportunity for the building of new identities and capacities which in themselves both transform and confront existing scalar configurations and power distributions.

AB International donors and state bureaucrats in the developing world have promoted decentralization reform as the primary means to achieve equitable, efficient and sustainable natural resource management. Relatively few studies, however, consider the power interests at stake. Why do state agencies decentralize power, what political patterns unfold, and how do outcomes affect the responses of resource users? This paper explores decentralization reform by investigating the political processes behind the Philippine state's decisions to transfer authority over national parks management to local government units. Drawing on a case of devolved management at Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Palawan Island, we examine how political motives situated at different institutional scales affect the broader process of decentralization, the structure of management institutions, and overall livelihood security. We demonstrate how power struggles between the Philippine state and City Government of Palawan over the right to manage the national park have impacted the livelihood support offered by community-based conservation. We conclude that decentralization may offer empowering results when upper-level policies and political networks tie into sufficiently organized institutions at the local level.

TI Innovative actions and innovation (in) capabilities of Russian
   industrial companies - An extension of a quasi-longitudinal study
SO POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES
LA English
DT Article
AB This article reports the results of an extension of a quasi-longitudinal survey among top corporate executives in Russian industry, presenting a snapshot of current innovation actions and innovation capabilities of Russian enterprises. Through comparison between the situations in 2002 and 2004, changes in the business and management of Russian companies in recent years are examined. The intensity of innovation significantly increased in 2003-04, but the resources for innovation at Russian CEOs' disposal became even more limited than before as the traditional lack of finance coincided with a growing shortage of qualified labour. Moreover, the intensity of past innovations has little impact on further successes as there is minimal accumulation of routines of innovative action within companies.
   Further accumulation of innovative capabilities by Russian industrial enterprises will be a rather slow and painful process. The successes in innovative development of some export-oriented 'national champions' will be limited by the inability of their local partners to adapt to new requirements. Locally-oriented companies with sufficient financing will be inclined towards adoption of the existing technological solutions implemented by turn-key operators. In both cases breakthrough innovations in production and management technologies will be rare and will not determine the overall picture. In this respect, the sustainability of development of the Russian industrial sector is not secured.

DE town & city planning; transport planning
ID CENTERS; TRAVEL
AB Planning Policy Statement 6 (PPS 6): Planning for Town Centres succeeds a consultation draft of December 2003 and replaces Planning Policy Guidance Note 6 (PPG 6): Town Centres and Retail Developments. This paper examines how effective the former guidance has been, how it has been modified to form PIPS 6, the likely impacts of the new guidance and what support from other policies will be necessary to achieve the stated objectives. Although PPG 6 has supported some successes in achieving objectives relating to accessibility of services by public transport, walking and cycling, and has supported some central areas, the overall picture is one of continued aggravation of the problems identified in it, principally the decline of many central areas, increasing problems of accessibility to services and deteriorating environmental quality. PIPS 6 places greater emphasis on analysing relationships between central areas and on assessing development needs. These changes will help clarify the problems but will need the support of other policies outside PPS 6, in particular policies relating to the amount of travel. Increasing travel over many years has been accompanied by polarisation of central areas; the decline of many commercial centres, especially the smaller ones, is causing social exclusion, deteriorating performance on sustainability criteria, and results in greater demands for expenditure on transport infrastructure. A case study of Dudley in the West Midlands examines how the guidance might help a town centre severely affected by decline since the mid 1980s.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The construction sector is a natural-resource-consuming agent. As a result environmental criteria and other key factors must be integrated into construction processes throughout their life cycle. On the other hand, a more general concept of sustainability considers equally economic, social and functional factors. All these matters entail the management of much information and disciplines that require a specific methodology to quantify their real influence on constructive models. In recent years, there has been progress in favour of buildings being more environmentally friendly. However, sustainable construction has centred on residential and office buildings. It could be said that there is a lack of focus on sustainability in the construction of industrial buildings, which present specific characteristics that differentiate them from residential buildings. This paper aims to analyse the sustainable environmental requirements for an industrial building by defining a system of specific indicators to assess building behaviour against these requirements, ultimately generating an assessment model as a basis for measuring a building's 'environmental sustainability index'.

TI Rainwater potential for domestic water supply in Grenada
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE developing countries; economics & finance; water supply
AB Water resources management in the face of increasing scarcity requires that countries undertake audits of their current resources. The small island of Carriacou (area 34 km(2)), which forms part of the state of Grenada, has no perennial streams and very little groundwater but receives an average annual rainfall of about 1200 mm. The island has traditionally depended on rainwater harvesting, and this offers a sustainable method of providing an adequate quantity and quality of water. Furthermore, rainwater harvesting systems have proven to be resilient in the aftermath of natural disasters. This paper assesses the potential of rainwater harvesting in the islands and shows that, although per capita water demand is dependent on household income levels, rainwater can adequately meet the demands of the island's residents. It shows that the cost of harvested rainwater is by up to nine times lower than that of the recently available desalinated water. The quality of rainwater has not been considered here, as quality is not a concern of the residents. The paper therefore highlights the need for policies that would promote the construction of adequate size storage and quality improvement facilities for achieving the full potential of rainwater as a sustainable water resource on a water-scarce small island.

AB Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC) have product returns at the center of attention. Our view is that CLSC are best managed from a business perspective where organizations seek to maximize value recovery. The research in the feature issue, and our experiences, shows that there are still numerous, unresolved, managerially relevant issues that deserve further investigation. We also observe that there is a pressing need to validate the assumptions in our models using interdisciplinary, industry-driven research. The time is right for production and operations management to play a central role in the sustainability movement slowly taking hold in practice.

TI From virtue to competence: Changing the principles of public service

ID MACINTYRE; MANAGER
AB Virtue has long been a central principle in the tradition of public service-to what extent is it still relevant today? Focusing on the role of the monitoring officer, a key official in the ethical framework of local government in the United Kingdom, this essay asks which virtues, if any, are still needed for public service and whether these virtues have been displaced by managerial notions of technical competence as the principles of public service delivery. The authors draw an initial distinction between virtue and competence that, upon further investigation, does not appear to be sustainable. Despite being drawn from two different academic perspectives-moral philosophy and management development-the concepts of virtue and competence are, in practice, very similar. This theoretical convergence is reflected in the practical concerns of monitoring officers and their perspective on public service ethics.

AB Biological soil crusts are a diverse soil surface community, prevalent in semiarid regions, which function as ecosystem engineers and perform numerous important ecosystem services. Loss of crusts has been implicated as a factor leading to accelerated soil erosion and other forms of land degradation. To support assessment and monitoring efforts aimed at ensuring the sustainability of rangeland ecosystems, managers require spatially explicit information concerning potential cover and composition of biological soil crusts. We sampled low disturbance sites in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (Utah, USA) to determine the feasibility of modeling the potential cover and composition of biological soil crusts in a large area. We used classification and regression trees to model cover of four crust types (light cyanobacterial, dark cyanobacterial, moss, lichen) and 1 cyanobacterial biomass proxy (chlorophyll a), based upon a parsimonious set of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data layers (soil types, precipitation, and elevation). Soil type was consistently the best predictor, although elevation and precipitation were both invoked in the various models. Predicted and observed values for the dark cyanobacterial, moss, and lichen models corresponded moderately well (R-2 = 0.49, 0.64, 0.55, respectively). Cover of late successional crust elements (moss + lichen + dark cyanobacterial) was also successfully modeled (R-2 = 0.64). We were less successful with models of light cyanobacterial cover (R-2 = 0.22) and chlorophyll a (R-2 = 0.09). We believe that our difficulty modeling chlorophyll a concentration is related to a severe drought and subsequent cyanobacterial mortality during the course of the study. These models provide the necessary reference conditions to facilitate the comparison between the actual cover and composition of biological soil crusts at a given site and their potential cover and composition condition so that sites in poor condition can be identified and management actions can be taken.

AB Conventional farmers converting to organics have contributed to most of the rapid expansion of organic farming in recent years. The new organic farmers may differ from their more established colleagues, which may have implications for the development of the organic farming sector and its distinctiveness vis-a-vis conventional production and marketing practices. The aim of this study was to explore Norwegian organic dairy farmers' personal and farm production characteristics, farming goals, conversion motives, and attitudes to organic farming, grouped by year of conversion (three groups). A postal survey was undertaken among organic dairy farmers (n=161). The results show that the newcomers (converted in 2000 or later) were less educated than the early entrants (the so-called 'old guard') who converted in 1995 or earlier. The frequency of activities like vegetable growing and poultry farming among the old guard was high. The late-entry organic herds were fed with more concentrates and had a higher milk production intensity, showed a higher incidence of veterinary treatments and less frequent use of alternative medicine than the herds of the two earlier converting groups. For all groups of farmers, the highest ranked farming goals were sustainable and environment-friendly farming and the production of high-quality food. Late entrants more often mentioned goals related to profit and leisure time. On average, the most frequently mentioned motives for conversion were food quality and professional challenges. The old guard was more strongly motivated by food quality and soil fertility/pollution issues than the others, whereas financial reasons (organic payments included) were relatively more important among the newcomers. All groups held very favorable views about the environmental qualities of organic farming methods, albeit with different strengths of beliefs. Even though trends towards more pragmatic and business-oriented farming were found, the majority of the newcomers were fairly committed.

TI Strategic market planning for value-added natural beef products: A
   cluster analysis of Colorado consumers
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE natural beef; consumer demand; targeted marketing
AB In the past decade, sales of meat products labeled as natural (minimally processed) and produced without antibiotics and hormones have increased dramatically. In response to growing demand for meat products differentiated by various production attributes, many smaller-scale beef enterprises are considering direct marketing of their beef products to end-consumers as a viable approach to sustaining their family farming operations. This research uses survey data from Colorado consumers, and factor and cluster analysis to determine market segments for various (varied by production protocols and other meat attributes) natural beef products. Findings from the cluster analysis indicate that there are multiple segments of consumers who are likely to purchase natural beef, and that different segments are motivated by different factors. The most important factor explaining almost two-thirds of the differences among consumer responses relates to consumers' perceptions of the importance of meat attributes related to production practices (e.g. use of antibiotics, hormones and environmentally friendly grazing). Interestingly, the two consumer segments that are willing to pay a significantly higher premium for natural, local beef are motivated by different aspects of the meat and its intrinsic production attributes. One segment, representing 12.5% of consumers, ranked the importance of all production attributes significantly lower than the sample average. Consumers in this segment appear to be motivated by their perceptions of the extrinsic quality of natural beef products. The other segment, 13% of consumers, appears to be altruistic, ranking all production attributes such as 'no antibiotics', 'no hormones', and 'humane treatment', significantly higher than all of the other clusters. These results indicate the potential strength of production methods (and marketing of such quality differences) as product differentiation criteria. This paper illustrates the type of market research that may be useful for beef producers seeking value-added marketing opportunities, and portrays the types of consumers who are fueling the growth in natural meats in the United States. Such market analysis can facilitate producers' ability to effectively develop product concepts, labeling and promotional strategies targeted at the most receptive consumer segments, and illustrates that there is more than one type of consumer interested in purchasing products differentiated by sustainable production methods.

AB Improving our understanding of phosphorus (P) or nitrogen (N) fertilization on growth and nutritional status of two woody colonizer species, alder (Alnus crispa (Has.) Pursh) or aspen (Populus deltoides Marsh.), using de-inking paper sludge (DPS) as an organic soil amendment is an avenue to develop sustainable restoration. Factorial greenhouse experiments were therefore conducted to determine the best combination of DPS and fertilizer on growth and nutritional status of woody species grown in degraded soils. For alder, five level of DPS (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80% DPS) in clay substrate or four levels of DPS (0, 10, 20 and 30% DPS) in sand substrate were studied in combination with three levels of P (0, 0.75 and 1.5 g P kg(-1) DPS). Similarly, the same levels of DPS in clay or sand substrates were studied in combination with four levels of N (5, 10 and 15 g N kg(-1) DPS) for aspen. For alder, the use of DPS in quantities greater than 30% in substrate without supplemental P caused a reduction in alder growth and leaf N content. However, alder showed reasonable growth and nutrition, regardless of the proportion of DPS in the substrate when P was adjusted to 0.75 g kg(-1) DPS (d.w.). For aspen, the addition of DPS without supplemental N decreased growth and leaf N content. However, aspen demonstrated satisfactory growth and nutrition when DPS was included at less than 60% of DPS in the substrate and when substrate N was adjusted to 10 or 15 g kg(-1) DPS (d.w.). The results of this study suggest that one time heavy application of DPS constitutes a potentially effective organic amendment for soil restoration purposes, but require additional fertilizers to sustain plant growth and nutrition.

AB Little is known about restoring the perennial herbaceous understory of Midwestern deciduous woodlands, despite the significant and widespread degradation of remnants due to human activities. Because many woodland understory species have reproductive characters that make reestablishment from seed slow or difficult, we investigated transplanting as a strategy for introducing 24 species to a degraded early-successional woodland in central Iowa, U.S.A. Plants were planted in single-species groups of generally four individuals, and then monitored for survival five times over a 7-year period, and for flowering during the first year. After 7 years, persistence of these groups was 57% averaged across species. Survival in years 5-7 does not reflect individuals that spread beyond the original planting units by self-sowing or vegetative spread and is therefore a minimum estimate of the abundance of many species at the site. Mean percent flowering was 72% across single-species groups for 15 species monitored. We consider these survival and flowering rates acceptable indicators of establishment success, especially given drought conditions at our site in the first few years and lack of weed control beyond the first year, and evidence that transplanted species were establishing outside the original planting locations. Additional work is needed to investigate regional differences in transplant success, and methods for sustainable production of species are not suitable for introduction by seed. We caution that our results do not necessarily apply to the restoration of rare species.

AB Selective logging may become a form of sustainable use of Amazon forest ecosystems since most part of the forest biomass is maintained and the impacts on the exploited area are lower than in comparison to those under other land uses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of selective logging on some soil physical characteristics. The study area lies about 80 km north of Manaus and the vegetation is a humid tropical rainforest. Seven to ten trees/ha (DAP > 55 cm) were felled and removed by a D6 bulldozer, in 1993. Six disturbance classes were defined in the logged plots, with three replicates each: tractor track, center of clearing, edge of clearing, edge of forest, remaining forest and control forest. Soil under tractor tracks represented 13.8% of the exploited area, and showed higher values of bulk density, and penetration resistance, and lower macroporosity and available water for plants than the other disturbance classes. The other classes were less affected and no significant differences were observed between their soil properties and the control forest, indicating selective logging as a practice that causes less impact on soils of Amazon forest ecosystems.

AB The present study aims to describe the population dynamics and state of the fishery of the mud cockle Anadara tuberculosa (locally know as piangua) in three harvesting areas along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica (Chomes, Purruja and Rincon) and to put the results in context with this species in other Costa Rican areas as well as with other Anadara spp. around the globe. The study is based on a five-month sampling period from October, 2003 through April, 2004 during which monthly length frequency measurements and tagging experiments were carried out. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters, K and L., (0.14 and 63.15, respectively) revealed a growth performance (phi'= 2.75) which is in the range of reported values for this family of bivalves, indicating the accuracy of these values. Estimated exploitation rates range from 0.62 (Rincon) to 0.76 (Purruja) and exceed sustainable levels at all study sites. The strong overharvesting in these areas, also mirrored by the low average harvested cockle sizes relative to less exploited areas of Costa Rica and elsewhere, is due to the relatively small clam populations in each fishing area, the easy accessibility and the high economic importance of the species to the local resource users. If conservation measures are not implemented it is probable that A. tuberculoso may follow its formerly abundant and bigger sister species, Anadara grandis (chucheca), on its way to local extinction.

AB A total of 311 sharptooth smooth-hound Mustelus dorsalis were collected in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica from March 1999 to May 2000 to determine reproduction and feeding habits. The fishes were collected using hook and line. 250 females and 61 males were identified. The females are bigger (550-660 mm) and heavier (400-1000 g) than males (500-585 mm and 200-300 g, respectively). All samples collected were mature and the minimum length to first maturity observed is 500 and 541 mm for females and males, respectively. From September to March individuals were mature, while samples caught during April and August were immature. A total of 1259 embryos were analyzed. Number of embryos per liter ranged from two to six, the total length is from 130 to 205 imn and the weight from 6 to 35 g. This shark is a polyphagous opportunistic carnivore that preys on crustaceans (Squilla hancocki, S. parva, Litopenaeus sp.), fishes (Anchoa sp., Caranx sp., Lu anus sp., Engraulis sp.) and mollusks (Loligo sp. and Octopus sp.). Main prey item was S. hancocki. The presence of mature sharks of both sexes along the year and the consumption of food items associated to shallow coastal rocky waters suggest that this sector of Nicoya Gulf is a nursery ground and an essential habitat. Based on these results the establishment of an integral management plan is proposed.

DE public health; medical assistance; Public Policies
AB Public health and healthcare originally started out separately from one another in the past, having later further developed taking different paths in modern times. The major development the health systems underwent in the last half of the 20th century entailed a heightening of the individual standpoint and a division of these two approaches despite the attempts made to bring them together as of the WHO Alma-Ata Conference in 1978. The waning of rationalism and other social phenomena had a hand the collective or population-oriented focus being focused on to a lesser degree in Public Health, but these trends also gave rise to a growing problem of rationality in individual healthcare and sustainability in the public health systems. The debate on the current scene stands to set out the sustainability-related problems mediated by internal and external agents and to revise Public Health's possible contribution to the improvement thereof by advocating yet a further attempt at bringing together and integrating these two diverging standpoints.

Industrialisation, however, brought about their destruction: more than half of the estuary's wetlands have disappeared. Within the context of sustainable development, this article explores the geolhistorical relationship between society and the environment in the high marsh area of Isle-aux-Grues, a relationship that respects the natural processes and limits of this ecosystem, unlike what can be observed in many other wetlands in the estuary. Over the past four centuries, humans have developed a sustainable relationship with nature by using the high marsh area of Isle-aux-Grues for hunting, fishing, harvesting marsh hay and leisure activities.

AB This article looks at the international opening of a regional pressure group based in Switzerland, the Groupentent de la population de montagne du Valais romand (French-speaking Valais mountain population group). Three factors explain how this opening came, about in the nineties: debates about Switzerland's membership of the European Economic Area, providing a fertile terrain for cross-border and international cooperation, fear of outsiders taking over the region via the Alpine Convention, which was to become a federating theme, and the organisation of mountain dwellers' interests on a European scale, which acts as a sustainable driving force behind the relations set up. In turn, this international opening was to change the "geography" of the group itself.

SO REVUE DE GEOGRAPHIE ALPINE-JOURNAL OF ALPINE RESEARCH

DE Information and Communication Technologies (ICT's); sustainable
   development; territories; mountain; actors
AB The development of ICT's and their associated uses raises the question as to how these can tie in with the notion of sustainable development. Although the most common approach consists in examining the possible impacts of ICT development in economic, social and environmental terms, the ability of information processing and communication technologies to be integrated within these three dimensions has still to be explored. Taking the notion of territory into consideration would seem to be a suitable way of answering this question. This is how two research teams came to exchange synergies and work together on a comparative analysis of the logic behind the installation of networks and the development of uses in the Maurienne and Vesubie valleys. This article presents the first results of the research programme, following identification of a certain number of challenges stemming from the links between ICT's and sustainable development and a brief characterisation of the geographic area. These results underline the importance of meshing given the smaller level of investment in the area of ICT uses. However, specific uses do emerge in certain conditions, which lead to the offering and possible mobilisation of resources specific to the territories. The ability of territories to break free from the control and influence of external actors would explain the emergence of such uses. From being seen as generic resources needed to develop territories, ICT's have acquired the status of resource operators. This status has yet to be characterised.

SO RIVISTA DI BIOLOGIA-BIOLOGY FORUM

DT Article
AB The first of the Millennium Development Goals - halve the proportion of people who suffer from hunger by 2015 - is essential for eradicating poverty, as most of the poor live in rural areas. The role of agriculture is, therefore, key to the fight against poverty. Nevertheless, over the last years rich countries diminished their official development assistance for agricultural development and some of them proposed and pushed for a new model of agriculture based on biotechnology. Such a new model of agriculture is presented by its supporters as a means to contribute to the elimination of poverty, as it intends to maximise the crop production.
   However, it does not take into consideration that policies fighting hunger:
   - need a more comprehensive approach;
   - must take into consideration socio-economic and environmental peculiarities, especially local needs and traditional knowledge and practices. Generically modified technology goes against these basic requirements, as it is designed to suit multinational enterprises in the North.
   When drafting development policies, rich and poor countries must bear in mind that the framework of the Millennium Development Goals, to which 189 Nations committed, requires a coherent approach to empower the poor, especially women, and promote traditional knowledge of indigenous people and local communities, as well as ensuring environmental sustainability. The fight to poverty and hunger will not be won and people will still go hungry if the fundamental causes of hunger and food insecurity are not tackled, whereas genetically modified technology is not based on this assumption.

AB In order to improve the capacity of bottom trawl fishing gears to reduce catches of young fish and discards in a highly exploited demersal trawl fisheries in the Mediterranean, the size-selection performance of a 36-mm square-mesh codend and two sorting grids with 20 and 15 mm bar spacing was assessed. Alternate hauls were used to assess the selectivity of 36-mm square-mesh codend. Selectivity of sorting grids was assessed using a double codend in which fish that escaped through the and were captured in the lower codend while other fish were guided into the upper codend. The mean selection length (L-50) for European hake was 18.5 cm and that for the Atlantic horse mackerel was 14.0 cm with the 36-mm square-mesh codend. These values are close to their current minimum landing sizes (20 cm for hake and 12 cm for horse mackerel). The sorting grid with 20-mm bar spacing showed L-50 value of 13.3 cm for hake, suggesting that a larger grid-spacing would be needed to obtain sufficient sorting performance. Similarly, for Atlantic mackerel the estimated L-50 of 14.3 cm indicates that larger grid spacing is required to attain an L-50 that would be close to the current MLS (18 cm). For Atlantic horse mackerel and red mullet, the L-50 obtained with the sorting grid with 20-mm bar spacing was close to the MLS of these species (the MLS of red mullet is 11 cm). The selectivity of the sorting and with 15-mm bar spacing was generally very poor. Size-selection performance of sorting grids was assessed for the first time in the local fisheries. In order to effectively improve size-selection, seasonal and depth-dependent differences between target and by-catch species must be taken into account, which is a good indicator of the difficulty of implementing a single mesh size or grid spacing in the Mediterranean demersal trawl fishery.

AB The worldwide growth of the marine aquarium market has contributed to the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. Enforcing the legislation on importing ornamental species has led some European traders to concentrate on local species. Portugal is used as a case study of marine ornamental fish and invertebrate collection in European waters. One hundred and seventy two species occurring in Portuguese waters (mainland, the Azores and Madeira archipelagos) were considered as potential targets for the marine aquarium industry, some of which are already traded on a regular basis (e.g. Clibanarius erythropus, Lysmata seticaudata, Cerithium vulgatum, Hinia reticulata and Ophioderma longicauda). To ensure appropriate management and conservation of these resources, the following options have been evaluated: banning the harvest and trade of all marine ornamental species from European waters; creating sanctuaries and "no take zones"; issuing collection permits; creating certified wholesalers; implementing the use of suitable gear and collecting methods; setting minimum and maximum size limits, establishing species-based quotas; protecting rare, or "key stone" species and organisms with poor survivability in captivity; establishing closed seasons; culturing ornamental organisms; and creating an "eco-fee" to support research and management. Establishing this sustainable alternative fishery may help minimise the economical and social impacts caused by the crash of important food fisheries in Portugal and other European and West African countries.

AB The management of urban stormwater and flooding is challenging, particularly within older, post-industrial urban environments where infrastructure, housing and businesses already operate. The urban environment constrains opportunities for the development and integration of new approaches to drainage management, particularly the use of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS). These issues are investigated through a case study of Glasgow. The northeast of the city suffered significant urban flooding in July 2002 following an intense convective summer storm. This event overloaded the urban drainage system, which was heavily integrated and led to the back flow of foul water into streets and homes. This study examines the response to this event and the construction of an integrated drainage management plan for the city, the Glasgow Strategic Drainage Plan (GSDP), which includes greater use of SuDS in tackling the city's capacity problems. Reflecting on the interdisciplinary nature of urban drainage management, this study adopts a social science method, undertaking semi-structured interviews with key actors involved in producing the GSDP.

AB Since the concept of sustainability has become central in the recent years, it is paramount to create guides that allow to evaluate the improvements, trends and state of territories under this approach. This article describes a methodological proposal that permit to deduct some improvements in the assessment and definition of the concepts of diversity, inequality and spatial cohesion. At the same time, some topics that need to be improved are identified, specially those referred to the theoretical development and practical measurement of sustainability and the availability of statistical information that fulfil some requirements such us spatial desegregation and temporal continuity.

AB A hybrid architecture of integrated circuits is expectedly able to overcome the serious difficulties encountered in the scaling down of conventional CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) circuits. In this architecture a silicon-based CMOS circuit controls a nanoscopic crossbar structure, in turn hosting at each cross-point a collection of functional molecules able to mimic by themselves the behaviour of a flash memory cell. The hybrid architecture, however, poses several problems: the set-up of an economically sustainable technology for the preparation of 10(11) cross-points cm(-2); the demultiplexing of the addressing lines to allow their linkage to the microelectronic circuit; the grafting of the functional molecules to those cross-points via batch processing; and the design, synthesis and electrical characterization of the functional molecules, which have been identified as the most important ones. This work is devoted to discussing which practical solutions can be adopted for the large-scale production of hybrid circuits on the 0.1 Tbit integration scale.

AB Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine whether periodic presumptive treatment (PPT) for sexually transmitted infections (STI) in service women could be implemented in 3 border provinces of Laos and whether its implementation was associated with a reduction in the prevalence of cervical infections.
   Study Design: Four hundred forty-two service women were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire in 3 border provinces at baseline (day 1) and 419 3 months (day 90) later. Azithromycin at a dosage of 1 g was administered at monthly intervals over 3 months in Khammouane province, on days 1, 30, and 90 in Oudomxai and days 1, 60, and 90 in Savarmakhet. Urine samples were collected at baseline and day 90 for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing.
   Results: Baseline samples showed very high levels of both gonorrhea and/or chlamydia of 42.7% in Oudomxai, 39.9% in Khammouane, and 22.7% in Savannakhet. At day 90, after 2 or 3 rounds of PPT, these were, respectively, 12.3%, 21.9%, and 17.0%. Overall, the prevalence of any cervical infection decreased by 45% from 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 28.1-36.9) at day 1 to 18.0% (95% CI = 14.5-22.1) at day 90 (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Lower prevalences of cervical infections were observed after 2 to 3 rounds of PPT. The optimal time between rounds of PPT is uncertain, but while these high STI rates prevail, a 1- to 2-month gap is recommended. After the introduction of this PPT project, costs of STI drugs reduced 5-fold making PPT a sustainable intervention in Laos for service women until user-friendly services are developed.

AB This study examines adverse selection in a subsidized voluntary health insurance scheme, the Rural Mutual Health Care (RMHC) scheme, in a poor rural area of China. The study was made possible by a unique longitudinal data set: the total sample includes 3492 rural residents from 1020 households. Logistic regression was employed for the data analysis.
   The results show that although this subsidized scheme achieved a considerable high enrollment rate of 71% of rural residents, adverse selection still exists. In general, individuals with worse health status are more likely to enroll in RMHC than individuals with better health status. Although the household is set as the enrollment unit for the RMHC for the purpose of reducing adverse selection, nearly 1/3 of enrolled households are actually only partially enrolled. Furthermore, we found that adverse selection mainly occurs in partially enrolled households. The non-enrolled individuals in partially enrolled households have the best health status, while the enrolled individuals in partially enrolled households have the worst health status. Pre-RMHC, medical expenditure for enrolled individuals in partially enrolled households was 206.6 yuan per capita per year, which is 1.7 times as much as the pre-RMHC medical expenditure for non-enrolled individuals in partially enrolled households. The study also reveals that the pre-enrolled medical expenditure per capita per year of enrolled individuals was 9.6% higher than the pre-enrolled medical expenditure of all residents, including both enrolled and non-enrolled individuals.
   In conclusion, although the subsidized RMHC scheme reached a very high enrollment rate and the household is set as the enrollment unit for the purpose of reducing adverse selection, adverse selection still exists, especially within partially enrolled households. Voluntary RMHC will not be financially sustainable if the adverse selection is not fully taken into account. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines trends in chronic disease outcomes from initiation of a specialised chronic disease treatment programme through to incorporation of programme activities into routine service delivery. We reviewed clinical records of 98 participants with confirmed renal disease or hypertension in a remote indigenous community health centre in Northern Australia. For each participant the review period spanned an initial three years while participating in a specialised cardiovascular and renal disease treatment programme and a subsequent three years following withdrawal of the treatment programme. Responsibility for care was incorporated into the comprehensive primary care service which had been recently redeveloped to implement best practice care plans. The time series analysis included at least six measures prior to handover of the specialised programme and six following handover. Main outcome measures were trends in blood pressure (BP) control, and systolic and diastolic BP. We found an improvement in BP control in the first 6-12 months of the programme, followed by a steady declining trend. There was no significant difference in this trend between the pre- compared to the post-programme withdrawal period. This finding was consistent for control at levels below 130/80 and 140/90, and for trends in mean systolic and diastolic BP. Investigation of the sustainability of programme outcomes presents major challenges for research design. Sustained success in the management of chronic disease through primary care services requires better understanding of the causal mechanisms related to clinical intervention, the basis upon which they can be 'institutionalised' in a given context, and the extent to which they require regular revitalisation to maintain their effect.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The recent diversification of domestic tourism needs in Japan, seen particularly in increasing demand for ecotourism and green tourism, shows that there is much potential for further development of nature tourism, much of which takes place in protected areas. However, numerous challenges exist. Based on case-study research on tourism taking place in three national parks, four common success factors of these sites were identified, namely, institutional arrangements; self-regulations related to conservation; high environmental awareness; and the existence of partnerships. This article demonstrates how, under the current system of Japanese national park management, community-based tourism can be facilitated by building upon these success factors. This would address the existing challenges to tourism in protected areas, and in turn would significantly contribute to the sustainable management of protected areas. Finally, this article points to the need for future research that focuses on the wider applicability of the lessons learned from the Japanese experience.

AB Soil fertility and agricultural systems sustainability depend upon soil organic matter (SOM). The effects of pasture management intensity on SOM are not well understood. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of management intensity of 'Pensacola' bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) pastures on the light density fraction of SOM (LD-SOM), the fraction that responds most readily to changes in pasture management practices. Pastures were grazed from 2001-2004 at four management intensities, defined as the combination of stocking method, N fertilization, and stocking rate (SR). Treatments were continuously stocked (CS) Low (40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and SR of 1.4 animal units ha(-1) (AU = 500 kg live weight)); CS Moderate (120 kg N and SR of 2.8 AU); CS High (360 kg N and SR of 4.2 AU); and rotationally stocked with a 7-d grazing period and 21-d resting period (360 kg N and SR of 4.2 AU). Composite soil samples (0-8 cm) from each pasture were collected in 2004. Management intensity did not affect C and N concentration in the bulk soil, but it did impact C and N concentrations of size fractions of LD-SOM. In particles from 250 to 2000 mu m, both C and N concentration were greater with increasing management intensity. In particles < 53 mu m, however, the lowest management intensity presented the greatest soil C and N concentrations. Increasing C and N in slow turn over SOM fractions with increased management intensity may result in greater C sequestration and potential soil fertility, but the increased likelihood of negative environmental impact and the questionable sustainability of high N fertilizer rates must also be considered.

AB Reductions in soil porosity through compaction and losses in nutrients through site organic matter removal are considered potentially detrimental effects of forest operations to site productivity. Defining sustainable forest practices is complicated, however, by the possible contrasting responses of commercial tree species to these disturbances. We compared the productivity and foliar nitrogen (N) nutrition of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) and hybrid white spruce (Picea glauca X engelmannii [Moenchl Voss) at Year 12 across organic matter removal and soil compaction treatments in the subboreal forests of central British Columbia. Nitrogen availability peaked in the years following tree harvest, and by Year 12 in situ rates of net N mineralization were uniformly low across treatments. Low rates of N supply were partially offset by intermediate disturbances (forest floor removal alone or compaction through forest floors), which increased N uptake and height growth for hybrid white spruce. Lodgepole pine, in contrast, had near adequate foliar N concentrations and higher tree productivity across the complete gradient of soil disturbances. Some advantage in N nutrition for lodgepole pine might be provided by ectomycorrhiza through host-specific Suillus species. Fruiting bodies of Suillus species had, on average, 40% higher N concentrations than other common ectomycorrhiza (ECM) fungi found across the plots. The large and often contrasting differences in growth and N nutrition between lodgepole pine and hybrid white spruce demonstrate the possible challenges in defining universal criteria for detrimental soil disturbance.

AB A deterministic model for assessing the risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate from land-based sludge disposal was evaluated. A controlled large-lysimeter experiment was set up to monitor movement of nitrate through soil. Four large lysimeters of 900 mm length were packed with Manawatu fine sandy loam (a Dystric Fluventric Eutrochrept), on top of which 200 mm of municipal sewage sludge was applied. One of the lysimeters was planted with pasture (Lolium perenne and Festuca arundacea), one with a willow tree (Salix sp. 'Tongoio'), another with a poplar tree (Populus sp. 'Kawa'), and one was left bare. Bromide was used as a conservative tracer. Movement of bromide and nitrate was analysed in the effluent from the base of the lysimeters.
   The processes of water and nutrient transport were modelled using a mechanistic scheme based on Richards' equation for water transport and the convection-dispersion equation (CDE) for nutrient transport. These equations were both linked to a sink term for plant uptake. The model simulated well the transport of water and movement of bromide in the four different lysimeters. The agreement between measured and simulated nitrate leaching was also reasonable considering the simplified model. Uptake of nitrogen by trees reduced the quantity of nitrogen available for leaching. The model could aid development of sustainable management of land-based sewage sludge disposal in terms of nitrate leaching. The next step will be to further develop the model for heavy metal movement, as heavy metals are common co-contaminants of sewage sludge. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB SCIENCE HAS CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL to contribute to sustainable development. Much of this potential remains latent, however, due to the divisions that exist within and between the producers of scientific information and the users of this and other sources of knowledge. A response to this situation has seen the emergence of 'sustainability science', which aims to overcome divisions between knowledge sources of various forms, including the social and natural sciences and alternative epistemologies that warrant acknowledgement. We review the key defining characteristics of sustainability science, and describe some examples of science-based South African initiatives, aimed at promoting sustainable development, that incorporate many of these characteristics. We suggest that, with some reinforcement of their sustainability science base, these examples provide good templates for broader application. To retain the experience gained through such projects and to build organizational memory, there is a strong case for the establishment of trans-disciplinary centres for sustainability science in South Africa.

AB This paper shows how to evaluate well performance under conditions of reservoir and completion uncertainty while also considering the impact of completion decisions and operating constraints. This topic is important because it can help to reconcile the often large gap between short-term deliverability and reliable and sustainable performance.
   Table I presents a list of operating constraints, and this paper includes examples regarding the application of some of the constraints. This table also includes consideration for the type of surveillance that is needed to apply the constraints. Discussion within the paper shows that the most relevant types of operating constraints are often not being used and also addresses appropriate operating limits for completions with sand control.
   Completion selection and design influence operating constraints. Examples within the paper illustrate methods to determine appropriate operating constraints. The examples also demonstrate the potential advantage of frac-packed completions or long horizontal completions with regard to preventing fines movement and increasing the longevity of both the completion equipment and the productivity.
   To aid with probabilistic performance forecasting, the paper includes a tabulation of published skin values including some permeability data.

LA English
DT Article
DE trust; performance excellence; living systems; social networks;
   adaptation to change; exploring possibilities
AB In the last 20 years significant developments in science, technology and the world economy have brought dramatic change in almost every sphere of human activity. Today's pace of change has become non-linear, accelerating and almost totally unpredictable. Our present search for ways to achieve sustainable excellence in performance are not to be found in models or metaphors of an organization as an 'ideal machine' from physics, but in those of biology and ecology. In an ecology-oriented worldview, an organization's image is that of a vibrant network of interacting human agents. The new image of the competitive field is now that of a continually evolving business landscape, shaped by the incessant waves of technological and economic change. Even though conventional assumptions about managing organizations-which shape actions-need to be replaced, the fundamental objectives of leadership remain nevertheless the same. First, it is important to maintain a high level of current performance, a task that always demands good coordination of all value adding activities. Second, leaders must enable a smooth organizational adaptation to emerging conditions, by engaging human resources to explore future possibilities and innovate new products and processes that will make the most of new opportunities. The achievement of both of these goals is possible only in proportion to the degree of trust among the interacting human agents that comprise the organization. Trust in this context measures the quality of relationships maintained within an organization and with all its key stakeholders.

DE Scotland; land reform; processes of enclosure/globalization; place;

ID HIGHLAND SCOTLAND; GEOGRAPHY; CONSERVATION
AB In the context of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, this paper examines the political possibilities that are created when land is removed as a commodity from circuits of global capital and when, in areas under crofting tenure, it comes under collective ownership. Drawing evidence from the case of the North Harris Trust, Isle of Harris, the largest community purchase of land thus far, the paper considers how place is re-configured in complex and contingent ways through the re-working of the materiality and meanings of the land and of nature. The latter includes disturbing class-based and colonizing discourses of 'wilderness', on the one hand and, on the other, exploring the ways through which the wind is commodified. The paper argues that this re-constitution of land and nature does not lead in a simplistic way to a reversal of processes of enclosure (and globalization) but rather, through the co-performance of land and nature in the new political spaces created by a community trust, the relationship between the 'local' and the 'global' is altered such that a more sustainable and socially just future may be imagined.

AB This paper reviews the literature on travel feedback programs (TFPs). These constitute soft measures designed to change travel behaviour, mainly from automobile to non-automobile travel, in mobility management. We classified TFPs according to place, technique, procedure, and communication media, and reviewed the effectiveness of 10 TFPs in Japan. We found that TFPs in Japan reduced CO2 emissions by about 19% and car use by about 18%, while increasing the use of public transport by about 50%. In addition, we found that TFP effectiveness increased when participants were asked to make behavioural plans to change their travel behaviour. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Design and evaluation of an adaptive incentive mechanism for sustained
   educational online communities
SO USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION
LA English
DT Article
DE online communities; virtual communities; participation; ratings;
   incentive mechanisms; personalized rewards
AB Most online communities, such as discussion forums, file-sharing communities, e-learning communities, and others, suffer from insufficient user participation in their initial phase of development. Therefore, it is important to provide incentives to encourage participation, until the community reaches a critical mass and "takes off". However, too much participation, especially of low-quality can also be detrimental for the community, since it leads to information overload, which makes users leave the community. Therefore, to regulate the quality and the quantity of user contributions and ensure a sustainable level of user participation in the online community, it is important to adapt the rewards for particular forms of participation for individual users depending on their reputation and the current needs of the community. An incentive mechanism with these properties is proposed. The main idea is to measure and reward the desirable user activities and compute a user participation measure, then cluster the users based on their participation measure into different classes, which have different status in the community and enjoy special privileges. For each user, the reward for each type of activity is computed dynamically based on a model of community needs and an individual user model. The model of the community needs predicts what types of contributions (e.g. more new papers or more ratings) are most valuable at the current moment for the community. The individual model predicts the style of contributions of the user based on her past performance (whether the user tends to make high-quality contributions or not, whether she fairly rates the contributions of others). The adaptive rewards are displayed to the user at the beginning of each session and the user can decide what form of contribution to make considering the rewards that she will earn. The mechanism was evaluated in an online class resource-sharing system, Comtella. The results indicate that the mechanism successfully encourages stable and active user participation; it lowers the level of information overload and therefore enhances the sustainability of the community.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are major contaminants of indoor air, with concentrations often several times higher than outdoors. They are recognized as causative agents of "building-related illness" or "sick-building syndrome". Our previous laboratory test-chamber studies have shown that the potted-plant/root-zone microorganism microcosm can eliminate high concentrations of air-borne VOCs within 24 hours, once the removal response has been induced by an initial dose. However, the effectiveness of the potted-plant microcosm in 'real-world' indoor spaces has never previously been tested experimentally. This paper reports the results of a field-study on the effects of potted-plant presence on total VOC (TVOC) levels, measured in 60 offices (12 per treatment), over two 5-9 week periods, using three planting regimes, with two 'international indoor-plant' species. Fourteen VOCs were identified in the office air. When TVOC loads in reference offices rose above 100 ppb, large reductions, of from 50 to 75% (to < 100 ppb), were found in planted offices, under all planting regimes The results indicate that air-borne TVOC levels above a threshold of about 100 ppb stimulate the graded induction of an efficient metabolic VOC-removal mechanism in the microcosm. Follow-up laboratory dose-response experiments, reported in the following paper, confirm the graded induction response, over a wide range of VOC concentrations. The findings together demonstrate that potted-plants can provide an efficient, self-regulating, low-cost, sustainable, bioremediation system for indoor air pollution, which can effectively complement engineering measures to reduce indoor air pollution, and hence improve human wellbeing and productivity.

   content; sustainability; tropical monsoon climate
AB Serious concerns have been raised about the sustainability of conventional mechanized linear wastewater treatment systems in the developing world. Bangkok in Thailand is no exception to these concerns, and merits closer examination. This paper is aimed at unveiling the fundamental facts and characteristics relating to the organic degradation potentials of domestic wastewater in Bangkok. It is supported by evidence from simple laboratory experiments in which existing local conditions were simulated. The results showed that greywater-like qualities of domestic wastewater do predominate in Bangkok, most probably as a result of three main factors: (1) continued use of leaching septic tanks, (2) the tradition of using water after defecation, instead of toilet paper, and (3) high organic degradation potentials under tropical monsoon conditions. Considering the small organic content, coupled with high organic degradation rates of the freshly collected greywater-based sewage in Bangkok, low-cost and decentralized natural treatment systems could be far more suitable for environmental sustainability in such tropical monsoon areas than the implementation of large-scale sewage works.

ID CONTAMINATION
AB The principal water target of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) is to ensure environmental sustainability by halving the proportion of people without access to safe water by 2015. Although great strides have been made in meeting this challenge since the year 2000, the safety of many of these water supplies remains unknown. Acknowledging the weaknesses of current water quality and hydrogeological means of assuring microbial safety, this paper has the objective of developing improved methods for the assessment and management of microbiological water safety based on a 'risk' paradigm. This paper provides evidence for the risk assessment of both conventional aquifer pathways and localised (short circuiting) pathways to 25 wells of three well technology types in Mozambique between 2002 and 2005.* Findings from the research outline improve methods of risk assessment and management by demonstrating that (1) the predominant source of contamination was from animal faeces rather than from latrines/septic tanks, (2) short circuiting is a significant risk to shallow groundwater in developing countries, (3) the use of alternative indicator organisms (e.g. enterococci) may improve risk understanding and (4) the World Health Organisation Water Safety Plans are recommended as an appropriate method of risk management.

AB The Glasgow Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SUDS) Management Project satisfies the first of three phases of the Glasgow Surface Water Management Project. This is Glasgow City Council contribution to the Transformation of Rural and Urban Spatial Structure (TRUST) project, one of the European Union (EU) inter-regional (INTERREG IIIB) funded research projects. The contribution of SUDS to the overall catchment dynamics of cities such as Glasgow was studied. Fifty-seven sites within 46 areas of Glasgow were identified for initial investigation, including a preliminary SUDS feasibility assessment and a desk study relating to historical planning issues that may be relevant for subsequent future development and regeneration options. The methodologies for a SUDS Option Decision Support Key and a corresponding SUDS Option Decision Support Matrix that are adaptable to different cities and countries have been outlined. The key should be used during a preliminary site investigation and can help to classify potential SUDS sites. Corresponding findings should be compared with the conditions listed in the matrix, which will inform the planner about potentially-suitable SUDS techniques for a particular site. Detailed design guidelines were then drafted for seven selected representative SUDS demonstration areas including the Pollok Centre area. This case study, for example, is representative for a class of 24 areas and sites. Combinations of infiltration trenches or swales with ponds or underground storage were the most likely SUDS options for the majority of the demonstration areas.

ID COLLECTIVE ACTION
AB Integrated Watershed Management involves many aspects of the biophysical and socio economic world operating at many different scales. It is a complex process since it involves a wide range of stakeholders that live, and compete for limited resources, at different temporal and spatial scales. In order to gain knowledge about appropriate approaches for integrating natural resources management with rural development strategies, this study details a framework designed to implement research and development activities in the Fuquene watershed of Colombia.
   The framework integrates key spatial information, available at different scales for the site, to facilitate envisioning different land-use scenarios and their impacts upon water resources. Subsequently, selected alternative scenarios of the impact on the identified externalities are analyzed using optimization models. Opportunities for, and constraints to, promoting cooperation among users are identified, using economic games in which more sustainable land-use or management alternatives are suggested. Strategic alliances and collective action are implemented to test the feasibility of environmental and economic alternatives. Their implementation is supported by co-funding schemes designed with private and public stakeholders in the study area. Research needs and limitations of the methodology are discussed The approach described here shows that integration is accomplished only when different scales of decision-making are considered and if activities at plot detail are linked with effects at the watershed scale.

AB The large numbers of common ciders Somateria mollissima and king ciders S. spectabilis wintering in southwest Greenland are subject to intensive hunting, and in addition to direct harvest an unknown number of birds are wounded and become carriers of embedded lead shot. We conducted the first assessment of the magnitude of this undesirable side effect of hunting in Greenland by X-raying 879 common and 114 king eiders collected by local fishermen and hunters during three winters (2000-2002). On average, 22% of all common eiders carried embedded shot, but proportions were strongly age dependent; of first-winter (1W) birds 13.2%, of immatures (IM) 16.4%, and of adults (AD) 29.1% were carriers. For king eiders the proportions were similar: 11.3, 10 and 20%, respectively, were carriers. Adult common ciders collected in fjord areas were significantly less burdened (24.5%) than birds collected in the more heavily hunted coastal areas (35.0%). Among inflicted birds, 1W birds contained more pellets (mean 2.2) than AD (mean 1.7), despite the adults' longer time to accumulate pellets from multiple inflictions, which suggests that the most burdened juveniles die before entering the older age class. From the proportion of wounded I W birds (13.2%) we modelled the infliction rates, i.e. the proportion of an age class that become pellet carriers each year, for older birds (IM+AD) to be at least 1.8-3%, assuming that annual survival of adult eiders falls within the range 0.8-0.9. Assuming that roughly 35% of the 463,000 common ciders estimated to winter in southwest Greenland are juveniles, 13% are immatures, and 52% adults (fourth winter and older), then each winter up to 30,000 ciders would become new carriers of embedded shot (2 1,000 juveniles, 1,200-1,800 immatures and 4,800-7,300 adults). As wounded birds may risk increased mortality in severe winters and reduced reproductive output, the infliction has implications for the demographic models used to assess sustainable eider harvest levels. There is a need for follow-up studies of regional variation in infliction, and to identify ways to possibly reduce the hunters' unintended impact on their game populations.

AB This article explores the importance of gender sensitive analysis of conflict constructed as ethnic strife for conceptualising and developing new and more effective ways of intervening in this type of war. It points out that because most of the physical violence and suffering in these conflicts occur at the community level, they generate massive refugee movements, causing not only physical and material devastation, but also the destruction of social networks and local communities. This critically affects the prospects for refugee return, which is central to any sustainable peace agreement and post-conflict democratic development. In searching for an answer to the question of how to address effectively the issue of reconciliation in such a context, the discussion highlights the centrality of acknowledging gender dimensions and dynamics of this type of war, as a way of uncovering and recognising a reconciliatory potential of women as women organising and activism that often occurs in these conflicts. By focusing specifically on the initiatives of some women's groups during the war in the former Yugoslavia, which aimed at rebuilding trust and broken social networks at a communal level, the article examines the reasons why women as women often opt for alternative forms of political mobilisation. It argues that this type of activism has an important potential for conflict resolution and should be recognised in a fundamental way in any attempt to build peace in conflict zones.

DE farm size; enterprise objective; maximization; and production

AB This study attempts to identify the poultry meat farmers' objectives of production, analyse their socio-economic characteristics, determine the optimal farm size and prioritize the constraints to achieving the enterprise objectives. Taking Osun State of Nigeria poultry meat farmers as a case study, data on poultry meat business enterprise objective(s), socio-economic characteristics of farmers and farms, quantity and prices of inputs and output, and constraints to production were collected. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics, regression technique and importance indices.
   From the profit function analysis, the profit maximizing output level was 1034 birds which was higher and more profitable than the mean output level (765 birds) that farmers operated. As many as 88 percent of the farmers sampled produced below the profit maximising level of output. Producing at the average profit maximizing level of output (223 birds) resulted in lower level of output and lower total profit than the mean and profit maximizing output levels. About 90 percent of the farmers produced higher than average profit maximizing output level. The constraints that limit farm size and which could affect sustainability of the enterprise were irregular demand of poultry meat, poor feed quality, high mortality rate and feed price instability in that order. These constraints, if addressed, would lead to increase in poultry meat supply to meet local demand and export.

TI About the competitiveness of the present and future EU ethanol industry
SO ZUCKERINDUSTRIE
LA English
DT Article
DE bioenergy; biofuels; fuel ethanol; production cost; competitiveness
AB Fuel ethanol is perceived by some as not competitive because it is more expensive to produce in the EU than in countries where fuel ethanol has been a reality for 30 years, or because oil is not yet expensive enough. UEPA believes that such a way of looking at things Will unavoidably lead to penalize a green source of energy and make it extremely difficult for the EU to achieve its objectives. Being competitive is the result of an investment (economically and politically speaking) the cost of which should be compared to the cost of not investing at all. Should the EU be totally dependent on non-EU produced ethanol, production costs will be a pointless parameter as highly volatile market prices will be the prevailing factor. Furthermore, UEPA believes that competitiveness should fully integrate the social, health and environmental aspects so that the economy becomes an incentive towards more sustainable decisions and not a hurdle. Unless external costs are internalized, renewable energies will always be penalized hence disrupting the implementation of the EU policy to boost green fuels.

AB The global ethanol market has irrevocably entered upon a new era. High oil prices together with governments increasingly implementing energy and environmental policies to deal with climate change, urban air pollution and energy security is leading to a surge in the number of countries implementing national fuel ethanol programmes. Sugar industries around the world are consequently looking to Brazil - the globe's dominant producer of cane based ethanol - as a plausible model for developing an integrated sugar and ethanol industry. Achieving commercial viability will be key to the longer term sustainable future for any sugar industry diversifying into fuel ethanol. Commercial viability is determined by both the underlying cost structure of production together with the market and policy conditions which determine the price of ethanol on the domestic and world market. Attention in this article is focussed on: the price of sugar; the price of oil; factors driving ethanol production costs - particularly feedstock costs and their likely variability - as well as the extent and longevity of any supportive government policy.

AB Shrimp ponds are traditionally set up in marine coastal areas and can lead to adverse impacts on the environment, especially the destruction of large areas of mangrove forests. Cage culture can be a more sustainable alternative for rearing shrimp, and polyculture with seaweeds may also improve sustainability. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of co-culturing the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and the Philippines seaweed Kappaphycus alvarezii in floating cages. The experiments were carried out in an offshore area near the Aquaculture Research Center of Sao Paulo State's Fishery Institute in Ubatuba - SP - Brazil (24 degrees 26'S; 45 degrees 04'W). Experimental grow-out cages (1.00 m long x 1.00 m wide x 1.00 m deep) were constructed with a polyester/PVC 5 mm-mesh and fixed in PVC floating frames. Postlarvae of L. vannamei were acclimatized and nursed in cages for 20 and 53 days, respectively. Afterwards, juveniles (2.39 +/- 1.62 g) were transferred to 6 experimental grow-out cages at a density of 100 shrimp/m(2). Commercial pellets consisting of 35% crude protein was supplied once a day, and shrimp were harvested after 103 days of growth. In order to test the use of available space in the water column, thalli of the seaweed K. alvarezii were fixed on ropes and attached to floating tubes and set up inside 3 shrimp grow-out cages. Shrimp yield reached production rates as high as 3.23 kg/m(2)/yr with a mean of 2.36 +/- 0.76 kg/m(2)/yr. Seaweed production reached rates of 23.70 kg/m(2)/yr with a mean of 17.47 +/- 5.71 kg/m(2)/yr. There were no negative interferences in co-culturing shrimp and seaweed inside the same cage. Student's t-test showed no statistical differences between the two treatments (monoculture and polyculture) for shrimp weight gain, survival rate, and food conversion ratio. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB A sustainable semi-intensive pond aquaculture technology including major carp species as cash-crop and small indigenous fish species (SIS) as food for the farmers' families is being optimized in Bangladesh. The inclusion of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), a cheap large species affordable by poor farmers, is now being considered. As part of a study on the effects of this filter feeder on polycultures including the SIS punti (Puntius sophore) and mola (Amblypharyngodon mola), an experiment was carried out in the ponds of the Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, to test this fish effects in the presence of the bottom feeders either common carp (Cyprinus carpio) or mrigal (Cirrhinus cirrhosus) on production/reproduction of SIS, on the other fish species and on pond ecology. The data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical techniques.
   Reproduction of both SIS species occurred in all ponds, their fiy numbers, weight and biomass at harvest not being affected either by silver carp or by the bottom feeder species. The addition of silver carp in mrigal ponds had a negative effect on both adult SIS, while its addition to carp ponds bad a weaker negative effect on mola and a positive effect on punti. Common carp favoured mola growth and reduced punti survival. Silver carp performance was not affected by the species of bottom feeder present. Common carp performance was not affected by silver carp. Mrigal harvesting biomass and survival were not affected by silver carp, but its harvesting weight, growth rate and yield decreased respectively by 29%, 42% and 39% in its presence. Large carp and total harvested biomass and yields were over 50% higher when silver carp was also present. In the presence of silver carp, large carp and total yields were 20% higher in common carp ponds, while in its absence they were somewhat higher in mrigal ponds. The FCR calculated considering only the large fish were 10% higher in mrigal ponds. FCR calculated including all species were somewhat higher in common carp ponds without silver carp, and 35% higher in mrigal ponds with silver carp. The observed results are explained and discussed considering the feeding habits of each species, the natural food web, and the ecological processes developing in the ponds.
   The addition of silver carp did not reduce the income obtained from the cash-crop species and could contribute to the nutrition and/or extra income of the fanner's family. From the production and ecological point of views, addition of silver carp to common carp ponds is a better proposition than to add it to mrigal ponds. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peatlands are an important terrestrial carbon store. However, heightened levels of degradation in response to environmental change have resulted in an increased loss of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and an associated rise in the level of discolouration in catchment waters. A significant threat to peatland sustainability has been the installation of artificial drainage ditches. However, recent restoration schemes have pursued drain blocking as a possible strategy for reducing degradation, fluvial carbon loss and water discolouration. This paper investigates the effect of open cut drainage and the impact of drain blocking on DOC and colour dynamics in blanket peat soil-water solutions. Three treatments (intact peat, drained peat and drain-blocked peat) were monitored in an upland blanket peat catchment in the UK. DOC and colour values were significantly higher on the drained slopes compared with those of the intact peat, which in turn had greater DOC and colour values than the drain-blocked slopes. Consequently, drain blocking is shown to be a highly successful technique in reducing both the DOC concentration and level of discolouration in soil waters, even to values lower than those observed for the intact site, which suggests a process of store exhaustion and flushing may operate. The colour per carbon unit (C/C) ratio was significantly higher at the drain-blocked site than either the intact or the drained treatments, while the E4/E6 ratio (fulvic acid/humic acid) was significantly lower at the blocked site compared to the two other treatments. The high C/C and low E4/E6 ratios indicate that drain blocking also modifies the composition of DOC, such that darker-coloured humic substances become more dominant compared to the intact site. This implies disturbance to DOC production and/or transportation processes operating within the peat. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable water use is in serious crisis in the piedmont region of the Taihang Mountains in the North China Plain, owing to rapid groundwater drawdown. Estimating the water requirement for agriculture, the biggest user of groundwater, will be helpful in understanding groundwater decline. Through the use of DSSAT-3-5 wheat and maize models, we assessed water use in winter wheat and maize, two staple crops in the region, in 1987-2001. Trends between groundwater change and simulated agricultural water use were compared. The results showed that groundwater decline was sensitive to simulated crop water requirement and irrigation requirement. According to regression analysis, 100 mm. of water requirement by cultivated land (mainly wheat and maize) resulted in about 0.64 m of groundwater decline. This relationship might be useful in understanding the regional water balance and to help decision-makers control groundwater decline through controlling crop water use or through long-distance water transfer. The study demonstrated the usefulness of using the DSSAT model for estimating crop water use and the effectiveness of clarifying the reason for groundwater decline using the simulation results of water use.

AB Formal assessment systems for agricultural sustainability are necessary for a scientific understanding of policy and planning for sustainable agricultural development. Analytical frameworks for environmental assessments and rural livelihoods assessments, backed by significant international initiatives, have been available for the past decade or so. Agricultural sustainability assessments can benefit greatly from an understanding of such frameworks. The state-of-the-art in environmental, rural livelihoods and agricultural sustainability assessments is evaluated and a framework for assessment of agricultural sustainability is proposed.

AB Mass bathing in sacred water bodies is an age-old ritual in India. Organized outdoor bathing is an important in situ utilization of water bodies, which demands water quality requirements for drinking as well as bathing purposes. Apart from this, the Himalayan rivers have a great potential for hydroelectric power generation due to altitudinal variations. The present study deals with. water quality assessment of rivers in Uttaranchal, in view of their religious importance and ecological sustainability. Based on bio-monitoring assessment, biological water quality criteria have been evolved for rivers of Uttaranchal, indicating various beneficial uses of water quality and their respective levels of characteristics. Out of 60 stretches of 19 rivers, 41 stretches indicated clean water quality of Class 'A', five stretches were slightly polluted (class 'B'), six were moderately polluted (class 'C'), one stretch was highly polluted (class 'D') and there were altogether seven severely polluted (class 'E') stretches. The physico-chemical water quality in most of the rivers of Uttaranchal remained unchanged except of total dissolved solids, which ranged from 90.23 to 121.33 mg/l, total suspended solids varying from 126.5 to 236.5 mg/l and total alkalinity of 37.0 to 96.0 mg/l. Religious places have contributed significant levels of sulphates to water quality (1.66 to 20.0 mg/l). Traces of iron, zinc and copper metals in water and sediments have been observed in clean water quality stretches. Agricultural practices on the river bank may have considerable impact on contribution of pesticide residues such as total Endosulfan, Dieldrin and DDT. Open defecation is the most common activity on river banks, which has significant contribution towards the aesthetic water quality of rivers.

TI Examining the production costs of antiretroviral drugs

DT Article
DE antiretroviral drugs; production cost; price; active pharmaceutical
   ingredients; Brazil
AB Objectives: To present direct manufacturing costs and price calculations of individual antiretroviral drugs, enabling those responsible for their procurement to have a better understanding of the cost structure of their production, and to indicate the prices at which these antiretroviral drugs could be offered in developing country markets.
   Methods: Direct manufacturing costs and factory prices for selected first and second-line antiretroviral drugs were calculated based on cost structure data from a state-owned company in Brazil. Prices for the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) were taken from a recent survey by the World Health Organization (WHO). The calculated prices for antiretroviral drugs are compared with quoted prices offered by privately-owned, for-profit manufacturers.
   Results: The API represents the largest component of direct manufacturing costs (55-99%), while other inputs, such as salaries, equipment costs, and scale of production, have a minimal impact. The calculated prices for most of the antiretroviral drugs studied fall within the lower quartile of the range of quoted prices in developing country markets. The exceptions are those drugs, primarily for second-line therapy, for which the API is either under patent, in short supply, or in limited use in developing countries (e.g. abacavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir).
   Conclusion: The availability of data on the cost of antiretroviral drug production and calculation of factory prices under a sustainable business model provide benchmarks that bulk purchasers of antiretroviral drugs could use to negotiate lower prices. While truly significant price decreases for antiretroviral drugs will depend largely on the future evolution of API prices, the present study demonstrates that for several antiretroviral drugs price reduction is currently possible. Whether or not these reductions materialize will depend on the magnitude of indirect cost and profit added by each supplier over the direct production costs. The ability to achieve price reductions in line with production costs will have critical implications for sustainable treatment for HIV/AIDS in the developing world.

AB Theoretical studies of wildlife population dynamics have proved insightful for sustainable management, where the principal aim is to maximize short-term yield, without risking population extinction. Surprisingly, infectious diseases have not been accounted for in harvest models, which is a major oversight because the consequences of parasites for host population dynamics are well-established. Here, we present a simple general model for a host species subject to density dependent reproduction and seasonal demography. We assume this host species is subject to infection by a strongly immunizing, directly transmitted pathogen. In this context, we show that the interaction between density dependent effects and harvesting can substantially increase both disease prevalence and the absolute number of infectious individuals. This effect clearly increases the risk of cross-species disease transmission into domestic and livestock populations. In addition, if the disease is associated with a risk of mortality, then the synergistic interaction between hunting and disease-induced death can increase the probability of host population extinction.

ID HEALTH-CARE; OUTCOMES; QUALITY; RATES; WORK
AB Contemporary medicine has much to its credit, but has created an insatiable demand for new technologies and more health services, fed by commercial promotion, professional advocacy and sociopolitical pressure.
   Total health expenditure at the national level is now almost 10% of gross domestic product and is expected to top 16% by 2020.
   After recent inquiries into the failings of its public health system, the Queensland Government has committed itself to a 25% increase in expenditure on health over the next 5 years. But will it lead to better population health, and is it sustainable?
   The return-on-investment curve for modern health care may be flattening out, in an environment of growing numbers of older patients with chronic illnesses, maldistribution of services and hospital overcrowding.
   A change in thinking is required if current medical practice is to avoid imploding when confronted with the next major economic downturn.
   Health policy, service funding and clinical training must focus on critical appraisal of the effectiveness of health care technologies and the structure and financing of health care systems.
   Practising clinicians will be obliged to provide leadership in determining value for money in the choice of health care for specific patient populations and how that care is delivered.

AB Regulation of cell growth and protein expression potentially results in a sustainable enhancement of the volumetric productivity in a fermentation process. Following a biphasic cultivation strategy the process initially passes through a cell proliferation phase to generate a sufficiently high viable cell mass. In the subsequent production phase cells are maintained viable and productive without significant cell proliferation leading to increased viable cell days and product yields. In a previous work we have shown that the well directed alteration of the process environment based on process parameter shifting is a promising tool to regulate cell growth and protein expression. In continuation of this work we investigated process parameters which have been identified to affect cell proliferation in favor of an increased specific productivity and total product yield in a series of biphasic batch cultivation experiments. In most of these processes the integral of viable cells and the specific productivity were increased leading to a significant improvement of both final product concentration and volumetric productivity. In addition, combined parameter shifts (pH 6.90/30 degrees C and pH 6.90/33 degrees C) exerted a synergistic effect on product quality. The loss of product sialylation which occurred at reduced temperatures was prevented by simultaneously reducing the external pH. In conclusion, biphasic cultivation based on combined shifting of process parameters is a suitable tool for controlling cell proliferation and protein expression of mammalian cells in a batch bioreactor leading to enhanced volumetric productivities and therefore offers an enormous potential for bioprocess optimization.

AB The-submerged culture of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae and its symbiotic bacterium, Xenorhabdus nematophila, was carried out in orbitally agitated bottles using a culture medium containing whey (in grams per litre: 500 whey, 20 yeast extract, 10 dried egg yolk-food grade, 3 sodium chloride, 37 corn oil-food grade). Maximum total viable nematode concentrations of 198,333 ml(-1) were achieved within fermentations of 24 days with 64% of the nematode population within the infective juvenile stage (U) (126,666 ml(-1)) at the end. The kinetics of the bioprocess was well modelled using the four-parameter Sigmoidal model and the corresponding maximum specific rates of nematode production (0.47 day(-1)), carbohydrates consumption (0-0008 g(carbohydrates) g(nematodes)(-1) day(-1)) and nitrogen consumption (4.44 g(nitrogen) g(nematodes)(-1) day(-1)) are first proposed. Besides, X. nematophila appears to have the capacity of lactose hydrolysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored in the different sections of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), the outlet of both the WWTP and rainfall water, and the downstream of the WWTP joining the river in the area or vicinity of an industrial science park located in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Levels of VOCs were determined by collecting air samples over several sampling points and analyzed using gas chromatography. Among VOCs identified in the drainage and effluent system in each season, acetone, isopropanol (IPA) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) were the major emission species and maximum concentrations were 400.4, 22.8 and 641.2 ppbv, respectively. The ambient air and wastewater sample analysis from neighboring wastewater streams identified pollutants being discharged from unaccounted sources other than the industrial park. According to the 24 h semi-continuous monitoring data (27/7/2002-29/7/2002), the total VOC concentration was an average of 93 ppbv (acetone contributed similar to 78%) with a dramatic variation during the day and night. The emission rate of measured VOCs estimated using fixed box model projected an average of 2-4 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) during the day and 9-17 mu g m(-2) h(-1) during the night. In addition, the isopletb maps show that the acetone and DMS emissions influence adversely the nearby residential area located at less than 100 m downwind from the plant. Eventually, based on this study, an on-line monitoring and alerting system could be built for a long-term performance, and with regular information on the varying pollutants over time construction of a green strategy and creation of a sustainable environment can be achieved.

AB Urine source separation (NoMix technology) has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to centralized wastewater treatment systems. Radical changes necessitate an early inclusion of sociological expertise, thus offering a real chance for transdisciplinary collaboration. The practical aim of our survey is to find out how users accept and use existing NoMix toilets and how this could be encouraged. We collected 1249 questionnaires from 2002 to 2004 in one Swiss school and one Swiss research institute. The technological immaturity of NoMix toilets was noted by many. Nevertheless, acceptance was high: 72% liked the idea and 86% would move into apartments with NoMix toilets. Moreover, most users found that NoMix toilets equal conventional toilets with respect to design (78%), hygiene (84%), and smell (78%). Like many other innovations, the NoMix technology only functions properly if it is used adequately, which we demonstrate for water saving and sitting to urinate. Many users adopted this behavior, e. g., 72% sat. Because perception and use of NoMix toilets is subjective, it can be influenced with certain measures such as good information and cleaning, or discussions with peers. We discuss the importance of social psychology for understanding the factors that influence the acceptance of environmentally friendly innovations.

AB Organic matter is a valuable resource on which the sustainability and productivity of soils relies heavily. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms for the loss of organic compounds from soil. It is also essential to determine how these losses can be minimized, especially those resulting from anthropogenic activity. Grazed grassland lysimeters (1 hectare) were used to examine the contribution and distribution patterns of dissolved free and combined amino acids to dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon in surface runoff and drainage waters from a grassland soil over three winter drainage periods. The waters were collected from soils beneath drained and undrained permanent ryegrass swards, receiving 0 and 280 kg ha(-1) year(-1) mineral nitrogen (N) input. Total dissolved free amino acid (DFAA) and dissolved combined amino acid (DCAA) concentrations ranged between 1.9 nM and 6.1 mu M and between 1.3 and 87 mu M, respectively. Although addition of mineral N fertilizer increased both DFAA and DCAA concentrations in waters, there was no detectable effect of soil hydrology or fertilizer addition on distribution patterns.

TI Development of the method and U.S. normalization database for Life Cycle
   Impact Assessment and sustainability metrics
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Normalization is an optional step within Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) that may be used to assist in the interpretation of life cycle inventory data as well as life cycle impact assessment results. Normalization transforms the magnitude of LCI and LCIA results into relative contribution by substance and life cycle impact category. Normalization thus can significantly influence LCA-based decisions when tradeoffs exist. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a normalization database based on the spatial scale of the 48 continental U.S. states, Hawaii, Alaska, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico with a one-year reference time frame. Data within the normalization database were compiled based on the impact methodologies and lists of stressors used in TRACI-the EPA's Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts. The new normalization database published within this article may be used for LCIA case studies within the United States, and can be used to assist in the further development of a global normalization database. The underlying data analyzed for the development of this database are included to allow the development of normalization data consistent with other impact assessment methodologies as well.

AB Wildlife-habitat relationship models have sometimes been linked with forest simulators to aid in evaluating outcomes of forest management alternatives. However, linking wildlife-habitat models with harvest scheduling software would provide a more direct method for assessing economic and ecological implications of alternative harvest schedules in commercial forest operations. We demonstrate an approach for frontier analyses of wildlife benefits using the Habplan harvest scheduler and spatially explicit wildlife response models in the context of operational forest planning. We used the Habplan harvest scheduler to plan commercial forest management over a 40-year horizon at a landscape scale under five scenarios: unmanaged, an unlimited block-size option both with and without riparian buffers, three cases with different block-size restrictions, and a set-asides scenario in which older stands were withheld from cutting. The potential benefit to wildlife was projected based on spatial models of bird guild richness and species probability of detection. Harvested wood volume provided a measure of scenario costs, which provides an indication of management feasibility. Of nine species and guilds, none appeared to benefit from 50 m riparian buffers, response to an unmanaged scenario was mixed and expensive, and block-size restrictions (maximum harvest unit size) provided no apparent benefit and in some cases were possibly detrimental to bird richness. A set-aside regime, however, appeared to provide significant benefits to all species and groups, probably through increased landscape heterogeneity and increased availability of older forest. Our approach shows promise for evaluating costs and benefits of forest management guidelines in commercial forest enterprises and improves upon the state of the art by utilizing an optimizing harvest scheduler as in commercial forest management, multiple measures of biodiversity (models for multiple species and guilds), and spatially explicit wildlife response models.

AB Understanding the relative ability of favoured fuelwood species to resprout following harvesting is integral to designing strategies for sustainable woodland resource utilisation. Harvester preference for particular woody plant species and plant size was examined in a formerly protected area, severely harvested over a short period of time. The resprouting response of harvested plants was measured five months after harvesting, towards the end of the wet season. Although a large proportion of stems of the dominant species (Terminalia sericea and Dichrostachys cinerea) had been harvested, certain less common species were particularly targeted (e.g., Pterocarpus rotundifolius and Peltophortan africanum). Harvested plants were mostly larger than 4 cm in stem diameter. Almost all harvested plants of all species resprouted. Species differed in whether resprout growth was channelled into many small resprout shoots or fewer large shoots. The species most highly favoured by harvesters produced relatively large resprout shoots. Plant stem diameter was the most important determinant of resprout output, with both shoot number and their composite diameter increasing with increasing plant size. Cut height, although having no significant effect on resprout output, influenced the location of resprouting, with taller stumps having a higher proportion of resprout shoots originating from the stem than from the root crown. For all species, approximately a third of the resprout shoots of harvested plants died during the five months following harvesting. Shoots originating from the stem had a higher dieback than those growing from the root crown. Resprout biomass production over the five month period was considerable, amounting to 989 kg ha(-1) (wet mass). An abundance of seedlings of the most common species may be a consequence of woodland thinning through harvesting. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Extreme natural hazards, particularly the hydro-meteorological disasters, are emerging as a cause of major concern in the coastal regions of India and a few other developing countries. These have become more frequent in the recent past, and are taking a heavy toll of life and livelihoods. Low level of technology development in the rural areas together-with social, economic and gender inequities enhance the vulnerability of the largely illiterate, unskilled, and resource-poor fishing, farming and landless labour communities. Their resilience to bounce back to pre-disaster level of normality is highly limited. For the planet Earth at crossroads, the imminent threat, however, is from a vicious spiral among environmental degradation, poverty and climate change-related natural disasters interacting in a mutually reinforcing manner. These, in turn, retard sustainable development, and also wipe out any small gains made thereof. To counter this unacceptable trend, the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation has developed a biovillage paradigm and rural knowledge centres for ecotechnological and knowledge empowerment of the coastal communities at risk. Frontier science and technologies blended with traditional knowledge and ecological prudence result in ecotechnologies with pro-nature, pro-poor and pro-women orientation. The rural communities are given training and helped to develop capacity to adopt ecotechnologies for market-driven eco-enterprises. The modern information and communication-based rural knowledge centres largely operated by trained semi-literate young women provide time- and locale-specific information on weather, crop and animal husbandry, market trends and prices for local communities, healthcare, transport, education, etc. to the local communities. The ecotechnologies and time- and locale-specific information content development are need-based and chosen in a 'bottom-up' manner. The use of recombinant DNA technology for genetic shielding of agricultural crops for coastal regions against abiotic stress (induced by the water- and weather-related natural disasters), strengthens the foundations of sustainable agriculture undertaken by the resource poor small farm families.

AB Background: In some Western countries, the medical profession is continuously losing prestige, doctors are claiming of high demands, low rewards, and difficult structural working conditions. This study aimed to investigate the arguments given by Swiss residents for and against a career in medicine.
   Methods: As part of a prospective cohort study of Swiss medical school graduates on career development, 567 fourth-year residents were asked to answer the free-response item of what arguments there still were in favour of or against a career in medicine. They also indicated whether they would choose the medical profession all over again (yes/no). The statements were transcribed, content categories inductively formulated, and their descriptions written down in a code manual. Arguments were encoded according to the code manual and assigned to eight content categories (Mayring's content analysis). Frequency distributions were given for categories and tested with Chi(2)-tests for differences in gender, speciality fields, and whether or not the respondent would again choose a career in medicine.
   Results: The 567 participants made 1,640 statements in favour of and 1,703 statements against a career in medicine. The content analysis of the residents' answers yielded eight categories with arguments both for and against a career in medicine. Of all "statements for" responses, 70% fell into the two top-ranking categories of Personal experiences in day-to-day working life (41.2%) and Interpersonal experiences in professional relationships (28.8%). The top-ranking category of the "statements against" arguments was General work-related structural conditions (32%), followed by Social prestige and health-policy aspects (21%). Main arguments in favour of a career in medicine were interdisciplinary challenge, combination of basic sciences and interpersonal concerns, helping suffering people, guarantee of a secure job; arguments against comprised high workload, time pressure, emotional stress, poorly structured continuing education, increasing bureaucracy, work-life imbalance, low income, and decreasing social prestige. The statements revealed few differences depending on gender, medical field, and attitude towards choosing the medical profession again; one out of five young doctors would not do so.
   Conclusion: Residents' chief complaint is deteriorating structural working conditions, including unfavourable work-life balance. Making medicine an attractive profession again will require sustainable changes in health-policy framework and social reward.

AB The urban ecosystem is composed of natural and socioeconomic subsystems. its direction of evolution is often determined by the economic value and benefits of the system's outputs, which however cannot fully describe the flows of substances, energy, information and population. Based on dissipative structure theory and urban nature-economy-society complex ecosystem theory, an indicator system and a model based on information entropy, which can measure the various flows in an urban ecosystem, are developed for evaluating the direction of change in urban development. in addition, the year- and indicator-based information entropies were estimated for the urban ecosystem. In total, four types of information entropy, including sustaining input, imposed output, destructive metabolism and regenerative metabolism, were calculated by using year-based information entropy to analyse the order and complexity of the urban ecosystem; the weights of indicators were calculated, and index scores for the urban ecosystem were calculated by using standardized values of the indicators. The values of index for sustainable development helped to identify the developmental level and harmonious degree of the urban ecosystem. By using these methods, the progress of sustainable development of Ningbo City (China) was evaluated from 1996 to 2003. The results showed that the order degree of Ningbo's urban ecosystem is increasing, the urban ecosystem's service function is improving and the health level of the system is strengthening. The developmental degree and the harmonious degree of the system's entropy flow increased from 1996 to 2003, and underwent a complicated transformation from a situation in which socioeconomic pressure dominated towards a situation in which the ecological carrying capacity became more adequate. The developmental degree of entropy production by the system first increased and then decreased from 1996 to 2003, leading to instability of the system's metabolism function. Its harmonious degree changed irregularly from 1996 to 2003, and underwent a complicated course from destructive metabolism to regenerative metabolism, then returned to destructive metabolism.

AB Background: Little is known about how sexual and reproductive (SRH) health can be made accessible and appropriate to adolescents. This study evaluates the impact and sustainability of a competitive voucher program on the quality of SRH care for poor and underserved female adolescents and the usefulness of the simulated patient (SP) method for such evaluation.
   Methods: 28,711 vouchers were distributed to adolescents in disadvantaged areas of Managua that gave free-of-charge access to SRH care in 4 public, 10 non-governmental and 5 private clinics. Providers received training and guidelines, treatment protocols, and financial incentives for each adolescent attended. All clinics were visited by female adolescent SPs requesting contraception. SPs were sent one week before, during ( with voucher) and one month after the intervention. After each consultation they were interviewed with a standardized questionnaire. Twenty-one criteria were scored and grouped into four categories. Clinics' scores were compared using non-parametric statistical methods ( paired design: before-during and before-after). Also the influence of doctors' characteristics was tested using non-parametric statistical methods.
   Results: Some aspects of service quality improved during the voucher program. Before the program started 8 of the 16 SPs returned 'empty handed', although all were eligible contraceptive users. During the program 16/17 left with a contraceptive method ( p = 0.01). Furthermore, more SPs were involved in the contraceptive method choice (13/17 vs. 5/16, p = 0.02). Shared decision-making on contraceptive method as well as condom promotion had significantly increased after the program ended. Female doctors had best scores before-during and after the intervention. The improvements were more pronounced among male doctors and doctors older than 40, though these improvements did not sustain after the program ended.
   Conclusion: This study illustrates provider-related obstacles adolescents often face when requesting contraception. The care provided during the voucher program improved for some important outcomes. The improvements were more pronounced among providers with the weakest initial performance. Shared decision-making and condom promotion were improvements that sustained after the program ended. The SP method is suitable and relatively easy to apply in monitoring clinics' performance, yielding important and relevant information. Objective assessment of change through the SP method is much more complex and expensive.

AB The concept of sustainability, an abstract one by its nature, has been given a mathematical representation through the use of Fisher information as a measure. It is used to propose the sustainability hypotheses for dynamical systems, which has paved the way to achieve sustainable development through externally enforced control schemes. For natural systems, this refers to the task of ecosystem management, which is complicated due the lack of clear objectives. This work attempts to incorporate the idea of sustainability in ecosystem management. The natural regulation of ecosystems suggests two possible control options, top-down control and bottom-up control. A comparison of these two control philosophies is made on generic food chain models using the objectives derived from the sustainability hypotheses. Optimal control theory is used to derive the control profiles to handle the complex nature of the models and the objectives. The results indicate a strong relationship between the hypotheses and the dynamic behavior of the models, supporting the use of Fisher information as a measure. As regards to ecosystem management, it has been observed that top-down control is more aggressive but can result in instability, while bottom-up control is guaranteed to give a stable and improved dynamic response. The results also indicate that bottom-up control is a better option to affect shifts in the dynamic regimes of a system, which may be required to recover the system from a natural disaster like the hurricane Katrina.

DE sustainability; ecosystem management; stochastic optimal control;
   uncertainty analysis
AB Sustainable development of ecosystems through external ecosystem management is assuming importance for the environmentalists. To that effect, previous work by the authors looked at the option of manipulating population dynamics of the species in an ecosystem to achieve sustainability. Fisher information is used as-the quantifying measure of sustainability and optimal control theory is used to derive the control profiles. However, that work considered only deterministic systems. Uncertainty being prevalent in all systems, particularly in natural systems, this paper extends that work to analyse uncertain systems. Predator-prey models are used to model the species populations and different control philosophies are compared. Ito mean reverting process is used to model the stochastic process, and stochastic maximum principle is used to derive the control profiles. The results for the objective of FI variance minimization qualitatively agree with those for the deterministic system, while the results for the FI maximization objective differ. It is observed that the instability associated with the FI maximization objective for deterministic systems is absorbed by the noise introduced by the uncertainty. Quantitatively, it is observed that the degree of uncertainty, along with its presence, is also important to identify the most appropriate management strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ID HAPPINESS
AB Ecovillages, co-housing communities, and other types of intentional communities (ICs) have proliferated in recent years. There are currently several thousands of these communities worldwide and their numbers are increasing rapidly. We surveyed a subset of these communities to learn more about their characteristics, including their world view or vision, the status of four basic types of capital (built, human, social, and natural), and the quality of life (QoL) they provide for their residents. Survey results indicate that ICs have a better balance between built, human, social, and natural capital than unintentional communities (based on a parallel survey of neighborhoods in Burlington, VT, USA) and that this results in a higher QoL among residents. It is difficult to assess the sustainability of ICs, but the data indicates that within ICs, social capital is substituted for built capital thereby reducing the level of material throughput.

AB Two prominent and alternate approaches, ecosystem service valuation and ecological footprints, link the production of ecosystem services with their consumption by societies. An overlapping goal of both approaches is to promote the sustainable use of ecosystem services such that their production rates are not compromised. Yet, little integration of these perspectives and their emphasis on distinct units, dollars and area, has been attempted. We combined these two approaches to better understand variation in the societal demand and production of freshwater, a critical ecosystem service, for 121 cities in the United States. The analysis linked previously compiled data on urban water use and the spatial distribution of run-off water throughout the conterminous United States. Incorporating the spatial distribution of water consumption and production, we computed heterogeneous urban water use footprints for all 121 cities. From the relationship between annual municipal utility expense and footprint area, the median monetary value for water footprint area was $88,808 km(-2) yr(-1) from all the cities we considered. The ratio between the footprint-estimated cost and the utility-observed cost was negatively related to the local availability of water, and was independent of population size. By linking ecosystem service valuation and ecological footprint analyses into a coherent framework, we developed an integrated metric for understanding the provisioning of ecosystem services, which could help inform sustainable pricing guidelines for renewable freshwater.

AB This paper summarises some recent work exploring the development of a multi-criteria optimisation tool for achieving sustainable solutions for municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMS). The aim of the project was to provide a new methodological background for the regional solid waste management modelling taking into account spatial and temporal patterns of waste generation and processing, environmental as well as economic impacts of the system development with a particular emphasis on public health and biodiversity.
   The research has focused on integrating three different approaches to the spatial-temporal analysis of the MSWMS, namely a life cycle inventory analysis, which helps to identify emission patterns within the MSWMS, a multi-criteria optimisation approach, which helps to find compromise solutions among environmentally and economically preferred options, and a geographic information systems approach, which provides a tool for identifying waste management facilities, transportation environmental and social impacts, as well as analysis of environmental impacts on valuable ecosystems. A Russian methodology for calculating environmental damage was used to weight the importance of different sub-territories covered by the system as well as simplifying the analysis of emissions from the waste treatment plants. The approach provides a new perspective for the analysis of municipal solid waste management systems at the regional scale. The principal novelty of the proposed complex MSW strategic management model is an integration of the different types of data-geographical, environmental and economic-using relational database technology. Simulations using the dataset for Gloucestershire were performed on a simplified version of the model. Simulations were undertaken to explore the potential effects on waste management infrastructure of introducing the EU Landfill Directive. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses inherent in the methods utilised has suggested that a relatively affordable and easy to use tool can be developed for strategic analysis of the municipal solid waste management system in a region, giving useful support to the decision-maker regarding the potential development paths and trade-offs between economic and environmental performance of a proposed waste management system.

AB Many countries now actively encourage land use change for the provision of multiple benefits, specifically including non-market benefits. often such policies have been poorly designed because of a lack of understanding of the spatial distribution of the potential costs and-especially-non-market benefits from land use change. As with market goods, the potential yield of non-market goods and services from land use can be highly spatially variable. in recent years, more and more studies on the economic aspects of natural resources have started to make use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS). What is yet lacking is the systematic adoption of a framework for the spatial targeting of policy interventions which can be used to improve decision making in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, equity or public acceptability. This paper uses existing studies in forestry to present such a framework and discusses its potential uses and limitations as a new standard tool to inform multi-functional land use decisions.

DE waste paper; paperboard; lamination; beech; poplar; specific gravity
AB One of the basic principles for sustainable development is to prevent wasting resources, preserve natural resources, and recycle the products obtained from resources. For this study, paperboard obtained from waste paper was laminated with natural wooden layers in accordance with the order of beech-paperboard-beech-paperboard-beech and an alternate material was produced. In this context, experiments were made for determining the specific gravity, compression, shearing, bending strength, elasticity module, and the resistance to direct withdrawal of screws and nails on a radial section surface with the objective of determining the usability of this material as a building material. When the findings obtained at the end of the experiments are studied carefully in a comparative manner, it was observed that paperboard laminated materials could be used with different objectives in interiors to protect against humidity. It was determined that it could be used in place of solid poplar materials for places of use where resistance to compression, elasticity module, and resistance to direct withdrawal of screws and nails on a radial section surface are important and in places where resistance to bending and shearing is required after taking the necessary measures. In the end, a contribution to the literature was provided by researching possibilities for different use of a material regained from waste and to provide sustainability.

TI Participants' perceptions of a lifestyle approach to promoting physical
   activity: targeting deprived communities in Kingston-Upon-Hull
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID EXERCISE
AB Background: The health benefits of an active lifestyle have been extensively documented and generally accepted. In the UK, declining physical activity levels are a major contributing factor to a number of public health concerns such as obesity and coronary heart disease. Clearly, there is an urgent need to support people in developing sustainable active lifestyles. In 2003, a new lifestyle-based physical activity service called Active Lifestyles ( AL) was set up in Kingston-upon-Hull to help local residents to become more active and develop healthier lifestyles. The service targeted the most deprived communities in the city. The aim of the study was to explore participants' perceptions of the operation and effectiveness of the AL service.
   Methods: Five focus groups were conducted in community centres and offices in the health promotion service in Kingston-upon-Hull. Sixteen white adult males (n = 5) and females ( n = 11) participated in the study. Ages ranged from 15 - 73 years ( mean age = 53 years). Data were analysed using a content analysis technique based on the 'framework' approach.
   Results: Three broad themes emerged from the focus groups; the referral process; operational aspects of the AL service; and perceived benefits of the service. Overall, participants were extremely positive about the AL service. Many reported increased activity levels, modified eating habits, and enhanced awareness and education regarding healthier living. Most participants reported that local awareness of the AL service was low and greater promotion was required so more people could benefit. The success of the service was highly dependent upon the qualities and approach of the AL advisor.
   Conclusion: The service appears to have filled a gap in service provision since it offered support to the most sedentary, older, unfit and overweight individuals, many of whom live in the most deprived parts of Kingston-upon-Hull. Traditional exercise referral schemes that focus solely on facility-based exercise should be broadened to encompass everyday lifestyle activity, where referral to a gym or exercise facility is just one of a number of physical activity options.

AB The decreasing availability of energy and the concern about climate change necessitate the development of novel sustainable energy sources. Fusion energy is such a source. The ultimate potential of fusion energy is very high and badly needed. A major step forward in the development of fusion energy is the decision to construct the experimental test reactor ITER.
   ITER will stimulate research in many areas of science. This article discusses research opportunities in the context of plasma-surface interaction. The fusion plasma with a typical temperature of 10 keV has to be brought into contact with a physical wall in order to remove the helium produced and drain the excess energy in the fusion plasma. The fusion plasma is far too hot to be brought into direct contact with a physical wall. It would degrade the wall and the debris from the wall would extinguish the plasma. Therefore, schemes are developed to cool down the plasma. The resulting plasma-surface interaction concerned in ITER is facing several challenges including surface erosion, material redeposition and tritium retention. In this article we introduce how plasma-surface interaction relevant for ITER can be studied in a smaller scale experiment: Magnum-PSI. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As they are easy to recycle and consume little natural resources, polymers have been considered as environmentally friendly for a long time. Significant evolutions have been observed, in the field of polymers from biomass for example, and at least 15% of world research on polymers are connected with environmental questions. To address these questions, it seems that multidisciplinary research has to be carried out considering the synthesis, formulation, processing and the characterization of polymers. Similarly, training in chemistry and materials is more and more concerned by sustainable development.

AB The present study was carried out to produce an artificial hydraulic lime for repair and conservation of historic masonry. Lime mortar is preferred to cement based mortar for conservation work because it is more compatible with stone and ancient brickwork, as well as being a more sustainable material. The study focused on the effect of burning conditions on the properties of an artificial hydraulic lime mortar obtained by burning limestone and siliceous waste materials. The raw meals were prepared from five types of siliceous materials obtained as byproducts from industrial processes ( pulverised fuel ash, glass cullet, silica sand, crushed rock and spent oil shale) with the amount of silica between 3 and 16%. The raw meal was burned in an electric furnace at 975 degrees C for 3 h. The mortar was prepared by mixing hot slaked lime putty (water/ lime ratio similar to 1.6) and 'Gowrie' sand at a lime/sand ratio of 1 : 3 by weight. The limes and lime mortar were prepared and tested according to BS EN 459-2: 2001. The investigations carried out on the products included free lime analysis, strength test and microstructural examination. The results show that the glass cullet lime is the most hydraulic product and can be classified as feebly hydraulic. It suggests that this hydraulic lime could be produced using a traditional kiln at a low cost.

ID ACIDIFICATION
AB On the basis of the FAO projection 'World Agriculture: Towards 2015/2030' we direct our discussion to food production, the consequences for land use, efficiency of nitrogen (N) and losses of reactive N to the environment during 1995-2030. According the FAO, global food production can keep pace with the increase in food demand in the coming three decades. However, according the projection used here, there will be a major global increase (8%) in arable land, most of it in developing countries and with a major impact on the extent of tropical forests. Further forest clearing may occur to compensate for declining soil productivity due to land degradation. Despite improvements in the N use efficiency, total reactive N loss will grow strongly in the world's increasingly intensive agricultural systems. In the 1995-2030 period emissions of reactive N from intensive agricultural systems will continue to rise, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, the increase of N use efficiency and further improvement of agronomic management must remain high on the priority list of policy makers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The global farming systems (GFS) approach is extended by adding a soil fertility and nutrient management dimension for Africa's forest-based, maize mixed, cereal-root crop mixed, and agro-pastoral millet/sorghum farming systems. Use is made of sustainable livelihood concepts, translated into farmer capitals (natural, physical, financial, human, social), and the indicator-based DPSIR (driving force-pressure-state-impact-response) framework for environmental reporting. State and impact indicators show, for each GFS, levels of nutrient stocks and flows, respectively. In case of nutrient depletion, soils may (i) initially still be fertile enough to provide reasonable and stable yields, (ii) support declining yields, or (iii) support low yields at low fertility level. In the latter case, food security is generally at stake. Response indicators include the level of uptake of improved integrated nutrient management strategies at land user level, and the enforcement of new and enabling pro-agriculture and pro-environment policies. Although the extended GFS have no direct relevance for farm-level interventions, the approach can be used to frame soil fertility research priorities and policies at a regional level.

AB China is unique for its long history of permanent arable farming, large population, low per capita natural resources, and at the same time, having largely achieved food self-sufficiency. Some of the experiences of Chinese farming may provide clues or alternatives to other resource-poor countries in their strive for optimizing utilization of natural resources, improving soil fertility, and increasing food production. China's experiences are summarized into five attributes: (1) farmer's strong awareness of the importance of organic manuring in soil fertility and productivity, (2) exploration of all possible organic resources for recycling, (3) maximization of resource use efficiency, (4) crop rotation and cropping intensification, and (5) irrigation and use of chemical fertilizers. Chinese farmers regard almost all forms of organic wastes as 'organic treasures', and recycle them into organic fertilizers through animal digestion and/or composting. Biogas generation using organic wastes is explored as an extra step in this process. Recycling of organic wastes through animals and biogas generation utilizes effectively the part of organic carbon that can be converted directly to food and useful energy, which would otherwise be quickly lost in the early phase of decomposition in soil or compost. Crop rotation with legumes helps restore and balance soil nutrient supply. Multiple cropping is effective in boosting crop production from limited arable land. Cropping intensification, however, requires external nutrient inputs from chemical fertilizers, and in many places, also irrigation. Government support proved critical in the development of agricultural infrastructure as well as in overall crop production. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a framework for nutrient management that takes sustainable soil fertility, environmental protection and balanced plant nutrition as starting points, and integrates concepts from plant physiology, soil chemistry and agronomy. The framework is meant as a tool that can be applied even if no local experimental results are known. Saturated soil fertility and ideal soil fertility constitute the bench marks of the framework. Saturated soil fertility is the fertility at which the soil by itself does exactly satisfy the nutrient demand of a crop producing the target yield, provided no nutrients get lost. Ideal soil fertility is the fertility at which the soil in combination with 'replacement input' exactly satisfies that nutrient demand. Replacement input is an input equal to the quantity of nutrients removed in harvested crop.
   Saturated soil fertility is calculated as a function of target nutrient uptake, and ideal soil fertility as a function of target nutrient uptake and recovery fractions of input nutrients. Because the recovery fractions are high for N, low for P and medium for K, the soil is relatively low in N, high in P, and medium in K at ideal soil fertility. The supplies of N, P and K to the crop by soil and replacement input together are well-balanced. The ratio of ideal soil fertility to saturated soil fertility proves to be 0.2, 0.6 and 0.4 for N, P and K, respectively.
   In case of nutrient losses, the steady-state soil fertility where nutrient input equals nutrient output by crop and losses is exactly the same as the ideal soil fertility for nutrients that do not accumulate in the soil, and somewhat higher than ideal soil fertility for nutrients that do accumulate. Equations are presented to calculate that steady-state soil fertility and the nutrient input and output. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WIDE WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Current environmental emission regulations typically follow a command-and-control approach mandating the installation of state-of-the-art abatement technology to safeguard hard emission thresholds. However, this type of regulation offers no reward for conducting pollution prevention and technological research to reduce emissions below compliance levels through process innovation. Alternatively, market-based regulations stimulate continued improvement of cleaner manufacturing practices by creating economic incentives for sustained waste reduction. The aim of this work is to furnish regulators and manufacturers with a concise tool for quantifying the impact of future regulatory scenarios. The proposed methodology employs realistic mathematical models of pollution abatement operations used in chemical, pharmaceutical, and specialty chemical manufacturing. It assesses the feasibility of treatment options, estimates their cost and expected emissions. Rigorous optimization techniques are introduced for managing regional emission reduction efforts at reasonable cost to manufacturers. The comprehensive mathematical programming formulations will enable plant managers to ascertain expected compliance cost, and regulators to design environmental regulations for reducing regional emissions at tolerable cost to industry.

AB Excess drinking poses multiple substantial health risks to HIV-infected individuals. However, no published intervention studies have focused on drinking reduction as the main outcome in HIV primary care patients. An intervention in this setting must place minimal demands on pressured staff and resources. This pilot study tested such an intervention, which consisted of brief Motivational Interviewing (MI) and HealthCall, an automated daily telephone self-monitoring system based on Interactive Voice Response (IVR), designed to extend and enhance the effects of brief MI. Thirty-one patients entered the study, received a 30-minute MI and were instructed in daily use of the IVR system. They received graphical feedback on their daily drinking from the HealthCall database after 30 days. A statistically significant decrease in drinking was found over time, both as reported in daily IVR calls (beta = -0.01, se 0.01, p = .03) and in follow-up interviews (beta = -0.04, se 0.12, p = 02) at 60 days. The proportion of daily calls made supported the feasibility of the intervention. The results indicate that HealthCall is acceptable to a disadvantaged HIV patient population, and preliminary data support the efficacy of this intervention in reducing harmful drinking among HIV primary care patients.

AB The Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH), utilizing the expertise of public and private, federal, state, and local partners, increased the proportion of state health department-funded community-based organizations implementing effective behavioral interventions (EBIs) from .05 (1:18) in 2002 to .78 (14:18) in 2004. As the stewards of nearly two thirds of the HIV prevention funds awarded annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state health departments occupy an important position in diffusing the science of EBIs to their grantees. This article describes the strategies and partners employed by Michigan's state health department to build the capacity of community-based providers to implement effective behavioral interventions. Additionally, lessons learned by the MDCH are highlighted and challenges to the long-term sustainability of these interventions are also discussed.

AB The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through its Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI) program, trained over 260 agencies on VOICES/VOCES between August 2003 and April 2005. ORC Macro conducted interviews with agency staff 3 months after receiving VOICES/VOCES training. This article discusses the diffusion of VOICES/VOCES; agencies' adoption, adaptation, and implementation of this intervention; and needs for ongoing proactive technical assistance (TA) for agencies to successfully integrate behavioral interventions into their programs. The vast majority of agencies implemented VOICES/VOCES with fidelity to the core elements, and agencies successfully adapted the intervention to make it more appealing to target populations. TA is needed for interventions to be successfully adapted and implemented with fidelity to the core elements, and to ensure program sustainability. More effective interventions of short duration and minimum complexity to easily match with existing resources and conditions of agency capacity among HIV prevention providers in the community are needed.

   Valley, Costa Rica
SO AMBIO

AB A study was conducted to evaluate long-term trends in nitrate concentrations and to try to identify the origin of nitrate using stable isotopes (N-15(NO3)- and O-18(NO3)-) in the aquifers of the western Central Valley, Costa Rica, where more than 1 million people depend on groundwater to satisfy their daily needs. Data from 20 sites periodically sampled for 4 to 17 years indicate an increasing trend in nitrate concentrations at five sites, which in a period ranging from 10 to 40 years, will exceed recommended maximum concentrations. Results of isotopic analysis indicate a correspondence between land use patterns and the isotopic signature of nitrate in groundwater and suggest that urbanization processes without adequate waste disposal systems, followed by coffee fertilization practices, are threatening water quality in the region. We conclude that groundwater management in this area is not sustainable, and that land use substitution processes from agricultural activity to residential occupation that do not have proper sewage disposal systems may cause a significant increment in the nitrate contaminant load.

TI Sustainability of public health programs: The example of tobacco
   treatment services in Massachusetts
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustaining important public or grant-funded services after initial funding is terminated is a major public health challenge. We investigated whether tobacco treatment services previously funded within a statewide tobacco control initiative could be sustained after state funding was terminated abruptly. We found that 2 key strategiesredefining the scope of services being offered and creative use of resources-were factors that determined whether some community agencies were able to sustain services at a much higher level than others after funding was discontinued. Understanding these strategies and developing them at a time when program funding is not being threatened is likely to increase program sustainability.

AB Filamentous actinomycetes are commercially widely used as producers of natural products (in particular antibiotics) and of industrial enzymes. However, the mycelial lifestyle of actinomycetes, resulting in highly viscous broths and unfavorable pellet formation, has been a major bottleneck in their commercialization. Here we describe the successful morphological engineering of industrially important streptomycetes through controlled expression of the morphogene ssgA. This led to improved growth of many industrial and reference streptomycetes, with fragmentation of the mycelial clumps resulting in significantly enhanced growth rates in batch fermentations of Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans. Product formation was also stimulated, with a twofold increase in yield of enzyme production by S. lividans. We anticipate that the use of the presented methodology will make actinomycetes significantly more attractive as industrial and sustainable production hosts.

This time, a university computer laboratory depends on elemental physic principles that regulate temperature, ventilation and light levels.

AB Helix pomatia L., the Roman snail, is a species faced with growing commercial interest in Moldova. Its life history characteristics (slow maturation and recruitment, high mortality among juveniles and low fecundity) along with its strong spatial aggregation, makes it especially vulnerable to exploitation. In this study, differences in density, shell size and age distribution were assessed in 7 unexploited and 10 exploited sites in the northern and central parts of Moldova. A significant impact of exploitation on snail population densities, shell size of adult snails and age distribution was revealed. Exploited sites had much lower densities than unexploited ones and in two places no live snails were found. This may suggest that exploitation is currently carried out at an unsustainable level, but additional information on the demography of populations and intensity of exploitation is required in order to make inferences regarding sustainability and long-term population management. There was a higher proportion of adult snails in exploited sites than in non-exploited, because of the collection strategies: not only adults, but also all other age groups are gathered. Bigger adult shell size in exploited sites may be related to lower population density, but further study is required to confirm this. Establishing of well-organized population monitoring systems and development of snail breeding enterprises are proposed in order to conserve the species in Moldova.

AB Integrating conservation goals with the sustainable use of tropical rain forests has received much attention in recent decades. Amomum villosum, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been cultivated in the understory of seasonal rain forest for 40 years in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. Cultivated area has reached 58.11 km(2) much of which is distributed within nature reserves. This practice has caused controversy on whether A. villosum cultivation would alter the structure and function of the primary forest. This study examined the effects of medicinal plant cultivation on seasonal rain forest by comparing plant diversity, biomass, litterfall and soil nutrients of primary rain forest with disturbed areas where A. villosum is cultivated. The results indicate that plant diversity, tree biomass, litter production and soil nutrients are significantly lower in the disturbed than in the primary rain forest. These results suggest that the cultivation of A. villosum affects the structure and function of the seasonal rain forest in Xishuangbanna.

AB Over-exploitation and fragmentation are serious problems for tropical forests. Most sustainable forest management practices avoid clear-cuts and apply selective logging systems focused on a few commercial species. We applied a simulation model to estimate the impact of such selective logging scenarios on the genetic diversity and demography of four tropical tree species from French Guiana. The simulations used data on genetic and demographic composition, growth, phenology and pollen and seed dispersal obtained for Dicorynia guianensis, Sextonia rubra, Symphonia globulifera and Vouacapoua americana at the experimental site in Paracou. Whereas Symphonia globulifera serves as a model for a species with low logging pressure, the other three species represent the most exploited tree species in French Guiana. In simulations with moderate logging, typical for French Guiana, with large cutting diameter (> 60 cm diameter) and long cutting cycles (65 years), the two species V. americana and Sextonia rubra were not able to recover their initial stock at the end of the rotation period, with a large decrease in the number of individuals and in basal area. Under a more intensive logging system (cutting diameter > 45 cm diameter, cutting cycles of 30 years) that is common practice in the Brazilian Amazon, only Symphonia globulifera showed no negative impact. Generally, the differences between the genetic parameters in the control scenarios without logging and the logging scenarios were surprisingly small. The main reasons for this were the overlapping of generations and the effective dispersal ability of gene vectors in all species, which guarantee relative homogeneity of the genetic structure in different age classes. Nevertheless, decreasing the population size by logging reduced the number of genotypes and caused higher genetic distances between the original population and the population at the end of the logging cycles. Sensitivity analysis showed that genetic changes in the logging scenarios were principally determined by the growth, densities and cutting diameter of each species, and only to a very small extent by the reproductive system including factors such as pollen and seed dispersal and flowering phenology.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop operationally important soil quality indicators to evaluate long-term sustainability, at the farm scale, for no-tillage systems in Argiudolls of rolling pampa (Argentina). The soil was classified as series Arroyo Dulce (Typic Argiudoll), a fertile dark, deep and well-drained soil of the hills. Three situations were considered: pristine soil with grass vegetation, grassland soil (also considered as a reference situation); and 15 years no-tillage soils from four production plots. Physical, physico-chemical, chemical and biochemical indicators were considered. Data were analyzed by principal components analysis (PCA) with canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). The first three components explained 90% of the overall variation. For pristine undisturbed soil, the main variables selected by PCA were particulate C, pH, respiration and total organic C, and in the case of grassland they were C stock (mass of C in the 0-10 cm soil horizon), water-soluble C, and % silt. The no-tillage area was separated in different plots according to the degree of erosion with different depths of the A horizon. Clay content and bulk density were the main variables in the less degraded no tillage plots. Cluster analysis was applied to construct an average linkage distance dendrogram.

AB A convenient and efficient application of heterogeneous methylrhenium trioxide (MTO) systems for the selective oxidation of lignin model compounds and lignins is reported. Environmental friendly and low-cost H2O2 was used as the oxygen atom donor. Overall, the data presented and discussed in this paper point toward the conclusion that the immobilized heterogeneous catalytic systems based on H2O2/and MTO catalysts are able to extensively oxidize both phenolic and non-phenolic, monomeric, and dimeric, lignin model compounds. Condensed diphenylmethane models were found also extensively oxidized. Technical lignins, such as hydrolytic sugar cane lignin (SCL) and red spruce kraft lignin (RSL), displayed oxidative activity with immobilized MTO catalytic systems. After oxidation, these lignins displayed the formation of more soluble lignin fragments with a high degree of degradation as indicated by the lower contents of aliphatic and condensed OH groups, and the higher amounts of carboxylic acid moieties. Our data indicate that immobilized MTO catalytic systems are significant potential candidates for the development of alternative totally chlorine-free delignification processes and environmentally sustainable lignin selective modification reactions.

AB Enzymatic hydrolysis of penicillin G by immobilized penicillin acylase in a nonionic surfactant mediated cloud point system was presented. The effect of the operation parameters on equilibrium pH of this enzymatic hydrolysis process without pH control was examined. A relatively high equilibrium pH in cloud point system without pH control can be obtained. The feasibility of recycling utilization of the nonionic surfactant, a novel green solvent, was also investigated experimentally. Enzymatic hydrolysis of penicillin G in a discrete semi-batch mode, which simulates a semi-continuous process., envisages a completely eco-friendly, sustainable and efficient process for production of 6-aminopenicillanic acid.

AB Perennial plants, growing in mixtures, make up most of the world's natural terrestrial biomes. In contrast, monocultures of annual crops are sown on more than two-thirds of global cropland. Grain and oilseed crops are the foundation of the human diet, but to date there are no perennial species that produce adequate grain harvests. Yet perennial plant communities store more carbon, maintain better soil and water quality, and manage nutrients more conservatively than do annual plant communities, and they have greater biomass and resource management capacity. These advantages provide a base from which to begin hybridization and selection for increased resource allocation to developing seeds, a decades-long process that must overcome or circumvent genetic complications. Breeding programs aimed at developing perennial grain crops have been initiated in wheat, sorghum, sunflower, intermediate wheatgrass, and other species.

TI Increasing work rate in vision guided precision banded operations
SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Concerns over the economic and environmental sustainability of farming are leading to an increased interest in techniques to reduce crop protection inputs by better targeting. One way to improve targeting is through physically aligning treatment devices with crop rows. Manual guidance is a difficult and stressful task due to the high concentration required to maintain acceptable tolerances, typically 25 mm. Under normal farm conditions, global positioning system based technologies are unable to reliably offer this performance. Commercial implement guidance systems based on computer vision have demonstrated that the required accuracy can be achieved. However, working width is limited due to the need to match implements with drill or transplanter width in order to avoid misalignment at the interface between bouts.
   This paper describes an integrated vision-based system for tracking multiple bouts that has been tested in two example applications. The first was an inter-row hoe for use in cereals with three independently guided 4 m wide sections, each with its own camera, operating on 12 m tramlines. Trials showed that the standard deviation in the lateral position was 10 mm at 10 km h(-1). The second exemplar based on a conventional boom sprayer was a precision band sprayer for vegetables spanning five 4 m wide beds. Trials indicated the standard deviation in lateral position was 22 mm at 12 km h(-1). (c) 2006 IAgrE. All rights reserved Published by Elsevier Ltd

AB Theoretical arguments are developed to describe the effects of a uniform slope on the development of the stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer (SBL). A maximum sustainable surface buoyancy flux exists for the SBL overlying a uniform, non-sloping surface. In this study it is shown that the SBL overlying a uniform shallow slope (with gradient of the order of 1:1000) also supports a maximum sustainable buoyancy flux, B-max, but that the value of B-max is influenced by the gradient of the slope, gamma. It is demonstrated that in the limit gamma -> 0, results for the SBL over a horizontal surface are recovered.

AB Primary objective: To carry out a clinical and cost-outcome evaluation of a neurobehavioural post-acute rehabilitation programme in the UK.
   Research design: The study was a multi-centre prospective cohort study of adults with acquired brain injury admitted for residential rehabilitation. Comprehensive data were collected on type of residence, amount and type of care, functional independence, engagement in constructive occupation and participation in social roles.
   Procedures: Data were gathered on admission relating to individuals' levels of care and functioning, both pre-morbidly and at the time of admission (pre-rehabilitation). Additional information about functioning was collected upon discharge (post-rehabilitation). Follow-up data was collated in person, by telephone or by post after an average of 18 months by a researcher who was blind to the rehabilitation outcomes. The data were analysed in terms of clinical outcomes and support costs. Savings in costs of care or support were calculated on the basis of difference between pre-rehabilitation and follow-up support costs minus the costs of rehabilitation.
   Results: Significant gains were evident at discharge and follow-up in virtually all indices of social outcome. Improvements were recorded in type of accommodation, levels of care, functional ability, productive occupation and performance of social roles. Patients admitted within 1 year of injury made the most progress, but improvements were made regardless of time since injury. Patients continued to benefit from rehabilitation well beyond the period when most natural recovery would take place. Economic calculations suggested that the initial costs of rehabilitation are generally offset by savings in care costs within 2 years. Sensitivity analysis on estimated savings in care costs yielded projected lifetime savings of between,1.1-0.8 pound M for persons admitted for rehabilitation within 12 months of injury, 0.7- pound 0.5 pound M within 2 years of injury and, 0.5-0.36M pound for admissions after 2 years.
   Conclusions: Specialist rehabilitation for neurobehavioural disability produces comprehensive and sustainable improvements in the life of individuals with brain injury. The initial costs associated with neurobehavioural rehabilitation are offset by savings in costs of support in the medium and longer term.

AB On an international scale, the last seventy-five years have been a period of deep social, economic and political transformation for the developing countries. They have been especially influenced by the international phenomenon of globalization, the benefits of which have been unequally distributed among countries. In this context, the strategies used to improve the general nutritional health of the population of developing countries include broad approaches integrating nutritional interventions in a context of sustainable community development, while valuing the existing relations between fields as diverse as agriculture, education, sociology, economy, health, environment, hygiene and nutrition. The community nutrition programmes are emblematic of these initiatives. Nevertheless, in spite of the increasing evidence of the potential possibilities offered by these programmes to improve the nutritional status and contribute to the development and the self-sufficiency of the community, their success is relatively limited, due to the inappropriate planning, implementation and evaluation of the programmes. In the present article, I attempt to emphasie the importance of community participation of the population of developing countries in the community nutrition programmes within the context of globalization. This process is not only an ethical imperative, but a pragmatic one. It is a crucial step in the process of liberation, democratization and equality that will lead to true sustainable development.

AB 1. On-farm quantification of sustainability indicators ( SI) is an effective way to make sustainable development measurable. The egg production sector was used as a case study to illustrate this approach.
   2. The objective was to select SI for economic, ecological and societal issues, and to analyse the performance on selected SI of different production systems.
   3. For the case study, we compared 4 egg production systems, characterised by differences in the housing systems which are most common in the Netherlands: the battery-cage system, the deep-litter system with and without outdoor run, and the aviary system with outdoor run.
   4. Based on a clear set of criteria, we selected SI for animal welfare, economics, environmental impact, ergonomics and product quality.
   5. We showed that on-farm quantification of SI was an appropriate method to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different systems.
   6. From this analysis it appears that the aviary system with outdoor run is a good alternative for the battery-cage system, with better scores for the aviary system on animal welfare and economics, but with worse scores on environmental impact.

SO BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID GREEN
AB Minimizing the use of energy is a central task in sustainable building. Minimizing the use of natural resources and maximizing the recycling potential are other important tasks to take into consideration. In low-energy buildings, the embodied energy accounts for a considerable part of the total energy use of the building. Therefore, it is also imperative to pay attention to the choice of building materials used. This article presents how material choice may affect both embodied energy and recycling potential in one of the most energy efficient apartment-type housing projects in Sweden (calculated energy for operation is 45 kWh/m(2) floor area per year). Initially, the embodied energy was 40% of total energy needed for a lifetime expectancy of 50 years. Through material substitution, the embodied energy can be decreased by approximately 17% or increased by about 6%. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we focus on a specific component of economically relevant trust, i.e. on what we call 'institutionally produced generalized trust', defined as the amount of widespread trust (which is a public good for the economic system as a whole) endogenously and continuously generated by the interaction of two types of private organizations operating in the economy: for-profit firms and nonprofit organizations. Through ail evolutionary model with a trust accumulation equation and two replicator equations (capturing the evolution of economic organizations over time) we show that (1) the fixed point where all the four sub-types of private organizations considered in the model are simultaneously present can be attractive only if 'virtuous' for-profits (i.e. socially responsible firms) and 'virtuous' nonprofits (i.e. actually trustworthy mission-oriented organizations) generate a negative externality on the other organizations of the same type. (2) The fixed point where the level of trust is very low and no socially responsible firms neither trustworthy organizations are present can be attractive; this social configuration interestingly recalls, to some extent, what some prominent social scientists depict as a trend currently occurring in the United States. (3) A socio-economic scenario where four pure population fixed points are simultaneously attractive exists. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As a byproduct of rapid urbanization and industrial development in the Pearl River estuary of South China, excessive release of various types of persistent toxic substances were conveyed from agricultural, industrial and municipal discharges at upstream section down into the estuary largely via various river outlets. In this paper, a persistent organic pollution (POP) characterization of sediments in the estuary is undertaken. More than one bioavailable toxicants are detected to play active roles in causing toxicity of marine sediments in the estuary. POPs may be transported for long distances to the downstream end of the Pearl River delta region. The data suggests that DDT might still be applied illegally within the region recently and that the prevalent levels of DDTs and HCHs in sediments are likely to pose detrimental biological effects on benthic organisms. The findings have significant implications in order to understand the environmental changes, to determine reasonable ways for future development, and to maintain a sustainable environment in the Pearl River estuary region.

ID PORTUGAL
AB Forest resources management planning must address ecological, economic and social sustainability concerns. Integrating temporal and spatial interactions of management options at the landscape level is thus a key planning process. Yet the impacts of a management plan on the characteristics of a landscape are often hard to anticipate. Combining decision support tools with recent computer visualization techniques may be a workable option. This paper presents a visualization tool to produce dynamic simulations of prospective forested landscapes. Its architecture as well as its connection to a forest resources spatial decision support system are described. Emphasis is on strategies to address the geometrical complexity of large forest areas. Specifically, geographic and forest data pre-processors were developed to convert spatial and biometric data to a format used as input by the visualization tool. The latter addresses the geometrical complexity to construct virtual landscapes and it enables real-time navigation over the forest in each period of the planning horizon. Results are discussed for application to a large problem. Results show that the visualization tool provides effective real-time navigation capabilities to assess forest management impacts at the landscape level. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In North American boreal forests, wildfire is the dominant agent of natural disturbance. A natural disturbance model has therefore been promoted as an ecologically based approach to forest harvesting in these systems. Given accelerating resource demands, fire competes with harvest for timber, and there is increasing pressure to salvage naturally burned areas. This creates a management paradox: simultaneous promotion of natural disturbance as a guide to sustainability while salvaging forests that have been naturally disturbed. The major drivers of posffire salvage in Canadian boreal forests are societal perceptions, overallocation of forest resources, and economic and policy incentives, and post fire salvage compromises forest sustainability by diminishing the role of fire as a critical, natural process. These factors might be reconciled through consideration of fire in resource allocations and application of active adaptive management We provide novel treatment of the role of burn severity in mediating biotic response by examining its influence on the amount, type, and distribution of live, postfire residual material, and we highlight the role of fire in shaping spatial and temporal patterns in forest biodiversity. Maintenance of natural posffire forests is a critical component of an ecosystem-based approach to forest management in boreal systems. Nevertheless, present practices focus heavily on expediting removal of timber from burned forests, despite increasing evidence that postfire communities differ markedly from postharvest systems, and there is a mismatch between emerging management models and past management practices. Policies that recognize the critical role of fire in these systems and facilitate enhanced understanding of natural system dynamics in support of development of sustainable management practices are urgently needed.

AB Scenario planning is a promising tool for dealing with uncertainty, but it has been underutilized in ecology and conservation. The use of scenarios to explore ecological dynamics of alternative futures has been given a major boost by the recently completed Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a 4-year initiative to investigate relationships between ecosystem services and human well-being at multiple scales. Scenarios, as descriptive narratives of pathways to the future, are a mechanism for improving the understanding and management of ecological and social processes by scientists and decision makers with greater flexibility than conventional techniques could afford. We used scenarios in one of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment's subglobal components to explore four possible futures in a Southern African river basin. Because of its ability to capture spatial and temporal dynamics, the scenario exercise revealed key trade-offs in ecosystem services in space and time and the importance of a multiple-scale scenario design. At subglobal scales, scenarios are a powerful vehicle for communication and engagement of decision makers, especially when designed to identify responses to specific problems. Scenario planning has the potential to be a critical ingredient in conservation as calls are increasingly made for the field to help define and achieve sustainable visions for the future.

AB Open-access hunting is a dynamic system in which individual hunters respond to changes in system variables such as costs of bunting and prices obtained for their catch. Sustainability indices used by conservationists ignore these human processes and focus only on the biological sustainability of current offtake levels. This focus implicitly assumes that offtake is constant, says little about the actual sustainability of the system, and fails to provide any basis for predicting the impact of most feasible management interventions. A bioeconomic approach overcomes these limitations by explicitly integrating both the biological and human components of the system. We present a graphical representation of a simple bioeconomic model of bushmeat hunting and use it to demonstrate the importance of considering system dynamics when assessing sustainability. Our results show that commonly used static sustainability indices are often misleading. The best method to assess bunting sustainability is situation dependent, but characterizing supply and demand curves, even crudely, has greater potential than current approaches to provide robust predictions in the medium term.

AB Devolution appears to challenge the traditional regional and national hierarchies of the UK, but in practice the dominance of the South East of England has been maintained through active state intervention. As social welfare has increasingly been redefined through economic success and access to the labour market, the focus of social policy has shifted accordingly. In this context the South East has been re-imagined not as a symbol of inequality and a potential source of redistribution, but rather as driver of economic prosperity and 'national' (UK) well-being.

AB Effectiveness of transgenic cottons with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cry1Ac gene along with non-transgenic commercial cultivars of Gossypium hirsutum and G. arboreum for the management of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera was evaluated at the research farm, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Patancheru, Andhra Pradesh, India. In general, there were no significant differences in oviposition between the transgenic and the non-transgenic cultivars under protected and unprotected conditions. The larval numbers were significantly lower on the transgenic hybrids during the 2004 rainy season under high infestation, but the differences in larval density between the transgenic and non-transgenic hybrids during 2002 and 2003 seasons under low levels of infestation were quite small. Bollworm damage in squares and bolls was significantly lower in the transgenic hybrids than in the nontransgenic ones, although there were a few exceptions. Differences in seed cotton yield between the transgenic and the non-transgenic hybrids were not significant under unprotected conditions at moderate levels of infestation during the 2002 and 2003 cropping seasons (except in the case of Mech 184). However, significant differences in seed cotton yield were observed during the 2004 cropping season under heavy bollworm infestation. Seed cotton yield of the first picking in transgenic hybrids was significantly greater than that of the non-transgenic counterparts. Transgenic hybrids suffered low shoot damage by spotted bollworm, Earias vittella. However, there were no differences between the transgenic and non-transgenic hybrids in their relative susceptibility to cotton jassid, Amrasca biguttula biguttula and serpentine leaf miner, Liriomyza trifolii, white fly, Bemisia tabaci, green bug, Nezara viridula, ash weevil, Myllocerus undecimpustulatus, and red cotton bug, Dysdercus koenigii. With a few exceptions, the bollworm damage and seed cotton yield of the G. arboreum varieties Aravinda and MDL 2450, and the G. hirsutum variety L 604 was not significantly different than that of the transgenic hybrids, and these varieties were also resistant to cotton jassid. The results suggested that it would be useful to combine transgenic resistance to H. armigera with plant characteristics conferring resistance to the target or non-target insect pests in the region in order to realize the full potential of transgenic plants for sustainable crop production.

AB It has been demonstrated repeatedly that the degree to which regulation operates and the magnitude of environmental variation in an exploited population will together dictate the type of sustainable harvest achievable. Yet typically, harvest models fail to incorporate uncertainty in the underlying dynamics of the target population by assuming a particular (unknown) form of endogenous control. We use a novel approach to estimate the sustainable yield of saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) populations from major river systems in the Northern Territory, Australia, as an example of a system with high uncertainty. We used multimodel inference to incorporate three levels of uncertainty in yield estimation: (1) uncertainty in the choice of the underlying model(s) used to describe population dynamics, (2) the error associated with the precision and bias of model parameter estimation, and (3) environmental fluctuation (process error). We demonstrate varying strength of evidence for density regulation (1.3-96.7%) for crocodiles among 19 river systems by applying a continuum of five dynamical models (density-independent with and without drift and three alternative density-dependent models) to time series of density estimates. Evidence for density dependence increased with the number of yearly transitions over which each river system was monitored. Deterministic proportional maximum sustainable yield (PMSY) models varied widely among river systems (0.042-0.611), and there was strong evidence for an increasing PMSY as support for density dependence rose. However, there was also a large discrepancy between PMSY values and those produced by the full stochastic simulation projection incorporating all forms of uncertainty, which can be explained by the contribution of process error to estimates of sustainable harvest. We also determined that a fixed-quota harvest strategy (up to 0.2K, where K is the carrying capacity) reduces population size much more rapidly than proportional harvest (the latter strategy requiring temporal monitoring of population size to adjust harvest quotas) and greatly inflates the risk of resource depletion. Using an iconic species recovering from recent extreme overexploitation to examine the potential for renewed sustainable harvest, we have demonstrated that incorporating major forms of uncertainty into a single quantitative framework provides a robust approach to modeling the dynamics of exploited populations.

TI Education and sustainable development: a political analysis
SO EDUCATIONAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the inter-relationships between 'education' and 'sustainable development' as these are played out in the political arena. Each of these two important areas of policy is prioritized by the UK government: education for over a 150 years, but emphatically so since 1997; sustainable development since at least 1992 when the Rio Earth Summit brought the issue to political (if not) public attention, and when this ( and other) governments entered into treaty obligations to advance sustainable development through the policy process - obligations which were reinforced during the Rio + 10 Summit in Johannesburg in 2002. We have written, with others, about the rise of interest in education's role in sustainable development in the period since Rio (Reid et al., Geography, 87( 3), pp. 247 - 255) and this paper does not go over this ground. Instead, we examine a range of contrasting perspectives that have been taken on these issues, ask what they reveal and what they do not, and further ask what we can and cannot say about politics, education and sustainable development. Finally, we argue that if sustainable development is to be promoted through education this requires that we learn to re-think our thinking about politics.

TI Implications of agricultural policy for species invasion in shifting

AB Policies to influence land use decisions in agriculture or grazing can increase the ability of invasive species to out-compete native species and thereby disrupt seemingly stable ecological-economic systems. Building off of models of interdependent resources, invasive species and soil fertility, this paper develops a model of shifting cultivation decisions for two types of farmers, one who sees the threat of invasive grasses and one who does not. The paper uses numerical solutions to this dynamic decision problem to examine the impact of various policies on farmer welfare and on the stability of the economic-ecological system. Some policies undermine the resilience of the system, while other policies augment the system's ability to withstand species invasions.

AB This paper applies recent advances in ecology to our understanding of firm development, sustainability, and economic development. The ecological literature indicates that the greater the functional richness of species in a system, the greater its resilience-that is, its ability to persist in the face of substantial changes in the environment. This paper focuses on the effects of functional richness across firm size on the ability of industries to survive in the face of economic change. Our results indicate that industries with a richness of industrial functions are more resilient to employment volatility.

TI Disintegrated transport policy: the multimodal studies process in

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY
LA English
DT Article
ID TRAVEL MODE CHOICE; ECOLOGICAL NORM; GREAT-BRITAIN
AB As part of a broader effort to promote more sustainable or 'integrated' transport, the United Kingdom Labour government commissioned a series of multimodal studies designed to seek genuinely multimodal solutions to traffic congestion problems in England. Consultants undertaking the studies were instructed to presume against new roads unless all other options were clearly impractical. We build upon previous work to assess the extent to which the outcome of the multimodal study process is consistent with the government's original intentions, as specified in relevant policy documentation. Our findings are that, although the process led to substantial achievements in some areas, its main outcome has been the approval of a host of new road schemes and-apart from some potentially significant public transport investment in the West Midlands-very little else. Viewed in the context of other developments since Labour came to power in 1997, such an outcome, would appear to indicate the further disintegration of the party's much-vaunted 'integrated' transport policy.

AB This paper tells a story of the community's purchase of the North Harris Estate, Isle of Harris, Scotland, bringing the land under collective ownership where previously it was held by an individual as a 'private' estate. At the broadest level the paper contributes conceptually to research whose objective is to challenge the inevitability of global imaginaries. Situated in the specific context of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, such action as that of the North Harris Trust has the potential to disturb global narratives of enclosure and privatisation. In recounting the story, the argument centres on the political possibilities of the land. In parallel with arguments concerning 'place', I examine how the re-creation of a collective, place-based identity in the new political spaces afforded by the North Harris Trust is linked to the process of negotiating the meanings of the land. The meanings of the land relate both to the mediation of historically resonant collective rights to the land and to how 'nature' is constituted in the search for socially just and sustainable futures. The focus is on the principles and everyday practices through which land and community are coproduced.

AB Mn plays an important role in plants. Soil Mn deficiency may markedly limit production of cereals, such as wheat. Wheat crop Mn deficiency can be corrected by application of Mn fertilizer, however, growing wheat cultivars adapted to Mn-deficient soils would represent a long-term solution and sustainable approach to wheat agronomy. The aim of this research was to characterise the physiological basis in Mn efficiency identified among a range of UK wheat cultivars grown in Mn-deficient soil in pot trials. Results demonstrated that the old spring wheat cultivar Maris Butler is Mn-efficient when grown in Mn-deficient conditions in comparison with modem commercial cultivar Paragon. Plants of cv. Maris Butler grown in Mn-deficient soil showed a mean relative dry matter 80% of plants in Mn-sufficient soil, whereas the modem cultivar Paragon gave a relative value of 55%. The Mn efficiency in cv. Maris Butler was shown to be related to an improved internal utilization of Mn, rather than to a higher plant Mn accumulation, which was expressed as an improved efficiency of photosynthetic photosystem II. From this study, it is suggested that cv. Maris Butler could be further examined as a potential genetic resource in future wheat micronutrient efficiency improvement programs aimed at achieving Mn efficiency in wheat. It is also suggested from this study that more than one mechanism has arisen in wheat to confer tolerance to Mn deficiency. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polyphenols in plants can protect proteins from degradation and improve the efficiency of conversion of plant protein to animal protein (meat and milk), but can this be achieved in a way that is environmentally sustainable, profitable to the livestock farmer and is consistent with aspirations for improved livestock nutrition, health, welfare and product quality? Given that grazed and conserved forage is the bedrock of sustainable ruminant production, this paper attempts to consider what challenges are ahead in terms of enhancing productive efficiency, reducing the polluting footprint of livestock agriculture and alleviating the endemic parasitism that occurs with grazing animals.

AB We used pitfall traps to study the effects of fire and salvage logging on distribution of carabid beetles over a forest disturbance gradient ranging from salvaged (naturally burned and subsequently harvested) to unsalvaged (naturally burned and left standing). Significantly more carabids were caught in the salvaged forest and the overall catch decreased steadily through the edge and into the unsalvaged forest. We also noted a strong negative correlation between carabid abundance and percent vegetation cover. Beetle diversity as measured through rarefaction was significantly greater at the edge relative to both the unsalvaged and salvaged forest. This stand level study suggests that the amount of edge habitat created by salvage logging has significant implications for recovery of epigaeic, beetle assemblages in burned forests by inflating the abundance of "open habitat" species in the initial communities. Carabid beetle responses to salvage logging can differ from responses to harvesting in unburned boreal forest suggesting that management of postfire forests requires special consideration.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY

   river basin; China
AB Water resources use is a key parameter in the hydrological cycle, especially in arid inland of Northwest China, groundwater movement and circulation processes are closely related to the surface water, while recoverable and renewable groundwater mainly comes from the conversion of surface river water, and there is extensive transfer among rainfall, surface water and groundwater. Human activity, in particular, large-scale water resources exploitation and development associated with dramatic population growth in the last decades, has led to tremendous changes in the water regime. There are misuse and wastage of surface water with traditional multi-channel irrigation for most rivers, which in turn leads to over-exploitation of groundwater to augment supplies. This situation has been exacerbated by rapid population growth and socio-economic development, with decreased irrigational systems return to groundwater due to the irrigation system in the middle reaches of rivers in the Hexi region becoming better. The investigations of this study revealed that over the last decades, man-made oases have developed rapidly in various inland river basins. With the increasing human demand for water, the contradiction between water demand and water supply is becoming increasingly acute and the amount of groundwater usage significantly increased. Notwithstanding the annual surface water from mountains is relatively stable in the Hexi region, the recharges of groundwater have been reduced by 11.1%, with a maximum reduction of 50% in the Shiyang River basin. Groundwater abstraction increased by approximately six times, particularly in the Shiyang River basin, groundwater abstraction exceeds recharge by 4.1x10(8) m(3) year(-1) in recent decades. Consequently, the groundwater level has declined widely by 3-16 m, with a maximum decline of 45 m in several groundwater observation wells in the Minqin basin on the lower reaches of the Shiyang River basin. These cause serious human activity-induced environmental problems, such as water-quality deterioration, vegetation degradation, soil salinization and land desert desertification, etc. It is suggested that modernized irrigation technology and new regulation to cover water resources management and allocation with the river basins are urgently needed to achieve a sustainable development. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of the development of water resources on the environment in arid inland river basins in Northwestern China, which were analyzed by comparing the three main river basins (i.e., the Shuilei, the Heihe and the Shiyang River basins) with different water resources development cases.

AB Coastal waters have been significantly influenced by increased inputs of nutrients that have accompanied population growth in adjacent drainage basins. In Tampa Bay, Florida, USA, the population has quadrupled since 1950. By the late 1970s, eutrophic conditions including phytoplankton and macroalgal blooms and seagrass losses were evident. The focus of improving Tampa Bay is centered on obtaining sufficient water quality necessary for restoring seagrass habitat, estimated to have been 16,400 ha in 1950 but reduced to 8800 ha by 1982. To address these problems, targets for nutrient load reductions along with seagrass restoration goals were developed and actions were implemented to reach adopted targets. Empirical regression models were developed to determine relationships between chlorophyll a concentrations and light attenuation adequate for sustainable seagrass growth. Additional empirical relationships between nitrogen loading and chlorophyll a concentrations were developed to determine how Tampa Bay responds to changes in loads. Data show that when nitrogen load reduction and chlorophyll a targets are met, seagrass cover increases. After nitrogen load reductions and maintenance of chlorophyll a at target levels, seagrass acreage has increased 25% since 1982, although more than 5000 ha of seagrass still require recovery. The cooperation of scientists, managers, and decision makers participating in the Tampa Bay Estuary Program's Nitrogen Management Strategy allows the Tampa Bay estuary to continue to show progress towards reversing many of the problems that once plagued its waters. These results also highlight the importance of a multi-entity watershed management process in maintaining progress towards science-based natural resource goals.

AB Onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) are becoming increasingly important for the treatment and dispersal of effluent in new urbanised developments that are not serviced by centralised wastewater collection and treatment systems. However, the current standards and guidelines adopted by many local authorities for assessing suitable site and soil conditions for OWTS are increasingly coming under scrutiny due to the public health and environmental impacts caused by poorly performing systems, in particular septic tank-soil adsorption systems. In order to achieve sustainable onsite wastewater treatment with minimal impacts on the environment and public health, more appropriate means of assessment are required. This paper highlights an integrated risk based approach for assessing the inherent hazards associated with OWTS in order to manage and mitigate the environmental and public health risks inherent with onsite wastewater treatment. In developing a sound and cohesive integrated risk framework for OWTS, several key issues must be recognised. These include the inclusion of relevant stakeholders throughout framework development, the integration of scientific knowledge, data and analysis with risk assessment and management ideals, and identification of the appropriate performance goals for successful management and mitigation of associated risks. These issues were addressed in the development of the risk framework to provide a generic approach to assessing risk from OWTS. The utilisation of the developed risk framework for achieving more appropriate assessment and management techniques for OWTS is presented in a case study for the Gold Coast region, Queensland State, Australia.

TI Impact of 100-year human interventions on the deltaic coastal zone of
   the Inner Thermaikos Gulf (Greece): A DPSIR framework analysis

AB The Axios River delta and the Inner Thermaikos Gulf coastal zone have experienced a long period of human interventions during the past 100 years. A post-evaluation of long run coastal zone changes under the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Response (DPSIR) conceptual framework is presented. The DPSIR approach is then used to project out into possible futures in order to connect with policy and management options proposed for the improvement of the current conditions and the achievement of sustainable development, in the coastal zone. Socio-economic driving forces with their origins in the end of the 19(th) century have generated numerous pressures in the coastal environment that changed the state of the environment. In the first part of the last century, there was no coupling between change of state and policy. Due to increasing environmental awareness, a coupling became more apparent over the last thirty years. Human interventions include river route realignment, extensive drainage of the plains, irrigation network, roads and dam constructions. The consequences were positive for the economic development of the area, human health, and navigation for the port of Thessaloniki. In contrast, the manipulation and over-use of natural resources has led to a reduction of wetlands, biodiversity loss, stress on freshwater supplies, and subsidence of coastal areas, aquifer salinization, and rapid coastal erosion. Three plausible future scenarios are utilised in order to investigate the implications of this environmental change process and possible socio-economic consequences.

AB Simulating hydrologic processes in geologically complex environments is a difficult scientific task since it incorporates high level of uncertainty. Many studies have attempted to accurately quantify the rainfall-water level elevation relationship in freshwater bodies so as to predict flooding and drought events. For this purpose several types of models have been implemented including distributed, black box and conceptual models that often provide efficient results, depending on the availability of reliable data as well as on the level of understanding of the system. Nevertheless, in the particular effort, three different models have been used to describe the relationship between rainfall and water level elevation in Trichonis Lake during the period 1951-1997. A Transfer Function model, a Dynamic Linear Regression and a physically based model, consisting of the lake's water budget equation, its Digital Bathymetric Model and GIS algorithms. These models have been tested to assess their efficiency and applicability in a karstic environment and the aim of the study was to find the best modeling option for developing sustainable water management plans and establishing a flooding/drought warning system in the particular lake catchment. The results indicated that in areas with geologically complex conditions, simple, physically-based models operate better than mechanistic models which usually cannot describe adequately the complexity of the system.

AB Aboveground biomass, aboveground litterfall, and leaf litter decomposition of five indigenous tree stands (pure stands of Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra, Cedrus libani, Juniperus excelsa, and a mixed stand of Abies cilicica, P. nigra, and C. libani) were measured in an eastern Mediterranean evergreen needleleaf forest of Turkey. Measurements were converted to regional scale estimates of carbon (C) stocks and fluxes of forest ecosystems, based on general non-site-specific allometric relationships. Mean C stock of the conifer forests was estimated as 97.8 +/- 79 Mg C ha(-1) consisting of 83.0 +/- 67 Mg C ha(-1) in the aboveground and 14.8 +/- 12 Mg C ha(-1) in the belowground biomass. The forest stands had mean soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SON) stocks of 172.0 +/- 25.7 Mg C ha(-1) and 9.2 +/- 1.2 Mg N ha(-1), respectively. Mean total monthly litterfall was 376.2 +/- 191.3 kg C ha(-1), ranging from 641 +/- 385 kg C ha(-1) for Pinus brutia to 286 +/- 82 kg C ha(-1) for Cedrus libani. Decomposition rate constants (k) for pine needles were 0.0016 for Cedrus libani, 0.0009 for Pinus nigra, 0.0006 for the mixed stand, and 0.0005 day(-1) for Pinus brutia and Juniperus excelsa. Estimation of components of the C budgets revealed that the forest ecosystems were net C sinks, with a mean sequestration rate of 2.0 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) ranging from 3.2 +/- 2 Mg C ha(-1) for Pinus brutia to 1.6 +/- 0.6 Mg C ha(-1) for Cedrus libani. Mean net ecosystem productivity (NEP) resulted in sequestration of 98.4 +/- 54.1 Gg CO2 yr(-1) from the atmosphere when extrapolated for the entire study area of 134.2 km(2) (Gg = 10(9) g). The quantitative C data from the study revealed the significance of the conifer Mediterranean forests as C sinks.

TI A long-term forecast analysis on worldwide land uses
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT

DE land uses; agriculture; world; forecast; environment
AB More and more lands worldwide are being cultivated for food production while forests are disappearing at an unprecedented rate. This paper aims to make a long-term forecast on land uses worldwide and provide the publics, researchers, and government officials with a clear profile for land uses in the future. Data of land uses since 1961 were used to fit historical trajectories and make the forecast. The results show that trajectories of land areas can be well fitted with univariate linear regressions. The forecasts of land uses during the coming 25 years were given in detail.
   Areas of agricultural land, arable land, and permanent pasture land worldwide would increase by 6.6%, 7.2%, and 6.3% respectively in the year 2030 as compared to the current areas. Permanent crops land area all over the world is forecasted to increase 0.64% by 2030. By the year 2030 the areas of forests and woodland, nonarable and nonpermanent land worldwide would decrease by 2.4% and 0.9% against the current areas. All other land area in the world would dramatically decline by 6.4% by the year 2030.
   Overall the land area related to agriculture would tend to decrease in developed countries, industrialized countries, Europe, and North and Central America. The agriculture related land area would considerably increase in developing countries, least developed countries, low-income countries, Asia, Africa, South America, etc.
   Developing countries hold larger total land area than developed countries. Dramatic and continuous growth in agricultural land area of developing countries would largely contribute to the expected growth of world agricultural land area in the coming years. Population explosion, food shortage and poverty in the world, especially in developing countries, together caused the excessive cultivation of land for agricultural uses in the past years. Increasing agricultural land area exacerbates the climate changes and degradation of environment. How to limit the growth of human population is a key problem for reducing agricultural land expansion. Development and use of high-yielding and high-quality crop and animal varieties, diversification of human food sources, and technical and financial assistance to developing countries from developed countries, should also be implemented and strengthened in the future in order to slow down or even reverse the increase trend of agricultural land area. Sustainable agriculture is the effective way to stabilize the agricultural land area without food shortage. Through various techniques and measures, sustainable agriculture may meet the food production goals with minimum environmental risk. Public awareness and interest in sustainable agriculture will help realize and ease the increasing stress from agricultural land expansion.

TI Citizen and consumer: The dual role of individuals in environmental

SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
ID RECYCLING BEHAVIOR; MOTIVATION; VALUES; NORMS; PRICE; POWER
AB This article investigates the dual role - exemplified by the ideal types of the consumer and the citizen - individuals face in the contemporary environmental policy context. As crowding-out theory highlights the implications of using the 'wrong' incentives, examining the match between policy and the value systems guiding individuals' decision-making process in practice is a relevant undertaking. Sweden provides the empirical context for the article, in which official environmental policy-discourse in Sweden is compared with the results of a mail-out survey to 4,000 individuals in four different counties. It is suggested that external motivations are perceived as highly relevant for the promotion of ecological sustainability, so the consumer element as a motivating feature of individuals' behaviour in the environmental field is indeed of considerable importance. However, at the same time people tend to ascribe far greater importance to the motivational values included in the self-transcendence cluster (altruism) as guiding principles in life than to the opposing values of self-enhancement (egoism), indicating that the citizen-role is also important to take into account in policy design. It is concluded that there is a mismatch between the content of Sweden's policy documents and the general value orientation held by the Swedish citizenry.

AB How much produced capital would resource-abundant countries have today if they had actually followed the Hartwick Rule (invest resource rents in other assets) over the last 30 years? We employ time series data on investment and rents on exhaustible resource extraction for 70 countries to answer this question. The results are striking: Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, and Gabon would all have as much produced capital as South Korea, while Nigeria would have five times its current level. A specific rule for sustainability - maintain positive constant genuine investment - is shown to lead to unbounded consumption.

AB The future of Earth's natural capital, and the ecosystem service benefits it supplies humanity, hinges on whether conservation and restoration become economically attractive and commonplace on lands managed for profit. Sustainable forestry is a potential means of making restoration profitable; in most of the world, it remains the only way to reforest large areas while maintaining economic viability for the landowner. Here we explore the potential benefits and limitations of native tree forestry as an economically viable conservation tool in the context of a case study-koa forestry on Hawaii Island. We conducted interviews with practitioners and scientists to evaluate koa forestry as means of restoring natural capital in Hawaii. Our interviews demonstrated strong interest in the ecological and economic potential of koa, but the respondents also cited a litany of concerns. Koa's attractiveness to private landowners is hampered by a lack of silvicultural information (particularly on native trees such as koa), the challenge of balancing profit and biodiversity, wariness of government involvement, and perhaps most importantly, large upfront costs and having to wait several decades for revenue from timber harvest. Establishing new revenue streams for non-timber ecosystem services of koa forests-through government or private sector payments-could greatly enhance the attractiveness of this land use to a diverse set of landowners.

AB The proliferation of designated areas following the implementation of Natura 2000 in Greece has initiated changes in the protected area design and conservation policy making aiming at delivering action for biodiversity and integrative planning on a wider landscape. Following the sustainability concept, an integrative approach cannot realistically take place simply by extending the protected area and designations. The paper addresses public involvement and inter-sectoral coordination as major procedural elements of integrative management and evaluates the nature and strength of their negative or positive influences on the fulfillment of an integrative vision of nature conservation. A review of the history of protected areas and administration developments in Greece provide useful input in the research. The analysis has shown that the selected network of Natura 2000 sites has been superimposed upon the existing system and resulted in duplication of administrative effort and related legislation. As a result the overall picture of protected areas in the country appears complex, confusing and fragmented. Major failures to integrated conservation perspective can be traced to structural causes rooted in politico-economic power structures of mainstream policy and in a rather limited political commitment to conservation. It is concluded that greater realisation. of integrated conservation in Greece necessitates policy reforms related mainly to sectoral legal frameworks to promote environmentalism as well as an increased effort by the managing authorities to facilitate a broader framework of public dialogue and give local communities incentives to sustainably benefit from protected areas.

AB Neither ecologists nor economists can teach us what we most need to know about nature: how to value it. The Hebrew prophets claimed that there can be no intelligent human ecology except as people learn to use land justly and charitably. Lands do not flow with milk and honey for all unless and until justice rolls down like waters. What kind of planet ought we humans wish to have? One we resourcefully manage for our benefits? Or one we hold in loving care? Science and economics can't teach us that; perhaps religion and ethics can.

AB Economics has played an important role in assessing climate change impacts, and the effects of various individual and policy response strategies. Proponents of a key role for economics in analysis of climate change policies and goals argue that its capacity to incorporate and compare a variety of costs and benefits makes it uniquely useful for normative assessment. Critics of economic analysis of climate change have questioned not only its empirical capacities, but also its fundamental usefulness given some of the important but often implicit assumptions on which it is based. After reviewing this debate and its implications for public policy on climate change, the paper sketches a way in which more technical economic analysis and public dialogue might be combined.

AB The Atlantic horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, is harvested by the biomedical industry for Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) a blood compound used to detect endotoxins, for scientific research on vision, and as bait for the eel and conch fisheries. They are also subject to sources of natural mortality such as consumption of eggs by shorebirds and stranding. Recently there has been growing concern over possible declines in Limulus populations along the east coast of the United States. We have used stage-structured matrix modeling to improve our understanding of Limulus population dynamics in three Cape Cod estuaries (Stage Harbor, Pleasant Bay, and Barnstable Harbor) with differing harvest pressures. The results suggest that a low level of harvest is sustainable, particularly if timing and size-specificity of the harvest are taken into consideration. The model also suggests that efforts should be made to avoid harvesting crabs prior to sexual maturity, as the population growth rate is more sensitive to changes in survival rate of older juveniles than of other stages. The information the model provides could assist local and regional fisheries managers in establishing appropriate regulations for the horseshoe crab fishery.

AB Bio-indicators were measured on juvenile fish to assess the quality of eight coastal and estuarine nursery grounds in the Eastern English Channel and in the Bay of Biscay during 3 years. Growth (size and otolith daily increment width), body condition (morphometric index) and abundance of juvenile common soles were analysed together with xenobiotic concentrations (heavy metals and organic contaminants).
   Condition indices displayed important variations and did not allow relevant estimation of environmental quality. On the contrary, growth and density indicators showed good steadiness above years but varied among sites. In spite of difficulties of interpreting these indicators on such a meso-scale approach, analyses highlighted the estuaries of Seine and Gironde. In these nursery areas, the levels of contamination were especially high, and the combination of fish growth performances and density was significantly lower than in other sites. The combination of these variables appears to provide reliable indicators of habitat quality and anthropogenic pressure on nursery grounds, especially highlighting contaminated areas. Such indicators may thus contribute to improve assessment of environmental quality of essential fish habitats with the aim of a sustainable management of fisheries resources. A study at a different scale, from this meso-scale nursery approach with more precise analyses, on local habitats, will nevertheless be necessary to optimize the relevance of these indicators for the assessment of essential fish habitat quality.

DT Article
DE sustainable development; urban governance
AB The sustainable development of the cities of Latin America and the Caribbean poses important challenges for the urban territorial policies at their local subnational national and regional levels. It requires the convergence in the urban space of the necessity of internalizing the environmental costs (via improvement of the management and governability of the associated systems), assuming and solving social inequities (via improvement of urban habitability and the investement of capitals), and the recognition and approach to economic restrictions related to efficiency (by improving the offer of financing). This work discusses these themes in their social economic and environmental dimensions, applied to the sustainable development of the human settlements in the region, focused both on present limitations and opportunities in this field, as well as on the regional process in terms of political reforms, implementation of programs and the development of projects. It is suggested that there are certain conditions orfactors that systematically fail in the development and implementation of policies aiming at this objective. One of these factors refers to the governability of the system, meaning by this, the characteristics of the relationships between actors (urban management and political will included), and the formal and informal rules of the system. The latter incorporates the institutional and normative frame that governs politics. The other factor refers to the scarcity of development of mechanisms of financing for the sustainable urban development.

ID REGIONS
AB From its origins in the Brunddand report, sustainable development was projected as an activity that was best generated and most appropriate at the local scale. This localisation of the phenomenon was also central to the thinking behind Local Agenda 21. Despite numerous worldwide initiatives along the lines of LA21, it is clear that local applications in metropolitan areas operating without an overarching city-wide framework oriented towards sustainability are likely to conftont serious obstacles. While recognising the value of localised initiatives, it is vital that sustainability is at the core of metropolitan level planning. Specifically the role of strategic urban planning has considerable overlaps with the pretensions of the sustainability agenda, such as high levels of participation, long time horizons, and integrated rather than sectoral decision-making. This article highlights these overlaps and the potentialities for regarding urban sustainability as a conceptual platform for strategic urban planning. Various metropolitan experiences of strategic planning are considered, particularly the case of Santiago de Chile.

AB This paper develops an Urban Sustainability Index System as part of a broader effort to provide better quality data and statistical analysis for local environmental decision-making. We show that urban sustainability can be measured in a comprehensive and synthetic way. In providing fair comparison across cities while keeping sensibility to local context, this index system can be used by policy-makers as a powerful tool to identify critical trends and policy gaps. This Urban Sustainability Index System has been applied to 57 cities in the metropolitan areas of Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte, Brazil The results indicate two different paths in relation to sustainability. The first is characterized by a gap between environmental quality and human development, leading away from sustainability. It is followed by the core cities and highly industrialized ones in both metropolitan areas. The second leads towards sustainability and is followed by a heterogeneous group of cities in both regions.

AB This paper defines the index of environmental quality (ICA) as a latent variable determined by a group of factor that affects it in a positive and negative manner. Setting off from the hypothesis of non environmental homogenous pertaining to urban territory, and following the construction of a system of simple indicators and its application in larges city. The most influential factors in the determination of the ICA by each comuna are established as well. Consequently, important information is derived, which will enable the planner and environmental agent to prioritize the assignation of economic resources, not only in a differential way among comunas but for the sort of resources or environmental variables that most affect the quality of environment.

AB Objective: To assess the effects of plant sterol or stanol ester consumption on their incorporation into erythrocytes and their effects on osmotic fragility of red blood cells.
   Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trial.
   Subjects and intervention: Forty-one subjects on stable statin treatment - who already have increased serum plant sterol and stanol concentrations - first received for 4 weeks a control margarine. For the next 16 weeks, subjects were randomly assigned to one of three possible interventions. Eleven subjects continued with control margarine, 15 subjects with plant sterol ester enriched and 15 subjects with plant stanol ester-enriched margarine. Daily plant sterol or stanol intake was 2.5 g. Erythrocyte haemolysis was measured spectrophotometrically at five different saline concentrations.
   Results: Despite significant (P = 0.004) increases of, respectively, 42 and 59% in cholesterol-standardized serum sitosterol and campesterol concentrations in the plant sterol group as compared to the control group, campesterol levels in the red blood cells did not change (P = 0.196). Osmotic fragility did not change significantly (P = 0.757) in the plant sterol and plant stanol groups as compared to the control group.
   Conclusion: We conclude that plant sterol and stanol ester consumption for 16 weeks does not change osmotic fragility of erythrocytes in statin-treated patients.

AB An underlying scientific rationale exists for combining alpha-adrenergic blockade and 5 alpha-reductase inhibition for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), given that their modes of action in managing LUTS secondary to BPH are different and complementary. Both alpha-blockers and 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) provide sustainable reductions in symptom scores. Although both classes of agents have data to support delays in acute urinary retention (AUR) and the need for invasive BPH therapy, only the 5-ARIs reduce the long-term risks of both events. Current evidence suggests that initiation of combination therapy should be considered in men with prostatic enlargement, elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, LUTS, and moderate or severe bother. The Medical Therapy of Prostate Symptoms (MTOPS) study provided evidence that the prostate volume threshold for benefit of a 5-ARI, and therefore of combination therapy, is lower than previously thought (> 25 cc). Cost effectiveness in this population has been demonstrated to increase in men with severe symptoms, although transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is probably more favourable in the long-term from a cost perspective. However, many men wish to avoid surgery, and for them, combination therapy offers significant benefits over monotherapy, especially over alpha-blocker therapy where no long-term reductions in the risk of AUR or surgery have been demonstrated.

AB The neuropeptide galanin is considered to be an endogenous antiepileptic agent, presumably acting via inhibition of glutamate release. Previously, we have demonstrated that in mice ectopically overexpressing galanin in cortical and hippocampal neurons, particularly in granule cells and their axons, the mossy fibers, hippocampal kindling epileptogenesis is suppressed and is associated with attenuated frequency facilitation in mossy fiber-CA3 cell synapses. We hypothesized that changes in synaptic transmission might occur also in other excitatory synapses of the galanin overexpressing (GalOE) mouse, contributing to seizure suppression. Lateral olfactory tract (LOT) synapses, formed by axons of olfactory bulb (013) mitral cells and targeting piriform cortex (PC) pyramidal cells, ectopically express galanin in GalOE mice. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we found that excitatory synaptic responses recorded in PC pyramidal cells during high frequency stimulation of the LOT were attenuated in GalOE mice as compared to wild-type controls. This effect was mimicked by bath application of galanin or its agonist galnon to wild-type slices, supporting the notion of ectopic galanin action. Since the high frequency activation induced in vitro resembles epileptic seizures in vivo, we asked whether the observed synaptic inhibition would result in altered epileptogenesis when animals were kindled via the same synapses. In male GalOE mice, we found that the latency to convulsions was prolonged, and once animals had experienced the first stage 5 seizure, generalized seizures were less sustainable. These data indicate that the PC is a possible target for epilepsy treatment by ectopically overexpressing galanin to modulate seizure activity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Stock enhancement initiatives have become an increasingly popular intervention in inland rural fisheries development over the past two decades, with stocking being a high priority on inland fisheries development agendas in Southeast Asia. However, stock enhancement initiatives have shown that whilst releases of cultured juveniles have the potential to yield substantial benefits, the actual outcomes, in terms of yields, distribution of benefits and institutional sustainability, are often different from those initially expected. One reason for this is the complexity of the environments into which enhancements are introduced, involving dynamic interactions between the biological characteristics of the resource, the technical intervention of enhancement and, crucially, the people who use and manage it. The introduction of people as a major factor affecting outcomes distinguishes stock enhancement from aquaculture. It also makes the need for interdisciplinary and social science research increasingly evident. This paper highlights lessons learned from long-term interdisciplinary research on stock enhancement of small waterbodies in Lao PDR. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we sought to understand when enhancement would be taken up by resource users, what factors affected the nature and distribution of enhancement benefits, and what affect resource users had on those biological outcomes that were achievable in the first instance. The responses to enhancement varied. Factors facilitating uptake included strong leadership, direct observation of benefits and an ability to adapt technology to suit requirements. When taken up, stock enhancement catalysed institutional change that affected both the nature and distribution of benefits among resource users. Who this benefited, and to what extent, was highly context specific and dependant on the wider social, political and institutional environment surrounding the enhanced fishery. Finally, interdisciplinary research demonstrated that an increase in production potential did not automatically lead to an increase in yields. Rather, it depended on the characteristics of the user community and the way they chose to manage and use the resource. Resource users were crucial in determining all the outcomes of stock enhancement. They were not only recipients, but also drivers, of enhancement technology. This has fundamental implications for how stock enhancement research and development is conducted. In particular, it requires increased participation of resource users in the research process, serious inter-disciplinary study, and the need to recognise and deal with uncertainty.

AB For almost 20 years, the Marine Science Institute (MSI), University of the Philippines, has been culturing giant clams to restore depleted populations of these large bivalves in the Philippines, and to promote giant clam farming as a sustainable livelihood. Restocking activities were done in collaboration with local groups by providing training in the culture and ocean rearing of giant clams, and by implementing a "users pay" approach. Initially, a variety of giant clam species was used but once F1 broodstock of Tridacna gigas were reared, restocking focused on this species due to its scarcity and fast rate of growth. About 20000 T. gigas were placed on coral reefs. In addition, > 50000 clams (T gigas, T. squamosa, T. derasa, T. crocea, T. maxima and Hippopus hippopus) were distributed through other means. Altogether, > 40 sites throughout the Philippines received cultured giant clams. Grow-out trials to test the viability of supplying giant clams for the aquarium trade to create new sources of income were conducted successfully with a group of fishers in Bolinao, Pangasinan. However, this initiative encountered legal obstacles when the government regulatory agency prohibited the export of cultured clams, regarding this as a threat to the conservation of wild individuals. The long experience in culturing and restocking giant clams in the Philippines provides many lessons for other countries wishing to restore stocks of these large bivalves. Particular care needs to be given to selection of release sites, negotiations with participating groups to safeguard the released clams, adequate transfer of technology to collaborators, and transport of large clams from nursery areas to release sites.

AB We evaluated the structural and compositional variability between floodplain forest sites in the Amazon estuary. Although tidal floodplain forests have been commonly perceived as a homogenous forest type, comparisons of basal area and stem density show that, from one locale to another, these forests can vary greatly in structure. Comparisons of common diversity indices along with detrended correspondence analysis and indicator species analysis also reveal marked compositional differences. Local structural and compositional differences result in contrasting potential for alternative forest uses such as timber, latex, fruit and seed-oil production. For example, areas with high dominance of palms, important features of the estuarine landscape, tend to have lower potential for timber management.
   While some previous research in the Amazon estuary has emphasized the forest management for timber, other studies have focused primarily on the importance of non-timber forest products for subsistence and market economies, and for conservation. Our results indicate that contrasting views of the management potential of Amazonian tidal floodplain forests reflect not only heterogeneity of forest use by riverine people, but also the heterogeneity of the forests themselves.

AB The sustainability of a range of forest management scenarios were evaluated for the Tapajos region of the Brazilian Amazon using the growth and yield simulation model, Simflora, a derivative of the model SYMFOR developed for application in Indonesia. A simulation of current management regulations based upon a maximum extracted volume of 35 m 3 ha(-1) and a 30-year cutting cycle was found to be unsustainable. A range of alternative specifications for the control (regulation) of harvested timber yield were compared, along with associated estimates of timber increment and description of the ecological composition of the stand. The alternative scenarios included cutting cycles ranging from 10 to 60 years and maximum yields from 10 to 40 m(3) ha(-1).
   The maximum commercial volume increment predicted in this study was 0.33 m(3) ha(-1). It was observed that the highest rates of volume increment were associated with high logging intensities. The study produced a limited number of potentially sustainable options for the Tapajos forest. The best of these were the combinations of 10 m(3) ha(-1) yield and a cutting cycle of 30 years or 20 m(3) ha(-1) with a 60-year cutting cycle. The analysis suggested that the sustainability of both of these options was "marginal" and suggested adopting a precautionary approach of an additional limit for yield to be no more than 33% of standing commercial volume until more data are available.
   Analysis of the ecological data from the simulations clearly demonstrated that the composition of the managed forest is likely to differ significantly from that observed in primary forest. The most significant likely change is a reduction in the proportion of trees in the emergent ecological group. This observation raises the issue that stakeholders should not expect tropical forests that are managed for production to ever be identical in structure or composition to primary forests. It also suggests that additional technical measures will be required to promote the regeneration and growth of current emergent species if these are to be maintained in managed forests in the Amazon.
   The study concludes that there cannot be a single system of yield regulation or forest management that will fit all contexts (social, ecological, environmental and economic) or management objectives held by various stakeholders in the Amazon. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of criteria and indicators (M) for sustainable forest management (SFM) requires further development and testing at the local level. The research objectives were to develop and test a C&I system for SFM, which consists of a generic C&I set for the local level, which shows applicability for the SFM of temperate forests internationally, and can be utilized as a decision-making support system for forest management. The case study took place at the Haliburton Forest and Wild Life Reserve (Haliburton Forest) in Ontario, Canada.
   The methods applied for the development and testing of the C&I system included: the development of the generic set of C&I for SFM at the local level; the identification of verifiers and norms (using three classes of indicators assessment representing different sustainability trends); the testing of the generic C&I set as a case study; the development of indicator measurement databases; the assessment of the state of the forest and its management; and the application of adaptive management procedures. The overall sustainability assessment was based on a hierarchical rating method (multi-criteria analysis rating method without assigning weight factors) applied to all principles, criteria, and indicators.
   The C&I system consists of a sequence of generic modules which can be applied internationally in temperate forests while specifying and addressing local conditions. These modules are: the formulation of goals and objectives; the identification of local forest management standards; the application of the generic C&I set; the assessment of C&I performance; and the application of adaptive management procedures. The generic C&I set consists of 4 principles, 16 criteria, and 58 indicators. Although field-testing results are available for all 58 indicators, in the context of this paper, only data of four example indicators, one for each principle, is presented.
   The Haliburton Forest shows a very good sustainability assessment result with a sustainability assessment score of 89.9%. About 41 indicators out of 58 show a positive, the remaining 17 indicators a neutral sustainability trend. The C&I system for SFM at the local level is suitable for defining, measuring, assessing, and monitoring the sustainability of forest management. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainability scientists call for education that produces sustainability professionals', who understand the need for sustainability and can work towards it. However, students often have very different ideas, usually based on an expectation of continued unlimited economic growth. This paper, based on research with large, diverse, first year engineering cohorts, argues that a reflective process and on-line support can contribute to a learning oasis-a supportive environment that encourages students to leave their cultural and intellectual comfort zones. In these circumstances, most students will engage with the personal and professional challenges of what it means to be Globo sapiens, a wise global citizen and global sustainability professional for an increasingly complex century.

AB Ninety-five common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) landraces from Spain were evaluated in three different environments in northern Spain for their agronomic performance and seed quality. Significant differences among landraces were found for 14 quantitative traits related to phenology, yield and its components, and seed quality traits. Environmental effects were significant for all traits evaluated except for seeds pod(-1)supercript stop, seed width/thickness, seed weight, and seed water absorption. Landrace by environment interactions were significant for all traits except for seeds pod(-1)supercript stop and seed water absorption. Selection of new breeding lines for agronomic performance and seed quality within landraces should be reliable because many of them are mixture of lines. Some heirloom varieties belonging to the types 'faba', 'caparron', 'rinon', 'ganxet' and 'tolosana' had the best performances regarding to seed quality and yield. Principal component analysis revealed differences among environments affecting the performance of the bean landraces. Variation in the landraces seems to be organized in a different way in each one of the test environments, therefore, low plasticity and specific adaptation of Spanish bean landraces to different environments is derived from this study. Some landraces, especially those large and white seeded should be an useful resource for sustainable farming systems in different biogeographical areas and a worthy germplasm for the genetic improvement of agronomic value and seed quality.

AB The resilience perspective is increasingly used as an approach for understanding the dynamics of social-ecological systems. This article presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960-1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social-ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge-system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services.

AB This paper reviews the concept of adaptation of human communities to global changes, especially climate change, in the context of adaptive capacity and vulnerability. It focuses on scholarship that contributes to practical implementation of adaptations at the community scale. In numerous social science fields, adaptations are considered as responses to risks associated with the interaction of environmental hazards and human vulnerability or adaptive capacity. In the climate change field, adaptation analyses have been undertaken for several distinct purposes. Impact assessments assume adaptations to estimate damages to longer term climate scenarios with and without adjustments. Evaluations of specified adaptation options aim to identify preferred measures. Vulnerability indices seek to provide relative vulnerability scores for countries, regions or communities. The main purpose of participatory vulnerability assessments is to identify adaptation strategies that are feasible and practical in communities. The distinctive features of adaptation analyses with this purpose are outlined, and common elements of this approach are described. Practical adaptation initiatives tend to focus on risks that are already problematic, climate is considered together with other environmental and social stresses, and adaptations are mostly integrated or mainstreamed into other resource management, disaster preparedness and sustainable development programs.

AB As forests, agricultural fields, and suburban and urban lands are replaced with impervious surfaces resulting from development, the necessity to recover green space is becoming increasingly critical to maintain environmental quality. Vegetated or green roofs are one potential remedy for this problem. Establishing plant material on rooftops provides numerous ecological and economic benefits, including stormwater management, energy conservation, mitigation of the urban heat island effect, and increased longevity of roofing membranes, as well as providing a more aesthetically pleasing environment in which to work and live. Furthermore, the construction and maintenance of green roofs provide business opportunities for nurseries, landscape contractors, irrigation specialists, and other green industry members while addressing the issues of environmental stewardship. This paper is a review of current knowledge regarding the benefits of green roofs, plant selection and culture, and barriers to their acceptance in the United States. Because of building weight restrictions and costs, shallow-substrate extensive roofs are much more common than deeper intensive roofs. Therefore, the focus of this review is primarily on extensive green roofs.

AB Despite growing interest in traditional and local ecological knowledge for conservation and resource management, the role of migrant resource users is largely unexplored. Challenging many assumptions about what constitutes "local knowledge," migrant and immigrant harvesters of non-timber forest products on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington possess useful ecological knowledge of overstory-understory relationships and how forestry practices affect understory biological and commercial production. Harvesters of salal (Gaultheria shallon), a shrub used in the multi-million dollar floral greens industry, were interviewed in Mason County, Washington in 2001-2003. Interviews revealed that harvesters possess different kinds of resource management knowledge depending on whether they are experienced harvesters or more recent newcomers to the area. These differences may also correlate with differences in their harvesting practices. Understanding how resource management knowledge differs between experienced and newcomer harvesters can inform forest managers in their efforts to develop effective management and permitting policies for floral greens and other non-timber forest resources in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

AB Hatchery programmes involving the mass release of cultured fish have been implemented worldwide to supplement wild populations and to increase harvests. Hokkaido Island is one of the most active regions for Pacific salmon hatchery programmes, with ca. 1.2 billion (10(9))juveniles released annually along a coastline of ca. 3000 km, During the last quarter of the 20th century, coastal catches of chum and pink salmon increased dramatically, whereas those of masit salmon did not. In addition to the development of hatchery technologies, several possible hypotheses may explain these catch trends, including climate change, closing of hi-h-seas fisheries, rehabilitation of water quality, habitat loss caused by damming and channelling, and increased pressure from recreational fisheries. Even when these other factors have been accounted for, it is difficult to evaluate whether all hatchery programmes have actually increased net populations. To use these programmes more effectively, it is necessary to evaluate both their river- and species-specific benefits and compare hatchery programmes with other management tools, such as fishery controls and habitat rehabilitation. Future hatchery programmes should incorporate active, adaptive learning approaches to minimize the risks associated with artificial propagation and to promote sustainable salmon stocks.

AB In addition to the high-capacity storage facilities based on hydropower technologies, electrochemical solutions are today's candidate for storage for renewable energy sources support. However, sustainability and limited life cycles of batteries are often inhibiting factors. This paper presents a hybrid energy storage system with high life cycle, which is mainly based on compressed air, where the storage and discharge are done within maximum efficiency conditions. As the maximum efficiency conditions impose the level of converted power, an intermittent time-modulated operation mode is applied to the thermodynamic converter to obtain a variable converted mean power. A smoothly variable output power is achieved with the help of a supercapacitive auxiliary storage device used as a filter. This paper describes the concept of the system, the power-electronic interface circuits, and especially the maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT) algorithm and the strategy used to vary the output power. In addition, this paper presents the characteristics of high-efficiency storage systems where the pneumatic machine is replaced by an oil-hydraulic and pneumatic converter, which is used under isothermal conditions. Practical results are also presented, which are recorded from a low-power pneumatic motor coupled to a small dc generator as well as from the first prototype of the final hydropneumatic system.

On the other hand, methods of agro-ecological zoning help locate those types of land use better suited to the physical characteristics of a region. However, agro-ecological zoning has not been developed yet for agroforestry systems. In this work, such a proposal is developed, taking as a case study the coffee-parlor palm system. This proposal is based or? selection and categorization of environmental variables, construction of a cartographic model, cartographic synthesis and validation. In a reap of agro-ecological zoning, the different suitability levels present in the study area are located. It was determined that 85.5% of the area has environmental constraints. Data for agroforestry system distribution are used for the validation process and, by means of generalized linear models, the effect of environmental variables or? this distribution was assessed. Of the 11 variables, only minimum temperature (palm), stone abundance and soil fertility didn't have statistical significance (P > 0.05). With the linear models, maps of presence probability were generated. A determination coefficient of 0.70 for the climatic factor and of 0.45 for the edaphic component, were registered. Correlation analysis was carried out between the suitability reaps and the presence maps of the agroforestry system, registering correspondence only in the climatic aspect (r = -0.88).

DE brown coals; genesis; classification; Oligocene-Miocene; Serbia
AB The petrologic, chemical and technological features of low-rank coals from nineteen of the most important basins in Serbia have been studied as part of the research project of genetic-industrial classification of low-rank coals of Serbia. Most of these features have been included as parameters of the codification system for low-rank coals. The paper discusses the main genetic, technological and supplementary parameters of the Serbian brown coals such as rank, petrographic composition, gelification degree, total moisture, ash content, sulphur content, calorific value, tar yield, the chemical composition and the thermotechnical properties of ash.
   The rank of brown coals from Serbia has been defined on the basis of the following parameters: random reflectance of huminite/ vitrinite (R-r=0.26-0.50%), total moisture (W-ar=13.18-49.11%), gross calorific value (Q(daf)=22.3-29.2 MJ/kg, dry, ash-free basis), net calorific value (Q(daf)=21.2-28.1 MJ/kg, dry, ash-free basis). The results from the maceral analysis confirm that the humic coals, in general, are characterized by high huminite content (76.0-97.9vol.%, mineral matter free), low inertinite amount (0.7-6.3 vol.%, mineral matter free), and a variable amount of liptinite (0.8-15.5 vol.%, mineral matter free).
   It is possible to define three groups of Serbian brown coals on the basis of the primary, or genetic parameters, technological, or chemical parameters, and supplementary parameters: soft (Low-Rank C; [Economic Commission for Europe, Committee on Sustainable Energy-United Nations (ECE-UN), 1998. International Classification of in-Seam Coals. Energy 19, 41 pp.; Economic Commission for Europe, Committee on Sustainable Energy- United Nations (ECE-UN), 1999. International Codification System for Low-Rank Coals. Energy 9, 19 pp.; Economic Commission for Europe, Committee on Sustainable Energy- United Nations (ECE-UN), 2000. International Classification for Low-Rank Coals. Energy 12, 21 pp.]), dull (Low-Rank B) and bright brown coals (Low-Rank A). The soft brown coals of Serbia contain a high percentage of total moisture (43-56%), and ash (30-43%, dry basis). These coals have a high volatile matter content (55-75%, dry, ash-free basis), and a relatively low carbon content (54-65%, dry, ash-free basis). The gross calorific value ranges between 22 and 26 MJ/kg (dry, ash-free basis), the net calorific value is between 20 MJ/kg and 25 MJ/kg (dry, ash-free basis), and the huminite/vitrinite reflectance ranges between 0.26%Rr and 0.30%Rr. The dull brown coals of Serbia have 17-47% of total moisture, 18-35% of ash content (dry basis), 50-60% of volatile matter content (dry, ash-free basis), 63-67% of carbon content (dry, ash-free basis), gross calorific value of 26-28 MJ/kg (dry, ash-free basis), net calorific value 24-27 MJ/kg (dry, ash-free basis), and huminite/vitrinite reflectance 0.31-0.40%Rr. Bright brown coals have 13-28% of total moisture, 14-27% of ash (dry basis), 50-60% of volatile matter content (dry, ash-free basis), 65-72% of carbon content (dry, ash-free basis), gross calorific value 26-30 MJ/kg (dry, ash-free basis), net calorific value 25-29 MJ/kg (dry, ash-free basis), and huminite/vitrinite reflectance of 0.41-0.50%Rr.
   This is the first comprehensive report on the genetic-industrial classification of brown coals from Serbia according to the selected parameters and on the possibility of their utilization in industry for combustion, liquefaction and briquetting. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE European Union legislation; genetically modified organism labelling;

   organisms; green house effect; sustainable development
AB The European Union (EU) legislation regarding sustainable development moves along two distinct lines: the impact of industries (food industries included) on the environment (release of gases and green house effect and the effect of cultivating genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on the environment. EU voted three communications [COM(2002)524, COM(2003)301, COM(2004)38] in an attempt to set an action plan based on technologies to manage pollution, by promoting less polluting and less resource-intensive products and services and ways to manage resources more efficiently. As such environment-friendly technologies pervade practically all economic activities and sectors it is anticipated that they will reduce effectively energy and resource consumption thereby creating fewer emissions and less waste. As regards the cultivation and/or importing of GMOs, EU legislation was based on two directives (E.U. 90/219/EEC, E.U. 2001/18/EC) and four regulations [Regulation (EC) No. 258/97, Regulation (EC) No. 1830/2003, Regulation (EC) No. 1830/2003 and Regulation (EC) No. 1946/2003]. The directives aimed at adopting measures for limited use of GM micro-organisms, making the procedure for granting consent to the deliberate release and placing on the market of GMOs more efficient and more transparent, making GMO labelling compulsory and thereby enhancing GMOs traceability along the entire food chain.

ID FAILURES
AB Objective: The 5-year project in the province of Sofala was designed to improve access, quality and utilization of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) by strengthening rural hospitals and health centers and ultimately the health system's capacity to respond to emergencies more quickly and effectively. Methods: Implementation consisted of attention to infrastructure, human resource development, transportation and communication systems, and management. Specific management aspects that were targeted for improvement included: supportive supervision, logistics for supplies, equipment and drugs, record keeping, monitoring and evaluation, and quality improvement techniques such as maternal death audits. Results: Access to EmOC improved with an increase in the number of fully functional EmOC facilities from 4 to 18. The number of women with obstetric complications who were admitted for treatment in participating facilities tripled, and the proportion of those women dying declined by half. Conclusions: Close collaboration and partnership with the provincial health directorate make the sustainabitity of many results likely while the replication of much of the Sofata model to other provinces is promising for the national strategy to reduce maternal mortality.

AB The proposed Stochastic Energy Source Access Management (SESAM) comprises renewable energy sources coupled via a direct current bus with storage modules of complementary characteristics to achieve co-generation of hydrogen and electric power on a continuous duty basis. As complementary solutions. hydrogen energy storage to provide a large capacity and access-oriented storage based on magnetic. electric or kinetic energy with less capacity but a faster response time are considered. These are arranged to form a multi-level storage that can compensate stochastic fluctuations of power over diverse time scales. The developed energy management coordinates the operation of the diverse storage modules. In this context. the access-oriented storage acts as a shock absorber in order to shield fuel cells and electrolysers from fast fluctuations of wind power and load. The functions of the plant are validated through Simulation using meteorological information obtained from the National Wind Technology Center in the USA. The plant is shown to provide the scheduled Output of hydrogen and electric power. Since seen from its terminals SESAM behaves in the same way as a power plant with controlled fuel input. it call be readily integrated with given infrastructures.

AB The ecological footprint (EF) is a method for measuring sustainable development through ecological impact. A methodology is presented for predicting urban ecological footprints. Urban energy use and natural resource consumption were analyzed to calculate an EF based on land type (arable, pasture, forest, fossil energy land, built-up area and water area) and consumption (food, housing, transportation, goods, services and waste). The result was then compared with the local ecological carrying capacity to develop criteria for sustainable ecological footprints. Case studies of four cities in China (Guangzhou, Ningbo, Suzhou and Yangzhou) illustrate the urban EF approach. The time series of EF in a case study of Guangzhou for 1991-2001 was analyzed and the consumption-land-use matrix of urban EF was established. The results show that the cities are ecologically unsustainable, with average ecological conflicts per capita of more than 2 ha. The urban EF method is useful to measure urban sustainable development and provides policy proposals for decision-making. However, the EF method still has limitations and weaknesses.

AB China has about 20% of the world's population. With rapid economic development and substantial population increase, China is now faced with severe conflicts between limited natural resources and increasing resource requirements. In this study, we used the ecological footprint method to assess the resource demand and supply conditions of each land use in China between 1978 and 2003. In order to provide insight into the spatial heterogeneity of resource demand and supply conditions, we also assessed the ecological footprint at provincial level in 2002. An ecological footprint curve method was introduced to compare differences in natural resource use, economic development and technological progress among different countries and provinces. The results showed that the ecological footprint, biocapacity and ecological deficit per capita for China have all been increasing during 1978-2003. The ecological footprints per person in northern and eastern China were larger than those in southern and western China. The ecological deficits per person in southern and eastern China were more severe than those in northern and western China. Though the resource use efficiency has increased considerably during 1978-2003, it was still much lower than those of the Netherlands, France, South Korea, Mexico, the Philippines and India.

AB Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a convenient tool used in aggregating the indicators of sustainable development and providing indices where different weights are assigned to the various indicators. There are, however, problems in interpreting of indices, especially if time series data are used. This study explores the feasibility of applying recent developments in PCA of time series using Philippine data. We present the comparative advantages of SPCA (Sparse Principal Component Analysis) relative to averaging of an adequacy/inadequacy index and PCA in index construction from various indicators of sustainable development in the Philippines in terms of usefulness and validity of indices being developed. SPCA can attain sparse and non-overlapping loadings without losing a large amount of explained variance compared to PCA. Because of the non-overlapping contribution of variables in SPCA components, indices can have clear and mutually exclusive meanings, facilitating interpretation. Even with a more complicated algorithm, reduced dimensions and simpler interpretation of indices justify the advantages of SPCA over PCA in index construction. The indices are interpreted in terms of the milestone of sustainability in the Philippines. The resulting indices provide an adequate summary of the sustainable indicators and evidence of the importance of leadership and political will in sustainable development.

AB Time series data on population change, economic development, climate change, water volume and quality and oasis land-use change were collected to study the interactions between these factors in the and Tarim River Basin, China. The study reveals that precipitation and stream flow in headwater streams increased, but stream flow in the main Tarim River had reduced significantly over the past three decades. This implies that human activity, rather than climate change, dominated the recent environmental changes in the river basin. As a result of population growth and cultivated land expansion in the upper and middle reaches of the river, severe problems of water shortage, water pollution, death of natural vegetation, soil salinization, desertification and sand-dust storms have occurred, particularly in downstream areas of the river basin. These problems have had serious negative effects on the health of local people and sustainable social economic development in the region. Some development strategies are proposed to deal with these problems.

AB Research on land-use and land-cover change, with associated effects on the eco-environment, is a key to understanding global change. The concept of 'ecosystem services' is also a hot issue in ecology and ecological economics. In this study, ecosystem service values are used to assess the ecological values of corresponding land-use types, so as to evaluate the ecological effects of regional land-use change. China's southwest agricultural landscape has unique ecological functions; but it also belongs to an ecologically fragile zone. Consequently, land-use change and associated ecological effects must be monitored to assure sustainable development of this area. Based on TM images in 1988, 1994 and 1999, the landscape classification maps of Yongsheng County were assessed using supervised classification and interactive modification methods. The transition matrix of land-use types and three indices of spatial patterns, patch-level, class-level and landscape-level indices, were calculated using models and GIS to examine the spatial patterns and dynamics of land use in the study area. The results show the influences of human activities and natural environmental elements, and that unused land has decreased rapidly, together with a continuous increase in forest during the past I I years. There are also frequent intermediate transitions between farmland and unused land. An index for landscape diversity shows a tendency to increase, indicating that the proportions of each landscape element tended to average. Also, the decrease in the fractal dimension of unused land reveals that the effects of human activity are increasing. Ecological value calculations show that land-use change in Yongsheng County from 1988-1999 has resulted in positive ecological effects, with distinct spatial differences.

AB This paper computes the efficient air pollution abatement ratios of 30 regions in China during the period 1996-2002. Three air emissions (SO2, soot and dust) are considered. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) with a single output (real GDP) and five inputs (labour, real capital stock, SO2, dust and soot emissions) is used to compute the target emissions of each region for each year. The efficient abatement ratios of each region in each year are then obtained by dividing the target emission by the actual emission of an air pollutant. Our major findings are: 1. The eastern area is the most efficient region with respect to SO,, soot and dust emissions in every year during the research period. 2. The eastern, central and western areas have the lowest, medium and highest 1996-2002 average target abatement ratios of SO, (22.09%, 42.23% and 57.58%), soot (26.19%, 56.34% and 66.37%) and dust (15.20%, 29.09% and 40.59%), respectively. 3. These results are consistent with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory, whereby a more developed area will use environmental goods more efficiently than a less developed area. 4. Compared to dust emission, the average target abatement ratios for SO, and soot emissions (as direct outcomes of burning coal) are relatively much higher for all three areas.

AB Post-conflict return is a highly politically charged process in a number of contexts, both for returnees and those who did not migrate or flee, leading many observers to question the notion of an unproblematic return "home". Specifically, doubts remain both about the conditions and voluntariness of return, the ability of individual returnees to reintegrate in their home countries and regions, and the wider sustainability of the return process. This paper seeks to provide an overview of recent policy interest in returns, before setting out a tentative definition of what might be considered a "sustainable" return. It is argued that it is possible to draw a distinction between narrow indicators of the "sustainability" of return, such as whether returnees subsequently reemigrate, and wider definitions, which see "sustainability" as involving both the reintegration of individual returnees in their home societies, and the wider impact of return on macroeconomic and political indicators. Based on either definition, the development of robust indicators of the sustainability of return could assist in monitoring the impact of return programmes, providing valuable insight on return policies. The broader definition suggested also draws attention to the idea that continued mobility after an initial return - including circulation and the development of a "transnational" lifestyle - may be more "sustainable" than a single and definitive return to the refugee's place of origin.

AB The restitution of property to refugees and displaced persons (RDPs) who fled their homes during the 1992 to 1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been highly successful on its own terms. After getting off to a slow start in the immediate post-war years, this process saw the return of more than 200,000 claimed properties to their pre-war residents by mid-2004. Although property restitution has facilitated durable solutions for RDPs who have benefited from it, these durable solutions have not exclusively taken the form of voluntary and permanent return. In many cases, RDPs have chosen instead to sell, exchange, or lease their restituted homes in order to finance voluntary internal resettlement in parts of the country other than their pre-war places of residence. In all cases, however, property restitution has been crucial to the viability and sustainability of either return or resettlement, facilitating free and informed choices by RDPs regarding their future. Property restitution in Bosnia and Herzegovina has often been held up as a model for other post-conflict settings characterized by mass-displacement. However, the utility of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an example must be assessed in light of favourable domestic and international factors that are unlikely to be repeated in other contexts. This paper argues that these factors should not disqualify Bosnia and Herzegovina as an example, but should instead underscore the importance that lessons learned in Bosnia and Herzegovina be incorporated early in the planning of other peace missions and implemented consistently. One of the foremost of these lessons was the efficacy of shifting the focus from the highly politicized concept of return to a more impartial "rule of law" approach, connoting an emphasis on individuals' rights to their former homes. The unusual level of resources that allowed the international community to correct its own early mistakes would not have been enough to guarantee property restitution in the absence of this successful implementation strategy.

AB The return of displaced populations is regarded by the international community as essential to peace processes in war-torn societies, with housing and property restitution increasingly seen to constitute a pre-condition for the success of such return movements. A decade after the end of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina the property restitution process is close to full implementation while the rate of return remains relatively low.
   This paper explores the relationship between property restitution and patterns of return and relocation, as well as between house and the sense of home in the aftermath of the violent conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is based on research among three distinct groups of displaced Bosnians within and from the town of Banja Luka (repatriates, "transnational" refugees, and IDPs). The paper shows that although repossession of pre-war housing was perceived by the displaced as important for reasons of morality, justice, and economic rehabilitation, sustainable return usually also demanded access to jobs and other sources of livelihood, often located in transnational space. This, however, meant that in many cases "return" was temporary rather than permanent, and that for other displaced Bosnians "sustainable relocation" had eventually come to be the desired goal.
   Yet the option of permanent resettlement in new parts of the country has not received much backing from the international organizations operating in Bosnia because of the emphasis on ethnic minority return as the central objective of post-war reconstruction. At the same time, the sustainability of return has to some extent been jeopardized by the international prioritization of "small home" politics, i.e. property restitution, at the expense of "big home" politics, that is, efforts to normalize the political and socio-economic structures beyond the confines of private homes. The paper argues that displaced persons may (re)create livelihoods and a full sense of home only when a positive relationship starts to develop between housing and the surrounding local and national environment.

AB The return of refugees and displaced persons has been a strong priority in the international commitment to reverse "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the war. Return and reintegration of refugees as a durable solution in profoundly changed and uncertain conditions are rarely unproblematic, and in Bosnia the sustainability of such returns, especially minority returns, remains of great concern. This article examines the strategies of return which Bosnian refugees adopt given such uncertainties, and points to the transnational space in which they occur. The return strategies described are of different duration, often take place outside of established policies and programmes, and are based on the need to keep options open in different places. While policies have tended to define refugee return as a single and definitive move to the country or place of origin, the transnational perspective suggests that return be better conceptualized as a dynamic and open-ended process, one which may extend over long periods of time, involving mobility between places and active links to people and resources in the country of asylum. Transnational strategies also include the many refugees abroad who hold on to their repossessed houses in Bosnia and visit regularly, some of them for longer periods and in preparation for returning permanently at a later date. In such a transnational dynamic, refugees and returnees are not always clear-cut categories, as both may move between and combine resources at both ends. The transnational perspective also throws into question notions of "home" as something bound to one particular locality or national community. If home is not just a place or a physical structure, but also a site of social relations and cultural meanings, it may well extend to several places, each one of which may hold its own particular sets of relations and meanings to those concerned. This transnational dimension of home is thus a challenge to notions of "repatriation" or "return" in the simplistic mode. Instead, as this paper shows, the reconstructed home may be translocal, where each locality becomes part of a new home. Rethinking return of refugees in terms of transnational mobility and belonging also suggests new ways of conceptualizing the potential for reconstruction of a large refugee population abroad. How policies and assistance programmes may capitalize on the skills and continued transnational engagements, not least of the many young Bosnians now acquiring higher education abroad, has yet to be developed.

ID UNBALANCED GROWTH
AB The paper discusses a number of threats to the financial sustainability of social spending: increased internationalization of national economies, gradually higher relative costs of producing a number of human services, the "graying" of the population, slower productivity growth in the private sector, low employment rates, and various types of disincentive effects related to the welfare state itself, including moral hazard. I argue that threats from gradually rising costs of providing human services and disincentive effects of welfare-state arrangements, in particular moral hazard and benefit dependency, are more difficult to deal with than the other threats. I also discuss the choice between ad hoc policy reforms and automatic adjustment mechanisms, delegated to administrative bodies, for dealing with these threats.

AB A number of uncertainties about long-term expenditure commitments in industrial countries are examined: (i) the assumptions underlying the projections, (ii) the potential to further reduce non-age-related expenditures, (iii) the implicitly assumed absence of "shocks," and (iv) the potential for raising revenue. This paper concludes that (i) there is scope, but within narrow limits, to reduce non-age-related expenditures; (ii) fiscal policy frameworks tend to understate risks; and (iii) prevailing tax rates leave little room for increasing taxation in the countries facing the strongest aging pressures. In sum, governments will have to adopt a much more ambitious fiscal policy stance to cope with aging populations.

AB This paper investigates the macroeconomic effect of fiscal policy and the fiscal reconstruction movement in Japan. I first summarize Japanese fiscal policy in the recent years and discuss sustainability of government deficits. Then, I investigate the macroeconomic effect of Japanese fiscal policy and evaluate the plausibility of the Keynesian and non-Keynesian effects. I also analyze political constraints in the fiscal reconstruction attempts and the possibility of crowding-in effect of fiscal reform. Finally, I discuss some measures for the successful fiscal reconstruction reform in the near future.

TI Roles of solar power from space for Europe: Space exploration and

LA English
DT Article
DE solar power; space; energy
AB The paper presents the prospective roles of SPS concepts for Europe. shows the outcome of recent studies undertaken by ESA's Advanced Concepts Team (ACT) together with European industry and research centres and gives insight into planned activities. The main focus is on the assessment of the principal validity and economic viability of solar power from space concepts in the light of advances in alternative sustainable. clean and potentially abundant solar-based terrestrial concepts. The paper takes into account expected changes in the European energy system (e.g. gradual introduction of hydrogen as energy vector). Special emphasis is given to the possibilities of integrating space and terrestrial solar plants. The relative geographic proximity of areas in North Africa with high average solar irradiation to the European energy consumer market puts Europe in a special position regarding the integration of space and terrestrial solar power concepts. The paper presents a method to optimise such an integration, taking into account different possible orbital constellations, terrestrial locations, plant number and sizes as well as consumer profiles and extends the scope from the European-only to a multi continental approach including the fast growing Chinese electricity market. The work intends to contribute to the discussion on long-term options for the European commitment to worldwide CO2 emission reduction. Cleaner electricity generation and environmentally neutral transport fuels (e.g. solar generated hydrogen) might be two major tools in reaching this goal.

TI A framework for sustainable materials management
SO JOM
LA English
DT Article
AB Achieving global sustainability will require a decoupling of material consumption from economic value creation. While industrialized societies have achieved gains in resource efficiency and waste recycling, total material throughput continues to rise. Environmental pressures will only be exacerbated as the world's developing economies increase their consumption rates. This paper describes an integrated framework for sustainable materials management that will help to address these critical challenges from a systems perspective.

TI Improving aluminum can recycling rates: A six sigma study in Kentucky
SO JOM
LA English
DT Article
AB The aluminum can industry is facing a new challenge in declining recycling rates in the United States. The economic benefits of aluminum recycling are widespread and important not only to the U.S. aluminum industry, but to the economy in general. With an A fred P Sloan Foundation grant, Secat Inc. and the University of Kentucky, through the Center for a Sustainable Aluminum Industry, are conducting a project in Fayette County, Kentucky, to understand and improve recycling rates using Six Sigma methodology. This application of Six Sigma is the first methodological attempt at improving the recycling rate. To date, the preliminary process map has been identifiedandan initial estimate of the true recycling rate has been developed. The information gathered during this project and described in this article is expected to serve as a steppingstone to a national effort to increase U.S. recycling rates. The result, it is anticipated, will be increased economic development opportunities.

   education; Liberty Hyde Bailey; sustainable agriculture; Thomas Berry;
   US agricultural history; worldview transition
AB The challenge of pursuing sustainability in agriculture is often viewed as mainly or wholly technical in nature, requiring the reform of farming methods and the development and adoption of alternative technologies. Likewise, the purpose of sustainability is frequently cast in utilitarian terms, as a means of protecting a valuable resource (i.e., soil) and of satisfying market demands for healthy, tasty food. Paul B. Thompson has argued that the embrace of these views by many in the consumer/environmental movement enables easy co-optation by agribusiness. It also reflects a critical weakness in this movement: a lack of commitment to philosophical principles that depart from the utilitarian premises of the industrial model of agriculture. This paper draws on the writings of Thomas Berry and Liberty Hyde Bailey to identify the philosophical principles of what we call planetary agrarianism. From the perspective of planetary agrarianism, the pursuit of sustainability is a broad and challenging moral, educational, and political task. Berry helps us see that it is fundamentally a project of worldview transition, which requires a new cultural narrative that must rival, in form and appeal, the mythic power of the utilitarian industrial vision. Liberty Hyde Bailey, author of The Holy Earth (1915) and a leader in the land-grant education and nature-study movements, took up the project of worldview transition in his life work. While in some ways dated and flawed, Bailey's writings are a valuable source of guidance for developing and pursuing a viable philosophy of agriculture for the 21st century.

AB We evaluated 2 strains of mice for their utility in the investigation of nutritional and molecular regulatory mechanisms of lactation. The lactational performance and milk composition were characterized for an inbred mouse strain, inbred Quackenbush Swiss line 5 (QSi5) selected persistently for fecundity, and a nonselected strain, CBA. The milk yield assessed by changes in BW in response to suckling of sustainable litter sizes for each strain was 3-fold greater (P < 0.001) in QSi5 mice than the CBA strain. The QSi5 mice also produced milk more efficiently (P < 0.001) than CBA mice, despite having the same quantity of mammary tissue per unit of BW. Milk composition did not vary between strains or by stage of lactation, with the exception of lactose concentration, which was greater (P = 0.003) in QSi5 mice. Expression of epsilon-casein was >= 10-fold greater, and alpha(S1)-casein was >= 3-fold greater, during mid and late lactation compared with early lactation in both strains, whereas kappa-casein underwent an apparent alteration in posttranslational modifications in both strains from early to mid lactation. Changes in casein composition coincided with an increased susceptibility to proteolytic degradation; hence milk from early lactation may be more readily degraded to facilitate digestion in the neonate. The greater milk synthetic capacity of QSi5 mice over the lactation cycle provides a useful model for studies of nutritional and molecular regulation of lactation.

AB 1. Sharks and rays are vulnerable to fisheries exploitation because of late maturation and low fecundity, highlighting the need for effective conservation strategies. Area closures have been proposed as an appropriate management option for thornback rays in the southern North Sea, where they appear to form local subpopulations between which there is limited mixing.
   2. To gain a fishery-independent estimation of stock distribution, 197 thornback rays Raja clavata tagged with electronic data storage tags (DST) were released in the Thames Estuary in 1999 and 2000.
   3. The tidal location method was used to estimate the positions of individual fish between time of release and recapture. The fishery-independent seasonal stock distributions were integrated with landings data and a simple model was developed to estimate monthly fishing effort per International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) rectangle by different fleets and gear types.
   4. The potential impacts of closed area management, in terms of reducing thornback ray mortality in the southern North Sea, were calculated. Spatial closures were applied either (i) as permanent closures of individual ICES rectangles or (ii) seasonally, at the level of the Thames Estuary. Catch reductions were calculated allowing for the redistribution of fishing effort.
   5. The results confirmed the importance of the Thames Estuary for thornback rays. However, 77% of rays moved outside the estuary over winter, with seasonal migration into the Thames to spawn between March and August.
   6. The effects of closures varied between areas and gear types. Permanent closures of individual ICES rectangles were less effective at reducing fishing mortality on rays than a spring or summer closure of the Thames Estuary as a whole, which would have a major impact on the commercially more valuable sole fishery.
   7. Synthesis and applications. The results presented illustrate the potential impacts of a range of closure scenarios, prior to their implementation, as a basis for advice on sustainable exploitation of thornback rays. These models could be further refined by additional studies of juvenile behaviour and of other ray subpopulations in the southern North Sea.

AB 1. Deer numbers have increased dramatically throughout Europe and North America over the last century, but empirical analyses of variation in harvesting and the influence of biological and cultural factors are lacking.
   2. We examined trends in size and composition of red deer Cervus elaphus harvests over the last three to four decades in 11 European countries with contrasting deer productivity, management strategies and hunting traditions.
   3. The harvest increased exponentially in all countries except Austria and Germany, where it was stable, and Poland, where it has declined in recent years. Harvest growth rates ranged from 0.009 in Austria to 0.075 in Sweden and depended on the management system and harvest composition, being negatively related to the proportion of females in the adult harvest.
   4. Within four focal countries (France, Hungary, Norway and Scotland), there was considerable spatial variation in harvest growth rates. These tended to be higher in recently colonized areas than in traditional hunting areas and were often higher than the maximum possible population growth rate. Range expansion was an important component of the increase in total harvest in France and Scotland, but not in Hungary or Norway.
   5. Harvest composition was available for seven countries, all of which showed a strong increase in the proportion of calves in the harvest. The sex ratio of the adult harvest was relatively stable, being strongly male-biased in Norway and marginally female-biased elsewhere. The proportion of males in the harvest was unrelated to trophy hunting objectives.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our study emphasizes that cultural aspects of management need to be accounted for, as well as biological factors, when interpreting the patterns of harvest growth and composition across Europe. Widespread sustained harvest growth has occurred, suggesting continued growth of deer populations with consequent social and economic impacts. Population control is therefore a major challenge for the future, currently hampered by inadequate population data and a decreasing number of hunters in some countries. Increasing the motivation of hunters to harvest female deer is one possible solution, although this may conflict with hunting traditions and economic considerations in some areas.

AB 1. Throughout arid regions of the world, groundwater is extracted for human population centres. In the Great Basin and Range region of the USA, we lack basic information regarding some plant communities detailing the extent to which vegetation is threatened by groundwater extraction. This is particularly true for alkali meadow vegetation, which is restricted to zones of shallow groundwater yet is not a riparian plant community with obligate wetland properties.
   2. To increase our understanding of the relative importance of groundwater and precipitation in maintaining alkali meadow vegetation cover, we used a 16-year record of plant cover derived from satellite data of Owens Valley, California, USA, in conjunction with concurrent depth-to-water and precipitation measurements, to analyse vegetation response to anthropogenic and climatic changes in water availability.
   3. Groundwater decline varied from 0.5 to 5.0 m throughout the study area, with the largest changes occurring at sites closest to pumping wells. The entire region experienced a 6-year drought (1987-92), during which annual precipitation remained below the 50-year median.
   4. Meadow plant cover over the 16-year study period was correlated with groundwater depth, but plant cover was generally unresponsive to annual precipitation variability. Sensitivity to groundwater decline was greatest for plots with a higher cover of herbaceous perennials.
   5. The results showed that this plant community is groundwater dependent, and that this characteristic buffers the system from the effects of drought. However, at sites with extensive groundwater decline, the remaining plant cover became weakly correlated with precipitation only after groundwater declined below a threshold depth located at 2.5 m, representing the average plant rooting depth.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Sustainable water development that seeks to pump groundwater without adversely affecting vegetation cover and plant assemblages must recognize the maximum rooting depth of groundwater-dependent plant species. When groundwater is within the root zone, management decisions can be made to either increase or decrease vegetation cover through modification of groundwater depth. When groundwater is below the root zone, vegetation cover is low and susceptible to changes in precipitation. Quantitative satellite measurements of vegetation cover might aid the monitoring and sustainable management of water resources.

AB The present study describes the annual condition as well the length-weight (LWR) and length-length relationships (LLR) of the Asian striped catfish, Mystus vittatus (Bloch, 1794) (Siluriformes: Bagridae), an important fishery in the Mathabhanga River (SW Bangladesh). A total of 2438 specimens (3.60-9.60 cm standard length) used in this study was caught with traditional fishing gear from January to December 2004. Overall, the allometric coefficient b of the LWR was close to the isometric value (b = 3.058), although it suggested negative allometric growth for males (b = 2.959) whilst positive allometric growth for females (b = 3.134). The results further indicated that the LLRs were highly correlated (r(2) > 0.989, P < 0.001). The monthly gonadosomatic index showed that the reproductive period of M. vittatus began in April, and ended in August when the highest values of the Fulton's condition factor (K) indicated their recovery. These results will be useful for fishery managers to impose adequate regulations for sustainable fishery management not only in the Mathabhanga River of Bangladesh but also in neighbouring countries.

ID STAKEHOLDER THEORY
AB Recognition is a basic precondition of participation. This article applies the dimension of recognition to business ethics. A case is made for normative stakeholder management as a voluntary commitment at the level of corporate leadership; this also meets management's strategic demands. A vitality criterion is offered as a heuristic instrument, suggesting that any operation should be avoided which would violate the legitimate interests of stakeholders. For this reason, the recognition of mutually-conditioned stakeholder claims is understood as the central management idea.

AB The concentrations of several selected organic hazardous substances were investigated in domestic graywater. In total. 41 of 81 organic hazardous substances were found in concentrations above the detection limits (nonylphenol and octylphenol ethoxylates, brominated flame-retardants, organotin compounds, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls. plithalates. linear-alkyl benzene sulfonate, and triclosan). Moreover, total solids. biochemical oxygen demand (BOD7). chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen, total phosphorus, potassium. and sulphur were investigated and presented for graywater. Another objective was to suggest potential household sources for a selected number of organic hazardous substances. The present and past investigations reveal households to be obvious contributors of organic hazardous Substances to municipal wastewater. and that graywater is an important media in this transport. The spreading derives from diffuse household sources like everyday activities (laundry. cleaning. etc.). the wearing down of things such as pipe material and interior fittings. and from airborne deposition.

AB The government of India decided to launch a project to implement 16 full-scale Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors (with a total capacity of 598,000 m(3)/d) in the Yamuna River basin under its Yamuna Action Plan (YAP). A polishing pond called the Final Polishing Unit (FPU) was utilized for post-treatment. This paper evaluates the sewage treatment efficiency of the combined system of full-scale UASB reactors and polishing ponds under Indian climatic conditions. Results have shown that the effluent from the sewage treatment plants (STPs) investigated failed to comply with applicable discharge standards in terms of BOD, SS, and fecal coliform removal. Therefore, it is proposed that such proper operation and maintenance as removing excess sludge and scum be conducted in order to increase treatment efficiency. Moreover, trained and experienced workers are also required to operate and maintain the systems, along with a scientific approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A linear engineering project-i.e. a pipeline-has a potential long- and short-term impact on the environment and on the inhabitants therein. We must find better, less expensive, and less time-consuming ways to obtain information on the environment and on any modifications resulting from anthropic activity. We need scientifically sound, rapid and affordable assessment and monitoring methods. Construction companies, industries and the regulating government organisms lack the resources needed to conduct long-term basic studies of the environment. Thus there is a need to make the necessary adjustments and improvements in the environmental data considered useful for this development project. More effective and less costly methods are generally needed.
   We characterized the landscape of the study area, situated in the center and north-east of Argentina. Little is known of the ecology of this region and substantial research is required in order to develop sustainable uses and, at the same time, to develop methods for reducing impacts, both primary and secondary, resulting from anthropic activity in this area.
   Furthermore, we made an assessment of the environmental impact of the planned linear project, applying an ad hoc impact index, and we analyzed the different alternatives for a corridor, each one of these involving different sections of the territory.
   Among the alternative corridors considered, this study locates the most suitable ones in accordance with a selection criterion based on different environmental and conservation aspects. We selected the corridor that we considered to be the most compatible-i.e. with the least potential environmental impact-for the possible construction and operation of the linear project. This information, along with suitable measures for mitigating possible impacts, should be the basis of an environmental management plan for the design process and location of the project.
   We pointed out the objectivity and efficiency of this methodological approach, along with the possibility of integrating the information in order to allow for the application thereof in this type of study. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Beyond compliance: environmental health problem solving, interagency
   collaboration, and risk assessment to prevent waterborne disease
   outbreaks
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB A systems approach to environmental health problem solving was used to investigate two waterborne norovirus outbreaks in Wyoming and can serve in the development of improved prevention strategies. An interagency collaboration to prevent waterborne disease involving local, state, and federal partners was designed to coordinate response to outbreak investigations. Improved risk assessment and reporting procedures were also integrated to ensure better availability of necessary data. Public health entities should implement sustainable intersectoral interventions to prevent waterborne disease that not only improve regulatory compliance but also have a positive impact on community health outcomes. Collaborative preventive health and water system protection activities should receive priority attention for implementation in state and local jurisdictions.

TI Change in care regimes and female migration: the 'care drain' in the
   Mediterranean
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE ageing; care drain; care regimes; female migration; informal work
ID EUROPE
AB Concern over the need to provide long-term care for an ageing population has stimulated a search for new solutions able to ensure financial viability and a better balance between demand and supply of care. There is at present a great variety of care regimes across industrial countries, with Mediterranean countries forming a distinctive cluster where management of care is overwhelmingly entrusted to the family. In some of these countries elderly care has recently attracted large flows of care migrants, ushering in a new division of labour among family carers (mainly women), female immigrants; and skilled native workers. The article explores the interconnections between the feminization of migration, on the one hand, and ongoing change in the Southern European care regimes, on the other hand. Different strands of the literature are brought together and reviewed to illustrate ongoing developments. One main objective is to identify issues of efficiency, equity and sustainability raised by this new 'model' of care. The results of recent surveys on provisions and costs of long-term care are accordingly reviewed to set the stage for discussion on the optimal mix of long-term care provisions in place of traditional family care.

AB The use of the Fenton process to enhance the sustainable flux in non-circular ceramic membranes is considered. The efficiencies of the Fenton Fe2+ and a fixed quantity of H2O2 (Fenton-oxidation coagulation process or process as a microfiltration pre-treatment using varying amounts of Fe2+ FOC) or a constant amount of Fe2+ but varying quantities of H2O2 (Fenton-oxidation oxidation process or FOO) are compared with processes involving only oxidation or only coagulation. The trend in TOC removal is FOC > coagulation > FOO > oxidation. The resultant membrane feed characteristics, i.e. TOC and average particle size, have an important influence On the Sustainable flux. Higher sustainable fluxes were found in all pre-treated feeds regardless of the pre-treatment option. The trend in the Sustainable fluxes is the same as for TOC with FOC achieving the best flux enhancements of up to 416% while oxidation was least effective (up to 47.7%). The fluxes achieved with FOC are mainly attributed to the effective removal of organics and to a lesser extent an increase in average particle size. This Study demonstrates the importance of the effect of the organic colloidal fraction on membrane performance and shows that pre-treatment can be important in reducing and controlling membrane fouling.

TI Evaluation and sustainability of the healthy learners asthma initiative
SO JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID SCHOOL; MANAGEMENT; PROGRAM
AB The Healthy Learners Asthma Initiative (HLAI) involved collaboration between Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS), local health care providers/payors, parents, and other partners. The intervention included development of enhanced asthma care in school health offices and clinic performance improvement projects to foster adoption of National Institutes of Health asthma guidelines. Goals were to improve asthma management among school children and reduce asthma-related school absences, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits. The effectiveness evaluation utilized a randomized community trial design with 16 elementary and middle schools matched and randomly assigned to either an intervention or a control group. Outcomes investigated were (a) school health office impacts and (b) school attendance. Data sources included school health office records, district attendance, enrollment, and demographics files. Following implementation of the HLAI, asthma visits to health offices were significantly lower in intervention schools compared to control schools (91 vs 121 visits per 100 students with asthma per month), and intervention schools had greater availability of medication and asthma action plans and more peakflow measurements, asthma education, and parent communication. Clinics initiated significantly more asthma action plans and sent them to MPS. Attendance differences between groups were limited to students who received asthma care through the school health office. Monitoring of asthma management activities provided through school health offices from 2002 to 2005 indicates sustained implementation of enhanced asthma care in schools and increased asthma communication between school, parents, and health. care providers.

AB Ti3+-free multicomponent titanophosphate glasses were developed as ecologically sustainable optical glasses. Especially, recent advances in the glasses as molding glass, athermal glass, nonlinear optical glass, and self-cleaning glass were presented. The Ti3+-free binary TiO2-P2O5 glasses containing TiO2 up to 74 mol% were prepared by melt quenching and long-term post-annealing around the glass transition temperature in the air, and possessed high transparency, high index, high dispersion, and low density. Li2O-ZnO-TiO2-P2O5 glasses have the lowest T-g (=560 degrees C) among titanophosphate glasses, with high index (n(d)=1.8), and high dispersion (nu(d)=22) being retained, while ZnO-TiO2-P2O5 glasses have the highest refractive index (n(d)=1.9) among glasses with T-g lower than 600 degrees C. Thus, ZnO-TiO2-P2O5 and Li2O-ZnO-TiO2-P2O5 glasses can be expected as high-index molding glasses. A very small temperature coefficient of refractive index, dn/dT, or very small temperature coefficient of optical path length, dS/dT, was obtained for K2O-TiO2-P2O5 glasses, meaning that they are considered as high-index athermal glasses and athermal NLO glasses. Ag2O-TiO2-P2O5 glasses showed photocatalytic activity and photo-induced hydrophilicity comparable with commercially available TiO2-coated self-cleaning glasses.

AB Water resource management in West Africa is often a complicated process due to inadequate resources, climatic extremes, and insufficient hydrological information. Insufficient data hinder sustainable watershed management practices, one of the top priorities in the Volta River Basin. This research properly fills in missing data by modeling the hydrological distribution in the Volta River Basin. On average, discharge gages across the basin are missing 20 percent of their monthly data over 20 years. Two methods were used to supplement missing data: a statistically linear model and a conceptual hydrological model. A linear equation, developed from the regression of precipitation and runoff, was used to evaluate the quality of existing data. The hydrological model separates the system into root and groundwater zones. Measured values were used to calibrate the hydrological model and to validate the statistical model. The quality of existing data was analyzed and organized for usability. Accuracy of the hydrological model was also evaluated for its effectiveness using R-2 and standard error. It was found that the hydrological model was an improvement from the linear model on a monthly basis; R-2 values improved by as much as 0.5 and monthly error decreased. Monthly predictions of the hydrological model were used to fill gaps of measured data sets.

AB The understanding of population dynamics is a central issue for managing large mammals. Modeling has allowed population ecologists to increase their knowledge about complex systems and better predict population responses to diverse perturbations. Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) appear sensitive to harvest, but the relative influence of survival and reproductive rates on their population dynamics are not well understood. Using longitudinal data on age- and sex-specific survival and reproduction from a marked mountain goat population in Alberta, Canada, we built a stage-class matrix model to predict short-term numerical changes for 11 other goat populations in Alberta for which the only data available were from annual aerial surveys. Overall, the model provided an acceptable fit to changes in population size for 8 of 12 populations. Temporal trends in population size were underestimated in 2 populations and overestimated in another 2, suggesting that these populations had different vital rates than those of the intensively studied population. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the survival of mature females (aged 5 yr and older) had the greatest elasticity for population growth. Modeled management scenarios indicated that nonselective yearly harvest rates above 1% of goats aged 2 years and older were not sustainable over the short-term for some populations. The simulations also revealed that small In = 25) and medium-size (n = 50) populations, which correspond to most goat populations in Alberta, had high extinction risk (18 to 82% over 40 years), even in the absence of harvest. Our results confirm that mountain goat populations are very sensitive to harvest, indicate that wildlife managers should prevent female harvest, and suggest that although a high demand for goat hunting exists in Alberta, most populations in this province-and probably small populations elsewhere -cannot withstand exploitation.

AB The black bear (Ursus americanus) population at White River National Wildlife Refuge is isolated and genetically distinct, but hunting occurs adjacent to refuge boundaries and females with cubs are removed annually for a reintroduction project. We trapped and radiotracked bears to determine level of exploitation and compare methods for estimating population growth and sustainability. We captured 260 bears (113 M: 14 7 F), 414 times, from 1998 through 2003. Survival estimates based on radiotracking and mark-recapture indicated that hunting and translocations were significant sources of loss. Based on mark-recapture data (Pradel estimator), the annual population growth rate (;,) averaged 1.066 (SE 0.077) when translocation removals occurred and averaged 0.961 (SE = 0.155) when both harvest and translocations occurred. Estimates of lambda based on a population simulation model (program RISKMAN) averaged 1.061 (SD = 0.104) and 1.100 (SD = 0.111) when no removals occurred, 1.003 (SD = 0.097) and 1.046 (SD = 0.102) when translocations occurred, and 0.973 (SD = 0.096) and 1.006 (SD = 0.099) when both harvest and translocations occurred, depending on the survival rate estimates we used. The probability of population decline by > 25% over a 10-year period ranged from 13.8 to 68.8%, given our estimated removal rates. We conclude that hunting and translocation losses are at or exceed the maximum the population is capable of sustaining. Although extinction risks of this important bear population are low over the near term, it should continue to be closely monitored by state and federal agencies. The mark-recapture method we used to estimate lambda proved to be a reliable alternative to more costly population modeling methods.

AB The relationship between functional redundancy and microbial community structure-diversity was examined using laboratory incubations to ensure constant environmental conditions. Serial dilutions of a sewage microbial community were prepared, used to inoculate sterile sewage, and maintained in batch culture. Probability suggests that dilution of the initial community should remove rare organism types, creating mixtures of cells differing in diversity. Regrowth of the diluted mixtures generated communities similar in abundance but differing in community structure and relative diversity (as determined using two DNA fingerprinting techniques and dilution-to-extinction analysis of community-level physiological profiles). The in situ function of each regrown community was examined by monitoring the short-term uptake of five different C-14-labeled compounds (glucose, acetate, citrate, palmitic acid, and an amino acid mixture). No significant differences were detected between treatments in either the rate of uptake of a substrate or the efficiency with which each community assimilated each compound. The fact that the activity of the original community was the same as that of a community regrown from an inoculum containing fewer that 100 cells (10(-6) dilution) indicates that functional redundancy was quite high in this system. For each organism type eliminated during the dilution process, at least one of the remaining types was able to provide the same function at the same level as the lost one. Further research is necessary to determine what impact this functional redundancy may have on overall ecosystem function and stability.

TI Using traditional swidden agriculture to enhance rural livelihoods in
   Vietnam's uplands
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Research in Vietnam's uplands shows that poverty alleviation and environmental protection can be most readily achieved by communities building, protecting, and using their own assets more effectively. This approach starts by looking at what poor people already have, not what they lack. By contrast, government development policies often seek to modernize the rural sector through the introduction of new agricultural technology and improved marketing without taking existing local capacities into account. Such policies often fail to achieve their objectives. Traditional composite swidden agriculture (CSA), by contrast, may be more environmentally sustainable and better able to enhance household food security than many "modern" agricultural systems. Therefore, improvement of existing systems of composite swiddening in combination with adoption of new ventures, such as cattle raising, may achieve greater success than attempts to replace swidden agriculture with completely new "modern" farming systems.

TI Innovation to support agropastoralist livelihoods in northwest Yunnan,
   China
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Many upland communities in northwest Yunnan, China, are agropastoralist. Agropastoralist livelihoods in the region are characterized by close interactions between crops and livestock, and by seasonal transhumance. Agropastoralist communities are relatively marginalized by technical service agencies and policy making processes. The Center for Biodiversity and Indigenous Knowledge (CBIK), a local NGO, has been working with communities and extension agencies to develop approaches to innovative technical and institutional interventions that support sustainable livelihoods. The present article describes the issues faced by agropastoralists in the region, the approaches promoted by CBIK (participatory technology development and co-management of rangelands), and issues faced in scaling up these approaches to influence local government policy and extension practices.

TI The evolution of community water governance in Uchira, Tanzania: The
   implications for equality of access, sustainability and effectiveness

ID POVERTY; MANAGEMENT; AFRICA; POOR
AB Community participation, ownership and cost sharing are key components of Tanzania's water policy, in common with the broad international consensus on water governance. However these policy goals are difficult to achieve, beset with paradoxes and their benefits may be overstated, both in terms of efficiency of resource management and equality of outcomes. This article draws on longitudinal ethnographic research of a village water supply in Tanzania to explore two issues: the contested nature of community ownership and the complex evolution of a 'community-owned' institution. The evidence from the Uchira Water Users Association leads us to question some of the simplistic assumptions made concerning the capacity of local communities to manage service delivery and to balance equity and sustainability principles.
   The limitations of 'bottom-up' and demand led approaches need to be recognised without discrediting their potential for challenging inequalities. The article concludes with a consideration of some of the tensions in community-driven development, which raises some important questions about the role of the State and external agencies in setting and enforcing equity criteria in community-managed initiatives.

AB Light water reactor (LWR) technology is nowadays the most successful commercial application of fission reactors for the production of electricity. However, in the next few years, nuclear industry will have to face new and demanding challenges: the need for sustainable and cheap sources of energy, the need for public acceptance, the need for even higher safety standards, the need to minimize the waste production are only a few examples. It is for these very reasons that a few next generation nuclear reactor concepts were selected for extensive research and development; super critical water reactors are among them. The use of a supercritical coolant would allow for higher thermal efficiencies and a more compact plant design, since steam generators, or steam separators and driers would not be needed, hence achieving a better economy. Moreover, because of the high heat capacity of supercritical water, relatively less coolant would be needed to refrigerate the reactor, therefore the feasibility to design a water cooled fast reactor: the supercritical water fast reactor (SCFR). This system presents unique features combining well-known fast and light water reactor characteristics in one design (e.g. a tendency to a positive void reactivity coefficient together with loss of coolant accident - LOCAs as a design basis accident). The core is in fact loaded with highly enriched MOX fuel (average plutonium content of similar to 23%), and presents a peculiar and significant geometrical and material heterogeneity (use of radial and axial blankets, solid moderator layers, 12 different enrichment zones). The safety analysis of this very complex core layout, together with the optimization of the void reactivity effect through core design, is the main objective of this work. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

CY MAY 16-20, 2005

AB In order to ensure sustainable energy supply in the future based on the matured light water reactor (LWR) and coming mixed oxide (MOX)-LWR technologies, a concept of innovative water reactor for flexible fuel cycle (FLWR) has been investigated in Japan Atomic Energy Research Agency (JAEA). The concept consists of two parts in the chronological sequence. The first part realizes a high conversion type core concept, which is basically intended to keep the smooth technical continuity from current LAIR and coming MOX-LWR technologies without significant technical gaps. The second part represents the reduced-moderation water reactor (RMWR) core concept, which realizes a high conversion ratio over 1.0 being useful for the long-term sustainable energy supply through plutonium multiple recycling based on the well-developed LWR technologies. The key point is that the two core concepts utilize the compatible and the same size fuel assemblies, and hence, the former concept can proceed to the latter in the same reactor system, based flexibly on the future fuel cycle circumstances during the reactor operation period around 60 years. At present, reprocessed plutonium from the LWR spent fuel is to be utilized in MOX-LWR. After this stage, the first part of FLWR, i.e. the high conversion type, can be introduced as a replacement of LWR or MOX-LWR. Since the plutonium inventory of FLWR is much larger, the number of the reactor with MOX fuel will be significantly reduced compared to the MOX-LWR utilization. When the fuel cycle for plutonium multiple recycling with MOX fuel reprocessing is realized, the fuel assembly will be replaced with another type of the tight-lattice one for RMWR with different rod diameter, rod gap width and so forth even in the same reactor system, being flexibly corresponding to the fuel cycle circumstances. Investigation on the core for both the parts of the FLWR concepts has been performed, including the core conceptual design, the core characteristics under Pu multiple recycling, the thermal hydraulic investigation in the tight-lattice core, and so forth. Up to the present, promising results have been obtained. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We show the massive reduction achievable, in both emissions and climate change impact, from enhanced nuclear energy use on the forecasts of future world energy use and its associated environmental impacts. A range encompassing the major scenarios for the World's energy demand have been analyzed using the latest version of the climate-modeling MAGICC/SCENGEN software (Version 4.1). We have updated and predicted the impacts of 80% substitution with CO2-free sources (likely predominantly nuclear) for coal-fired electricity (by 2030) and for transportation fuel (by 2040). For transportation, hydrogen produced by CO2-free sources would replace gasoline and diesel fuels. In this paper, to bracket the range of futures, we simply focus on two scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC), one (A1FI) that is energy-profligate and one (132) that is energy-conserving.
   The results show that, interestingly, projected average global temperatures for all scenarios are fairly similar until about 2035 (a further rise beyond the 1990 average temperature of +0.75 +/- 0.1 K) regardless of energy usage and its sources. However, by 2050, the different IPCC scenarios diverge markedly. Understandably, A 1171 is projected to have noticeably stronger effects than B2 on average global temperatures (about 0.3 K more in 2050) but the effect is much stronger over land at mid and high latitudes (up to almost I K more). What is most striking is that the substitution of CO2-free sources gives projected average temperature rises in 2050 over key land areas (North America and China) that are very similar for the two energy-use scenarios - typically 1-1.5 K because A1FI's additional energy is predominantly supplied by nuclear. In contrast, projected rises with the unaltered cases are markedly different being about 2.5 K for A1FI and 1.5-2 K for B2. The projected changes in rainfall distribution show similar patterns, especially for the expected increases in higher latitudes.
   With the assumption of no additional policies for substitution of energy sources beyond 2040, temperature divergence between the two scenarios of relative energy profligacy or conservation grows in the latter half of the 21st century, even with substitution. However, the early substitution of nuclear energy and hydrogen appears to buy time and is not crucially dependent on severe, near-term curtailment of energy use. Near-term curtailment is too difficult to implement at a time of rapid industrialization of major emerging economies. Of course, proportionately larger deployments of CO2-free energy sources are needed for more energy-intensive scenarios.
   Nuclear power must dominate as the source of CO2-free energy since it is proven, dependable, available on a large scale, and economic. Social objections to nuclear energy in some countries and quarters are seen as well-meaning but misguided distractions from solving the energy and environmental crises that are now facing world sustainability. The time for real technical, social and political action is now. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose of the paper: This paper critically deconstructs academic career pathways in research and explores possible future directions. Background and context: Development in NHS policy and practice has brought about something of a sea change in academic career pathways in nursing and midwifery.
   Whilst once there was a fairly prescribed route into nurse education and then research, contemporary factors no longer foster such traditional routes.
   Methods: In examining what a career pathway into academic nursing research may took Like it may be useful first to delineate what are the basic assumptions that constitute 'achievement' within such a career. Once pinpointed it is possible to map out different pathways that illustrate the diversity with which this has occurred. This provides a useful mirror for examining what may or may not be useful for the future. This paper explores three areas of the nurse academic career pathway: introspectivety to understand where we are at the moment, retrospectively by examining composite research careers in order to gain insight for the final prospective section, where we make recommendations for the future.
   Conclusions: Nurses and midwives working in higher education require transparent and sustainable research strategies that facilitate clear research pathways in academia. The tensions between research and teaching are inevitable, but are manageable if workforce development uses individuals to their strengths and values diversity of contribution. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Changes in ecosystem functions following disturbances are of central concern in ecology and a challenge for ecologists is to understand the factors that affect the resilience of community structures and ecosystem functions. In many forest ecosystems, one such important natural disturbance is fire. The aim of this study was to understand the variation of resilience in six functional groups of invertebrates in response to different fire frequencies in southern Switzerland. We measured resilience by analysing arthropod species composition, abundance and diversity in plots where the elapsed time after single or repeated fires, as determined by dendrochronology, varied. We compared data from these plots with data from plots that had not burned recently and defined high resilience as the rapid recovery of the species composition to that prior to fire. Pooling all functional groups showed that they were more resilient to single fires than to repeated events, recovering 6-14 years after a single fire, but only 17-24 years after the last of several fires. Flying zoophagous and phytophagous arthropods were the most resilient groups. Pollinophagous and epigaeic zoophagous species showed intermediate resilience, while ground-litter saprophagous and saproxylophagous arthropods clearly displayed the lowest resilience to fire. Their species composition 17-24 years post-burn still differed markedly from that of the unburned control plots. Depending on the fire history of a forest plot, we found significant differences in the dominance hierarchy among invertebrate species. Any attempt to imitate natural disturbances, such as fire, through forest management must take into account the recovery times of biodiversity, including functional group composition, to ensure the conservation of multiple taxa and ecosystem functions in a sustainable manner.

AB Evolution of the prokaryotic biosphere is regarded from the system point of view. It starts with the appearance of the first organisms, the similar to 3.5 Ga date forming the boundary between the observed and imagined biosphere. The prokaryotic community dominated from the Archean to the Mesoproterozoic. Prokaryotes make a sustainable community due to the cooperative action of specialized forms. The main route for establishing a community is made by trophic links. The structure of the trophic links in the prokaryotic community making a trophic network is an invariant, with secondary adaptive deviations. Material balance is the ultimate requirement for a long living self-supporting system. The system of biogeospheric cycles is dictated by the constancy of biomass composition establishing a quantitative ratio between C-org:N-org:P-org. Biospheric processes are driven by the C-org-cycle. Carbon assimilation is limited by the size of the illuminated moist surface populated by producers, meaning that C-org-production remains within an order of magnitude of 10(2) Gt/ yr. Evolution of primary producers forms a basis for the evolution of the biospheric-geospheric system, and cyanobacteria integrated as chloroplasts remain its driving force. Decomposition of organic compounds is performed by organotrophic destructors, anaerobic being less effective. Destructors determine the residual C-org accumulation. Recalcitrant C-org remaining in the sedimentary record is equilibrated by O-2 and other oxidized compounds as Fe- oxides or sulfates. Geospheric and biotic interactions include both direct and biotically mediated processes; the most important is the weathering- sedimentation pathway. Prokaryotic community makes a sustainable frame into which all other more complex forms of life fit. That makes the prokaryotic biosphere a permanent essence of the whole system. New participants might come in and substitute functional components only when they fit to the existing system. The evolution of a large system is additive rather than substitutive. The message of this is; "we all originated from the cyanobacterial community."

TI Do changes in transport costs and tariffs shape the space-economy in the
   same way?
SO PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE

ID TRADE; GEOGRAPHY; MODEL
AB We investigate how alternative ways of modelling trade costs affect the main results of "new" economic geography. In order to do so, we compare the impacts of falling transport costs and decreasing tariffs on the spatial distribution of economic activities. Our analysis reveals that tariffs and transport costs largely play symmetric roles, in the sense that a decrease in either of them favours agglomeration. Yet, tariffs generate rents which, once redistributed or used to finance local public goods, make dispersion sustainable over a larger range of parameter values. Therefore, decreasing transport costs are more likely to trigger agglomeration than decreasing tariffs.

AB Objective: To develop, implement and evaluate a workshop to help adolescents develop independent and active relationships with their physicians.
   Methods: A needs-assessment survey informed the development of a workshop delivered by medical student volunteers and incorporated into the career and personal planning curriculum of high schools in Vancouver, Canada.
   Results: Over a 6-year period, 64 workshops were delivered by 181 medical students to 1651 high school students in six schools.
   Conclusion: The workshop is acceptable, do-able, effective and sustainable, characteristics that arise from the mutual benefits to all the groups involved: the medical school, the school board, the medical students, the high school teachers and students. The workshop provides a model for providing health care education to adolescents in the community.
   Practice implications: Teaching adolescents the importance of good doctor-patient communication encourages them to take ongoing responsibility for their health care and is an alternative route to direct health care education. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The study examined the content and frequency of messages to an Internet support group, using a conceptual framework based on support-giving and emotional work. The main questions addressed concerned what correspondents seem to be gaining from their involvement and whether the high-frequency correspondents differ motivationally from the lower-frequency correspondents.
   Methods: Messages to an Internet support group for women with breast cancer were collected over 12 months. The number of contributions written by individual correspondents could be determined. Messages were reliably coded for their main themes in terms of seeking or providing support.
   Results: The majority of correspondents (94%) wrote fewer than 10 messages. Two high-frequency correspondents emerged whose messages significantly less often referred to seeking and more often to providing support than did the messages of the less-frequent correspondents. These volunteer emotion workers both reported gaining personal satisfaction from their role.
   Conclusion: The high-frequency correspondents act as informal volunteer emotion workers for the other users, and valuably supplement the role of the group's initiators. Further research is needed on how to amplify the psychological rewards for volunteer emotion workers in online support groups for adults with cancer.
   Practice implications: Volunteer assistants in electronic groups may be crucial to the sustainability of online support initiatives. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using Landsat TM data of 1988, 1998 and 2001, the dynamic process of the spatial-temporal characteristics of land use changes during 13 years from 1988 to 2001 in the special economic zone of Xiamen, China was analyzed to improve understanding and to find the driving forces of land use change so that sustainable land utilization could be practiced. During the 13 years cropland decreased remarkably by nearly 11304.95 ha. The areas of rural-urban construction and water body increased by 10152.24 ha and 848.94 ha, respectively. From 1988 to 2001, 52.5% of the lost cropland was converted into rural-urban industrial land. Rapid urbanization contributed to a great change in the rate of cropland land use during these years. Land-reclamation also contributed to a decrease in water body area as well as marine ecological and environmental destruction. In the study area 1) urbanization and industrialization, 2) infrastructure and agricultural intensification, 3) increased affluence of the farming community, and 4) policy factors have driven the land use changes. Possible sustainable land use measures included construction of a land management system, land planning, development of potential land resources, new technology applications, and marine ecological and environmental protection.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) in forest ecosystems is not only important to global carbon (C) storage but also to sustainable management of forestland with vegetation types, being a critical factor in controlling the quantity and dynamics of SOM. In this field experiment soil plots with three replicates were selected from three forest vegetation types: broadleaf, Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.), and Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata Hook.). Soil total organic C (TOC), two easily oxidizable C levels (EOC1 and EOC2, Which were oxidized by 66.7 mmol L-1 K2Cr2O7 at 130-140 degrees C and 333 mmol L-1 KMnO4 at 25 degrees C, respectively), microbial biomass C (MBC), and water-soluble organic C (WSOC) were analyzed for soil samples. Soil under the broadleaf forest stored significantly higher TOC (P <= 0.05). Because of its significantly larger total soil C storage, the soil under the broadleaf forest usually had significantly higher levels (P <= 0.05) of the different labile organic carbons, EOC1, EOC2, MBC, and WSOC; but when calculated as a percentage of TOC each labile C fraction of the broadleaf forest was significantly lower (P <= 0.05) than one of the other two forests. Under all the three vegetation types temperature as well as quality and season of litter input generally affected the dynamics of different organic C fractions in soils, with EOC1, EOC2, and MBC increasing closely following increase in temperature, whereas WSOC showed an opposite trend.

AB Wonderland, a compact, integrated economic, demographic and environmental model, is investigated using methods developed for studying critical phenomena. Simulation results show the parameter space separates into two phases, one of which contains the property of long term, sustainable development. By employing information contain in the phase diagram, an optimal strategy involving pollution taxes is developed as a means of moving a system initially in a unsustainable region of the phase diagram into a region of sustainability while ensuring minimal regret with respect to long-term economic growth.

AB The ability of Dacrylella oviparasitica and Fusarium oxysporum to suppress Heterodera schacltii numbers was examined in field microplots. Fungi were individually added to fumigated field soil that was seeded with sugar beet. Four weeks later, soils were infested with H. schachtii second-stage juveniles (J2). At two harvests, 11 weeks and 19 weeks (1,469 and 2,547 degree days (base 8 degrees C), respectively) after nematode-infestation. H. schachtii cyst and egg numbers were assessed. At both time points, D. oviparasitica reduced H. schachtii population densities to those in the naturally suppressive soil, even when additional H. schachtii J2 were added to the microplots after the first harvest. Although F. oxysporum did not alter H. schachtii population densities after I I weeks, significant reductions were detected after 19 weeks. The sustainability of the H. schachtii suppressiveness created by single applications of the fungi at the beginning of the microplot trials was further examined in a greenhouse study. Soil collected at the completion of the microplot trials was potted, and seeded with sugar beet. Four weeks later, each pot was infested with H. schachtii J2. Approximately 16 weeks (1,389 degree days) after seeding, the D. oviparasitica-amended soil produced greater fresh root weights and considerably smaller nematode population densities than the nonamended control.

AB The distribution of fine roots and external ectomycorrhizal mycelium of three species of trees was determined down to a soil depth of 55 cm to estimate the relative nutrient uptake capacity of the trees from different soil layers. In addition, a root bioassay was performed to estimate the nutrient uptake capacity of Rb+ and NH4+ by these fine roots under standardized conditions in the laboratory. The study was performed in monocultures of oak (Quercus robur L.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] on sandy soil in a tree species trial in Denmark. The distribution of spruce roots was found to be more concentrated to the top layer (0-11 cm) than that of oak and beech roots, and the amount of external ectomycorrhizal mycelia was correlated to the distribution of the roots. The uptake rate of [86 Rb+] by oak roots declined with soil depth, while that of beech or spruce roots was not influenced by soil depth. In modelling the nutrient sustainability of forest soils, the utilization of nutrient resources in deep soil layers has been found to be a key factor. The present study shows that the more shallow-rooted spruce can have a similar capacity to take up nutrients from deeper soil layers than the more deeply rooted oak. The distribution of roots and mycelia may therefore not be a reliable parameter for describing nutrient uptake capacity by tree roots at different soil depths.

AB Impacts of sustainable soil-borne pest management strategies on the soil ecosystem were compared to that of methyl bromide fumigation using nematode community analysis. A field experiment was conducted in 2003 and repeated in 2004. Soil treatments carried out in summer months included methyl bromide (MB) fumigation, solarization (S) for 6 weeks, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) cover cropping for 3 months (CP), combination of solarization and cowpea cover cropping (S + CP), and a weedy fallow throughout the summer used as a control (C). All treated plots were planted to pepper (Capsicum annuum) after the application of the treatments at the end of the summer. In general, responses of nematode communities to soil treatments were more obvious at pepper planting than at 4 months after planting. In 2003, initial population densities of bacterivores and fungivores at pepper planting followed a hypothesized pattern of MB > S > S + CP > CP > C. However, this perturbation did not persist after a cycle of vigorous growth of a pepper crop. Omnivorous nematodes were the most sensitive nematode trophic group, with impact from soil treatment lasting until the end of the pepper crop. Nematode community indices such as ratio of fungivores to fungivores plus bacterivores, richness, and structure index were especially useful in detecting impacts by the various soil treatments. While disturbance from MB on the nematode communities lasted at least until the end of the pepper crop, that from the solarization often reduced or disappeared at the end of the experiment. The CP treatment enhanced many of the beneficial nematodes but failed to suppress the final population densities of herbivorous nematodes at pepper harvest (Pf). However, CP + S consistently reduced the Pf of herbivores to levels equivalent to MB in both years, whereas, this level of suppression could not be achieved by either CP or solarization alone.

AB Fusarium head blight (FHB or head scab) has become a major limiting factor for sustainable wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production around the world. For quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of resistance to FHB, F-3 plants and F-3:5 lines, derived from a 'Frontana' (moderately resistant)/'Seri82' (susceptible) cross, were spray-inoculated in 2001 and 2002. respectively. Artificial inoculations were carried out under field conditions. Of 273 SSR and AFLP markers, 250 could be mapped and they yielded 42 linkage groups, covering a genetic distance of 1931 cM. QTL analysis was based on the constructed linkage map and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). The analyses revealed three consistent QTLs associated with FHB resistance on chromosomes 1 BL, 3AL and 7AS explaining 7.9%, 7.7% and 7.6% of the phenotypic variation, respectively, above 2 years. The results confirmed the previously described resistance QTL of 'Frontana' on chromosome 3AL. A combination of 'Frontana' resistance with 'Sumai-3' resistance may lead to lines with augmented resistance expression.

AB In Mutale Local Authority of South Africa, a photovoltaic pilot project was commissioned to provide off-grid electricity to 582 households residing in Folovhodwe village. The aim was to try a renewable source of energy supply in a rural settlement area. The Beneficiaries Assessment method was used to assess the problems of the implementation and operation of the solar energy project in Folovhodwe. The project initiators did not realize that there would be the problem of the sustainable implementation of the project. The problem of sustainability was related to the inadequate definition of the role of each stakeholder. For example the end users were not taught how to properly operate and repair faulty equipment because it was not built into the planning and implementation stages of the project. Skill acquisition through capacity building for the end users can promote the sustainability of the project on a long-term basis. In Folovhodwe, improper planning and implementation of the project was responsible for the failure of the project. The project initiators did not foresee the problem of theft of materials, problems related to the procurement of spare parts and who would bear the cost of maintenance of the facilities. The failure of the project was also related to the inability of the policy makers to tackle the question of the role that each stakeholder should play to ensure the success of the project in a rural setting. The suggestion to policy and decision-makers is that pilot projects with relatively new technology input in a rural area should reconsider the importance of culture, capacity development and the level of income of the end users at the initial planning stage and implementation.

AB The concept of socioeconomic metabolism can be traced back to 19th century and can provide a useful framework for both natural and social scientists to study the interrelations between human societies and their natural environments. Many studies on socioeconomic metabolism incorporated material flow analysis, but there are still many unresolved methodological issues such as its units, aggregation techniques, and omitted energy flows. The importance of the relationships between land use and socioeconomic metabolism has also been raised recently. In order to combine material flows and energy flows, this paper incorporates emergy synthesis to overview the socioeconomic metabolism of Taiwan during 1981-2001. Due to the lack of natural resources, the extraction of domestic non-renewable materials has decreased since 1980s and have to be supplemented by import. The requirements of imported energy flows has increased substantially with industrial development. Difference between results from material flow analysis and emergy synthesis is also discussed. It is found that material flow analysis alone could not identify the essential fact of Taiwan's increasing dependence on energy use. Furthermore, the qualitative characteristics of materials flows are also neglected. The analysis of the relations between land use and socioeconomic metabolism indicates that the changes of land use affect the socioeconomic metabolism in Taiwan. However, due to the lack of information, whether the change of socioeconomic metabolism has triggered land use change still need further investigation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Education towards sustainability in Chemical Engineering (CEng) gave birth to a waste management program (WMP) at Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, in Portugal. It involves students, teachers, and laboratory technicians. It aims to enhance the conscientiousness of the decision-maker next generation for saving resources, managing wastes, and at same time to develop applied chemistry understanding.
   This program was implemented in 1999 and is responsible for management and fate of all inorganic wastewater providing from training experimental activities of the CEng degree. An immediate reduction of wastes at their source was first defined. Wastes were collected separately and were reused, recycled or chemically treated, and after analytically controlled as legally imposed. Solids formed after this program were recycled, purified or followed suitable elimination.
   Global results point out environmental, pedagogical, and social benefits. Active participants are aware, in agreement, and publicly committed to the WMP. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper shows that, for dynamic optimizing economies with different types of natural resource, environmental, and human-made capital stocks, a necessary and sufficient condition for permanently sustaining an optimal utility/consumption level is the stationarity of the current-value Hamiltonian. For economies whose development is not exogenously and directly affected by time (i.e., time-autonomous economies), this stationarity condition generalizes Dixit et al.'s (1980) "zero-net-aggregate-investment" rule of sustain-ability, which in turn generalizes Solow-Hartwick's sustainability rule. For non-autonomous economies, the stationarity condition is not generally fulfilled, and the current-value Hamiltonian under (over) estimates the true welfare level by an amount equal to the discounted value of the net "pure time effect." For the non-autonomous case of a time-dependent utility discount rate, a general condition on the discount rate function (of which the hyperbolic discount rate function is a special case) upholds the results obtained for autonomous cases. The paper concludes with a discussion of policies that promote both optimality and sustainability objectives.

AB The oxidation of pyritic mining waste is a self-perpetuating corrosive process which generates acid mine drainage (AMD) effluent for centuries or longer. The chemical neutralization of these complex, buffered effluents result in unstable, metal-laden sludges, which require disposal to minimize long-term environmental consequences. A variety of passive treatment systems for AMD, developed in the past two decades, combine limestone and organic substrates in constructed wetlands. These systems work well initially but over the longer term fail due to clogging with and the depletion of available organic carbon. However, some ecologically engineered systems, which exploit the activities of acid reducing microbes in the sediment, rely on photosynthesis in the water column as a source of organic matter. The primary productivity in the water column, which also generates some alkalinity, provides electron donors for the microbial reduction processes in the sediment. In its consideration of 'passive' systems, the literature has placed undue emphasis on sulphate reduction; thermodynamical iron reduction is equally important as is the need to prevent iron oxidation. Secondary precipitates of iron play a significant role in sediment-driven biomineralization processes, which affect the anaerobic degradation of organic matter and the stability of the resulting metal sulfides. One such passive system, which utilized a floating root mass as a source of organic carbon, is described. An extensive review of the literature and the chemical and biogeochemical reactions of AMD treatment systems, lead to the conclusion, that sediment based ecological systems offer the greatest potential for the sustainable treatment of AMD.

AB This paper examines the existence of equitable preferences on intergenerational consumption paths in an infinite horizon setting. There are two ethical considerations that capture the concept of intergenerational equity: inequality aversion in allocations and equality in treating generations. They are embodied in the Pigou-Dalton principle and anonymity, respectively. We investigate the existence of binary relations that satisfy these two axioms, as well as other standard axioms, such as monotonicity, transitivity, or continuity, on various domains. We show that any domain admitting such a binary relation is quite restricted: its interior is empty and contains no sustainable consumption path.

DT Article

AB Social health insurance (SHI) has gained popularity in recent years as a health-care funding mechanism for developing countries in Latin America and beyond. This is reflected in a number of high-profile conferences sponsored by international agencies, and a profusion of externally funded reform projects. This article assesses the potential of SHI to provide a sound model of health-care financing, drawing on the experiences of Argentina and Mexico. It uses four criteria to assess the performance of SHI: coverage, equity, effectiveness and sustainability. The article begins by outlining key principles of SHI and comparing it to other models of health-care financing. It then gives a comparative overview of four SHI programmes in Argentina and Mexico, before analysing their performance in greater detail. The article finishes by extracting lessons from this comparative analysis, both for the countries studied and for global debates on SHI.

TI Where techno-science meets poverty: Medical research and the economy of

ID VACCINE; TRIAL
AB This paper considers how internationally supported medical research is understood and interpreted by its actual and potential study subjects, exposing the limits to bioethical discourses amidst economic inequalities and contrasting sociocultural worlds. It focuses on the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratories in The Gambia and particularly their Pneumococcal Vaccine Trial (PVT) that was conducted jointly with the Gambian government during 2001-2004. In many respects this was an exemplar of international best practice in trial communication and informed consent procedures. Yet ethnographic and survey research finds that Gambian parents' perspectives on participation are shaped not by trial specificities, but by broader, historically shaped views and experiences of the MRC as an institution. There is a pervasive view that the MRC offers good, free medication to participants, but that it also 'steals blood'. Widespread concerns with blood-stealing emerge from local frames of understanding in which blood is treated as a tradeable good, in which blood accumulation and depletion in bodily processes relates to its exchange in hospital and medical research practices, and in which transactions can be more or less (un)reasonable. Yet such thinking, rooted in an 'economy of blood', has been overlooked by medical research staff and indeed by historians and anthropologists of Africa whose analyses of bloodstealing have been overly transfixed on rumour and the occult. This paper argues that such cultural framings, which guide local critical commentary on trans-national research orders, require serious attention and need to inform open dialogues between scientists and the public if medical research in resource-poor settings is to continue to be sustainable and politically legitimate.

AB In the Australian Wet Tropics World Heritage Area (WTWHA), protected areas impact on the rights and obligations of Indigenous traditional owners. This research investigated the effectiveness of two new policy instruments, a negotiated agreement, and a protocol, as mechanisms to bridge between the differing protected area management approaches of Kuku-Yalanji Aboriginal people and the WTWHA managers. The policy innovation sought from these instruments reflects a paradigm shift in protected areas globally toward a more inclusive approach, and recognition of diversity in governance types. However, the instruments' effectiveness in achieving innovation was hampered by the lack of substantive legal mechanisms to overcome the colonial legacy within protected areas. Legislative reform to properly recognize diversity in protected area governance would assist effective bridging. Internationally, rigorous criteria to measure progress toward a more inclusive approach in national systems would enhance our capacity to ensure the current paradigm shift becomes more than convenient rhetoric.

AB While stakeholder involvement in environmental management is now common, we suggest that stakeholders can contribute to a pluralistic civic science that incorporates local knowledge directly into environmental decision making and research. We consider how insights from feminist scholarship might help us to understand the influence of power relations among our subjects of study and in determining how scientific knowledge is defined and used. We pay particular attention to how knowledge is produced, how participation is constrained, and to what extent community participants and researchers would benefit from critical reflection in their work. We apply these elements to an assessment of a community forestry pilot project in Burns Lake, British Columbia, Canada. Our findings suggest that while local participants have considered community forestry effective, practices have not met the ideals of a pluralistic civic science. We identify some of the reasons for this discrepancy and provide suggestions for future practice.

AB It is frequently hypothesised that high soil fungal/bacterial ratios are indicative for more sustainable agricultural systems. Increased FIB ratios have been reported in extensively managed grasslands. To determine the shifts in fungal/bacterial biomass ratio as influenced by grassland management and to find relations with nitrogen leaching potential, we sampled a two-year-old field experiment at an organic experimental farm in the eastern part of The Netherlands. The effect of crop (grass and grass-clover), N application rate (0, 40, 80, 120 kg N ha(-1)) and manure type (no manure, farm yard manure and slurry) on the FIB ratio within three growing seasons was tested, as well as relations with soil and crop characteristics, nitrate leaching and partial N balance. Biomass of fungi and bacteria was calculated after direct counts using epifluorescence microscopy. Fungal and bacterial biomass and the FIB ratio were higher in grass than in grass-clover. The FIB ratio decreased with increasing N application rate and multiple regression analysis revealed a negative relationship with pH. Bacterial activity (measured as incorporation of [H-3]thymidine and [C-14]leucine into bacterial DNA and proteins) showed the exact opposite: an increase with N application rate and pH. Leaching increased with N application rate and was higher in grass-clover than in grass. Partial N balance was more positive at a higher N application rate and showed an inverse relationship with fungal biomass and FIB ratio. We conclude that the fungal/bacterial biomass ratio quickly responded to changes in management. Grasslands with higher N input showed lower FIB ratios. Grass-clover had a smaller fungal biomass and higher N leaching than grass. In general, a higher fungal biomass indicated a lower nitrogen leaching and a more negative partial N balance (or smaller N surplus), but more observations are needed to confirm the relationship between FIB ratio and sustainability.

AB Like all other living organisms, microorganisms depend on nutrients, carbon and energy. Since microorganisms are central to most soil processes, the sustainable management of agricultural soils may need to consider the impact of soil fertility management on the soil microbial community. We tested the hypothesis that different rates of N and P fertilizers, and cropping frequency (modifying C input to soil) influence the size, structure and physiological condition of soil microbial populations residing in the plough layer (top 7.5 cm). For this study, we used a 37-yr old long-term wheat-based rotation experiment located in the semiarid Brown soil zone of Saskatchewan. The experiment included (1) four input treatments: (i) no N or (ii) no P fertilizer application to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in fallow-wheat-wheat (F-W-W) rotations, and (iii) recommended rates of both N and P fertilizer applied to fallow-wheat (F-W) and (iv) to F-W-W; (2) two rotation phases: fallow and wheat-after-fallow; and (3) four sampling times: 8 June, 4 July, 5 August and 16 September 2003. Increased partitioning into storage lipids of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) biomarker 16:10)5 (P = 0.04), suggested the accumulation of storage material under low soil N availability. Discriminant analysis detected modifications in soil microbial community structure due to cropping frequency (P = 0.001) and sampling time, the effect of which was different in the fallow (P < 0.0001) and wheat-after-fallow (P < 0.0001) phases of the rotations. Correlation analysis of soil variables conducted in plots growing wheat revealed a dual effect of plants, which stimulated active soil microbial biomass (SMB), possibly through the release of soluble extractable C (Csol-ext) in soil and, at the same time, SMB competed with wheat for soil water and N. The 37 y of different nutrient input treatments had no effect upon the active soil microbial biomass according to PLFA measurements, despite changes in soil resource-related variables (soil water potential, Soil PO4-P and NO3-N fluxes, and Csol-ext concentrations) (P <= 0.003). The biomass of each of three microbial populations monitored was lowest on 4 July, when the amounts of the soil resources monitored were average, and greatest on 5 August, when N, P and soil moisture availability was lowest. The temporal effect on the biomass of microbial populations seemed unrelated to variation in nutrient or water availability. We conclude that the soil microbial community is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions. We propose therefore that the occurrence of sudden and dramatic events, such as a heavy rainfall on a dry soil, is the most important determinant of seasonal variation in active soil microbial biomass.

AB The clay mineralogical composition of 87 topsoil (0-15 cm) samples from inland valleys (IVs) and flood plains (FPs) in seven West African countries, namely Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, was examined using X-ray diffraction analysis to gain basic information for the development of sustainable lowland agriculture in the region. The results of the present study revealed that the clay fraction (< 2 m) of these samples consisted of 68.4% of 7 angstrom minerals (low-activity clays such as kaolin minerals), 26.6% of 14 angstrom minerals (relatively high-activity clays such as smectite and vermiculite) and 5.1% of 10 angstrom minerals (illite or clay micas) and showed a high variability in the composition. With respect to the soil material classification based on the relative abundance of these three types of minerals, Type 7 (rich in 7 angstrom minerals) accounted for 42.5% of the total samples, while 39.7% of all the samples were Type 7-10 and 7-14 with a predominance of 7 angstrom minerals and with negligible amounts of 10 and/or 14 angstrom minerals, respectively. Type 14-7 accounted for 17.2% of the total samples and was only recorded in Nigeria. The other clay mineral types (i.e. Types 7-10-14, 14, 10, 10-7, 10-14 and 14-10) that were composed mainly of 10 and/or 14 angstrom minerals were hardly found in the West African lowland soils, whereas Types 14 and 7-10-14 were observed in a vertic soil of Southeast Ghana and in northern Ghana, respectively. In contrast, no significant differences in the clay mineralogical composition were found between the IV and FP soils. Geographical distribution of the soil types showed that the soils in the eastern part of West Africa contained more 14 angstrom and 10 angstrom minerals than those in the western part. Although the effect of agro-climatological differences was not conspicuous, soils in the Sahel and Sudan savanna zones showed a higher percentage of 14 angstrom clay minerals than those in the Guinea savanna and equatorial forest zones. The findings were as follows: (1) the low fertility status of the lowland soils in the region was closely associated with their poor mineralogical characteristics (i.e. predominance of 1:1 type clay minerals and a lower amount of 2:1 type clay minerals), (2) no significant differences in the mean clay mineralogical composition were observed between the IV and FP soils, indicating that the lower fertility of the IV soils mainly resulted from the lower clay content, (3) the clay mineralogy of the West African lowland soils was more strongly influenced by the nature of the parent materials than by the climatic conditions and relief.

AB Opuntia is a drought tolerant crop and even the smallest amount of water is absorbed efficiently through the shallow and horizontally spread root system. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the root dynamics of cactus pear for sustainable production of fodder and fruit in the drier areas. This study, conducted during the 2003/2004 growing season on two-year-old Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller (cultivar Morado-green cladode) and O. robusta Wendel. (cultivar Monterey-blue cladode) plants in the field was therefore aimed at quantifying root distribution with distance and depth from the stem. Root growth was expressed in terms of both mass and length, and water-use efficiency (WUE) was defined as the cladode dry mass production per unit of evapotranspiration. In both species most roots were concentrated in the first 150 mm soil layer. After only two growing seasons the roots spread as far as 2.5 m from the stem for both species. The total root dry weight production calculated per plant up to a depth of 1200 mm, was 239 and 316 g per plant or kg ha(-1) for O. ficus-indica and O. robusta respectively. The thickest roots developed directly from the planted cladode and were 9.1 min thick for O. ficus-indica and 6.3 min for O. robusta. Opuntia robusta showed a finer root system than that of O. ficus-indica. After two growing seasons 3407 and 2702 kg ha(-1) aboveground dry mass was produced by O. fieus-indica and O. robusta respectively. The MTUE of O. ficus-indica (6.52 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) was significantly higher than that of O. robusta (5.39 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)). The roots comprised only 11% of the total biomass for O. robusta and 7% for O. ficus-indica. Such root adaptations of this species are in addition to the classical physiological and structural modifications of CAM plants to tolerate prolonged drought. (c) 2006 SAAB.

TI Identifying asset-based trends in sustainable programmes which support
   vulnerable children
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION

DT Article
DE collaborative support; inclusive education; schools as nodes of care and
   support
AB In this article we argue that the asset-based approach is one explanation for sit stain ability in programmes supporting vulnerable children. We structure our argument by formulating five questions and then pursuing tentative answers to them. We start our contention by highlighting the particularity of the challenges faced in schools to support vulnerable children. We then consider the common denominators in programmes that have shown evidence of sustainable practices for supporting vulnerable children. This is followed by a deliberated link of the identified sustainability factors (e.g. common denominators) with the asset-based approach as a theoretical framework. Subsequently, we consider why the asset-based approach can be considered in terms of supporting vulnerable children in education. We indicate the similarities between the asset-based approach and current discourses focusing on the notion of schools as nodes of support and care.(1) We conclude by suggesting that knowledge of asset-based good practices could be shared with families in school-based sessions, thereby developing schools'. families' and communities' capacity to support vulnerable children.

AB Because of the growing participation rates of nature-based tourism (NBT) and the variety of organizations affected by the growth, this study set out to identify NBT policy initiative recommendations designed to promote sustainable NBT activities in rural Pennsylvania. A mail survey of key decision makers in NBT programs in the state resulted in 22 major policy initiative recommendations that address: resource allocation and management, state agency planning and coordination, partnership with stakeholders, communication between state agencies and the public, knowledge base and the role of science, and information and data management. The survey also identified 65 policy initiative recommendations for 14 specific types of NBT activities. Study results help define the choices NBT programs face over what the "fit" with the state's NBT environments will or should be. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INDICATORS
AB The sustainability benchmark for ecotourism sites may vary with respect to space and time. Using subjective measures as indicators reflect variation in these factors. In order to evaluate the sustainability of an ecotourism site, this study utilizes subjective measures to analyze the relationships between resource, community and tourism in sustainable ecotourism. A Taiwanese indigenous ecotourism site was taken as an example, and the Delphi technique was used to identify evaluation indicators of this tourist destination. Local residents, tourists and resource administration were interviewed to explore each group's perception of relationships with the remaining two groups. After results reflect local economic, social and environmental concerns. Furthermore, the evaluation variables identified can be reapplied to other destinations. The study provides a valuable tool for sustainable destination management. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Transgenic plants producing insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) can control some major insect pests and reduce reliance on sprayed insecticides. However, large scale adoption of this technology has raised concerns about potential negative effects, including evolution of pest resistance to Bt toxins, transgene flow from Bt crops to other plants, and harm to non-target beneficial organisms. Furthermore, concern has also been expressed over the effects this technology may have on biodiversity in general. Ecologically relevant risk assessment is therefore required (Risk = Hazard x Exposure). Transgenic plants that produce Bt toxins to kill insect pests could harm beneficial predators. This might occur directly by transmission of toxin via prey, or indirectly by toxin-induced reduction in prey quality (Hazard). To test these hypotheses, we determined the effects of Bt-producing canola on a predatory ground beetle (Pterostichus madidus) fed larvae of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) that were either susceptible or resistant to the Bt toxin. Survival, weight gain, and adult reproductive fitness did not differ between beetles fed prey reared on Bt-producing plants and those fed prey from control plants. Furthermore, while Bt-resistant prey was shown to deliver high levels of toxin to the beetle when they were consumed, no significant impact upon the beetle was observed. Subsequent investigation showed that in choice tests (Exposure), starved and partially satiated female beetles avoided Bt-fed susceptible prey, but not Bt-fed resistant prey. However, in the rare cases when starved females initially selected Bt-fed susceptible prey, they rapidly rejected them after beginning to feed. This prey type was shown to provide sufficient nutrition to support reproduction in the bioassay suggesting that Bt-fed susceptible prey is acceptable in the absence of alternative prey, however adults possess a discrimination ability based on prey quality. These results suggest that the direct effects of Bt-producing canola on predator life history was minimal, and that predators' behavioural preferences may mitigate negative indirect effects of reduced quality of prey caused by consumption of Bt-producing plants. The results presented here therefore suggest that cultivation of Bt canola may lead to conservation of non-target predatory and scavenging organisms beneficial in pest control, such as carabids, and may therefore provide more sustainable agricultural systems than current practices. In addition, minimal impacts on beneficial carabids in agro-ecosystems suggest that Bt canola crops are likely to be compatible with integrated pest management (IPM) systems.

ID MODEL
AB During the last decade, systems analysis has become a more frequently used tool in municipal waste management. This paper investigates how one such analysis, carried out in a Swedish county, was perceived by local municipal officers and politicians as Support in the decision-making process. A questionnaire was sent to municipal officers and politicians in local government committees and municipal councils. The respondents considered the most important aspects in evaluating scenarios to be: possibilities for municipal co-operation to minimize cost and negative environmental influence; sound working conditions for refuse disposal personnel; low emissions of greenhouse gases; keeping household economy in mind; and using technologies that are known and reliable. Aspects of relatively low importance were the number of locally generated job opportunities, and minimizing work efforts for the households. The study also showed differences between male and female respondents and between politicians and Municipal officers, on how scenarios were valued and on which aspects of the systems analysis were of greatest importance for this valuation. Respondents, on average, were satisfied with the systems analysis, and its usefulness as a decision-support tool. However, more work should be carried out to explain and present the results of the systems analysis to further improve its usefulness.

AB Growing chick-pea in sustainable systems requires the use and development of more competitive genotypes which can complement the effects of reduced input weed control. A 2-year study assessed the competitive ability of 13 genotypes grown in either the presence or absence of weeds, in a split-plot design including the weeds in pure stands. Crop and weed density, phenology, relative biomass of crop (RBc) and weeds (RBw), crop yield characters, crop biometric traits in the absence of weeds, relative biomass total of mixtures (RBT) and crop competitive ability (C-b = ln RBc/RBw) were recorded. Lines C136, C120, C101 and C106, and cultivars Pascia, Visir and Sultano gave the best seed yield in the absence of weeds (1.8-2.0 t ha(-1) DM). Weeds reduced yield by 75% and 83% in C136 and C133 and by 87-97% in the other genotypes. Weed biomass in mixture (mainly Chenopodium album) averaged 4.42 t ha(-1) DM. Chick-pea genotypes C136 and C133 were the most competitive, but weeds were more competitive than any of the chick-peas. C-b was correlated directly to the height of first fertile pod (r(2) = 0.84) and inversely to the insertion angle of primary branches to the vertical (r(2) = 0.77). Intergenotypic variation for competitive ability could be exploited in integrated weed control using more competitive genotypes, or used in breeding programmes aimed to develop highly competitive cultivars on the basis of easily screenable characters.

AB Cysticercosis is due to the establishment of the larval stage of the zoonotic cestode parasite Taenia solium. The infection causes substantial human morbidity and mortality, particularly in several Latin American countries and parts of Africa and Asia, as well as economic losses in pig husban dry due to condemnation of infected pork meat. The life cycle of T solium includes human beings as definitive hosts and pigs as intermediate hosts. Cysticercosis is acquired by the ingestion of eggs released by human tapeworm carriers, who become infected after ingesting pork meat contaminated with cysticerci. Taenia solium transmission has been associated with poverty, lack of sanitary services and practices of rearing backyard pigs with free access to the areas that villagers use as toilets, as well as cultural behaviour. Nonetheless, due to the recent increase of migration and tourism, industrial countries are also reporting cases of human cysticercosis. There are many epidemiological studies that have been conducted mainly in Latin American countries that have evaluated intervention measures for control of cysticercosis including the development and testing of vaccines. Furthermore, the involvement of international agencies and institutions, such as the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Livestock Research Institute, as well as the commitment of policymakers, scientists and field workers, are key means for the sustainable control and, hopefully, eradication of T solium infections.

AB The interest in novel methods of controlling helminth infections in ruminants is driven primarily by the development of parasite resistance to currently available anthelmintics. While the purpose of anthelmintics is to achieve high efficacy, i.e. > 90% reduction of adult and/or larval parasites in the target host animal, the purpose of novel parasite control methods is rather to assist in maintaining parasite infections below the economic threshold. The ability to maintain parasite levels below the economic threshold is related not only to the efficacy of the control method, but also to the epidemiology of the parasites, climatic conditions, the livestock management program, and integration in a sustainable parasite control program. Because of this fundamental difference, novel parasite control methods need to be evaluated using efficacy criteria different from that adopted for anthelmintics. Although the efficacy of novel parasite control methods may be demonstrated in classic dose-confirmation studies, the impact on livestock production parameters can only be evaluated when tested on-farm. In this paper, the rationale for evaluating novel methods differently from anthelmintics is reviewed, potential performance expectations are presented, and four novel parasite control methods (vaccines, nematophagous fungi, condensed tannins, and immunonutrition) are assessed based on the potential performance criteria.

AB Seriously escalating global anthelmintic resistance in gastrointestinal nematodes of small ruminants has spawned a variety of alternatives to anthelmintics for worm management, based on the need for sustainable Integrated Parasite Management (sIPM).
   Pivotal to the sIPM approach is the concept of refugia, the proportion of a given parasite population that escapes exposure to control measures. By balancing drug applications with the maintenance of refugia, the accumulation of anthelmintic resistance alleles in worm populations can be considerably delayed, while still providing good levels of control. The over-dispersed nature of parasitic infections provides an opportunity to achieve this balance, by targeting treatments to the members of a flock or herd that are least tolerant to nematode infection. However, implementation of this strategy has only recently become feasible, with the development of the FAMACHA (c) system for clinical evaluation of anaemia due to haemonchosis. Subsequently, the use of milk yields has proven an effective indicator in dairy goats infected predominantly with nematodes other than Haemonchus contortus. In addition, short-term weight changes and perhaps also body condition scoring may provide indices of parasitism, permitting the rapid identification of animals likely to benefit from treatment.
   However, sIPM and refugia-based approaches are more complex than whole-flock treatments in conventional programs, and adoption by farmers is most likely where the theoretical basis is understood. As close communication with informed advisors is generally limited, there is a danger that sIPM will remain a theoretical concept without alternative modes of communication. The development of computer-based decision support programs, which use epidemiological, seasonal and clinical information to provide recommendations for specific situations, should be accorded high priority in the future development of worm management systems.

AB The increasing prevalence of anthelmintic resistance has provided a spur for research into 'alternative/novel' approaches to the control of helminthoses that are intended to reduce our reliance upon using chemoprophylaxis. The different approaches either target the parasite population in the host or on pasture, but the goal of all of them is to restrict host parasite contact to levels which minimise the impact of helminths on host welfare and/or performance. Infrapopulation regulation can be achieved through methods that enhance immunity such as optimised nutrition (immunonutrition), genetic selection and vaccination, or by an 'antheimintic' route using bioactive forages, copper oxide wire particles, or use of targeted selective treatment strategies such as FAMACHA (c) which reduce the selection pressure for the development of resistance by maintaining a population in refugia. Suprapopulation control can be achieved through grazing management, or by using predacious fungi such as Duddingtonia flagrans. All of these approaches have been developed beyond the proof of concept stage and some are capable of being employed currently. However, some still require knowledge transfer, or commercialisation before they can be tested and widely applied in the field. All of the different approaches present unique challenges to the researchers engaged in developing them, and in comparison to simple prescriptive anthelmintic treatments, their use appears complex and requires some expertise on behalf of the advisor and/or end user. At present, most of our data are derived from trials using single approaches, but it is apparent that we need to move towards integrating some of these technologies which again represents a further challenge to the extension/advisory services. Progress in establishing different approaches requires not only the funding to support their scientific development but also to support the development of computer based models which can be used to highlight deficiencies in our understanding of the control mechanisms and to identify impediments to their introduction. It is inevitable that some of the approaches currently under investigation will fail to become widely applied for a variety of reasons that are not solely financial. These include issues concerned with practicability/applicability, affordability/appropriateness, availability/deliverability and above all, the failure to provide a consistent, reliable effect when used under commercial farming conditions.

AB Background: The study sought to determine the effect of using insecticide-treated clothes (ITCs) on personal protection against malaria infection. The specific objectives were to determine the effect of using ITCs on the rate of infection with malaria parasites and the effect on indoor mosquito density.
   Methods: This study was done in Dadaab refugee camps, North Eastern Province Kenya between April and August 2002, and involved a total of 198 participants, all refugees of Somali origin. The participants were selected through multi-stage cluster sampling. Half of the participants ( treatment group) had their personal clothes worn on a daily basis (Diras, Saris, Jalbaabs, Ma'awis and shirts) and their bedding ( sheets and blankets) treated with insecticide ( permethrin). The other half ( comparison group) had their clothes treated with placebo ( plain water). Indoor mosquito density was determined from twelve households belonging to the participants; six in the treatment block and six in the comparison block. During pre-testand post-test, laboratory analysis of blood samples was done, indoor mosquito density determined and questionnaires administered. Using STATA statistical package, tests for significant difference between the two groups were conducted.
   Results: Use of ITCs reduced both malaria infection rates and indoor mosquito density significantly. The odds of malaria infection in the intervention group were reduced by about 70 percent. The idea of using ITCs for malaria infection control was easily accepted among the refugees and they considered it beneficial. No side effects related to use of the ITCs were observed from the participants.
   Conclusion: The use of ITCs reduces malaria infection rate and has potential as an appropriate method of malaria control. It is recommended, therefore, that this strategy be considered for use among poor communities like slum dwellers and other underprivileged communities, such as street children and refugees, especially during an influx to malaria-prone regions. Further research on cost-effectiveness and sustainability of this strategy is worthwhile.

AB An emergy evaluation was conducted on the systems of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) production, processing and export in Nicaragua in order to evaluate the environmental contributions to the tradeable products and thus enrich the discussion about fair trade. The emergy indices calculated were: transformities, % renewable, environmental loading ratio and emergy exchange ratio. The different emergy indices showed that coffee processing and industrialization are intensive activities, requiring large environmental support. The calculated transformities for coffee cherries, green coffee, roasted coffee and instant coffee were 3.35E+05, 1.77E+06, 3.64E+06 and 1.29E+07 sej/J, respectively The emergy exchange ratio demonstrated that almost all purchasers benefit when buying green coffee from Nicaragua. The sales of roasted or instant coffee is of benefit for Nicaragua. This means that Nicaragua exports much more emergy in the green coffee sold than it imports in the money received for the coffee, thereby depleting its local natural resources. A fair price to pay for green coffee would range from 0.7 to 3 times the actual price paid now. Emergy analysis is a powerful tool in assessing the direct and indirect environmental requirements for a good or service and it is thereby able to evaluate trade in a much more comprehensive way than is usually done using standard economic measures. Inequity in international trade can be detected with this evaluation methodology. Therefore, we propose the use of emergy exchange ratio (EER), emdollars and emprice values as useful measures when trying to develop more sustainable and fair trade conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objectives: In the Gambia, the combination of chloroquine (CQ) and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has replaced CQ monotherapy for treatment of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. We measured the efficacy of the combination CQ/SP, and the prevalence of parasites carrying alleles associated with resistance to CQ or SP.
   Design: We conducted a single-blind, randomised, controlled trial to compare the efficacy of CQ/SP to that of SP or CQ alone.
   Setting: The study took place in the town of Farafenni and surrounding villages in the Gambia.
   Participants: Participants were children aged 12 mo to 10 y presenting as outpatients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
   Interventions: 500 children were randomised to receive CQ, SP, or CQ/SP as supervised treatment and actively followed over 28 d.
   Outcome Measures: Primary outcome was parasitaemia at any time during follow-up. Secondary outcomes were PCR-confirmed recrudescent infections among treatment failures, and clinical failure requiring rescue medication by day 28. Pretreatment parasite isolates from 161 patients were tested for the presence of resistance-associated genetic markers.
   Results: The prevalence of parasitological failure by day 28 for the CQ group was 60.3%, compared to 17.6% for SP ( odds ratio [ OR], 0.106; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.057 - 0.194; p < 0.001) and 13.9% for CQ/SP ( OR versus CQ, 0.140; 95% CI, 0.078 - 0.250; p < 0.001). There was no difference between the SP and CQ/SP groups ( OR, 1.324; 95% CI, 0.705 - 2.50). The projected prevalence of PCR-corrected treatment failure was 30.2, 6.06, and 3.94% in the CQ, SP, and CQ/ SP groups, respectively. The pfdhfr-triple mutant and pfdhps-437G mutation were common, with prevalences of 67.4 and 51.2%, respectively. Pretreatment carriage of pfdhps-437G and of multidrug-resistant parasite genotypes was associated with treatment failure in the SP group, but not in the CQ or CQ/ SP groups.
   Conclusions: The combination of CQ/ SP was an efficacious treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Gambian children in this study, but the frequent occurrence of multidrug-resistant parasites suggests that this observed efficacy is not sustainable.

AB The analysis of technical efficiency in developing country agriculture is well established but has been overlooked for developing country commercial marine fisheries. Policies raising technical efficiency in agriculture are viewed as uniformly positive but are a mixed blessing in fisheries due to the open-access property right and common-pool resource. This study explores this contradiction and policies aimed to promote sustainable development and management of renewable common pool resources through a case study of the Java Sea purse seine fishery. Season of the year rather than fisher or vessel characteristics primarily determines technical efficiency. The results are contrasted with developing country agriculture and conclusions drawn for fisheries development strategies.

AB Conventional resources mainly fossil fuels are becoming limited because of the rapid increase in energy demand. This imbalance in energy demand and supply has placed immense pressure not only on consumer prices but also on the environment, prompting mankind to look for sustainable energy resources. Biomass is one such environmentally friendly renewable resource from which various useful chemicals and fuels can be produced. A system similar to a petroleum refinery is required to produce fuels and useful chemicals from biomass and is known as a biorefinery. Biorefineries have been categorized in three phases based on the flexibility of input, processing capabilities, and product generation. Phase I has less or no flexibility in any of the three aforementioned categories. Phase II, while having fixed input and processing capabilities, allows flexibility in product generation. Phase III allows flexibility in all the three processes and is based on the concept of high- value low- volume ( HVLV) and low- value high- volume ( LVHV) outputs. This paper reviews the concept of biorefinery, its types, future directions, and associated technical challenges. An approach of streamlining biorefineries with conventional refineries in producing conventional fuels is also presented. Furthermore, twelve platform chemicals that could be major outputs from an integrated biorefinery are also discussed.

AB Models for auxiliary power units (APU) based on-board hydrocarbon fuel processors (FP) for hydrogen production for polymer-electrolyte-membrane (PEM) fuel cells were coded in Matlab/Simulink software considering the following: (i) either an autothermal (ATR) or a steam reforming (SR) unit fed with several fuels (road distribution net fuels: gasoline, light diesel, heavy diesel, and biodiesel; reference fuels in internal combustion enginer (ICE) applications: isooctane for gasoline and cetane for diesel oils); (ii) the secondary units for the CO cleanup process (water gas shift and CO preferential oxidation reactors: WGS and COPROX); (iii) the auxiliary units for the balance of plant of the whole system (afterburner, heat exchangers, water recovery radiators, air compressor, and water and fuel pumps), necessary to properly operate the FP; and (iv) the PEM fuel cell. First, a study on the feasibility of the substitution during the simulations of the real liquid fuels available for automotive traction (mixtures of various organic compounds) with their reference fuel counterparts (pure substances normally used as references for ICE applications) enlightened that isooctane and cetane are not satisfactory substitutes of gasoline and diesel oils, respectively. Then, beyond the prevalent goal of comparing the ATR and the SR options, particular attention was paid to the models as design tools for the optimization of the FP scheme to obtain the highest possible energy conversion efficiency within the constraints imposed by, e.g., catalyst and materials durability and self-sustainability of the system as concerns energy and water balances. From the simulation results, gasoline emerges as the most effective fuel, whereas the highest performance, in terms of efficiency, seems to belong to the SR APU system (efficiency up to 39%), which is, though, characterized by a plant complexity higher than that of its ATR counterpart (efficiency slightly exceeding 36%).

ID GENERAL-PRACTICE; AUSTRALIA; MEDICINE
AB Primary health care is the foundation of effective, sustainable population health and is associated with higher patient satisfaction and reduced aggregate health spending.
   Although improving patient care requires a sound evidence base, rigorously designed studies remain under-represented in primary care research.
   The pace of research activity in general practice and the rate and quality of publications do not match the pace of structural change or the level of funding provided.
   Recruitment difficulties are a major impediment, fuelled by general practitioners' time constraints, lack of remuneration, non-recognition, and workforce shortages.
   Radical reform is required to redress imbalances in funding allocation, including: funding of GP Research Network infrastructure costs; formalising relationships between primary care researchers and academic departments of general practice and rural health; and mandating that research funding bodies consider only proposals that include in the budget nominal payments for GP participation and salaries for dedicated research nurses.

AB Groundwater recharge is a key factor in water balance studies, especially in semi-arid areas. In India, the Groundwater Evaluation Committee recommends the use of the "water table rise method" to evaluate recharge. However, this method does not account for spatial variation of recharge, which can be very important especially in an agricultural area. We propose a simple methodology that incorporates the one-dimensional agro-hydrological model soil-water-atmosphere-plant (SWAP) in conjunction with data available from government agencies, integrated into a geographical information system, to assess the effect of land use and soil on groundwater budgets at the subwatershed scale. Simulation units (SU), homogeneous with respect to cropping system, irrigation and soil, are defined on the basis of field data. SWAP results indicate that under the conditions of the study area, recharge is more affected by soil type than by land use. However, the groundwater balance is more dependent on the amount of withdrawal than on the recharge rate. The model was tested in Bethamangala subwatershed where groundwater level data are available for a 21-year period. The outputs obtained from the SWAP model are used as boundary conditions for a simple one-dimensional groundwater model. The simulated groundwater heads are consistent with the observed trends, and the estimated recharge rate falls within the same range as the recharge rate estimated with the water table rise method. Results suggest that current agricultural practices, which induce a groundwater recharge of 70 mm/year, could be sustainable. However, scenarios involving an increase in irrigated area reduce simulated recharge. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Libya is considered as one of those countries having limited renewable water resources because most parts of the country are either semi-arid or arid. The consequent over-reliance on ground water for meeting the ever-increasing water demand has resulted in the excessive depletion of the fresh ground water stock. The situation is being exacerbated by the lack of adequate natural recharge to replenish the water withdrawn from the various aquifers. The study reported in this paper focused on the Murzuq basin located in southwest Libya. The basin provides domestic water and serves the Gadowa irrigation project. The continued water withdrawal from the aquifer system over the last three decades has resulted in significant lowering of the ground water table. In this study, data on water quality, quantity and ground water levels from several water wells serving the Gadowa irrigation project were analyzed, together with the historic water use patterns over the past twenty years at the Gadowa irrigation project. The result of the analysis shows that there is scope for significant improvement in the efficiency of water utilization, which if achieved should enhance the overall sustainability of ground water use in the Murzuq basin.

AB This study aims to estimate, identify and evaluate the biomass production options, estimate the sustainable biomass production for energy, and estimate the energy potential of biomass production in Turkey. Within the framework of sustainable development, Turkey today faces the challenge of balancing economic growth with environmental progress. Sustainable biomass production potential mainly depends on the productivity and surplus land available for biomass production. Based on the surplus land available for plantation, the plantation options and biomass productivity, the sustainable biomass potential for energy is estimated. Among the biomass energy sources, fuelwood seems to be one of the most interesting because its share of the total energy production of Turkey is high at 21%. The total biomass energy potential of Turkey is about 32 Mtoe. The amount of usable biomass potential of Turkey is approximately 17 Mtoe. The electrical production from usable biomass has a net impact of $4.4 billion in personal and corporate income and represented more than 160,000 jobs.

AB Hydropower is today the most important kind of renewable and sustainable energy. Resources of hydropower are widely spread around the world. Hydro energy is the most reliable and cost effective renewable energy source. It is obvious that among all the renewable energies, hydropower occupies the place in the world, and it will keep this place for many years to come. Hydroelectric energy is responsible worldwide for some 2600 TWh of electricity output per year, which means about 20% of the world's entire electricity demand, making it one of the most reliable and cost effective renewable energy sources. In 2001, the largest hydropower generating countries were Canada (333.0 TWh), the United States (201.2 TWh) and Norway (120.4 TWh). Hydroelectric power consumption in the EU grew by nearly 27% between 1991 and 2001. In 2001, hydro accounted for approximately 5% of total EU power consumption. France is the EU's largest producer of hydroelectricity. In 2001, generation capacity of hydropower was about 25,000 MW in France.

AB In the past 15 years corporations and governments have developed a growing appreciation of the need for sustainability. However, there is still little clarity on how to move toward the goal of sustainability or measure improvements. Not only are there currently few operational metrics by which to practically assess progress toward sustainability, there is also little understanding of how to judge the effectiveness of such metrics. This paper presents a pragmatic approach to developing - and evaluating - system-specific performance metrics for sustainability. Electronics recycling is used as a case problem in developing and judging the effectiveness of such metrics. Despite growing concerns about the handling of end-of-life electronics, data availability is inconsistent, and there is still limited understanding of the electronics-recycling system as a whole. To begin to address the need for practical quantitative methods to assess system performance, several indicators were developed and applied to three U. S. electronics-recycling operations. These metrics were assessed based on the developed criteria that effective measures be useful, robust, and feasible. Results show that the current measure of "mass percent to landfill" is not sufficient to assess system performance. Relevance-weighted mass indicators with varying data requirements can provide additional insights on resource efficiency.

AB Selective logging, fire suppression, forest succession and climatic changes have resulted in high fire hazards over large areas of the western USA. Federal and state hazardous fuel reduction programs have increased accordingly to reduce the risk, extent and severity of these events, particularly in the wildland-urban interface. In this study, we examined the effects of mechanical fuel reduction treatments on the activity of bark beetles in ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa Dougl ex. Laws., forests located in Arizona and California, USA. Treatments were applied in both late spring (April-May) and late summer (August-September) and included: (1) thinned biomass chipped and randomly dispersed within each 0.4 ha plot; (2) thinned biomass chipped, randomly dispersed within each plot and raked 2 m from the base of residual trees; (3) thinned biomass lopped-and-scattered (thinned trees cut into 1-2 m lengths) within each plot; (4) an untreated control. The mean percentage of residual trees attacked by bark beetles ranged from 2.0% (untreated control) to 30.2% (plots thinned in spring with all biomass chipped). A three-fold increase in the percentage of trees attacked by bark beetles was observed in chipped versus lopped-and-scattered plots. Bark beetle colonization of residual trees was higher during spring treatments, which corresponded with peak adult beetle flight periods as measured by funnel trap captures. Raking chips away from the base of residual trees did not significantly affect attack rates. Several bark beetle species were present including the round-headed pine beetle, Dendroctonus adjunctus Blandford (AZ), western pine beetle, D. brevicomis LeConte (AZ and CA), mountain pine beetle, D. ponderosae Hopkins (CA), red turpentine beetle, D. valens Leconte (AZ and CA), Arizona fivespined ips, Ips lecontei Swaine (AZ), California fivespined ips, I. paraconfusus Lanier (CA) and pine engraver, I. pini (Say) (AZ). Dendroctonus valens was the most common bark beetle infesting residual trees. A significant correlation was found between the number of trees chipped per plot and the percentage of residual trees with D. valens attacks. A significantly higher percentage of residual trees was attacked by D. brevicomis in plots that were chipped in spring compared to the untreated control. In lopped-and-scattered treatments, engraver beetles produced substantial broods in logging debris, but few attacks were observed on standing trees. At present, no significant difference in tree mortality exists among treatments. A few trees appeared to have died solely from D. valens attacks, as no other scolytids were observed in the upper bole. In a laboratory study conducted to provide an explanation for the bark beetle responses observed in this study, monoterpene elution rates from chip piles declined sharply over time, but were relatively constant in lopped-and-piled treatments. The quantities of beta-pinene, 3-carene, alpha-pinene and myrcene eluting from chips exceeded those from lopped-and-piled slash during each of 15 sample periods. These laboratory results may, in part, explain the bark beetle response observed in chipping treatments. The implications of these results to sustainable forest management are discussed.

AB Medicinal use of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) fruits in treating benign prostatic hypertrophy has driven a recent sharp increase in fruit harvesting. At the same time, saw palmetto often is considered a keystone species, serving as habitat or a food source for several hundred mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian and insect species. Due to harvesting pressure on this ecologically important, non-cultivated species, land management practices that produce environmentally sustainable harvests are needed. As part of research focusing on use of controlled burning as a management tool, we investigated effects of burning season and frequency on saw palmetto flowering and fruiting in 32 pine flatwoods sites in central and southwest Florida from 1997 to 1999. The study was conducted as two repeated measures experiments, each involving 16 sites. Each experiment included two among-subjects factors - burning season and past burning frequency - and one within-subjects factor -year- with four replications of each treatment combination. For both experiments, growing season (i.e., April-July) burns had high flowering levels the first year after burning (mean proportion of saw palmettos flowering = 0.49, n = 16 sites), but decreased the second year after burning (mean proportion flowering = 0.15, n = 16 sites), while winter (i.e., November-February) burns had intermediate levels of flowering during both the first and second years after burning (mean proportions flowering = 0.21 and 0.28 for first and second years after burning, n = 16 sites). Although most flowering occurred during April and May, flowering occurred 2-5 months after winter burns, but did not occur until 9-12 months after growing season burns. During the 1997-1998 experiment, fruit infection by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides caused a fruiting failure in all sites. During the 1998-1999 experiment, fruit yields were higher in growing season burns only in infrequently burned (i.e., burned less often than every 5 years) sites, and only in 1998 (mean fruit yields = 325 kg/ha and 0.25 kg/ha for growing season, infrequently burned sites and winter, infrequently burned sites; n = 4 sites in each group). Frequently burned (i.e., burned every 2-3 years) sites generally had low fruit yields (mean fruit yields = 163 kg/ha and 242 kg/ha for frequently burned sites in 1998 and 1999; n = 8 sites). Although controlled burning can be an effective management tool in producing economically sustainable saw palmetto fruit harvests, land managers also must consider ecological needs of other plant and animal species when planning environmentally sustainable burning regimes.

AB The aim of our study was to characterize the structure and regeneration dynamics of dominant tree species along altitudinal gradient in dry valley slopes of the Bhutan Himalaya. In the typical dry valley slopes of west-central Bhutan, we analyzed forest stratification, tree crown projection, and population structure from lower dry valley bottom (1520 m a.s.l.) to upper humid ridge top (3370 m a.s.l.) across five major forest types: i.e. (1) dry pine forest with Pinus roxburghii as a dominant species; (2) mixed broad-leaved forest with Quercus lanata (evergreen), Quercus griffithii, (deciduous), and Rhododendron arboreum (evergreen) as major canopy species; (3) evergreen broad-leaved forest dominated by Quercus semecarpifolia, Quercus glauca and Quercus oxyodon; (4) cool conifer forest dominated by Abies densa and Tsuga dumosa; (5) cold conifer forest with A. densa and Juniperus recurva as dominants. In general, regeneration pattern of major dominant species shifted from inverse-J (lower altitudes), to sporadic (mid-altitudes), and to uni-modal type (upper altitudes) corresponding to three regeneration trends: (1) invasive at the lower, warm, dry forest under relatively strong human disturbances; (2) stable/balanced at the mid-altitude, in a relatively stable, mature moist evergreen broad-leaved forest with gap regeneration; and (3) poor/low regeneration at the upper, cool, humid conifer forest with a continuously cattle-grazed understory. Overall, regeneration patterns were balanced in all forest types, however care should be taken to prevent excessive exploitation of dry pine forest of lower valley bottom, and to control cattle grazing at higher altitudes. Our findings can be incorporated into management plans for sustainable management and conservation of mountain forests. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Inverted wells, in which the solid casing extends over the full depth of the permeable aquifer, but with slotted screens projecting upwards alongside the solid casing, can provide high yields in moderately transmissive aquifers for which all permeable strata are within about 30 m of the non-pumping water level. The use of inverted wells has been pioneered in the Rajshahi Barind in northwest Bangladesh. Conceptual and computational models of inverted wells are developed. By examining a step-pumping test using a numerical model, the important flow processes are identified and quantified. The sustainability, of the substantial groundwater abstraction in the Rajshahi Barind is examined by considering the recharge processes which depend on losses from flooded rice fields, the hydraulic conductivity of the overlying Barind Clay and the seasonal recovery of observation well water levels.

AB The need for economic analysis for the design and implementation of efficient water resources management policies is well documented in the economics literature. This need is also emphasised in the European Union's recent Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), and is relevant to the objectives of Euro-limpacs, an EU funded project which inter alia, aims to provide a decision-support system for valuing the effects of future global change on Europe's freshwater ecosystems. The purpose of this paper is to define the role of economic valuation techniques in assisting in the design of efficient, equitable and sustainable policies for water resources management in the face of environmental problems such as pollution, intensive land use in agriculture and climate change. The paper begins with a discussion of the conceptual economic framework that can be used to inform water policy-making. An inventory of the available economic valuation methods is presented and the scope and suitability of each for studying various aspects of water resources are critically discussed. Recent studies that apply these methods to water resources are reviewed. Finally, an application of one of the economic valuation methods, namely the contingent valuation method, is presented using a case study of the Cheimaditida wetland in Greece. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Daily startup and shutdown (DSS) operations using several purge gases were applied for Ni-loaded Mg(Al)O periclase catalyst to test the sustainability in steam reforming of CH4. Thirteen wt% Ni loaded Mg(Al)O catalysts were prepared by using Mg(Ni)-Al hydrotalcite as the precursor with varying Mg/Al ratios. H2O/N-2 (100/25 ml min(-1)), O-2/N-2 (40/10 ml min(-1)) and CO2/H2O/N-2 (40/15/25 ml min(-1)) were tested as the purge gas in imitation of steam, air and spent gas, respectively. Use of air as the purge gas resulted in a quick deactivation of all Ni loaded catalysts due to the oxidation of Ni metal on the catalyst surface. Spent gas was the most inert for the DSS operation causing no significant deactivation of Ni loaded catalysts. Steam, the most convenient purge gas for DSS operation of PEFC, revealed evident deactivation depending on the (Mg + Ni)/Al ratio in Ni/Mg(Al)O catalysts; use of the (Mg + Ni)/Al ratio of 3/1 resulted in a quick deactivation with steam purge, although this ratio was the most profitable for the steady state operation with the Ni/Mg(Al)O catalysts. The most stable operation was achieved with the ratio of 6/1 in steam as the purge gas. The deactivation took place mainly by the oxidation of Ni metal by steam as the purge gas during the DSS operation between 200 and 700 degrees C. It is likely that Mg(Al)O on the Ni/Mg(Al)O catalysts was hydrated by steam to form Mg(OH)(2) on the catalyst surface, resulting in the oxidation of Ni metal finely dispersed on Mg(Al)O periclase.

AB In the Indian Central Himalaya, indigenous knowledge is an important natural resource that has enormous potential to facilitate the development process in cost-effective and sustainable ways. It governs almost all important productive resource sectors and revolves around traditional values of resource use. In this study, covering nineteen settlements and as many as 500 respondents drawn equally from both sexes, an effort was made to understand the indigenous knowledge of both sexes through documentation of indigenous system of medicine and health-care practices. The study revealed that women are the real custodians of the indigenous knowledge system, as 52% of them have knowledge on thirty practices against that of 26% for males.

AB The objective of this study is to measure and evaluate the interactions among various variables in the complex urban ecosystem (CUE), through employing an equilibrium model, a metabolism model and a harmonious development model. Based on a theory of the complex urban ecosystem (including society economy and nature) with metabolic function, a system of indicators is developed for evaluating urban ecosystem, through using factor analysis (FA), the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and a synthetic index. The urban metabolism model and the urban harmonious development model are constructed and then are employed to measure and evaluate the interactions among various variables for Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chongqing, and Shenzhen. The urban metabolism model illustrates how the conversion of resources into useful products and wastes is similar to human metabolic processes or those of an ecosystem, and accounts for how the basic metabolic concept has been extended to include the livability of the CUE from a human perspective so that the socioeconomic aspects of sustainability are integrated with the environmental aspects. This means that the best way to reduce the impacts of socioeconomic development would be reduction of the resource inputs. On the other hand, the sustainability of development of a city is not only simply reduction of the metabolic flows (resource inputs and waste outputs), but also increase of the livability of the city, measured here by the recycling degree. There are two potential ways to purify the metabolites produced by the CUE: (1) reclamation of wastes, (2) making wastes harmless for the natural ecosystem. The harmonious development model presents the urban developmental trends by the developmental degree and the harmonious degree in response to the relationships between development pressure and carrying capacity in CUE. This model shows that the socioeconomic development pressure and the carrying capacity of the natural ecosystem are competing processes, and that ecological improvement is most possible when the socioeconomic development pressures are small and the carrying capacity of the natural ecosystem is large. At last some conclusions drew about the recycling degree, developmental degree, and the harmonious degree in six Chinese cities show that the key factors of urban sustainable development are the decrease of socioeconomic development pressure, the protection of natural ecosystem, and the raising of urban metabolism function. To reach such goals, each city must strengthen its potential for sustainable development, and must consider the recycling degree and the harmonious degree to define the break-even point for improving the health and livability of CUE.

AB Prediction of nitrate leaching from cropland is crucial for preventing surface or ground water degradation. Accurate modeling of nitrate leaching requires simulations of both soil hydrological and biogeochemical processes. This paper reports an attempt to improve an existing biogeochemical model, Denitrification-Decomposition or DNDC, for estimation of nitrate leaching from crop fields with tile drainage system. DNDC was equipped with detailed biogeochemical processes of nitrogen turnover but a simple module for one-dimensional movement of soil water. Observations from nine drainage tiles with three different fertilizer treatments in 4 years (1996-1999) at an experimental field in Iowa were used for model modifications. Preliminary comparisons with observed tile discharge flow indicated that the original DNDC lacked the water leaching recession character. To correct this deviation, new water retention features were added to DNDC by: (1) adopting a recession curve to regulate the gravity drainage flow in the explicitly simulated soil profile (0-50 cm) and (2) introducing a virtual water pool for the space between the bottom of the modeled soil profile (50 cm) and the tile lines depth of placement (145 cm) to control the tile discharge flow. With these modifications, model prediction of water leaching fluxes from the tile drainage lines was improved. An adsorbed N pool was created in DNDC to simulate the buffering effect of soil on the amount of nitrate available for leaching. The Langmuir equation was adopted to simulate adsorption and desorption of ammonium ions on the soil absorbents. This modification enhanced the model capacity for simulating free ammonium dynamics, nitrification, and nitrate leaching. Sensitivity tests of the modified DNDC showed that the modeled impact of differences of precipitation, soil texture, soil organic carbon content, and fertilizer application rates on nitrate leaching rates were consistent with observations reported by other researchers. This study indicated that a biogeochemical model with limited modifications in hydrology could serve nitrate leaching prediction and be useful for sustainable agricultural management.

AB Urbanization brings many changes in urban land-cover composition. It generates the need to quantify the effect of increasing population on urban environmental quality that can draw together the relationship related to various land covers. The present scenario of urbanization in India poses challenges for sustainable development, which requires scientific vision about the existing scenario and relationship among various factors for careful planning. In this research, an attempt was made to understand the physical interrelationship of man-made as well as natural environment at the micro level of Dehra Dun urban area using IKONOS satellite imagery. A detailed study was carried out on representative wards of different characteristics within Dehra Dun Municipal Corporation. For this purpose, six wards were selected considering various parameters including type of development (old/new), population density and land use. On the basis of surface functional characteristics, land-cover composition was classified under man-made hard surface, green cover and soft surfaces including playgrounds, lawns, barren land, etc. The results showed that the proportion of various surfaces is similar in different wards of varied densities. The ratio of area under soft surfaces is about 50% and green cover is about 25% of the hard surfaces. An accurate characterization of the surfaces allows reliable relationships to be established and increased understanding of land-cover composition at the micro level, which provides scientific support and visualization for the sustainable development of the city.

AB Recently there has been a move towards environmentally conscious manufacturing with an emphasis on life-cycle assessment. The intention is that life-cycle assessment be integrated into a holistic or systemic approach to product design. Such an approach allows consideration of the total energy expended, the resources used, and the waste created. Hence, enabling the entire environmental impact to be determined and minimised. Hadley Industries PLC [1] is a master in utilising the cold roll forming process to produce an increasingly wide range of products. The question considered in this paper is how a cold roll forming company mid-way along the value adding chain, a sub-contractor, not involved in final product designs and hence product life-cycle assessments can ensure they are a sustainable and environmentally conscious manufacturer.

AB This paper aims to share the field application experience related to the development of an innovative stand-alone sustainable energy system known as the PURE project. The PURE project has been developed alongside a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) scheme, which is supported by the UK Department of Trade and Industry and executed by siGEN in collaboration with The Robert Gordon University. The system has been constructed within an industrial estate on the island of Unst in Shetland, 200 miles north of the Scottish mainland. The energy system now supplies five business properties with clean reliable power and utilises wind turbine and hydrogen technology to provide a sustainable energy source.
   The stored hydrogen gas generated by the system is used as an energy source for periods when electrical demand within the business properties exceeds wind turbine production. The hydrogen is also utilised as a fuel source for transportation and as a transportable energy source for mobile power generation.
   The paper therefore gives a detailed description of the PURE project and discusses the field experience accumulated during the development and installation of the system. It also shares a number of practical issues that had to be overcome during its integration and operation. The installation of the PURE project has resulted in a number of unexpected conclusions being identified and marks a significant step forward in the accessible deployment of this technology for community use.

AB An In-Space Cryogenic Propellant Depot (ISCPD) is an important stepping stone to provide the capability to preposition, store, manufacture, and later use the propellants for Earth-neighborhood campaigns and beyond. An in-space propellant depot will provide affordable propellants and other similar consumables to support the development of sustainable and affordable exploration strategies as well as commercial space activities. An in-space propellant depot not only requires technology development in key areas such as zero boil-off storage and fluid transfer, but in other areas such as lightweight structures, highly reliable connectors, and autonomous operations. These technologies can be applicable to a broad range of propellant depot concepts or specific to a certain design. In addition, these technologies are required for spacecraft and orbit transfer vehicle propulsion and power systems, and space life support. Generally, applications of this technology require long-term storage, on-orbit fluid transfer and supply, cryogenic propellant production from water, unique instrumentation and autonomous operations.
   This paper discusses the reasons why such advances are important to future affordable and sustainable operations in space. This paper also discusses briefly R&D objectives comprising a promising approach to the systems planning and evolution into a meaningful stepping stone design, development, and implementation of an ISCPD. The success of a well-planned and orchestrated approach holds great promise for achieving innovation and revolutionary technology development for supporting future exploration and development of space.

AB Among other approaches, space technologies are currently being deployed for disaster management, environmental monitoring, urban planning, health applications, communications, etc. Although space-based applications have tremendous potential for socioeconomic development, they are primarily technology driven and the requirements from the end-users (i.e. the development community) are rarely taken into consideration during the initial development stages.
   This communication gap between the "space" and "development" communities can be bridged with the help of the web-based knowledge sharing portal focused on space applications for development. This online community uses the development gateway foundation's sophisticated content management system. It is modeled after the development gateway's knowledge sharing portals (http://topics.developmentgateway.org) and draws from their expertise in knowledge management, partnership building and marketing. These types of portal are known to facilitate broad-based partnerships across sectors, regions and the various stakeholders but also to facilitate North-South and South-South cooperation.
   This paper describes the initiative "Space for Development" (http://topics.developmentgateway.org/space) started in 2004 which aims to demonstrate how such a web-based portal can be structured to facilitate knowledge sharing in order to bridge the gap between the "space" and "development" communities in an innovative and global manner.

AB As societies worldwide struggle to address what policy analysts call "wicked problems" such as world hunger; malnutrition, and ecological sustainability, analysts from a variety, of perspectives have questioned the administrative state's abilities to deal with them. Ascendant since the early 1990s as a prescription for remedying these shortcomings is a market, technocratic, and non-deliberative theory of administration that some have called "neo-managerialism" and others the "managerialist ideology." This study uses European attitudes toward promoting tire use of genetically modified (GM) foods (is a "policy window" for exploring how well or ill-suited the neo-managerialist philosophy informing the U.S. government's promotional campaign was with the factors driving European opposition to GM foods. Causal modeling of the "calculus of dissent" that led to a the European Union (EU) moratorium on GM foods suggests that deliberative (rather than neo-managerialist) theories of administration are better suited for the "collective puzzlement of society" that wicked problems require.

ID COUNTRIES
AB The South Korean National Pension scheme was instituted in 1988 and now covers all private-sector employees and the self-employed. Since the financial crisis Of 1997, however, it has become controversial and is under considerable pressure, not least because of the perceived financial implications of the country's rapidly ageing population. Predictions of financial shortfalls or 'unsustainability' have prompted calls for severe 'downsizing' of the scheme. The debate on the reform of the scheme has been dominated by the need to respond to demographic change in ways that assist the national economy, invariably by reducing social expenditure. The debate, however, has given little attention to the social or welfare functions of the pension scheme, though the material insecurity of older people has been exacerbated by major changes in the labour market and the family. This paper details recent socio-demographic changes in Korea and discusses their implications for old-age security and pension reform. It argues that public-pension schemes should be developed to strengthen social protection against the insecurities of old-age, that intra-generational redistribution should be at the core of the reformed arrangements, and that the introduction of a comprehensive non-contributory pension scheme should be seriously considered.

AB Emergy analysis was used to analyze three agricultural systems to compare and contrast resource use, productivity, environmental impact, and overall sustainability. Emergy analysis was appropriate for this task because of its ability to transform different types of inputs to a common form (solar energy equivalents) to allow meaningful comparisons across the three systems. The systems analyzed were conventional corn (Zea mays L.) production in Kansas, USA, blackberry (Rubus rubus Watson) production in Ohio, USA, and a Lacandon polycultural rotation system in Chiapas, Mexico. Despite these different systems and diverse inputs, emergy allowed the quantification and comparison of flows for each system on a common basis. This allowed system-level conclusions and demonstrated the utility of emergy analysis when evaluating agricultural systems. The greatest inputs of emergy across the three systems were for fertilization and irrigation of the corn system. These two inputs accounted for 95% of the purchased emergy input to the corn system. The indigenous system was most reliant on renewable resources, and therefore, had the lowest level of environmental loading. The sustainability index for the three systems ranged from 0.06 for the corn system, to 0.65 for the blackberry system, to 115.98 for the indigenous system. The respective energy and emergy yield for each system were 2.6E9 J ha(-1) year(-1) and 3.57E15 sej ha-1 year(-1) for the indigenous system, 3.71E10 J ha(-1) year(-1) and 8.59E15 sej ha(-1) year(-1) for the blackberry system, and 1.40E11 J ha(-1) year(-1) and 1.30E16 sej ha(-1) year(-1) for the corn system. While the indigenous system has the highest level of sustainability, its energy yield was 14 times less than the blackberry system, and 53 times less than the corn system. The results confirm the need for food production systems with large yields that are more dependent on renewable energies. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents an ecological analysis of Chinese agriculture for the period from 1980 to 2000, on the basis of Odum's well-known concept of emergy in ecological economy. Emergy analysis methods are explained, illustrated and used to diagram the agro-ecosystem, to evaluate environmental and economic inputs and harvested yield, and to assess the sustainability of the Chinese agriculture as a whole. Detailed structure of the input/output and system indicators are examined from a historical perspective for the contemporary Chinese agriculture in the latest two decades after China's Reform and Open in the late 1980s. Temporal variation of indices such as increasing environmental load ratio (ELR), decreasing emergy self-support ratio (ESR) and decreasing emergy yield ratio (EYR) illustrate a weakening sustainability of the Chinese agro-ecosystem characteristic of profound transition from a self-supporting tradition to a modem industry based on non-renewable resource consumption.

TI Intensification and diversification of New Zealand agriculture since
   1960: An evaluation of current indicators of land use change
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT

DT Article

ID ABUNDANCE; TRENDS
AB Previous studies of New Zealand's environmental and agricultural history have provided a broad-brush characterisation of land use change that potentially misses pivotal fluctuations in land use policy and practice that would inform us of key drivers of ongoing agricultural land use change. Of particular interest to policy makers is the period after the end of agriculture's 'long boom' in the late 1970s, when a dramatic change in economic policy occurred and farming subsidies were removed. A review and principal components analysis of 35 New Zealand agricultural statistics from the past 40 years identified two main patterns of change in land use, production, and farm inputs. One set of variables, which explained 49% of the variation, indicates an overarching, strong and steady trend for agricultural intensification and to a lesser extent diversification, as indicated by (a) increasing stocking rates and yields, (b) increased farm fertiliser, pesticide and food stock inputs, (c) conversion to more intensive forms of agriculture, and (d) diversification into forestry and deer farming. A second group of variables, which explained 22% of overall variation, inflects around 1982/1983, the time of a major shift in agri-economic policy that removed farm subsidies. The second group of changes included some contraction in agriculture (especially in sheep farming) and its associated inputs and a decline in rural population. There is evidence of acceleration in intensification and diversification in the past decade and for slowing in the contraction of the second set of variables between 1997 and 2001. The drivers of these changes are poorly understood and their impacts on biodiversity conservation in farmed landscapes cannot be discerned from the national indicators currently being monitored. The accelerating agricultural intensification over the past 40 years raises concern about whether New Zealand farming is broadly ecologically sustainable now, and especially whether it could remain so in future.

AB Microbiological soil-quality indicators, especially related to C and N cycles, and microbial diversity may be useful tools to determine whether a particular environment responds to an imposed management or reclamation strategy. External influences such as forest clearance and soil management affect biological indicators making them useful to point out whether the land use strategy is sustainable. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to assess the utility of some soil chemical and microbiological properties and 16S rDNA diversity in bacteria domain and their significance as soil-quality indicators in different land use systems in southern Brazil, Parana State. Nine sites with soil originated from basalt (Rhodic Ferralsol), previously covered with the Atlantic native forest were evaluated: a native forest tract as reference; three sites artificially reforested with native species, but with understory differently managed; secondary forest naturally regenerated from abandoned pasture; artificially reforested with eucalyptus; two wheat-cropped sites at differing vegetative stages; one site in fallow. Twenty-four chemical and microbiological properties and their derivatives were assessed, in addition to molecular diversity of bacteria domain based on denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Amongst all variables, the most dissimilar along the sites were total organic C, microbial biomass C and N, and ammonification rate. Total organic C was highest in the native forest, followed by secondary forest, eucalyptus and the artificially reforested sites; the wheat-cropped and fallow sites produced the lowest values. This trend was also observed for ammonification rate, which was closely correlated to organic C. Microbial biomass C and N were also higher in the reforested sites, whereas for microbial N biomass, the eucalyptus site resembled to the wheat-cropped and fallow sites. The DGGE analysis revealed that the fallow, eucalyptus and wheat-cropped sites had less bacterial diversity. All the sites reforested with native species grouped with the native forest, while the eucalyptus, fallow and wheat-cropped sites formed separate clusters. A similar clustering pattern was observed when all chemical and microbiological properties were considered in a grouping analysis. The results for reforestation employing native species tended to be similar to those of the stable native forest, while the use of an exotic species (eucalyptus) tended to be similar to those of the cropped sites. In addition, the fallow site showed general unfavorable trends in microbiological indicators and less bacterial diversity, suggesting that such soil management is not sustainable at least in subtropical areas. In this case, would be preferable provide the soil with vegetal covering that increase the organic C inputs and consequently microbial diversity and activity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Multipurpose trees, the integral components of homegardens, contribute significantly to the closed nutrient cycling processes and sustainability of the ecosystem. Although, the litter production and probable nutrient returns via litter in homegardens have been documented, quantification and characterization of the decomposition and bioelement release from the litter have received relatively little scientific attention. The objective of the present study is to explore the litter dynamics of six locally important multipurpose trees (Mangifera indica L., Artocarpus heterophyllus Lamk., Anacardium occidentale L., Ailanthus triphysa Dennst., Artocarpus hirsutus L. and Swietenia macrophylla L.), in an agroforestry homegarden in Southern Kerala, India. Litterfall and nutrient additions in the six species ranged from 383 to 868 g m(-2) yr(-1), nitrogen, 6.4 to 8.8, phosphorus, 0.17 to 0.42 and potassium, 1.1 to 2.8 g m(-2) yr(-1). The annual litter output in the homegarden was 425 kg with A. hirsutus, M. indica, A. heterophyllus and A. occidentale recording significantly higher litter and nutrient additions. Leaf litter decay studies revealed A. heterophyllus and A. occidentale to be the most labile litter species and S. macrophylla the most recalcitrant. The decay rate coefficients varied significantly among the species. Foliage decomposition rates related to the initial chemical composition of the litter revealed best correlation with lignin. NPK release was almost complete by the end of decay in all species inspite of the initial phases of accumulation observed for nitrogen and phosphorus. Two-way analysis of variance test revealed significant differences in the contents of the three elements as a function of species and time elapsed. Macronutrients were released in the order K > N/P. The higher rates of decay and nutrient turnover in M. indica, A. heterophyllus and A. occidentale foliage indicated the potential of using these species' litter as nutrient inputs in agriculture while A. triphysa, A. hirsutus and S. macrophylla perform better as organic mulches taking a longer time for decay and hence nutrient release.

AB It is possible that current tree domestication practices undertaken by farmers reduce the genetic base of tree resources on farms, raising concerns regarding the productivity, sustainability and conservation value of agroforestry ecosystems. Here, we assessed possible changes in genetic variation during domestication in the important and heavily utilised timber species, Vitex fischeri Gurke (syn. Vitex keniensis), by comparing geographically proximate forest and farm material in central Kenya. Employing RAPD analysis, a total of 104 polymorphic markers revealed by five arbitrary primers were scored in a total of 65 individuals, 32 from forest and 33 from farmland. Despite concerns of possible genetic erosion, forest and farm stands did not differ significantly in levels of genetic variation, with H values of 0.278 and 0.269, respectively. However, Mantel tests did reveal greater geographically related associative genetic structure among individuals in farm rather than forest material, with r(M) values of 0.217 and 0.114, respectively. A more detailed analysis of structure suggested this could be due to local variation in origin of some on-farm trees. Implications of data for the genetic management of V. fischeri stands during farmer-led tree domestication activities are discussed. At present, there appears little reason to reject on-farm V. fischeri as a source of germplasm for future on-farm planting or for conservation purposes, although this situation may change and will require monitoring.

AB Wood ash production is increasing due to the increasing use of wood as a sustainable fuel. Wood ash can be recycled in crop soils as a source of nutrients and as a liming agent to correct soil acidity. However, the effect of wood ash on soil quality is poorly known. Here we studied the effect of addition of wood ash at 5 and 20 t ha(-1) on microbial and biochemical properties in samples from the 0-30 cm surface of three neutral and two alkaline agricultural soils. The samples were incubated for one year at 25 C and 60% water-holding capacity. The soil microbiological biomass (microbial biomass C and N), general microbial activity using fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, and alkaline phosphatase, arylsulphatase, catalase and o-diphenoloxidase activities were determined periodically together with pH and electrical conductivity. Increases in microbial biomass C and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis occurred at the lower wood-ash dose, whereas microbial biomass C decreased at the higher wood-ash dose over the entire period, and the fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis after 4 months. The microbial C/N ratios of treated samples were significantly different with respect to that of the control, suggesting changes in the structure of the microbial communities. The changes in microbial biomass and microbial activity were related to the increases in pH, which induce the development of bacteria to the detriment of fungi, to the electrical conductivity, and to the nutrient levels after wood-ash addition. Alkaline phosphatase and arylsulphatase activities were weakly inhibited at 20 t ha(-1), and catalase activity was stimulated in the neutral samples and inhibited in the alkaline samples. The highest o-diphenoloxidase activity observed throughout in all of the treated samples may suggest a decrease in the mineralisation process. Our findings reveal that the soil biochemical parameters investigated are significantly affected only in some cases at 20 t ha - 1, suggesting that a treatment exceeding 5 t ha(-1) is not recommended until the agro-chemical and physical functions of the soil are further studied.

AB Mycorrhizal inoculation is a promising, sustainable technique to enhance plant growth. We evaluated the effects of mycorrhizal inoculation and of the use of two substrates, soil and peat, on the growth of wild cherry, Prunus avium L., on the weaning and post-weaning. After weaning, plants were grown for 13 weeks in a greenhouse on either 40% soil or 40% peat at two levels of fertiliser: 2 or 4 g m(-3) of a 16:9:12 slow-release fertiliser. They were subsequently kept for a further 120 days in a frost-free greenhouse before outplanting to the field. The results show that enhanced plant growth after seven months in the field was associated with increased peat and fertiliser levels in the substrates during the post-weaning growth phase, and with prior mycorrhizal inoculation by a G. deserticola isolate, which compensated for less favourable substrate conditions. Plants inoculated with G. intraradices had more branches positioned in the lower half of the stem, while plants inoculated with G. deserticola had more branches in the upper half of the stem.

AB In sustainable agriculture, adaptation of swards to grazing is a major issue for breeding forage grass cultivars. Understanding the relationships between sward traits and animal production under grazing could help to identify criteria for selection. Intake is the major limiting factor for animal production under grazing. In this paper, short-term intake rate by grazing dairy cows (Bos taurus) is compared between eight diploid perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) populations. Four replicates per population were measured over four periods (April and May 2001, and April and October 2002) in two experiments per period, that is, intermediate- and late-maturity groups. For each period, sward structure was characterized by tiller density, leaf blade and sheath lengths, and green leaf and total dry matter (DM) yield, while nutritive value was characterized by in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), percent of DM, N, water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC), and neutral-detergent fiber (NDF) contents. For the late-maturity populations, the population with the shortest leaves had a lower fresh matter intake rate (10.5 kg h(-1)) than the three others (12, 12, and 11.6 kg h(-1), respectively). For the intermediate-maturity populations, differences in intake rates among populations were significant (P = 0.06) for all periods and were highly significant (P < 0.0004) in April 2002. In this period, 49% of the variation in fresh matter intake rate could be explained by blade length. In conclusion, differences in short-term intake rate between populations of diploid perennial ryegrass are highlighted. In both maturity groups, blade length appears to be an important factor explaining these differences.

AB Geographic assessments indicate that the selection of produce in local supermarkets varies by both area-level income and racial composition. These differences make it particularly difficult for low-income African American families to make healthy dietary choices. The Garden of Eden produce market was created to improve access to high-quality, affordable produce for these communities.
   The Garden of Eden is housed in a church in an economically depressed African American community in St Louis, Mo, that has less access to fresh produce than surrounding communities. All staff are from the community and are paid a living wage. The market is run with an eye toward sustainability, with partners from academia, a local faith-based community organization, businesses, and community members collaborating to make all program decisions.

ID HEALTH; TRIAL
AB Background: The Inner-City Asthma Intervention was a national, multicenter implementation of an evidence-based intervention to reduce asthma morbidity in inner-city children that was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Funding was initially planned for 4 years beginning in April 2001, but because of budgetary changes funding ceased in September 2004, 6 months before the original plan. Some sites were able to sustain their asthma program when the funding ended and others were not.
   Objective: To compare characteristics of sites that were able to sustain their asthma program after the original funding ended with those that were not.
   Methods: Data were collected from the project manager at each site in an electronic survey and through telephone interview in November 2003 and August 2005. Using contingency tables, we examined the bivariate relationship between each proposed factor and our outcome measure, secured funding.
   Results: Of the 18 sites that completed the survey, 50% reported continued funding. All sustainable sites received funding from multiple sources, including either the hospital or the community. One site received federal funding and one site received state funding. Of the sites that presented data to multiple funders, 6 of 9 were sustained (P =.05).
   Conclusions: Sustainable programs were more likely to be funded locally. Programs that used an evaluative process, including patient outcomes data, to demonstrate the importance of the program to their institution and community were more likely to obtain continued funding compared with those that did not.

AB The literature on subjective well-being has focused primarily on the developed economies. The authors provide empirical evidence from a developing country, Peru. Their results-and in particular a strong negative skew in the assessments of the respondents with the greatest income gains-support the importance of relative rather than absolute income differences. Among other factors, they attribute their results to shifts in reference norms and to macroeconomic volatility. Relative differences seem to matter more for those in the middle of the distribution than for the very wealthy or the very poor. Respondents were more critical in assessing their progress vis-a-vis others in their country versus those in their community. The frustrations that the authors find among the upwardly mobile may have implications for the future economic and political behavior of a group that is critical to the sustainability of market policies.

AB Promoting sustainable economic growth with social inclusion represents a challenge for Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the former metalworker and leader of the socialist Workers' Party, who won the Brazilian presidency his fourth try. The election of Lula has raised expectations at home and abroad. Although the government scored impressive fiscal victories by following ultra-orthodox macroeconomic policies, its performance in achieving economic growth and social improvement has been less than brilliant. Written in February 2004 to assess his first year in office, this article examines the challenges that Lula initially had to overcome and outlines the main points of his political economy. By the end of the first year, few great changes had taken place, except perhaps in his political party's manner of governing. Early in Lula's presidency, his policies were quite similar to those of earlier governments.

AB Densely populated and intensively cropped, the subtropical highlands of the world have severe agricultural sustainability problems resulting from soil erosion and fertility decline. In 1991, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) initiated a long-term field experiment with zero tillage under rainfed conditions at its semi-arid highland experiment station in Mexico (2240 m asl; 19.31 degrees N, 98.50 degrees W; Cumulic Phaeozem) to evaluate the effects of tillage, residue management, and rotation on maize and wheat production. Long-term effects on root rot and nematode populations - and their possible detrimental effects on yield - were monitored from 1998 to 2003 to evaluate the sustainability of the cropping system. In general, wheat showed less root rot incidence than maize. Crop residue retention reduced the numbers of the nematode Pratylenchus thornei in both crops, as did zero tillage compared with conventional tillage. Conventional tillage with continuous maize and residue removal, the common farmer practice in this region, reduced yield and dramatically increased R thornei. Zero tillage with residue removal resulted in low values for yield, root rot, and nematode populations, especially under maize monoculture. Under zero tillage and residue retention, root rot incidence in maize was moderate, parasitic nematode numbers were low, and yield was highest compared to alternative practices. In wheat, the highest yields were observed under zero tillage and residue retention, with intermediate root rot incidence. Zero tillage with rotation and residue retention enhanced water availability, soil structure, and nutrient availability more than conventional tillage. Microbial life diversity increased under zero tillage and residue retention, which may useful for biological control and integrated pest management. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the economic impact of the invasion of a scallop fishery by an exotic shellfish that was accidentally imported some decades ago. The invasive alien species, a slipper-limpet, Crepidula fornicata, is a space competitor for local scallops, and its spread threatens the sustainability of the ongoing scallop restocking program. Facing this invasion, the local fisheries committee has initiated a containment project intending to make the restocking program consistent with the exotic species presence in the fishery. The issue is complicated by the occurrence of occasional toxic micro-algae blooms affecting the scallop fishery. The paper presents a model dealing with the economic impact of the invasive process, and a methodology for cost-benefit analysis of invasion management. According to numerical simulation, the invasion is a serious threat to the economic viability of the restocking program, and invasion management would help maintaining the long term sustainability of the fishery. Sensitivity tests highlight the importance of long term equilibrium scallop catches on the program result, depending on scallop farming technical performance and ecosystem disturbance.

AB Military sociologists have attempted to explain how military institutions develop and maintain high levels of social cohesion. They have focused primarily on how the personal and intimate social interactions between soldiers produce bonds of comradeship. This comradeship is taken as the basis of social cohesion. Although sustainable, there is an unfortunate bias in the work of military sociologists. They focus almost exclusively on informal rituals in which personal bonds are forged. In fact, the decisive rituals that bind military groups together are the formal processes of training. Drawing on ethnographic analysis of the British armed forces and the Royal Marines, in particular, this article attempts to redress the balance. It examines the drills-above all, the communication drills-that British troops are collectively trained to perform and claims that these constitute the key social rituals for the British military. On the basis of this analysis, an alternative account of comradeship is proposed.

AB Liberals have clear ideas about the relations between the economy and the environment. Good ecology is also long-term economy, and there is no contradiction between the economy and the environment. New technologies, more investments into research, cooperation with industry and the public are required to bring about a new environmental policy in Germany.
   Energy policy needs a new beginning free from ideology. This is elaborated in 7 theses:
   The key to successful economic development, more growth and employment is to be found in sustainable energy supply.
   The 3 guiding principles of sustainable energy supply are
   (1) economic soundness, (2) continuity of supply, (3) environmental compatibility.
   The supply situation is the more secure, the richer the energy mix, and the more sources from all over the world are used.
   Taxes, levies, and costs due to shifting are a burden on energy prices and endanger the economic viability of energy supply.
   We need a sensible energy mix composed of fossil energy resources, nuclear power, and renewable energies.
   A rich energy mix combined with a powerful expansion of renewables, more measures to improve efficiency and save energy make Germany less dependent on international raw material purchases.
   Climate change is a reality. Enhancing research and development efforts is our response.

AB The paper summarizes a framework for a systematic comparative evaluation of the sustainability of energy systems and includes a comprehensive application of this framework to major electricity generating technologies and the associated fuel cycles in Germany. Main efforts have focussed on the generation of quantitative, technology-specific, economic, environmental and social indicators. A number of methods have been employed, including Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Risk Assessment (RA), and the Impact Pathway Approach (IPA). Two methods of indicator aggregation were used: namely, the estimation of total (internal and external) costs, and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). Use of MCDA is motivated principally by the acknowledgement of the role of value judgments in decision-making.

AB River catchments have been the dominant form of regionalisation for natural-resource management in many countries since the 1980s. Local governments play a considerable role in planning with ever-increasing responsibilities for sustainable environmental management, planning and development controls. There has also been an increasing emphasis on community participation in resource management, which emphasises the need to re-examine the requirements for spatial definition of resource governance regions. This paper proposes three principles. First, the nature and reach of environmental externalities of resource use should determine the size and nesting of resource management regions. Second, the boundaries of resource governance regions should enclose areas of greatest interest and importance to local residents. Third, the biophysical characteristics of a resource governance region should be as homogenous as possible, which provides resource planning and management efficiencies. The paper describes a range of concepts and empirical techniques used to apply these principles to the derivation of a resource governance regionalisation of the State of New South Wales, Australia.

ID LACTOSE
AB The salty waste streams from cheese manufacture need to be managed by avoidance, minimization and conversion into new product streams. The project members visited the in-plant and ex-plant operations of various cheese factories to gather information and samples for analysis. Within the cheese factory, salt streams (e.g. ion exchange regenerants) may be reutilised or, fractions thereof, converted into product streams e.g. calcium phosphate (brushite) rich fractions. Electrolysis experiments were carried out to demonstrate the practicality of converting 'waste' salt streams, into both caustic and acidic solutions suitable for clean-in-place (CIP) applications. With the evaporation ponds, thermodynamic modelling of the analytical data shows that some relatively valuable products such as sodium sulphate hydrate (mirabilite), sodium chloride-potassium chloride and calcium phosphate dihydrate (brushite) may be recovered. It is proposed that the different waste streams should be isolated, organic components removed for subsequent product "mining" and the salty streams directed to separate evaporation ponds according to their composition to enable the production of higher value, higher purity salts.

AB On an Austrian pig breeding and finishing farm containing 13,000 pigs a mange prevalence of 38,7% according to the results of the skin scraping and 28,2% based on serology was determined. Due to the insufficient treatment (single treatment of the sows using Phoxim [Sebacil (R) pour on]), sustainable control was impossible. That could be confirmed by the high number of mange positive gilts and finishing pigs. Before eradication started the following prevalences of mange could be found: sows 6,74% (skin scrapings), respectively 6,18% (serologically), gilts 18,18% resp. 28,67%,finishing pigs 54,35% and 38,58%. The breeding stock for eradication was treated with doramectin (Dectomax (R)) injectable solution and the finishing pigs with Ivomec (R)-praemix, both applied twice. The success of treatment of the different farm units and of different age groups was controlled for the following ten months by combined diagnostic methods. In addition to skin scrapings, serum and colostral samples were carried out using a commercially available ELISA licensed for investigation of blood serum and colostrum. After treatment antibodies in the serum of the sows and gilts and Sarcoptes mites in their skin scrapings were detectable for up to four months after treatment. In serum samples of piglets and colostrum samples antibodies against Sorcoptes mites were detectable up to five months after final treatment.
   Due to the higher level and longer verifiability of antibodies in blood samples of piglets for five months after treatment and high prevalences their use as a diagnostic tool can be recommended. In contrast the use of colostral samples for routine diagnosis should be investigated more thoroughly. The comparison of the results of different diagnostic methods showed that for reliable mange diagnosis combined methods are recommended.

TI The catch and trade of seahorses in Vietnam

ID BYCATCH; FISHERY
AB Catch monitoring and surveys were used to assess the seahorse trade in Vietnam. Despite low daily catch rates, potentially 6.5 t of dried seahorses (similar to 2.2 million seahorses) were taken annually as bycatch by trawlers operating out of five coastal provinces of Vietnam. Individual seahorse catches were collated by a few local buyers, who supplied wholesalers in three major markets: Ho Chi Minh City, Hai Phong City and Da Nang. Domestic consumption was small and most seahorses were exported, generally through unofficial and unregulated channels across the northern border into Guangxi province of China. Overall, the seahorse trade was of low economic value to Vietnam, but may constitute an important source of income to upper level buyers and exporters. Most fishers and buyers surveyed reported that seahorse catch had declined over time. This paper should help in meeting the new CITES requirements - through implementation of an Appendix II listing in 2004 - that all international trade in seahorses must be monitored and managed for sustainability.

AB Indigenous forest reserves represent approximately one fifth of Brazilian Amazonia and pose enormous challenges for sustainable natural resource management by native Amazonians. In collaboration with the Kayapo Indians of A'Ukre of southeastern Amazonia, we obtained a game harvest profile of over 1360 forest vertebrates consumed at this village over a 20-month period, including 743 mammals, 361 forest tortoises and 256 birds from a minimum of 42 game species. This amounted to a total of 13,775 kg of game animals harvested over the entire study (mean = 26.2 kg d(-1)supercript stop). We also obtained some 450 km of line transect census data of midsized to large-bodied vertebrates within the core hunting catchment of this village and in an unhunted but otherwise comparable site upriver of A'Ukre. Population density estimates of 16 of the 18 species censused were significantly depressed by hunting by central place foragers within the village catchment, and a number of harvest-sensitive prey species showed clear evidence of local depletion. For the time being, however, we can conclude that hunting was sustainable at the landscape scale largely because source-sink dynamics in the context of low village catchment density is made possible by large surrounding tracts of primary forest that remain unharvested or underharvested.

AB The fronds of Rumohra adiantiformis, also known as '7-weeks-fern,' 'leatherleaf' or 'samambaia-preta,' are used worldwide as florists' greenery. Costa Rica and the USA cultivate and export R. adiantiformis, whereas in South Africa and Brazil this trade is based on extractivism. In Brazil, R. adiantiformis is harvested in the Atlantic Forest biome; 50% of the production comes from the slopes of the 'Serra Geral' (state of Rio Grande do Sul), where some 2000 families harvest and trade R. adiantiformis as their main source of revenue. However, harvesting, trading and transporting wild ornamental species is illegal in the Atlantic Forest, This study evaluates R. adiantiformis extractivism in hilly areas of Rio Grande do Sul, from an ethnobotanical/ethnoecological perspective. The study reveals that emic perceptions on the sustainability of R. adiantiformis extractivism are in agreement with relevant ecological data. The regeneration areas on the slopes of the Serra Geral have the highest plant density ever reported for R. adiantiformis; its extractivism has low environment impact and generates significant income for local communities. Further studies of these areas are important in order to support neoextractivism as a suitable form of use of the state's biodiversity.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly envisaged as a tool to manage coastal ecosystems and fisheries. Assessment of their performance with respect to management objectives is therefore important. A number of WAS provided conservation benefits for fished species. Observed benefits do not apply to all species at all times, and responses to protection are also highly variable among fish taxa. Among the many empirical studies on marine reserves, only a few designs considered 'before and after data' and spatial variation. In this paper, we are interested in assessing the effect of a no-take reserve on the reef fish assemblage in a northwestern Mediterranean example. Data were obtained from a three-year survey using underwater visual censuses (UVC), before and after MPA establishment. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and multivariate regression trees (MRT) were used to evaluate the effects of reserve protection on the reef fish assemblage, while accounting for habitat. Modelled biological responses were abundances and diversity indices calculated at different levels of the assemblage. Significant effects were found for many of these metrics. in addition to PERMANOVA, univariate models provided more insight into the magnitude and direction of effects. The most sensitive metrics were related to large species and species targeted by fishing. These results may be used to choose the metrics that are more suitable as community-based indicators of MPA impact in the perspective of monitoring programs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB When long-term, intense levels of harvest nearly extirpated Chinese ginseng (Panax ginseng C. Meyer) in the early 18th century, commercial harvest of American ginseng (P. quinquefolius L.) began and large quantities of the roots were exported to East Asia. Annual export figures have fallen over the past 200 years, but demand for wild American ginseng has not abated. Persistent harvest of long-lived, slow-maturing species can have negative impacts on population growth rates, yet those closest to wild resources are often in a position to be the best stewards of that resource. This study explored the consequences of different harvester behaviors on the population dynamics of American ginseng. Drawing on known behaviors, we developed three harvester 'types' and ran demographic simulations on wild ginseng populations, partitioning the sources of differences in population growth rates using a life table response experiment (LTRE). The simulations showed that ignoring size class limits and harvest season onset dates dramatically affected population growth rates. Existing laws in many states are not adequate to protect wild ginseng populations. A stewardship-oriented harvester, who delays harvest onset by two weeks, self-limits harvest intensity and plants ginseng seeds at the time of harvest can reverse declining population growth rates.

AB In this paper, it is argued that adequately assessing the implications of the current patterns of woodfuel production and use, and the sustainable potentials of woodfuel resources, requires a holistic view and a better knowledge of the spatial patterns of woodfuel supply and demand. There is a need to conduct multi-scale spatially explicit analyses of woodfuel supply and demand that are able to articulate local heterogeneity at the regional and national levels. Studies that provide full-country coverage and are based on consistent integration of data at lower geographical scales are woefully lacking. This paper describes the Woodfuel Integrated Supply/Demand Overview Mapping model (WISDOM). This is a GIS-based tool, aimed at analyzing woodfuel demand and supply spatial patterns from a new perspective that includes: (a) the assembling of existing but dispersed information into single data sets, (b) a modular integration of these data sets, based on the analysis of key variables associated with woodfuel demand and supply patterns, and (c) a multiple-scale and spatially explicit representation of the results, in order to rank or highlight areas in which several criteria of interest coincide. The final objective of WISDOM is to assess the sustainability of woodfuel as a renewable and widespread energy source, while supporting strategic planning and policy formulation. Three case studies for Mexico, Slovenia, and Senegal illustrate the practical implementation and innovative results of using WISDOM. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The use of firewood for domestic heating has the potential to reduce fossil-fuel use and associated CO2 emissions. The level of possible reductions depends upon the extent to which firewood off-sets the use of fossil fuels, the efficiency with which wood is burnt, and use of fossil fuels for collection and transport of firewood. Plantations grown for firewood also have a cost of emissions associated with their establishment. Applying the FullCAM model and additional calculations, these factors were examined for various management scenarios under three contrasting firewood production systems (native woodland, sustainably managed native forest, and newly established plantations) in low-medium rainfall (600-800 mm) regions of south-eastern Australia. Estimates of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of heat energy produced for all scenarios were lower than for non-renewable energy sources (which generally emit about 0.3-1.0kg CO2 kWh(-1)). Amongst the scenarios, emissions were greatest when wood was periodically collected from dead wood in woodlands (0.11 kg CO2 kWh(-1)), and was much lower when obtained from harvest residues and dead wood in native forests (< 0.03 kg CO2 kWh(-1)). When wood was obtained from plantations established on previously cleared agricultural land, use of firewood led to carbon sequestration equivalent to -0.06 kg CO2 kWh(-1) for firewood obtained from a coppiced plantation, and -0.17 kg CO2 kWh(-1) for firewood collected from thinnings, slash and other residue in a plantation grown for sawlog production. An uncertainty analysis, where inputs and assumptions were varied in relation to a plausible range of management practices, identified the most important influencing factors and an expected range in predicted net amount of CO, emitted per unit of heat energy produced from burning firewood.

AB Renewable energy sources such as bioenergy crops have significant potential as alternatives to fossil fuels. Potential environmental problems arising from soil sediment and nutrient losses in runoff water from bioenergy crops need to be evaluated in order to determine the sustainability and overall feasibility of implementing bioenergy development strategies. This paper discusses runoff, sediment, N, and total P losses from agricultural land (continuous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)) converted to short-rotation sweetgum (Liquidamber styraciflua L.) plantations with and without fescue (Festuca elatior L.) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) bioenergy crops, compared to corn (Zea mays L.), on a Decatur silt loam soil in north Alabama, from 1995 to 1999. Runoff volume was significantly correlated to total rainfall and sediment yield in each year, but treatment differences were not significant. Sweetgum plots produced the highest mean sediment yield of up to 800 kg ha(-1) compared to corn and switchgrass plots, which averaged less than 200 kg ha(-1). Runoff NH4+ N losses averaged over treatments and years for spring season (3.1 kg ha(-1)) were three to five times those for summer, fall, and winter seasons. Runoff NO3- N for no-till corn and switchgrass plots in spring and summer were five to ten times that for sweetgum plots. No-till corn and switchgrass treatments had 2.4 and 2.1 kg ha(-1) average runoff total P, respectively, which were two to three times that for sweetgum treatments. Growing sweetgum with a fescue cover crop provides significantly lower risk of water pollution from sediment, runoff NH4+ N, and NO3- N. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The bioconversion potential of two epigeic species (Eisenia foetida Sav. and Eudrilus eugeniae Kinberg) of earthworms was assessed in terms of efficiency and sustainability of vermicomposting of Taro (Colocasia esculenta (Linn) Schott in Schott and Endl). In different vermireactors, each run in triplicates with one of the two species of earthworms, and 60 g of 6:1 Colocasia:cowdung as feed, vermicasts were produced with steadily increasing output in all the reactors. E eugeniae was found to be more efficient producer of vermicasts than E foetida. In all reactors, the earthworms grew well, increasing their weights and number. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Microula sikkimensis is a biennial herb, found only in the eastern rims of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and lends itself to multiple applications in medicine, food and fodder. Utilizing the seed production of M. sikkimensis to develop a sustainable production ecosystem is a logical option for the degraded alpine grassland in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. From 1994 to 2004, a field survey and transplanting trials were conducted in eleven counties of three provinces for collection of habitat factor data. By multivariate statistical analysis the habitat factors were condensed into seven key habitat factors which described an actual habitat state. Introducing the niche theory into the research of M. sikkimensis, habitat niche-fitness (HNF) is defined as the degree of similarity of an actual habitat state to the optimum habitat. A new model of HNF is constructed to evaluate the adaptive extent of M sikkimensis and the influence of habitat on seed yield with the key habitat factors as dependent variables and factor weights as parameters. The results showed that the values of HNF had a reasonable distribution and better reflected the varied differences under different habitat conditions, and that the cultivation measures had the effect of increasing the value of HNF and seed yield, increasing 14.26% and 99.61% at an average level, respectively. A seed yield prediction model was constructed with HNF as a surrogate for composite environmental factors. The estimated seed yield agreed well with the observed data, and the average of the absolute deviation percent was 5.46%, demonstrating the validity of the model in predicting seed yield. The HNF model and seed yield prediction model evaluated the threshold value of HNF, predicted the upper limit of seed yield for each study site and the limit seed yield, and have a wide range of prospects for practical application in the similar regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB A great quantity of CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere through the different phases of a building life cycle: in the production of materials and products, in the construction of the building itself, in the setting on site, in the exploitation. the renovations, the later rehabilitations, up to the final demolition. The present paper shows the possibility of reducing the CO2 emissions up to 30% in the construction phase, through a careful selection of low environmental impact materials. The purpose of this study is to quantify the total amount of CO2 emissions saved by the method presented in the particular phase of material selection within the life cycle of a building. This material selection, as well as the bioclimatic characteristics, must be defined from the early design project phase.
   The research presented here has been carried out on a case study of three terraced houses built in Spain, comparing them with a building with similar characteristics but constructed in a conventional way and with no selection of materials. The houses have been constructed following low environmental impact criteria, including alternative energies for future use and maintenance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID IMPACT ASSESSMENT; CONSTRUCTION; FUTURE; EIA
AB Sustainability assessment methods for building projects have a major role to play in introducing sustainability values and principles into mainstream construction practice. The paper reflects on potential measures that should advance building assessment practice in fostering sustainable construction and it advocates a redefinition of the objectives of building assessment methods. Arguably, the current emphasis in the building process and building assessment on a physical design and functional properties of buildings needs to be complemented with a concern for the quality of social and technical processes. To increase the effectiveness of any building assessment method, it is necessary to define clearly its desired outputs and outcomes. The paper suggests three significant outcomes of building sustainability assessment: integration; transparency and accessibility; and collaborative learning. These outcomes have emerged from a critical appraisal of the theory of Environmental Assessment and the Process Protocol. Environmental Assessment was examined as it provides valuable insights in terms of addressing sustainability at a project level. Lessons from the Process Protocol allow for the potential optimization of building projects using a building sustainability assessment method. Addressing these outcomes provides the means for proactive project enhancement, in terms of its sustainability and quality, by using a building sustainability assessment method.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT METHODS
AB The shift from 'green building' to 'sustainable building' entails a number of great challenges and opportunities for the developers and users of planning and building assessment tools. The current assumption is that a new generation of building assessment tools is required to meet the current and forthcoming requirements associated with the description and assessment of each building's contribution to sustainable development. Existing design and assessment tools do not address the many economic, social and performance facets over the life span of a building, and do not provide building assessment results for all dimensions of sustainable development. Different assessment tasks within the design process are analysed, and approaches for the further development of building assessment tools are considered. The integration into a 'job-sharing approach' with other instruments and measures of the design, construction and management phase are proposed. A proposal for a comprehensive system for the description and assessment of 'integrated building performance' is offered. Recommendations are given for its implementation within the next generation of building assessment tools.

AB Despite the creation of a variety of environmental building tools, it remains difficult to select existing tools or to develop new tools to address specific needs in many regions. This is largely due to insufficient transparency and complexity surrounding existing tools as well as the vague understanding of regionally specific conditions and requirements. An approach is proposed for developing regionally specific environmental building tools for China. Two new conceptual frameworks are established to classify environmental building tools and their related factors. Based on the new frameworks, a survey was conducted to understand local Chinese architects' perceptions about the relative importance of environmental building factors, and their expectations about the character, orientation, function and styles of environmental building tools in China. Based on these results, a suite approach to developing regionally specific environmental building tools is proposed and the implications of their applications in China are considered.

   assessment
AB Environmental indicators for buildings have the potential to serve as a means of making the environmental impacts (and possibly benefits) of buildings visible to all relevant actors. In addition, indicators facilitate the consideration and management of an array of environmental issues in the relevant decision-making situations. The broad acceptance of indicators across different groups of decision-makers in different phases of a building's life cycle is especially important when indicators are not mandatory, but are to be used in voluntary bottom-up initiatives. The objective of the present study was to investigate if (and to what extent) a consensus on environmental indicators for buildings as 'a common language for green building' can be reached among core actors in the Danish building sector and what such indicators could look like. Based on an analysis of current indicator systems and a qualitative investigation of the views of different actor groups on environmental indicators for buildings, the areas of consensus and lines of conflict between the actor groups were identified. Four different technological frames were used to identify four different perceptions of environmental indicators. Applying the theory of the social construction of technology (SCOT) in a prospective way, the findings show that a closure of the indicator-debate on the basis of an all-actors consensus within the near future is unlikely. Instead, three likely scenarios are described for the future development of the indicator debate and the directions for different actors are identified to create a common language for the use of green building indicators.

TI Defining absolute environmental limits for the built environment
SO BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
LA English
DT Article
DE building performance; building sustainability assessment; environmental
   assessment; environmental performance targets
AB The question addressed is whether it is possible to define working limits on environmental impacts from the built environment in terms of global carrying capacity. The main focus is on energy-related impacts, since these are global and relatively well-understood. Four possible approaches to defining limits are explored: static equilibrium, asymptotic, integral of excess and planned future. The conclusions that emerge from this exploration are that global environmental constraints are very tight, but also that they are dynamically and strongly influenced by the trajectory of social and technological development over the coming century. Their use as the basis for practical, quantitative metrics of sustainability, therefore, involves a large measure of subjectivity. A fifth approach - the developmental approach - is identified, which instead of focusing on long-term external constraints to human activity, focuses instead on the internal, short-to medium-term dynamics of the built environment itself. It appears likely that the developmental approach, guided by qualitative conclusions from the analysis of global carrying capacity, is likely to be most fruitful.

AB The development of a checklist used for judging the 2005 Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Sustainability Award is described. A quick, simple, robust and fair approach was required. The checklist drew upon an existing practice-based method that had been developed to assist a dialogue between design team members and their clients first setting priorities and targets for sustainability and then assisting later reviews and progress reports. The topics covered were extended by the findings of a review of available sustainability assessment methods, and organized broadly in accordance with the sequence of work in an architectural project - from site selection to building in use. Although not objectively calibrated, the checklist allows levels of aspiration and achievement to be identified, reports quickly and concisely, and permits comparisons between buildings of very different types. The checklist not only helped with judging the award, but also attracted favourable comments from users and others. The approach may therefore have wider applications in providing a simple introduction to sustainability assessment, which can then lead into more precise quantification if and where required.

SO BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID PISCES
AB Fishery-dependent monitoring of the tiger grouper, Mycteroperca tigris (Valenciennes, 1833) spawning aggregation at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico was conducted from 1995 to 1999 with very limited fishing in 1999. The aggregation formed at the "El Seco" site 2 d after the full moon in February and March and rarely in January or April. Hook and line fishing with live baits at the site was 4-7 d per aggregation period and an average of seven boats handlined per aggregation period. Spearfishing effort was limited and declined to zero by the end of the study. Predation losses of hooked fish to sharks were quantified and on average 33% of captured fish were lost to predation. Documented landings from the fishery declined about 60% from almost 5000 kg in 1995 to about 2000 kg in 1998. A total of over 6700 fish was estimated to have been landed in 4 yrs. Fleet catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data, as a proxy for abundance, demonstrated a strong declining trend from 1996 to 1998. In the 4 yrs of catch sampling, the mean size of males was significantly greater than that of females. The modal value of the size distribution (sexes combined) increased from 510 mm SL (standard length) in 1995 to 550 mm SL in 1998. The sex ratio (M: F) of samples from the aggregation were all male-biased and increased from 3.7:1 in 1995 to 12:1 in 1998. Continued fishing at the levels of fishing effort observed is not considered sustainable. A seasonal closure of the El Seco site should be considered as a management option.

TI Stakeholders' strategies and multifunctionality: The case of Guadeloupe
   and Reunion Islands
SO CAHIERS AGRICULTURES

DT Article
DE farms; Guadeloupe; Reunion; socioeconomic environment; innovation
AB The multifunctionality of agriculture promoted by the Agriculture Act is difficult to reconcile with the intensive models dominant in Guadeloupe and Reunion. This is made clear by an analysis of the management rules and practices for territorial farming contracts, intended to implement this Act. The difficulty of this reconciliation can also be observed by the impact that the statute's application has had on its targets - production units. We conducted open or conversation interviews with institutional personnel and with farmers who have signed these contracts. Those signed so far have supported production for export from both places, markedly in Guadeloupe and less so in Reunion. in Guadeloupe, these contracts have rarely served to help develop the practices of participating farmers or to incite new projects. Technical, economic or even organizational innovations have remained more ad hoc than at Reunion. Although the objectives of these contracts have been "deflected", this learning process via diversion of the statute augurs well for a better adjustment to the new Sustainable agriculture contracts by farmers and the institutions working with them.

TI Factors affecting buildability of building designs
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE design appraisal; buildability improvement; factor analysis;
   discriminant analysis
AB By identifying the succinct attributes of design, the abstract concept of buildability can be expressed in a more defined and tangible way for its improvements. In this research, factor analysis is used to expound the data obtained from a questionnaire survey on buildability attributes. Results show the first three out of nine key buildability factors for building designs are (i) allowing economic use of contractor resources, (ii) enabling design requirements to be easily visualized and coordinated by site staff, and (iii) enabling contractors to develop and adopt alternative construction details. Discriminant analysis has been used to identify significant differences amongst the respondent groups. At the project level, the findings give designers a better understanding of factors affecting the buildability of their outputs, thus enabling design solutions leading to more efficient and safe construction. At the industry level, the identified factors can contribute to sustainable development through the reduction of waste and the economic use of resources.

AB Steam reforming of acetic acid as a model compound present in bio-oil over Pt/ZrO2 catalysts has been investigated. Pt/ZrO2 yields steam reforming products (i.e., H-2, CO, CO2) to the amounts predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium; however, conversion and yields dropped rapidly with time on course. The deactivation was due to blockage of active sites by coke/oligomer formed. This report clarifies cause of the deactivation during steam reforming of acetic acid. It was found that many products can be formed from acetic acid on ZrO2, such as acetone. The experimental results confirmed that aldol condensation of acetone took place on ZrO2 to give larger compounds which can easily become deposits to block active sites for steam reforming. In order to develop durable catalysts for steam reforming of bio-oil, support should be designed to enhance activation of water. minimize dehydration reactions and thus oligomer formation.
