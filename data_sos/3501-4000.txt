DE FGD gypsum composites; extrusion; gypsum blocks
AB A huge amount of gypsum is generated as an industrial solid waste from flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) installations of thermal power stations. Properties of gypsum by-product from FGD installation in Maritsa-East-2 thermal power station were studied. Dihydrate gypsum was dried and on the base hemihydrate produced different composite building materials were produced. Using plasticimeter measurments and modelling extrusion process it was proved that the materials obtained may cover all quality requirements for plaster building materials. The optimal conditions related to the extrusion process have been determined on the basis of using different weight ratios of used components. Setting time and the mechanical properties of the materials give sufficient evidences that the new materials produced can be used for wall panels. It was also proved that the new materials would more economically efficient in comparison with the same type of materials produced on the basis of natural gypsum. Gypsum extruded panels production is recommended on the basis of gypsum by-product as a BAT and suitable way for sustainable utilisation, because the new materials are environmental friendly and economically more efficient.

DE ecobusiness; labour market; environment education and environment
   legislation; sustainable development
AB At present, the environment protection is the major problem for humankind. Human intervention on the environment conditions has surpassed the limit thresholds of nature's regeneration. We are, witnessing a pollution and degradation, in certain cases, irreversible, of the environment elements; human life itself is being jeopardised, unless measures are taken to limit and eliminate the polluting process. For a long time it has been thought and it is still stated that between environment protection and labour force occupancy, more than that, between the right to a healthy environment and the right to work there would be an irreconcilable discrepancy. The classic example of shutting down or diminishing the activity of polluting enterprises and unemployment is too well known. Yet, however, the evolution of reality seems to change this view. The paper presents aspects regarding the dynamics of the relation between the environment protection and labour market within the social and political context, the economic and natural one, where that report is materialising. The paper highlights the barriers to ecobusiness and suggests the paths to be taken in order to overcome those barriers.

DE environment; tourism; solid management; biotechnology; methane; ethanol;

AB This paper presents some aspects of the pollution generated by the tourism activities and of the efficient waste management, as important parts to achieve the sustainable eco-agrotourism concept. An innovative mini-plant, principally based on the biotechnological process, is proposed to treat the waste water and organic wastes generated by tourism activities. The method is very attractive due to the possibility of recycling of valuable compounds like ethanol (green fuel) and methane. These fuels are obtained by fermentation of wastes with high organic content. At the same time, the by-products (biosolids) resulted from anaerobic digestion can be processed like fertiliser or converted to compost. The mini-plant allows the co-digestion or co-composting with other organic solid wastes generated by tourism activities or by bioethanol production. The plants like reed beds are proposed for dewatering of the sludge before land application or compost production. All involved processes are simple, ecological, economical, and could be integrated in the sustainable eco-agrotourism concept.

DE therapeutic spa tourism; Central Greece; natural resources
AB In the early 1980's changes had been foreseen which would affect the world tourism market. Tourism represents a very important component of revenue of the Greek economy which these recent years has suffered a decline. Given the worldwide decline of tourism, new forms of tourism are being sought to satisfy domestic and foreign competition coupled with the increased expectations for improved quality services at competitive prices. This paper answers the tourism decline challenge with a new opportunity offered by the proposed strategy of Therapeutic Spa Tourism in Central Greece based on the proper use of natural resources and in accordance with the philosophy of sustainable development. The strategic location of Central Greece, the favourable legislative framework, the geographical competitive advantages of the region with many natural therapeutic spas which have been in existence since antiquity are examined. The new programs based on the analyses from pilot projects and statistical data from local and governmental sources recommend specific new directions taking advantage of the natural resources which offer an attractive answer to the demands of tomorrow's market for vacations of natural and healthy life.

AB Renewable energy sources are the only energy sources compatible with the ground rules of the sustainable development. Biomass represents 95% from the total potential of renewable sources. It is utilised mainly as firewood and wood for charcoal production. A minor amount of renewable energy has made its way into the Romania's electricity generation mix. The Romanian government is planning to implement a new program for increasing the use of renewable energy that includes photovoltaics, wind energy, biomass, and geothermal. The top priority is the use of biomass for thermal applications, substituting oil.

AB Within the Education for sustainability (EfS) framework, the key-concept is sustainable development (SD). This work aims at the detection of information that may contribute to its understanding, within textbooks of the formal education. More specifically, the contents of eight Greek high school textbooks of the natural sciences were analysed using the 'content analysis' method. Specific categories were defined realising a SD teaching hypothetical scenario and the corpus of the analysis was coded accordingly. In general, the results revealed the existence of information that can be used within the proposed SD teaching scenario. Moreover, trends concerning the dispersion of the information according to different axons that were employed, e.g. parts of the textbooks, way of presentation, were also captured. Thus, the presented approach by focusing on the SD key-concept managed to detect the existence and position of relevant information within the school textbooks under consideration. The proposed approach leaves space for future interventions towards the increase of the coherence of the above information, with an EfS orientation.

DE environmental impacts; fish cage farm; coastal water quality; nutrients
AB Aquaculture forms an important economic activity and involves the production of high quality food supplies. Environmental impacts of aquaculture depend on a number of parameters such as the size of the farm, feeding techniques, physicochemical and geological characteristics. The development of marine aquaculture has led to conflicting demands for coastal resources and an increased interest in water quality. The assessment of environmental impacts of aquaculture in the marine environment is necessary for the management of coastal areas in the context of sustainability. In the present work, nine water quality parameters were systematically measured in a fish cage farm in Sithonia, Chalkidiki. Monitoring of water quality took place in two sampling locations during a year. Water samples were collected monthly from three depths and the measured parameters were: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, silicate and ammonium. The results showed a decrease in the concentrations of dissolved oxygen and increased values of nutrients during the summer months. The particular unit has a moderate impact on the water quality of the surrounding area.

The Kizilirmak delta, the lake Ulubat, the Gediz delta and the Akyatan lagoon have been involved at the same time in 1998 with the Kus and Burdur lakes which were partially involved before. The lands of Turkey are located where three continents meet which constitutes diversity in habitats due to the geographic location, topography and different climatic conditions. Wetlands which contribute to this diversity by providing reproduction, nourishment and sheltering media for living beings are internationally significant. In this respect, not only several wetlands all around the world are being protected by this international tool, the Ramsar Convention, but also the sustainability of the wetlands is managed as well. Only 9 of 25 wetlands of Turkey are involved to the Ramsar list. Within this paper the criteria of determinig a wetland as 'Ramsar area' has been studied and some of the wetlands of Turkey have been evaluated with regards to the criteria of the Ramsar Convention.

   analysis; e-comics
AB The aim of this empirical study is to make apparent and to interpret the thoughts of students about environmental problems. In particular, 73 students at the School of Primary Education of Democritus University of Thrace, who attended the lesson 'Introduction to ICT' were engaged in the process of developing comics, using the computer, i.e. an e-comics, with the above theme. Initially, the analysis of the e-comics, upon specific categories of interest that was performed using the method of the content analysis, is described. The results reveal some interesting aspects of the students' views to environmental problems. More specifically, most of the findings are aggregated in a narrow approach to the environmental problems, yet a strong willingness to act for their prevention, is also reported. The findings of this work reveal the potentiality of the use of the e-comics as a research tool to retrieve information from people. Moreover, their electronic form may serve as a body of resources for further educational uses, within the framework of the education for sustainability.

DE lakes; fisheries; fishery models; sustainable development; fishery

AB The lakes Koronia and Volvi in the region of Central Macedonia (Greece) are very important lakes due to their natural environment and they are protected by specific environmental laws. Recently, both of these protected wetlands are under intense exploitation of their biological resources while a lot of developmental human activities are in conflict functions and uses of their waters. This paper describes the fishing efforts of these two environmental sensitive wetlands and attempts to generate models for forecasting their fishery production. Annual fishery production data originated directly from the relative 'Fisheries Public Authorities' of each lake ecosystem as well as from relative scientific papers, studies and programs. Annual fishery production models were defined through 'Trend Analysis', 'Moving Average' and 'ARIMA' modelling and can support short-term forecasts. The degradation of the fishery production of the lakes Koronia and Volvi, which are identified as traditionally inland water fishery areas, is mainly related with the general reduction of their biological resources, the overfishing and also from the recent environmental changes. The existing fishery management is insufficient and not so well adapted with the environmental features of these lakes, following mainly general fishery regulations and ignoring their specific characteristics. The results of this paper can support the local authorities to apply a sustainable and environmental-friendly fishery management plan.

TI DETERMINATION OF ORGANIC HALOGENS COMPOUNDS FROM SOIL BY COULOMETRY
   METHOD CONCERNING TO SEWAGE SLUDGE USE IN AGRICULTURE

DT Article
DE soil pollution control; organic halogen compounds; sewage sludge;
   coulotmetry method
AB The Sewage Sludge Directive 86/278/EEC, the Organic Farming Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, the Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC and Commission Decision 2001/688/EC for the Ecolabel for soil improvers and growing media are just about the only European instruments relevant to this specific waste stream. This situation has more recently suggested the provement or the legislation applicable to sludge and other biodegradable wastes, so the revision of the Directive 86/278/EEC and the development of a Biowaste Directive have been planned as necessary actions. Many of the organic compounds are halogenated, produced by chlorination of water during purification processes, through industrial and municipal run-off (paper pulp industry, manufacture of PVC and waste incineration), natural sources and sewage purification practices. It should be noted that the source of absorbable organic halogens (AOX) might be organochlorine pesticides. Chlorine is a contaminant often found in soil. Some organic halogens may be transformed in the soil to more toxic compounds such as vinyl chloride, which is known as a human carcinogen. Adsorbable organic halogens are a mass parameter that includes many substances, which are adsorbable and contain halogens. Halogens (usually chlorine but also fluoride, bromine and iodine) envelop organic substances so as to disallow breakdown by bacteria, which means that these substances are often not easily degradable. Adsorption tendency most often goes hand in hand with a tendency to accumulate in organisms (bio-accumulativeness). AOX are detected by coulometry method using a deposition reaction of silver ion and halogens ions in accordance with the German Standard DIN 38414/1989 and the European Standard CEN/TC/2003. Based on the UE Directives, AOX concentration must be lower than 500 mg kg(-1), concerning environmental protection for use of sewage sludge in agriculture. This is a measure of careful soil protection to prevent the input of high amounts of anthropogenic compounds into soil, some of which may be persistent pollutants for sustainable use of land. This work was an original research in TUBORG Scholarship B.EN.A 2004.

DE landscape potentiality; determination; Enez
AB Enez is located on the southwest part of Edirne with the Aegean sea on the west, Kesan on the east, the Saroz gulf on the south and Ipsala and Greece on the north. The center of the town was built in the ancient times as a Greek colony. The name of Enez comes from a Greek princess called 'Eneyaz'. The town was under the sovereignty of the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Geneose, Ottoman Empire, Russia and Greece in order. The town was included in the Turkish Republic borders after the 1922. Enez is an antique town with its castle, Turkish-islamic cemetery and the other historical-cultural remainings. Besides its cultural and historical richness it has several natural beauties. The town is important by its sea, lake and mountain ecosystems. The Meric river, which flows from the Balkans forms a wide delta and combines with the sea in Enez. Tasaltu, Bucurmene, and Dalyan lagoons with their rich fish flora, the Gala lake which is a National Park with its bird fauna, and the Hisarli mountain with its rich flora and fauna form the landscape potentiality of the town. The entrance of the foreign tourists to the town was forbidden for long years because of its geographical location. This inhibition limited the tourism activities with native tourists and this caused an increase in the number of secondary houses in the coastal zone. Besides, the domestic and industrial contamination and the pollution caused by the agricultural activities are the most important environmental problems of the town. These negative factors cause degradation in nature and damage the natural balances. In this study the importance of Enez with its location and landscape potentiality was underlined. As a conclusion several proposals are made to maintain the sustainability of recreational potentiality over conservation process.

LA English

DE tourism policy; sustainable development; protected areas; management
   activity
AB In terms of tourism development, Greece concentrates its efforts on summer and winter tourism. This is completely irrational in the case of a country with such a wide experience in tourism issues. More specifically, in the island of Euboea natural beauties are in abundance. Unfortunately, though, they are either still unexploited or exploited irrationally. Based on this research 'The prospects of ecotourism development in Euboea', the planning of Euboea's tourism development should be re-examined taking into consideration all the different parameters. The fact that the tourist market has been transformed into a demanding field characterised by high business risk and very fierce competition should also be taken into account. On the other hand, this market offers limitless potential for mild forms of tourism, like ecotourism. Ecotourism will entail a turn to quality that is considered essential, primarily for the regional economy but for the national economy as well. The purpose of any ecotourist activity should be twofold. First, it should intend to bring urban people into contact with nature by giving them the chance to enjoy its unique beauties, that is to say forests, ravines and all natural sites in general. Second, ecotourist initiatives should aim at providing financial aid to the farmers, by means of promoting the local products and making them available to the visitors of the region. In this way, farmers will get involved into the tertiary sector and realise the great significance of this quality-oriented form of tourism for the improvement of their economic conditions and for the protection of the environment. By means of this research, ecotourism's essence and content will be presented as well as the fact that ecotourism can act as an incentive for the development of internal tourism and can bring about investment initiatives on the tourist sector and thus leads to the creation of the appropriate infrastructure that will help the extension of the tourist period throughout the year. It can also be argued that the development of ecotourism, which is presently at an initial stage in the specific area, as it was mentioned above, can be an effective solution to the problem of unemployment that is very acute in the region.

Trade on tourism increases the need for import, furthermore, this trade helps people living on the islands to pay their import debts and ensures a better living standards. Although there are a lot of unfavourable problems that tourism brings together, it is a great success as much as tourism that islands turn towards another production that will enable the flow of foreign exchange. The countries can not develop an economy that is based on production except tourism since they are small-scaled countries, the islands can not improve their economies, they can not use modern technology, and they are faced with problems resulting from transportation. On the other hand, most of the islands with their natural beauties and attractive climatic conditions seem to be appropriate for creating a very extensive tourism industry. The improvement of tourism on the islands depends on these natural beauties and their protectinon. In this context, it is obvious that a sustainable tourism is needed. The matter of a sustainable tourism reveals when trade on tourism begins to create undesirable effects on the physical environment and the culture of the local public. In this paper the positive and negative effects of tourism in small islands and how to sustain the ecological and social life are analysed.

TI EFFECTS OF FERTILISER SYSTEMS ON QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF OIL FROM
   DIFFERENT SUNFLOWER (Helianthus annuus L.) CULTIVARS

DE sunflower; fertiliser system; yield; oil
AB A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of organic, inorganic and integrated fertiliser systems on the quantitative and qualitative traits of sunflower cultivars in 1999 and 2000 at the Miandoab research station (lat. - 36 degrees 58'N, long. - 46 degrees 09'E, alt. - 1371 m). This experiment was done on a split plot design with RCBD arrangement in 3 replications. Main plot was composed of various levels of chemical fertilisers (40, 80, 120, 160 and 200 kg N/ha), organic fertilisers (6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 t farm yard manure (F.Y.M.)/ha), integrated fertilisers (40 kg N + 24 t F.Y.M., 80 kg N+18 t F.Y.M., 120 kg N + 12 t F.Y.M. and 160 kg N + 6 t F.Y.M./ha), and control (no fertiliser). The subplot was composed of 4 sunflower cultivars: AS-508, Hysun-33 hybrids, Armavirski and Record O.P.S. Intergated fertiliser system treatments and - 200 kg N/ha.treatments showed a significant higher yield, head weight, seed number/ head, head diameter, 100 seed weight, and seed yield over other treatments and control. The treatments 200 kg N /ha, 30 t F.Y.M. and 120 kg N + 12 t F.Y.M. /ha showed the highest increase in plant hight. The organic fertiliser system treatments showed the highest oil content while the inorganic fertiliser treatments showed the highest increase in protein content. The 200 kg N/ha treatment showed the lowest oil content. The integrated fertiliser treatments (160 kg N + 6 t F.Y.M /ha and 120 kg N + 12 t F.Y.M./ha) have the highest nitrogen and protein contents compared to the other treatments of this system. The results revealed that the application of mixture of inorganic and organic fertilisers would not only be able to reduce the input consumption per unit area, but also would increase the energy of efficiency produced thus reducing the inorganic fertiliser consumption and attainment of sustainable agriculture. Among the cultivars studied, Hysun-33 in the first year and AS-508 and Record in the second year have the highest yield due to the higher head weight, seed number/ head and 100-seed weight. Significant difference in the oil content among the cultivars studied was not observed. The results have shown that the hybrid cultivars As-508 and Hysun-33 are suitable and may be recommended for this region.

AB In Wuhan urban agglomeration (WIJA), the population growth and concentration, the industrial development and urban sprawl have been affecting the environment fundamentally. Comparing with Yangtze delta metropolitan region, the level of urbanization and industrialization of WUA has lagged behind for about 10 years; but the problems in environmental protection and rehabilitation are commonly serious. In the future, WUA should avoid unnecessary mistakes and seek a win-win strategy for economy and environment in its large-scale development stage. Based on the analysis of the changing of main environmental pollutants and the coupled curves in past decades, the paper discussed the important links among the urban environmental pollutions, industry growth and urban sprawl in MTUA. It is concluded that the integration of economic and environmental policies in urban development is more required and significant at the large urban agglomeration region. Four proactive and long-term strategies need to be adopted to provide prior guidance and better protection for the development of WUA.

AB Sustainable sanitation is an approach for more ecological and sustainable water resources management. In this paper, we proposed one of the new integrated waste treatment systems: an "sustainable sanitation system" that includes separation of the black water from water system by a non-flushing toilet (bio-toilet), and a gay water treatment based on a biological and ecological concept. Sustainable sanitation system also converts the domestic waste to soil conditioners and fertilizers, for farmland use. As one of the case studies, Environmentally Symbiotic Housing in which people actually live using the bio-toilet for the black water treatment and the household wastewater treatment facility for the gay water was introduced. The availability of this system was investigated by analyzing the sawdust used in the bio-toilet and the quality of the effluent in the household wastewater treatment facility. As the result, the water content of the sawdust did not exceed 60% in any of the sampling points and the BOD and COD of the effluent of the household wastewater treatment facility were below 10 and 20 mg/L respectively, due to the low loading. Compared to the pollution load on the water environment created by the conventional system, it was found that the effluent of the house has a lower load than the tertiary treatment and the volume of the water consumption is 75% of the conventional system.

ID DISTILLATION
AB As several sub-Saharan African countries are entering into the commercial production of geranium essential oils, this work sought to characterize the oil quality of Pelargonium sp. based on organoleptic, physicochemical and chemical properties from different Southern and East African countries to highlight the importance of germplasm selection in the commercial production of oils and to develop base-line yield information. In 2002, Rwanda began to rebuild their essential oil industry, and locally available Pelargonium cultivars were introduced into cultivation trials. The organoleptic evaluation and chemical profile (citronellol 13%, linalool 18% and geraniol 35%) showed that these oils were not suitable for international markets, but may have an important role in domestic markets. In an effort to upgrade the essential oil industry to higher standards, new geranium plantlets of the Bourbon type were obtained from South Africa and distributed to several sites in Southern and Eastern Africa. The newly introduced cultivar yielded essential oils with a suitable organoleptic and chemical profile (citronellol 31%, linalool 3% and geraniol 7%). In Zambia, a commercial grower was also producing geranium oils that were later deemed not suitable for international markets. While in Madagascar, a country with a long history of producing geranium in small land units by many small-scale commercial farmers, those samples analyzed in this study were found to produce high quality oil similar to the Bourbon type. These results clearly demonstrate that the selection and introduction of a specific strain or chemotype with the acceptable organoleptic and chemical profiles are among the key factors needed to obtain high quality essential oils that will meet international expectations and standards, prerequisites for the successful establishment and sustainability of an essential oil targeted for the global trade.

TI Ethnomedicinal plants used by the people of Manang district, central
   Nepal
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: The district of Manang (2000 - 6000 m) is located in the Central Himalayas, Nepal. The majority of local inhabitants of the area are Gurungs, of Tibetan origin. The remoteness of the region has resulted in continued use of plants as medicine in an area where the ethnobotany has sparsely been documented.
   Methods: Interviews were conducted with amchi (Tibetan medicinal practitioners), local healers (including priests locally known as 'lamas'), plant traders, and knowledgeable villagers (including herders) regarding local plant names and their medicinal uses during several field visits (20022005). When convenient to the locals, a jungle or forest walk was done with the healers, allowing for both plant collection and detailed information gathering.
   Results: This present research documented 91 ethnomedicinal plant species, belonging to 40 families under 73 genera, and 45 new ethnomedicinal plant species are added. These 91 locally used medicinal plants are found to treat 93 ailments. This study provides information on 45 plant species previously unknown for their medicinal uses in Manang. The indication for use, mode of preparation, dose and administration of medicine are described in detail for each species.
   Conclusion: This wealth of ethnobotanical knowledge persists, and is being transferred to the next generation in some areas in upper Manang, in a country where this is often not the case. The senior amchi of the area (Karma Sonam Lama), who has been practicing Tibetan medicine for three generations, feels that it is of utmost importance to conserve the traditional healing system and to pass his knowledge on to the local community about the importance of medicinal plants. He hopes that this will lead to the conservation and sustainable management of medicinal plants in the villages. Over the duration of this research, the prices of several rare medicinal plants of Manang increased dramatically, highlighting both the scarcity and the quick disappearance of the species. This is only one example of a worrying trend of over harvesting of medicinal plants, and highlights the need for conservation and management of medicinal plants of Manang district.

AB The medicinal properties of plant species have made an outstanding contribution in the origin and evolution of many traditional herbal therapies. These traditional knowledge systems have started to disappear with the passage of time due to scarcity of written documents and relatively low income in these traditions. Over the past few years, however, the medicinal plants have regained a wide recognition due to an escalating faith in herbal medicine in view of its lesser side effects compared to allopathic medicine in addition the necessity of meeting the requirements of medicine for an increasing human population. Through the realization of the continuous erosion of traditional knowledge of plants used for medicine in the past and the renewed interest at the present time, a need existed to review this valuable knowledge of medicinal plants with the purpose of developing medicinal plants sectors across the different states in India. Our major objectives therefore were to explore the potential in medicinal plants resources, to understand the challenges and opportunities with the medicinal plants sector, and also to suggest recommendations based upon the present state of knowledge for the establishment and smooth functioning of the medicinal plants sector along with improving the living standards of the underprivileged communities. The review reveals that northern India harbors a rich diversity of valuable medicinal plants, and attempts are being made at different levels for sustainable utilization of this resource in order to develop the medicinal plants sector.

TI Diversity and utilization of antimalarial ethnophytotherapeutic remedies
   among the Kikuyus (Central Kenya)
SO JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Plants in Kenya are becoming increasingly important as sources of traditional medicines. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that malaria kills about 2.7 million people every year, 90% of who are from Africa. Malaria continues to be a national concern in Kenya as it plays a major role in the high mortality rates being experienced currently. The use and miss-use of chloroquine to prevent and treat falciparium malaria has led to widespread appearance of chloroquine resistant parasites in Kenya and other tropical countries. These factors and the rising costs of non-chloroquine drugs have made the local people to turn to traditional remedies for management of this menace.
   This paper examines the current utilization of traditional plant medicines in managing malaria menace in Central Kenya. The results show both indigenous and introduced species are in use indicating traditional medicinal practices in this region are dynamic. In total 58 species in 54 genera and 33 families were identified. The family Rubiaceae was found to have the highest number of reported species. Use of the various taxa is compared between five districts within Central Province of Kenya. The commonest species in this pharmacopoeia are: Caesalpinia volkensii Harms, Strychnos henningsii Gilg, Ajuga remota Benth., Warbugia ugandensis Sprague and Olea europaea L. The first three species are used in all the five districts while the others are restricted in some of the districts. In 74% of the anti-malarial plant species reported in this study, the remedies are obtained in destructive manner and may need conservation measures to ensure sustainable utilization. The results of this study become a basis for selecting plants for further pharmacological and phytochemical studies in developing new and locally relevant anti-malarial agents.

AB Despite rather broad definitions, global analysis showed that seamount fishes, particularly seamount-aggregating fishes, had higher intrinsic vulnerability than other groups of fishes. The pattern was similar when considering only commercially exploited species. Biological characteristics leading to greater vulnerability included a longer life span, later sexual maturation, slower growth and lower natural mortality. The results supported the contention that seamount fishes, especially those that aggregate on seamounts, are highly vulnerable to exploitation and that fishing on seamounts may not be sustainable at current levels and with current methods. A number of seamount populations have already been depleted; more depletion, extirpations, and even species extinctions may follow if fishing on seamounts is not reduced.

AB We investigated C and N cycling in long-term agroecological experiments initiated over 50 years ago at a cool, semi-arid site on the North American Great Plains. We used isotopes at natural abundance to trace C and N exchange between soils and plants in contrasting cropping systems. Both C-13 and C-14 indicated that the soil organic matter was isotopically distinct from current plant inputs, suggesting that recently added plant C was cycling independently of much of the soil C pool. For tracing recent C flows, bomb-C-14 was more sensitive than C-13, and increased more in high - than in low - yielding systems. Analysis of N-15 in plant tissues, as an index of N-15 in actively cycling soil N, suggested that biological and industrial N fixation both tended to decrease plant N-15, whereas livestock manure addition increased N-15 abundance. Collectively, the data suggest that soil organic matter is kinetically heterogeneous, so that a majority of soil C and N inputs and outputs exchange with only the small pool of soil organic matter that is actively cycling. Consequently, recently photosynthesized C and deposited N may not readily enter the old, stable fractions of soil organic matter. Practices to retain CO2 from the atmosphere and prevent leakage of reactive N to non-agricultural systems should therefore focus on management of this active pool.

AB A call for combining the strengths of geographic education with environmental education to produce an 'education for sustainability' addresses local problems for sustainable development. A place-based approach encourages civic responsibility among students. Using service-learning to extend education beyond the classroom in this case study connected students with local clients in a watershed-based initiative. Theoretical underpinnings of service-learning for geographic education are discussed, and the case study is viewed from instructor, student, and client perspectives to identify successful outcomes and provide suggestions for those who might adopt service-learning for the first time.

TI False, cheap and degraded: when history, economy and environment
   collided at Cades Cove, Great Smoky Mountains National Park
SO JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY

AB Great Smoky Mountains National Park was created in 1934 after decades of popular activism. The National Park Service initially planned to restore wildness to all formerly settled lands through the process of secondary succession, but did not in a valley in the northwest corner of the park, Cades Cove. Transforming the 1200-ha agricultural setting into forest would have eliminated the visual charm highly prized by the tourists who had long come there. Additionally, experts promoted the preservation of Cades Cove's historic-cultural landscape because they falsely perceived the local culture to be a relic of the past. The Park Service acceded, but its commitment to historic preservation was tempered by a concern to minimize its expenses. Consequently, an agricultural permit system was adopted in 1945, which allowed modern farmers to operate on the historic landscape, keeping it open. This cheap method kept open the beautiful vistas of Cades Cove. Unfortunately, the agency's commitment to beauty and economy led to decades of ecological degradation, including water pollution and species extirpation. Only in the last two decades, has park management moved away from its focus on a low-cost, attractive landscape to embrace one that is also ecologically healthy, and thus more sustainable.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID RECHARGE
AB The city of Beijing has long-term concerns over the sustainable yield from its groundwater aquifers. The aquifers provide half of the city's water supply and have seen falling water tables over the past century. The sustainable yield of aquifers below urban Beijing is assessed based on changes to the groundwater budget equation from virgin conditions. Sources of anthropogenic recharge, including leakage from water mains and sewer pipes, seepage from septic tanks, irrigation, gardening, and artificial recharge, are together as large as changes to the groundwater flux as a result of groundwater withdrawals. Changes to natural recharge, and to a lesser extent natural discharge, also significantly impact the water budget. Uncertainty persists in several components of the budget equation, in particular changes to the groundwater flux. Estimates of the upper and lower bounds for sustainable yield are relatively unchanged for the years 2000, 2010, and 2015. However, the components of the budget will change as seepage from septic tanks is expected to decrease. Uncertainty in the likely range of sustainable yield is reduced by conducting Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations indicate there is a 96% chance that the lower pumping rate established in 1990 is sustainable. However, with between 30 and 60% of the water budget provided by treated or untreated wastewater, there must be long-term concerns over the quality of the groundwater supply.

AB In recent years, with half the world's population living in towns and cities and most of them relying heavily on public transport to meet their mobility needs, efficient and effective public transport operations have become critical to sustainable economic and social development. Nowadays, Light Rail Transit Systems (LRTSs) are considered to be the most promising technological approach to satisfy these needs, i.e. to ensure efficient and reliable urban mobility. However, LRTSs are subject to frequent minor disrupted transit operations, often caused by stochastic variations of passenger demand at stations and traffic conditions on the service routes, which increase passenger waiting times discouraging them from using the transit system. Although these minor disruptions usually last no longer than a few minutes, they can degrade the level of service significantly on a short headway service. In this paper the authors propose a real-time disruption control model for LRTSs based on an integrated quantitative forecasting and regularization approach. The forecasting component relies on Artificial Neural Networks, a non-parametric computational model that has proved to be particularly efficient for the forecasting task in several applicative domains. The regularization engine involves the formulation of a constrained mathematical programming problem which can be solved quickly and, therefore, is well suited for real-time disruption control. The conceptual model is applied to a case study concerning the transit line number 7 operating in the urban area of Milan. To validate the proposed forecasting and regularization framework an experimental plan has been designed and performed under different traffic and passengers demand fluctuation conditions. The results of the simulation study witness the efficacy of the overall approach to forecast and regularize the considered LRTSs.

AB Calcium and aluminium incorporation into a sodium borosilicate glass with base composition 0.30Na(2)O : 0.46SiO(2) : 0.24B(2)O(3) was investigated. Glasses of general compositions (0.30 - x/3.3)Na2O : xCaO : (0.46 - x/2.2)SiO2 : (0.24 - x 4.2)B2O3 (Cx) and (0.3 - x/3.3)Na2O : xAl(2)O(3) : (0.46 - x/2.2)SiO2 : (0.24 - x/4.2)B2O3 (Ax) were prepared by melt quenching. All the samples were tested for glass-ionomer cement formation. Glasses in the Cx system did not yield sustainable cements on mixing at glass to liquid ratios of 2.4 : 1. The glasses of system Ax were unmixable at glass to liquid ratios between 2.4 : 1 and 1.5 : 1, with the exception of the sample with composition x = 0.3, which was mixable at a glass to liquid ratio of 2.4 : 1, producing a cement with an average compressive strength of 69.3 MPa (sigma = 6.1 MPa). B-11, Na-23, Al-27 and Si-29 magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterize the structure of the glass and cement samples. The results showed that the calcium boroaluminosilicate glass compositions have the potential to be used as solid components in the preparation of glass-ionomer cement formulations.

AB Most of the SARS-CoV-infected patients spontaneously recovered without clinical intervention while a small percentage succumbed to the disease. Here, we characterized temporal changes in N protein-specific and S glycoprotein-specific neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses in infected patients who have either recovered from or succumbed to SARS-CoV infection. Recovered patients were found to have higher and sustainable levels of both N protein-specific and S glycoprotein-specific Nab responses, suggesting that antibody responses likely play an important role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of SARS-CoV-infected patients.

AB Uniform and aligned Nickel Oxide (NiO) nanotube bundles have been synthesized by a template process. Individual nanotubes are 60 mu m long with a 200 nm outer diameter and wall thickness of 20-30 nm. The synthesis involved forming Ni(OH)(2) nanotubes that were subsequently heated to 350 degrees C in order to fully convert the product to NiO nanotubes. NiO nanotube powder was used in lithium-ion cells for assessment of lithium storage ability and electrochemical performance. Discharge capacity of the NiO nanotube electrode was in excess of 30% higher than that of the standard NiO nanocrystalline powder electrode after 20 cycles. Impedance data suggests the NiO nanotube electrode provides more controlled and sustainable Li diffusion when compared to the NiO reference powder electrode system.

AB The bio-reduction method is reported as a part of a complimentary self-sustained technology, where bioremediation and metal particle production are related. The use of the characterization methods in this self sustainable technique open the expectative to be used for several other elements and with other plants, which will be discussed. However, the particular case of Mn nanoparticles involves an important option to generate nanoparticles in the range of 1-4 nanometers with a well controlled size and with a structure based on an fcc-like geometry for the smallest clusters and with more complex arrays for cluster greater than four shells, which involves magnetic moments significantly related to their atomistic configuration. At the same time, the use of the characterization methods establishes the dependence of the nanoparticle's size on the pH conditions used during the synthesis; small clusters in the range of 1-2 nm were generated using pH = 5, and it was shown that for the smallest aggregates, simple polyhedron shapes are stable.

TI Romania"s economic policy: rulers' wisdom will lead us
SO JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE economic policy; emerging markets; market economy; macroeconomics;
   Romania
AB Purpose - To highlight the key-role of macroeconomic management in a dysfunctional emerging market economy.
   Design/methodology/approach - The analysis - focused on the particular case of Romania, where the transition to market economy is underway-relies on two basic hypotheses. According to the former, the reform programs implemented during the 1990s failed to take into account some fundamental correlations such as the one between reform measures and the real state of the economy (more specifically, the presence or absence of distortions). Another important correlation must exist between various types of macroeconomic policies, whether designed to trigger changes in the real economy (e.g. transfer of ownership, etc.) or aimed at securing macro-stabilization. According to the latter hypothesis, overlooking such correlations will jeopardize both macroeconomic equilibrium and the soundness of future growth.
   Findings - The data illustrating the evolution of Romania's economy during 1995-2003 confirm the aforementioned hypotheses. Although the economy started growing at a fairly-high rate after 1999, growth has been mostly immiserizing and hardly sustainable since. This outcome can be illustrated by using well-known models such as Bhagwati's generalized theory of distortions and welfare and Mundell's approach of macroeconomic policies under imperfect capital mobility.
   Originality/value - The use of the "immiserizing growth" concept in depicting Romania's economic evolution after 2000 is most likely an element of originality. The paper might be valuable for emphasizing the imperfections of the Romanian "government-central bank" tandem.

AB Study Design: A single-group comparative study.
   Objectives: To compare lumbopelvic kinematics and muscle activation patterns while sitting on stable and unstable surfaces.
   Background: Unstable surfaces are commonly used during the rehabilitation of certain low back pain disorders. The benefits postulated are increased muscle activity and facilitation of sustainable midrange positions via neuromuscular control. The use of unstable sitting devices in the workplace is controversial, as the postulated increase in muscle activity is thought to lead to a muscle fatigue/pain response. However, little evidence exists for or against the ability of these devices to alleviate or prevent spinal pain.
   Methods and Measures: This study included 26 healthy adults (14 male, 12 female). Fastrak 3-dimensional motion analysis detected lumbar curvature, pelvic tilt, and postural sway during sitting on a stable and unstable surface over 5-minute periods. Surface electromyography was used to measure activity in the superficial lumbar multifidus, transverse fibers of internal oblique, and iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis.
   Results: Spinal postures were similar for sitting on a stable and unstable surface. Significant increases in postural sway were detected (P = .013) in 3 dimensions of movement during sitting on an unstable surface. Gender differences were noted. No EMG amplitude or variance differences were detected between seating conditions.
   Conclusions: Preliminary data show that sitting on unstable surfaces induces greater spinal motion, but does not significantly alter the lumbosacral posture nor the amount of activity in the superficial trunk muscles under investigation.

AB In a field experiment from 1995 to 2001, options of weed control in genetically modified, glufosinate resistant (Liberty Link) sugar beets have been evaluated. These sugar beets were cultivated under conventional (PF) and conservative tillage methods (MU). The field trail show that by using herbicide resistant sugar beets; it was possible to reduce the frequency of treatments with herbicides as well as the amount of herbicide used.
   In the years 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2001 the field trials were destroyed by unknown persons. Despite that fact, it was possible to come to statements concerning the use of the herbicide resistant technology (HR Technology). Through the opportunity of a later herbicide use the integrated weed control in the sugar beet cultivation can be developed further. The control of weeds requires a very early herbicide application, since the authorized products only achieve a satisfying efficacy, if the weeds are still in the cotyledonous and first leaf stages. Therefore, under current practical conditions, a consequent and integrated weed management based on threshold levels cannot be realised. This concept applies weed control only in critical periods of sugar beet growth.
   The experiment showed that the effect of Liberty 18 SL (Glufosinate 183g/1) on important arable weeds allows a later application. This could be the basis for further enhancements of weed control systems in the sugar beet cultivation and enables the sugar beet grower to conduct a more targeted weed control. Weeds mostly affect sugar beets at a later stage of development.
   Through the cultivation of genetically modified, herbicide resistant sugar beets, it was possible to reduce the frequency of herbicide applications as far as to one application. The application of the soil sparing conservative cultivation method in sugar beet cultivation can be facilitated by the use of the HRTechnology. Thus, it could be possible to reduce pre-emergence treatments with herbicides.
   Furthermore, the trials showed that a more flexible weed management is possible through the combination of herbicide resistant sugar beets with the herbicide Liberty 18 SL. That enables the sugar beet grower to conduct the herbicide application at a time. Thereby, soil structure damages can be minimized and consequently, the sustainability of modern agricultural cropping systems can be improved.

AB In the intensive winter-wheat growing areas, characterized by winter crop mono-culture, no ploughing, early seeding times and heavy soils, typical for the coastal and river marshlands in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, black-grass populations were selected over several years, which exhibit resistance against several herbicides from different mode of action classes. A monitoring program was conducted over 4 years, and confintied in 2004 again the results from 2001-2003 that practically all resistant populations had developed a metabolic resistance mechanism. On 2 locations an additional ACCase-target-site resistance was found. A mathematical model developed for metabolic resistance demonstrates that such black-grass populations can not be controlled in a sustainable manner by only relying on herbicides. A successful long-term strategy includes a combination of agronomic measures, in particular ploughing, and herbicide programs. Mixtures of different herbicides are usually more effective than sequences in programs. Herbicide programs should aim for optimum control in the fall. Lexus (R) (flupyrsulfuron-m) + a residual herbicide, applied early post-cm fall, consistently showed high levels of control. The pre-treatment with flupyrsulfuron-m has a positive effect on the activity against black-grass of a subsequently applied ALS-inhibitor herbicide.

AB Black grass is a hard-to-control grass, especially in areas with crop rotation of cereals and oilseed rape. Besides cultivation practice, alternating use of herbicides with different modes of action in tank mix or spraying course is the most important measure for achieving a sustainable control and prevention of resistance development. The urea derivatives Isoproturon (IPU) and Chlorotoluron (CTU) are belonging to the herbicides most frequently used in Europe against the grass. While IPU has been used in Germany since more than 40 years without interruption, registration of CTU-containing formulations has expired in 1998. For Lentipur CL 700, a 700 g/l Chlorotoluron SC formulation, the registration in Germany is expected for June 2006. In trials conducted in parallel to the registration process, the efficacy of the formulation alone and in tank mixture with Ralon Super was tested at post emergence timing in autumn. The trials showed, that the combination of 2,0 l/ha Lentipur CL 700 with 1,0 l/ha Ralon Super is providing a high level of safety for black grass control also under difficult conditions. Investigations on sensitivity of black grass samples against CTU in the greenhouse revealed results correlating to that on field efficacy of Lentipur CL 700.

AB Information on the contribution of various soil nitrogen (N) sources to plant N uptake is often needed for the implementation of sustainable or site-specific management practices in agriculture. Considering the limitations of traditional methods in meeting these needs, this study investigated the potential of leaf delta N-15 as an early indicator of nutrient deficiency in cotton. The spatial and temporal natural abundance of N-15 was measured in the soil and leaves of a fertilized cotton field located near the village of Moschochori (Larissa, Greece). The isotopic signal of the leaves was interpreted in the context of the relative contribution of fertilizer to cotton N uptake,as has been demonstrated in the past for other agricultural crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivam L.) and corn (Zea mays). Spatial variability of leaf delta N-15 was high early in the growing season (June), reflecting differences in fertilizer N availability and uptake between the east and west side of the field, as well as differences resulting from soil denitrification in depressions. The west side of the field appears to have lost significant amounts of fertilizer N, due to leaching during the rainy period in May, that accumulated in depressions near the waterway. In the subsequent months, the isotopic signal of the leaves was consistently high and indicated reduced fertilizer N uptake on the west side that resulted in deficiencies of N as well as of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). The significant correlations of mid-square leaf delta N-15 with late-season nutrient content and soil elelctrical conductivity(EC) provided evidence that the natural abundance of N-15 was a sensitive indicator of soil and plant nutrient status in this fertilized cotton field.

AB Phosphorus (P) nutrition of the rice-wheat (RW) systems of the Indo-Gangetic Plain of South Asia has become important due to the alternate flooding and drying cycles of this crop rotation. Field experiments on the RW cropping sequence were conducted at three locations of Bangladesh on three soil types. Two fertilizer doses-farmers' practice (FP) and soil-test based (STB), containing recommended amounts of P, nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and other nutrients-were compared with mungbean or maize as a third crop. The objective of the experiments was to detect P deficiency, if any, in rice, wheat, mungbean, and maize, and to compare the FP and STB doses of fertilizers in rice-wheat-mungbean and rice-wheat-maize sequences under two mungbean management practices (residue removed or retained) and one maize management practice (residue removed) in terms of P nutrition of those crops and annual system-level P removal and apparent P balance in the soil. The apparent P balance was negative with the FP dose (-1 to -9 kg ha(-1) for mungbean sequences at Joydebpur and Nashipur) and there was soil P accumulation under both the STB dose (9-49 kg ha(-1)) and zero N control (13-50 kg ha(-1)) across sites. The effect of maize or mungbean as the pre-rice crop on the apparent P balance of various RW sequences was not significant. Phosphorus deficiency occurred at all sites in wheat and maize, and at Ishwordi in rice, suggesting that P fertilizer recommendations need to be revised for RW systems in Bangladesh. The results also suggest that long-term monitoring for P concentration, uptake, and balance would be necessary for improving not only the productivity and sustainability of this system but also the fertilizer P-use efficiency.

AB Oligomeric polyether polyols were obtained through the acid-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of epoxidized methyl oleate and the subsequent partial reduction of ester groups to give primary alcohols. The oligomers were characterized with titration, spectroscopic techniques (Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, size exclusion chromatography, and differential scanning calorimetry. Depending on the degree of reduction, polyols of different hydroxyl content values were obtained and were reacted with 4,4'-methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate) to yield polyurethanes. These materials, which were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, could behave as hard rubbers or rigid plastics.

AB Guayule is a shrub native to Mexico growing in semiarid lands, that may be incorporated into the semiarid region production system as a complement for annual crops. The possibility to develop this natural resource as a sustainable industrial source of natural rubber, may improve the socio-economical level of people living at the guayule region and favor the agricultural development near the US-Mexico border. Despite the existence of natural stands in Mexico with guayule plants of different rubber content, a program envisaging selection of plants with high rubber synthesis potential joined to agronomic management practices are required. This could achieve the rubber yield needed to guarantee a constant supply of raw material for an industrial processing plant. This paper reviews R&D work carried out in Mexico for the last 25 years, including genetic aspects and evaluation of guayule response to environmental and agronomic factors. Relevant results showed plants with up to 21% rubber content and the existence of diploid plants, which could facilitate future plant breeding programs.

TI Re-conceptualising rural resources as countryside capital: The case of
   rural tourism
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE rural tourism; constant capital approach; countryside capital;
   investment; promotional images
AB Commentators tend to agree that the rural resource is becoming increasingly subject to pressures arising from an ever wider range of economic, social, political and environmental influences. This paper focuses on the case of rural tourism in illustrating the advantages of adopting a sustainable development approach to identifying suitable policies and strategic action plans to assist in addressing these increasingly complex challenges. The central proposition is that much can be achieved in raising the profile of rural tourism and the nature of its interdependence with rural resources by re-conceptualising the rural resource as a kind of 'capital asset' of the rural tourism industry. Drawing on recent thinking by ecological economists, an approach based on the concept of the constant capital rule is set out. The paper then outlines some of the benefits of re-casting the rural resource as 'countryside capital', using two case-study vignettes by way of illustration. A major conclusion is that re-conceptualising the rural resource as countryside capital provides a more holistic and integrated understanding of the rural tourism production system, which will be required if rural communities are to capture more effectively the potential benefits rural tourism has to offer them. This, in turn, enables a much clearer articulation of the rationale for public-, private- and voluntary-sector investment in rural resources to be made. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A cooperative publishing model for sustainable scholarship
SO JOURNAL OF SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING
LA English
DT Article
AB Organizing scholarly publishing as a cooperative business has the promise of making journals more affordable and scholarly publishing more sustainable. The authors describe the development of the modern cooperative from its beginnings in England during the Industrial Revolution and highlight the great extent and diversity of business worldwide that is currently done cooperatively. Some of the current initiatives in scholarly publishing (SPARC, PLoS, German Academic Publishing, etc.) are analysed in light of cooperative business principles, and it is shown that, while these models often partially utilize cooperative business practices, none of them has adopted the cooperative model in totality.
   A cooperative can be defined for practical purposes as a democratic association of persons organized to furnish themselves an economic service under a plan that eliminates entrepreneur profit and that provides for substantial equality in ownership and control(1).

TI Land tenure management: A key determinant of sustainable farming in
   Martinique
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE land tenure; sustainable development; sustainable farming; Martinique
AB For the past 15 years, the notion of sustainable farming has become a constant reference in defining rural development policies. For many years, "Sustainable farming" was limited to the reproducibility of eco-systems without considering social and economic factors. Yet, in Martinique, as in many other insular states in the Caribbean, control over the way farmland is managed is a prerequisite in defining any so-called Sustainable farming policy. The analysis of changes in the use of farmland shows that the inter-generational transfer of land is not assured: the usable agricultural area has decreased by 38% in less than 30 years, with, nevertheless, substantial spatial variations. In the same way, it appears that because of their size, more than 50% of farms are today economically not viable. In addition, different studies on fanning practices show that the land tenure structures of the farms may constitute an obstacle to the application of environment-friendly practices. To address this problem, many regulations-instruments-have been adopted and institutional bodies created in recent decades at different levels of local government. In spite of all these initiatives, and owing to lack of political will and the paradoxical attitudes of farmers and their representatives (who, "in the name of the farming profession," call for the preservation of farmland but whose interests at the individual level are to have their land developed to permit construction), most of these measures have not had the desired effect. In the last three or four years, new initiatives have been adopted (implementation of the control of land tenure structures and local-level planning for sustainable development). The future of agriculture in Martinique-and therefore its sustainability-will probably depend on the rigour with which these measures are applied.

TI Experiences in implementing the bean seed strategy in Malawi
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

DT Article
DE bean seed strategy; seed multiplication; seed distribution; variety
   promotion; small seed pack
AB This is a follow-up paper describing experiences gained from the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) seed strategy in Malawi, published in the Journal of Sustainable Agriculture in 2000. The strategy included: informal seed multiplication using smallholder farmers; informal seed distribution using grocery shops, rural traders, extension agents, health clinics, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); intensified publicity through promotional materials like posters, leaflets, brochures and radio messages; and informal outlets such as farmers, NGOs, extension agencies, village traders and various other institutions. A high rate of success was achieved using this strategy in making bean seeds available to farmers on a pilot scale. Farmers showed considerable interest in purchasing seeds of newly released bean varieties in Malawi. The quantity of seed produced and distributed over the years increased considerably. Introduction of small seed packs helped to improve smallholder farmers' access to seeds of new bean varieties. The small seed packs sold fast because they were affordable and potable, making it easy to reach many farmers in the rural communities. Farmers were willing to try several varieties with minimal investment. Introduction of color posters helped to create rapid awareness and promoted the new varieties. However, bean as a self-pollinated crop provides limited profit margins, so the private sector has not yet shown the desired interest in seed production and distribution, despite that there is substantial demand for bean seed in Malawi.

AB The objectives of this study were to document changes over time in soil nitrate and phosphorus (P) concentrations, percentage of ground cover, rooting holes, and gilt and litter productivity for pastures of "Spar" old-world bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum) that were either burned or not burned before occupation. Pregnant gilts (seven in each pasture; n = 56) were assigned at random to each of four replicated treatments of burned or non-burned pastures (0.4 ha each). Each pasture was subdivided into three regions: (1) inner-hub, (2) middle, and (3) outer-with a feeding place along the fence-line. Soil samples (12 per pasture) were collected at 0-15.2 cm depth every 30 days and assayed for nitrate, and percentage of ground cover visually estimated. Four composites from initial and final soil samples, corresponding to the three regions Plus the feeding place, were used to determine P concentration. Rooting holes were counted and sizes measured on day 0, 30, and 60. Ground cover decreased (P < 0.05) initially when precipitation was limited but did not differ (P > 0.49) between burned and non-burned pastures. Numbers (0.18/d) and sizes (55 cm(2)/d) of rooting holes increased (P < 0.05) with time, and non-burned pastures had more (P < 0.01) rooting holes than burned pastures at day 60. Soil nitrate concentration were higher (P < 0.05) on day 90 for non-burned pastures than the burned but not on other day (P < 0.20) and concentration in the outer region increased (P < 0.03) with time. Phosphorus concentration did not differ (P > 0.08) between treatments; however, the feeding place had higher (P < 0.05) concentration than other regions. There also was a trend (P < 0.08) for non-burned pastures having higher P concentration by day 150. Gilts on non-burned pastures lost more (P < 0.05) body weight during lactation than those on previously burned pastures. Burning a pasture and stocking it with gilts during winter impacted groundcover negatively in terms of both vegetative growth and botanical composition. During periods of' low rainfall, nutrients accumulated in soil, especially in pasture with dormant vegetation, denuded ground, or places where feeding on the ground occurred. Pasturing pregnant pigs could help in general distribution and recycling of nutrients as well as potentials of mitigating the negative public perceptions on animal welfare typical of conventional systems, but animal and environmental management aspects need further studies.

DE AEZ; agricultural land region; land suitability; sustainable
AB A study was conducted to establish an approach to land development for sustainable agriculture of the Kotawaringin Barat Regency, Kalimantan, Indonesia. The study comprised three parts, namely, developing the agroecological zone (AEZ), establishing agricultural land regions, and determining land suitability of these regions for several existing crops. On the basis of land characteristics, climatic data, 4-slope classes, and the isohyperthermic temperature regime, Kotawaringin Barat Regency was divided into four main agroecological zones. The area covered by zone I, II, III, and IV were 12.45%, 33.4%, 10.89%, and 43.26%, respectively. The steep upland areas of zone I would be left undisturbed for native forest and wildlife reservation. The moderately steep areas of zone II would be suitable for hardy perennial crops. The gentle sloping areas of zone III would be suitable for agro-forestry and annual crop cultivation. Depending upon the soil types, the lowland, and swampy areas of zone IV would either be left for mangrove forest production or for annual crop cultivation. Overlaying the AEZ map with the present land use map generated an agricultural land region map, creating areas known as extensification, intensification and conservation zones. These areas are biophysically determined and ecologically sustainable. More than 60% of the total land area of Kotawaringin is suitable for agriculture, leaving almost 40% for native forest conservation. The arable agricultural lands under the extensification and intensification zones were evaluated for their suitability to some existing perennial and annual crops cultivation. The lands were classified as highly suitable (S1) to marginally suitable (S3) for commercial crops such as rubber and oil palm, and staple food crops like upland rice and wetland rice.

ID N2 FIXATION
AB Certain microorganisms fix atmospheric nitrogen in the root nodule of trees by establishing a symbiotic relationship. Rhizobium usually infects legume trees for nodulation while Frankia is an actinomycete, which is known for actinorhizal symbiosis with nonlegumes. However, Azospirillium is an associative symbiotic nitrogen-fixing organism. Vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi help plants absorb phosphorous. These four microorganisms were examined in the present study. An experiment was conducted by inoculating Frankia, Rhizobium, and Azospirillum either singly or in combination with VAM to Casuarina equisetifolia, Acacia nilotica and Eucalyptus tereticornis. The inoculation resulted in high biomass built up over control. Casuarina equisetifolia and Acacia nilotica developed more nodules with higher nodule dry mass and high nodule nitrogenase activity compared to control. From the result it is important to note that the dual inoculation namely Frankia + VAM, Rhizobium + VAM, and Azosprillum + VAM showed higher productivity than single inoculation in all the above three tree species.

DE contract farming; corn; farm characteristics; soybeans; specialty grain;
   value-added; value-enhanced
AB This study examines the farmer and farm operations characteristics of producers growing specialty corn and soybeans under contract. By identifying the class of farmers participating in value-added grain production, a better assessment of how and where contract farming is penetrating the grain sector can be made. If family farms are to counteract this growing agricultural industrialization, they must be willing to utilize sustainable agricultural practices as an alterative means to achieve growth and sustainability. Utilizing two case studies, one in Iowa and one in Nebraska, 114 contract growers were surveyed. The findings were compared with the general farm population in Iowa and Nebraska and to the general farm population in those counties in which the majority of contract growers in the survey reside. The survey results reveal that contract growers farm more land, are younger in age; are more educated, rely more heavily on hired labor, and are less likely to work off the farming operation than farmers in the general farm population. Many of the contract grower operations also possess three characteristics which make them attractive to contracting firms: access to large transportation equipment such as semis that can haul grain long distances, segmented storage to separate specialty and commodity grains, and irrigation to reduce production risks.

AB The aim of this study is to determine the energy input and output for wheat and cotton production in the Southeastern Anatolia region of Turkey. The data used in this study were collected through a questionnaire by face-to-face interviews. In the study, the inputs included human labor, machinery, electricity, diesel fuel, oil, fertilizers and seeds which were taken into account in calculation of energy use for wheat and cotton production. Energy values were calculated by multiplying the amounts of inputs and outputs by their energy equivalents with the use of related conversion factors. The output/input ratio was determined by dividing the output value by the input. The total energy used in various farm inputs were 17160 MJ/ha for wheat and 39538 MJ/ha for cotton production. The energy output/input ratio was found to be 2.21 for wheat and 2.38 for cotton production. The specific energy for wheat and cotton production was 7.18 MJ/kg and 10.52 MJ/kg, while the energy productivity was found to be of the order of 0.14 kg/MJ and 0.095 kg/MJ, respectively. The results of the study reveal that improper production techniques applied at improper time, and irrational input use are the main causes of inefficiencies in energy use. Reduced tillage methods should be adopted in order to achieve considerable savings, particularly in mechanical energy.

AB Approximately 25% of the soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] grown in the mid-South is produced in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-soybean double-crop system. Pre-soybean field preparations often consist of removing wheat residue by burning followed by conventional tillage (CT). However, crop residue burning has serious negative environmental consequences and will likely be outlawed in the future. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of alternative wheat-residue management practices, tillage [no-tillage (NT) and CT], burning (burn and no burn), and wheat-residue level (low and high), on soil surface properties after two full cropping cycles in a wheat-soybean double-crop production system on two silt-loam Alfisols in east-central Arkansas. Soil bulk density increased over time, but the increase was unaffected by imposed treatments. Changes in soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were generally unaffected by tillage or burning, whereas soil EC increased by 7% under the high and decreased by 8% under the low wheat-residue level treatment at one location, but not the other. Mehlich-3-extractable Mg and Zn increased more and Na decreased less under NT than CT at one location or the other. Soil organic matter and total N and C also increased more under NT than CT at one location, but not the other. The results of this study indicate that, in a wheat-soybean double-crop production system in a relatively warm and wet environment, numerous soil properties can be improved more under NT than CT and more when crop residues are left unburned than when they are removed by burning. Extended use of alternative wheat-residue management practices that improve soil tilth will result in more sustainable agriculture and likely increase production.

AB Sustainable increase in agricultural production was achieved in the past through the use of bush-fallow farming system. Extensive land use due to urbanization, increase in population and high farming population has led to reduction in fallow period. As a consequence, rapid deterioration of soil structure and declining productivity constitute major problems of agricultural productivity. Amid the efforts for increase in agricultural productivity, many developing Countries are concerned about the environmental effects of agricultural technologies. The focus is on sustainable agricultural technologies that can increase yield as well as regenerate soil fertility without fallow. This was achieved through alley farming developed by researchers in the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria. This paper examines the impact of alley farming on crops and livestock production. Surveys indicate that farmers are adopting the technology and that the initial adopters continue to use alley farming. Crops yield increased with alley farming and hedgerows reduced erosion and runoff. When prunings from Leucaena leucocephala and Gliricidia sepium planted in alley farms were fed to cattle and ruminant animals, there was increased survival and body weight. Moreover, dairy cow milk production increased significantly.
   Constraints to alley farming adoption include lack of knowledge about its benefits and lack of money. The paper concludes with suggestions for effective extension of alley farming to enhance adoption.

AB Mining of nutrients from soil is a major problem causing soil degradation and threatening long-term food production in developing countries. In this paper an attempt was made for carrying out nutrient audits, which includes the calculation of nutrient balance at micro- (plot/field) and meso-level (farm) and evaluation of trends in nutrient mining/enrichment. A nutrient budget is an account of inputs and outputs of nutrients in an agricultural system. NUTrient MONitoring (NUTMON) is a multiscale approach that assesses the stocks and flows of N, P, and K in a well-defined geographical unit based on the inputs viz., mineral fertilizers, manures, atmospheric deposition and sedimentation and outputs of harvested crop products, residues, leaching, denitrification, and erosion losses. The calculated nutrient balances at crop activity level indicated a negative balance for cereals and pulses, whereas positive for most of the horticultural crops. Similarly the results showed a negative balance for N and K and positive for P at farm level. Soil nutrient pool has to offset the negative balance of N and K, hence there will be an expected mining of nutrients from the soil reserve in the study area. The management options/policy interventions to mitigate this mining by manipulating all inputs and outputs in a judicious way with an integrated system approach are also discussed.

AB AKIS performance is vital especially, for the countries with overly rural populated and considerable important agricultural economies like Turkey. In the Study, the comparative analysis has been done for examining AKISs of conventional and ecological raisin farming in the Manisa Province of Turkey. According to the findings, outsider actors direct both the AKISs. The farmer groups operate with low technology adoption level and public extension service has not any field-level activity about ecological farming. The employing approaches in both AKISs are based on traditional models. The most important pillars of sustainable development such as participatory approaches and empowering the local were not recognized in the region.

AB This paper examines the role of organic farmer networks in facilitating farmer innovations in complex agro-ecological farming systems through a study of a sample of organic farmers in the northeastern tier of New York State. Building on a knowledge systems and social learning perspective, it illustrates how learning is triggered and agricultural innovations diffused among a broader community of sustainable producers through an interactive, participatory style of problem solving. Finally, the paper links farmers' social learning processes to extension through a critical reflection on the potential niches in organic farmer management for extension practice.

ID SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; INDUSTRY
AB This study examines the seed supply system for maize production ill Southwestern Nigeria in order to characterise the local seed system and to assess the potentials of the maize seed sector in the development of sustainable crop improvement and enhanced agricultural productivity. Using structured questionnaires, a seed survey was conducted among 94 farmers randomly sampled from 5 farm settlement locations covering 3 states in the region. The data collected were subjected to descriptive analysis of simple proportions and percentages. All improved varieties on the sampled farms were the IITA elite varieties. At all locations, the percentage of total land area cultivated with the seeds of improved varieties ranged from 71 to 100%, while percentage of land area sown with local varieties ranged from 0 to 29%. Seed use in terms of volume followed the same pattern. The highest proportion of farmers (about 50%) who planted improved varieties used seeds from previously saved harvests, while 25% procured them from extension agents, 17% bought them from seed dealers, 5% from research institutes and the farmer-to-farmer exchange was negligible. About 39% of farmers used improved varieties for high crop yields, 24% for disease resistance and 22% for market preferences, whereas local varieties were cultivated by 37% of farmers because of market preferences and availability, 16% because of low cost and 12% because of disease resistance. The implications of the results on sustainable economic development of the seed industry and suggestions for strengthening of the commercial seed sector are discussed.

AB Yemen's agriculture and water resources sectors are in a crisis. The water availability is 150 m(3)/cap/a. This compares with an average of 1250 m(3)/cap/a for the Middle East and North Africa. All surface water and groundwater resources are exploited beyond the level of recharge. The agriculture industry uses 93% of the potable water, and does not actively encourage sustainable water saving techniques. Qat (Catha edulis; recreational drug) cultivation uses 40% of the potable water. ne water crisis could be mitigated by reducing qat production, and promoting water reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation. However, this is Currently socially unacceptable.

AB The degradation of natural resources has a direct and significant impact on those living in rural areas. The resultant increasing pressure that is placed on the livelihoods of rural people leads to desperate and poor agricultural practices, which in turn cause further degradation of natural resources. The LandCare programme of the South African national government aims to address these problems by facilitating rural agricultural projects that are Sustainable in the long term. This paper summarises the development of a new set of project selection criteria for the evaluation of project proposals in order to compile an effective LandCare programme portfolio. The new project selection criteria were developed through a review of current literature, existing criteria applied in previously selected projects and interviews with key stakeholders during project site visits. These site visits were also used to determine criterion weights, which were calculated using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a known decision-analysis technique. The established set of criteria was applied to three case studies in South Africa, through which an evaluation procedure is further demonstrated. Thereby a successful project portfolio can be ensured that is dedicated to all three components of sustainable development in rural areas.

AB Tin tailings are characterized by coarse sand; low in nutrient content, water-holding capacity, pH, organic matter and microbial activity; poor/absence of soil aggregation and high surface soil temperature. Therefore, the area is unsuitable for agriculture and forestry. An attempt was made to rejuvenate these lands into a Sustainable production system through establishment of Acacia mangium and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) agroforestry (AF) system. Performance of A. mangium and peanut AF system with different P rates and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) inoculation was studied on degraded ex-tin mining land in Serdang, Malaysia. Three P rates viz. 0, 50 and 100 g Gafsa phosphate rock (GPR) plant(-1) in combination with and without AM were evaluated on A. mangium seedlings during 190 to 290 days after planting (DAP). The experiment was conducted in split-plot design with three replications. Peanut was sown in the alleys of A. mangium at 185 DAP. Three P rates at 0, 50 and 100 kg P ha(-1) along with and without AM were studied on peanut. Growth of A. mangium given 50 g GPR plant(-1) with AM was found higher throughout the study, while at 100 kg P ha(-1) with AM was optimum for peanut. The application of AM and P fertilizer tended to increase soil organic-C, N and available P. There was an indication of improvement of soil fertility with such cropping, which might also ensure better future production.

AB High water tables threaten the sustainability of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), the primary crop of Florida's Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of water-table depth on morphological characters, single-leaf net photosynthetic rate (Ps), and growth of sugarcane. In pot studies, single stools of sugarcane cultivar CP 80-1743 were grown at eight equally spaced water-table depths from 5 to 33 cm (2 to 13 in). Large-tiller number of CP 80-1743 increased by 0.2 for each cm (0.4 in) increase of water-table depth, and stalk diameter increased as water-table depth increased from 5 through 23 cm (2 through 9 in). In lysimeter studies, responses of two genotypes to,periodic floods and several water-table depths were compared. Yields of genotype CP 95-1429 were not affected by water-table depth and CP 95-1429 had similar stalk numbers and diameters across water-depth treatments. Yields of genotype CP 95-1376 increased as water-table depth increased, and stalk numbers and diameters of CP 95-1376 also increased as water-table depth increased. Quantifying large tiller number and stalk, diameter in sugarcane should facilitate identification of genotypes and agronomic practices with improved tolerance to shallow water-tables.

AB Degradation of land and denudation of forest resources, instability in production, erosion of soil, and depletion of native fertility status necessitates a thorough understanding for sustainable agricultural development for conservation of natural resources for present and future generations. We studied the natural resource inventory of Luppi village, situated at eastern plateau of India using a Geographic Information System and satellite imagery (IRS IC LISS III satellite imagery) and Participatory Rural Appraisal Technique, a procedure for rapid acquisition of knowledge, development activity, and decision-making done with the involvement of rural people and household survey. A base map and resource map of the village were developed using GEOMATICA software. Toposequence based micro-level study revealed that there were four types of land situations: upper terraces locally called Tanr, Bahri (land close to homesteads), Baad (middle terraces), and Garha (lower terraces). Adverse bio-physical and socio-economic conditions and age-old, traditional, unscientific agricultural activities in the region act as deterrents for crop production and natural resource management. Based on the study, it can be concluded that priority should be given to long term strategies encompassing silviculture or silvi-pastoral system (cultivation of trees and pasture simultaneously) on upland, cultivation of short-duration, flash-flood tolerant, high-yielding rice variety for Aman (wet) season, and cold-tolerant rice variety for winter season in low land areas; social forestry in degraded land; agro-ecologically suited cropping systems with suitable variety choice for problem areas; and judicious nutrient management in homestead gardens that is ecologically suitable, socio-econornic ally acceptable, technologically sound, and environmentally sustainable.

DE broadleaf; monocot; reduced-till; rotation; varieties
ID COVER CROP; FORAGE
AB Sustainable production can sometimes be achieved with diversification of cropping patterns and by the use of disparate crops in rotation. Following a forage grass harvest for feed it may be possible to produce a cucurbit crop before it is time to reseed an overwintering,grass cover crop. Pumpkins may be a crop that can be grown in rotation with grasses. Five annual Italian ryegrass varieties of varying maturity ["Shiwasuaoba" (early); "Miniamioba" and "Waseyutaka" (medium); "Marshall" and "Zorro" (late)] were established in the fall. In early summer of the following year the grasses were harvested, their yield determined, and the stubble left in place. The control was composed of winter wheat which was harvested in the spring and the stubble turned under and the soil maintained without cover. Seed of pumpkin, cv. ProGold 300, were sown into strips tilled in the ryegrass stubble or bare soil. Number and weight of pumpkins were determined. Weed cover in plots following pumpkin harvest was determined. Plots were seeded with the ryegrasses or wheat, with the procedures repeated over two years. Marketable number and yield of pumpkin were not affected by cover or year of planting and averaged 1,755 fruit/ha and 5.9 Mg(.)ha(-1), respectively, over both years. The percent of pumpkin fruit of the expected size for this cultivar, > 7.25 kg, was 41% in the first year and 26% in the second year. Approximately 68% of fruit from plants on bare soil, and 27% from plants on soil covered with ryegrass stubble, were > 7.25 kg. Total weed cover was not different on bare soil between years (avg. 86%), and dicot weeds were greater in 2002 than 2003. Total weed cover in ryegrass plots averaged about 36% in 2002 and 93% in 2003. Dicot weed cover in ryegrass stubble plots were not different between years or ryegrass variety and averaged 32%. Monocot weed cover was significantly lower in 2002, 5%, than in 2003, 57%, regardless of cover. There is a need for additional studies in ryegrass-pumpkin rotation before recommendations can be made for its implementation in southeastern Oklahoma.

ID AGRICULTURE
AB This contribution examines the extent to which farm size affects the sustain ability of dairy farms in Austria. Correlations between sustainability indicators and farm size are calculated on data from accounts Voluntarily provided by a network of farms. The results show that in large farms income from agriculture and forestry per unpaid family work unit was higher and the proportion of direct payments in income was lower. Smaller farms, on the other hand, tend to exhibit a higher proportion of diversification and generally contribute more to the regional economy. Moreover, smaller farms tend to provide greater environmental services than larger ones per unit agricultural area. Note, however, that larger farms show higher values of certain environmental indicators, when these are related to the produced output. This study concludes that boosting efficiency and increasing output reflects a trade-off with environmental and social services provided by the agricultural sector.

AB Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) crop rotation is regarded as a key procedure for ecological restoration in the semiarid areas of China's Loess Plateau. This study was designed to clarify the soil water restoration in alfalfa crop rotation, to examine the responses of soil nitrogen and organic matter to alfalfa crop conversion in two years, and to assess the adaptability of various rotations for soil water restoration and soil fertility's sustainability. Soil moisture in the millet fields converted from alfalfa grassland was always higher than in alfalfa grassland in the two years after the conversion, which indicates rotation as an efficient way to restore soil water after continuous planting of alfalfa. However, planting millet (Setaria italica Beauv) as it is usually done as local practice, is not helpful for soil water restoration in the first year. In the second year after the conversion, planting potatoes (Solanum tuberosion L.), spring wheat (Tritician aestivitin L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and fallow following millet restored soil water by 36.0 mm, 11.3 mm, -1.3 mm and 4.9 mm, respectively, from April to October, and potatoes resulted the best choice in alfalfa crop rotation for soil water restoration. Compared to the continuous alfalfa planting, rotation treatments resulted in lower soil total nitrogen (by 9.9% in 2001 and 21.5% in 2002), lower soil organic matter (by 46.8% in 2001 and 28.1% in 2002), and higher soil mineral nitrogen (by 27.2% in 2002). Among the rotation treatments, soil total nitrogen and organic matter decreased greatly in cornfields, while they remained the same or increased slightly in spring wheat fields. This indicated that if there is no fertilizer application, spring wheat might be the best choice to keep soil fertility in balance for the farmland converted from perennial alfalfa stands in this region, whereas planting corn and other crops with large consumption of soil nutrients should be avoided.

AB A farmer survey was conducted in three different agroecosystem types in the midwestern and southeastern United States. We selected Saline County, Kansas; Knox County, Indiana; and Coffee County, Georgia, representative of former prairie grassland, Midwestern deciduous forest, and Southeastern deciduous forest biome types. A twenty-question, multiple-choice Survey was mailed to 300 farmers in each county during summer months of 2002 and 2003. Data were collected in four categories: demographic information, problems related to conventional agriculture, sustainable agriculture approaches, and attitudes toward sustainable agriculture. Survey responses were examined and discussed within the context of the social and ecological consequences of industrial agriculture, the alternatives presented by agroecologists, and the communication network between agroecologists and farmers. One Suggestion for achieving sustainability is building stronger connections between university agroecologists and farmers. For example, 58 percent of respondents from Kansas, 57 percent from Indiana, and 70 percent from Georgia view an ecologist as a friend/advisor to the farmer. These data should be useful to agroecologists interested in strengthening their relationship with stakeholders and in disseminating research findings concerning alternative agricultural practices.

ID SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE; MATTER
AB This paper uses survey data to demonstrate the importance of farm size in food-labeling decisions. Using logistic regression models, the study suggests that there exists a positive and significant relationship between agricultural producers who want food labels to explain production practices, even if there is no scientifically determined difference in the product and farm size. The results further indicate that producers within the 55- to 64-year-old age category are more likely to want food labels to explain production practices, while producers who own 1 to 25% of the land that they farm are less likely to express such a preference. The findings may be the first of its kind that provide preliminary evidence that at least in the area of production practices and food labels, the interests of producers and consumers may be converging.

AB Sustainable agricultural production practices contribute to minimize the potential negative effects on the environment including reduction in non-point source pollution of groundwater, in addition to various other environmentally sustainable goals. Understanding nutrient leaching patterns from different nutrient sources in a sandy soil is important to develop management alternatives to minimize nutrient leaching, improve nutrient uptake efficiency, thus to make the system Sustainable as well as economically attractive. Leaching column experiment was conducted using Quincy fine sand packed to simulate the natural soil profile of 120 cm depth. The treatments included (1) unamended; (2) 100 kg N ha(-1) as urea; (3) 100 kg ha(-1) each of N and P as urea and KH2PO4; and (4) 200 kg N ha(-1) as manure. All columns received uniform bromide (Br-) applications at 112 kg ha(-1), as KBr and leached with 5 pore volumes (PV; 45 L) of water. The Br- was leached entirely in the second PV of leachate, and Br- retention in the soil was negligible. Leaching of NH4-N was considerably lower than that of NO3-N. Leaching Of PO4-P was negligible in the first 3 PV, but increased rapidly during the subsequent leaching. The amount of P leached was much greater from the soil amended with urea plus KH2PO4 than that with the manure. The residual soil N after the completion of leaching of 5 PV of water showed NH4-N concentrations <= 1.5 mg kg(-1) through the entire depth of the soil column, across all treatments.

AB The effects of season and months of mating, kindling and weaning as well as effects of breed on some rabbit (Orygtocagus cuniculis) reproductive traits were Studied using eighteen primiparous pure bred does comprising of six each of chinchilla, Dutch-belted and New Zealand white breeds of rabbits. The Study was conducted within a period of thirteen months (February 2002 to February 2003) at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, University Bauchi, research and teaching farm. Results obtained from the Study show that season had no significant influence on most of the reproductive traits under investigation. However, a significant (P < 0.001) season of mating effect was found on parturition interval with the early dry season showing the longest (PI = 52.36 days) while late rainy season had the shortest (PI = 42.00 days). Months, which is a finer division of the season, had a significant (P < 0.001) effect on most reproductive traits except gestation length. Season of kindling had significant (P < 0.05) effect on litter weight and partial milk yield it 28 days postpartum. Month of kindling had significant (P = 0.001) effect oil almost all traits measured except gestation length and partial milk yield at 14 and 28 days. Season of weaning had some influence (P < 0.05) and (P < 0.001) on the number of kits weaned and partial milk yield at 28 days postpartum. Breed did not have effect oil most doe traits but significantly influenced differences in most litter traits. Generally, the results obtained show that the best season that favoured productivity in rabbits in this part of Nigeria is the wet seasons. That was when feeds are abundantly found and temperature is moderately cool. The best and most adaptable breed to this area is the chinchilla. This Was based on the superiority the breed had shown over the Dutch-belted and the New Zealand white in most of the traits measured. Sustainability of rabbit production in this part of Nigeria rely purely oil how best selection is made in terms of the breed to use and how properly the breeding programme is planned and timed.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationships and seasonal weather variations on soil total C and N concentrations, microbial biomass C pool, trace gas fluxes, and rates of internal N-cycling from soils under degraded pasture at Nova Vida ranch, Rondonia, Brazilian Amazon. We collected samples from soils and gas fluxes at the 5 soil types in April 2000 (end of the wet season) and in October 2001 (end of the dry season). Samples were analyzed in both seasons for soil microbial biomass C, soil total C and N, inorganic N, net N mineralization and net nitrification rates and some other soil properties. Overall, the effects of the season events upon soil properties were highly variable. The studied soils with high rates of CO, evolution but low rates of net N mineralization had high rates of N immobilization. The high immobilization rates suggest that the high CO2 evolution rates were associated with a growing microbial biomass. Moreover, in the wet season, the lower NO3--N pools and rates of net mineralization and net nitrification we measured are indicative of lower pasture N2O fluxes. In general, net nitrification rates exceeded net N mineralization rates as the relatively NH4+-N pools. The interrelationships were investigated in order to understand the major biogeochemical cycles that influence soil fertility under pasture, which is important for devising management technologies that enhance the sustainability of these areas and thus slow further deforestation.

AB Upper Mustang-a scenic Himalayan desert is an important tourist destination in Nepal. Its very remoteness, stark landscape and inhospitable climate, coupled with its many unique cultural attractions, have led to Upper Mustang being described as "to the international tourism circuit what Antarctica is for naturalists." Agriculture, livestock and tourism are considered major sources of livelihood but the low agricultural productivity, diminishing rangelands, inequitable sharing of revenue from tourism threaten the sustainability of livelihood in Upper Mustang. Reducing the crop loss to pest and diseases, improving animal health and rangelands, equitable sharing of revenue generated from tourism and its re-investment in the area are seen as key strategies for sustainable livelihood.

AB Steam disinfestation of soil is attracting growing interest in intensive agriculture, because of the increasing demand of reduced use of fumigants. In this study, we assessed the effect of steam application on the microarthropod Community, a fundamental component of soil environment. We conducted steam disinfestation treatments in experimental parcels, where we sampled for edaphic microarthropods on one date before and on four dates after the treatments. Our results showed that edaphic fauna quickly recolonized the disinfested soil, re-establishing dense and rich communities after 45 days. These results support the low environmental impact of this technique and thus could be used for certification of the eco-biological sustainability of steam treatment in organic farming.

TI Facilitating the diffusion of alternative cropping systems for mountain
   agriculture in Vietnam
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE compartment model; crop-livestock systems; mountain agriculture; spatial
   dynamics; Vietnam
ID MANAGEMENT
AB In the mountain areas of Northern Vietnam, the past decade was marked by rapid changes in agricultural production systems. Under the new land policies, some farmers had no other choice than to return to the traditional slash and burn cropping systems. Now, however, land allocation to individuals prevents farmers from shifting cultivation to newly cleared land, which is necessary to regenerate soil fertility, and thus for slash and burn practices to remain sustainable. As a consequence, in some villages there is an increasing risk of land degradation. As livestock feeding relies mainly on natural resources, land degradation results in chronic shortages of forage and more generally to a crisis in traditional production systems. To tackle these issues, the Mountain Agrarian Systems Program has designed alternative cropping systems based on direct seeding under a cover crop. Beside their widely recognized role in the conservation of soil and natural resources, these innovative techniques also provide good forage for the farm animals. However, their diffusion implies a profound reorganization of the crop-livestock systems at complementary scales from field, farm, and up to the village community. Accompanying such changes requires that all partners jointly develop communication procedures based on a common knowledge base.
   In this paper we discuss the spatial compartment model, a graphic discussion and simulation tool used to represent a village in a way that allows both researchers and local stakeholders to understand and visualize their individual and collective situations. We used the model to test a set of cropping innovations through a participatory simulation with local farmers. The farmers were very interested in the new techniques, and some began to test them on their own land. The spatial compartment model proved to be an effective communication tool between scientists and local stakeholders.

ID TELEMEDICINE
AB It has been suggested that joint teleconsultations can improve communication at the primary-secondary care interface. We examined data from a qualitative analysis of social interactions in teleconsultations between specialists and general practitioners. The primary interaction was between specialists and patients. The general practitioners mostly adopted a 'back seat role', listening and observing, but not becoming actively involved. Teleconsultations create a number of interactional difficulties, which are likely to impede implementation and sustainability.

TI State Medicaid and private payer reimbursement for telemedicine: an
   overview
SO JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE
LA English
DT Article
AB Individual states in the USA were given the option of paying for telemedicine services with Medicaid (i.e. federal health-care funds administered by the state) in 1998, when the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) published final rules for Medicare payment for teleconsultations in health professional shortage areas (HPSAs). It was left to telemedicine practitioners in each state to negotiate the scope of the services covered with the state Medicaid office. Three reports of data gathered by 2002-03 surveys on state reimbursement policies have been reviewed, with additional information from a brief informal 2005 survey conducted by the author. In the seven years since 1998, 34 states have added coverage of telemedicine services to their Medicaid programmes, although there are wide variations in service coverage, payment policies, and geographical and other restrictions. There is less published information on private payer reimbursement. One survey performed by AMD Telemedicine (AMD) and the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) showed that over half of the 72 telemedicine programmes in 25 states delivering billable services were being reimbursed by private payers. In 1999, 43% of responding telemedicine networks saw reimbursement as a barrier to long-term sustainability, while in 2004 only 22% did so. It appears that some progress has been made in Medicaid and private payer reimbursement for telemedicine.

AB We have developed a system for tele-ophthalmology that uses low bandwidth data transmission via the Internet. The online system has been tested in two different trials, with specialist advice provided from Perth. The first trial concerned referrals from Indonesia. Approximately 250 consultations were provided in the first two years. The referral rate rose to an average of 10 consultations per month. 25% of patients avoided intended air travel to Australia, 20% were operated on locally in Indonesia and the other 55% travelled to Australia where they were given advice about the surgery required, cost and length of stay. In the second trial, referrals were received from a regional hospital in Western Australia. Approximately 200 consultations were provided. About 4% of the patients were transferred to Perth for treatment, 38% of the patients needed follow-up, 8% were treated by local medical officers according to specialist advice, and the rest were cleared of any disease. Problems of reimbursement and doctors' indemnity will need to be overcome if the online service is to become sustainable.

AB Telemedicine conducted via prerecorded interaction is more convenient than that using realtime interaction. On the other hand, a realtime consultation allows an immediate result to be obtained and there is likely to be a strong educational component for the remote practitioner. The use of the telephone is under-rated in telemedicine. Telephones have been used in outpatient follow-up, mental health, help lines and support groups. Telephones (fixed and mobile) have also been used for data transfer (e.g. for transmission of electrocardiograms). Realtime transfer of still images has been used in telepathology for many years, and more recently for rapid assessment of injuries. Realtime transfer of video images has been widely explored, perhaps most successfully in telepsychiatry. Some realtime telemedicine applications have been taken up with enthusiasm, even if formal evidence of cost-effectiveness may be lacking. Teleradiology and telepsychiatry are two examples where widespread adoption is beginning to occur. Other forms of realtime telemedicine represent 'niche' applications. That is, they appear to be both successful and sustainable in the centres where they were pioneered, but have not been adopted elsewhere. Teledialysis and teleoncology are examples of this type. The patchy diffusion of telemedicine is something that is not yet well understood.

ID TELEMEDICINE APPLICATIONS
AB The Alberta Telehealth Network uses a provincial scheduling system, which allows use of the network to be monitored via reporting procedures. We developed a province-wide costing model for videoconferencing in Alberta, including administrative, clinical and educational activities. In 2003, there were 212 different videoconferencing sites. During the year, 5766 videoconferencing sessions were provided and in these sessions the sites were connected to the network a total of 21,596 times. About 27% of the connections were from providing sites and about 73% of the connections were from receiving sites. On average, one site in the telehealth system was connected to another site about 100 times, and the average videoconferencing session included about 3.8 sites, varying from mainly two sites in clinical sessions to 4.2 sites in administrative sessions and 6.1 sites in educational sessions. The total cost of videoconferencing in Alberta for administrative, clinical and educational activities was about CA $5.74 million in 2003. About 52% of the annual cost was for educational sessions, 34% for administrative meetings and 14% for clinical consultations. The average cost of videoconferencing at a single site ranged from $223.48 (for providing clinical consultations) to $278.57 (for receiving educational sessions). The costing model provides information for decision-makers about the cost of videoconferencing activities and can be used in the development of a sustainable telehealth system in Alberta.

AB Background: Clinical trials conducted in real world settings can improve the translation of research into practice. Although many experts have outlined strategies to conduct effectiveness research in primary care practices, there are few case studies describing how decisions and trade-offs influence the design and implementation of practical clinical trials.
   Methods: This paper outlines the IDEALL ( Improving Diabetes Efforts Across Language and Literacy) Project, a study of self-management support strategies for diabetes. We present a case study about translational diabetes research. We explore patient, clinician, and practice recruitment; which interventions to study; and decisions about the level of integration of interventions into practices.
   Results: Recruitment strategies needed to take into account Institutional Review Board restrictions not allowing direct patient contact outside of the clinic. Patient diversity was increased by using a population-based database to identify eligible patients; clinic diversity was increased by including neighborhood and hospital-based clinics. An adjunctive model of care to provide interventions was used to avoid burdening clinics with integrating the interventions into clinical practice, but did not address the importance of sustainability in primary care settings.
   Conclusion: Practical clinical trials involve complex strategies, decisions, and trade-offs. Researchers engaging in translational research should continue to describe how design decisions may influence the interpretation of results.

AB The third-generation 1-kW(e)-class module was developed with an automatic control system. A conversion efficiency of 48% ac/lower heating value [ac/LHV] was achieved with an exhaust heat recovery unit. An endurance test using the third-generation 1-kW(e) module was done for over 1000 h and no degradation of the power generation performance was observed. In parallel, a single-cell unit, which includes one cell and two metallic separators, was tested for over 10000 h and the degradation rate of the terminal voltage was found to be 1-2%/ 1000 h. In the direction of scale-up, a triple-stack module of 3-kW(e) output was developed. A partial load as well as excess loads on the module were tested and the output power of 1-5 kW(e) was attained under thermally self-sustainable conditions. It was found that a high efficiency of 55% dc/lower heating value [dc/LHV] was obtained under stable operation. Ongoing research of the fourth-generation 1-kWe module has resulted in the conversion efficiency of 58% [dc/LHV]. (c) 2006 The Electrochemical Society.

TI Critical factors for sustainable social projects
SO JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development is currently an extremely relevant concept worldwide, especially in developing countries like South Africa. Mining and metals companies are also directly affected by the sustainable development agenda. The Mining Chatter's requirements as well as new legislation (Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act) expect, among others, for mines to support infrastructure and poverty eradication projects in the communities surrounding the mines. The aim of this paper is to, against the background of a qualitative study of mining communities in the North-west Province of South Africa, put forward some critical factors for the sustainability of social development projects in the mining sector.

AB The relationship between third-party contract enforcement and informal networks raises important sociological, political, and economic questions. When economic activity is embedded in social structures, what are the implications of third-party contract enforcement for the scope and nature of economic relations? What determines whether individuals rely on formal legal institutions or informal networks to sustain trade relationships? Do legal institutions erode informal networks? We develop a model in which a trade-off exists between size and sustainability of networks. By adding the possibility of fee-based, enforceable contracts, we provide a theoretical explanation for the coexistence of legal contract enforcement and an informal economy. We find that legal enforcement has little effect on networks until law becomes sufficiently inexpensive, at which point small decreases in the cost of law have dramatic effects on network size and the frequency of use of the legal system.

AB Sufficient conditions for legislative cooperation are identified within the context of a model of repeated legislative interaction. We show that in many environments, cooperation is sustainable even among impatient legislators. Special attention is given to the case of repeated spatial bargaining; we find that when the dimensionality of the policy space is sufficiently large, parameterizations of the model which do not admit cooperation are rare and atypical. Furthermore, contrary to conventional wisdom, we demonstrate that legislative cooperation is possible in a one-dimensional policy space. The developed theory is applied to address various claims in the substantive literature on legislative parties.

AB Microcalorimetry was used to study the seasonal evolution over one year of the microbial activity in a humic-eutrophic Cambisol soil as a function of its forest cover. The study was carried out on three soils with identical origin but covered with different forest species: pine, eucalyptus, and a typical Atlantic-humid riverside forest.
   Some other physical, chemical and biological properties and environmental parameters, mainly humidity and environmental temperature, were considered to analyze their influence on soil microbial activity.
   The study was performed using a microcalorimeter Thermal Analysis Monitor 2277 in which the experiments were carried out with 1 g soil samples treated with 1.25 mg glucose g(-1) soil. From the measured results it follows that pine forest soil is the least productive of the three, as it generates an average heat of 2.7 vs. 5.9 J g(-1) generated by the eucalyptus forest soil and 3.1 J g(-1) generated by the riverside forest soil. These results are dependent on the remaining physical, chemical and biological features analysed and because of this, pine forest soil, with a pH value 3.3 in spring, shows a small capacity to maintain a stable microbial population which is the lowest of the three (0.079.10(8)to 0.46.10(8)microorganisms g(-1) soil) while riverside soil microbial population is in the range from 7.9-10(8) to 17.10(8) microorganisms g(-1) soil.

DE commuting; South East England; journey length; mode choice
AB The Greater South East England region of the UK constitutes a "global mega-city region". The UK Government's 2003 Sustainable Communities strategy proposes major new growth centres in South East England at Ashford, Milton Keynes, Stansted, Cambridge and Thames Gateway. These,, along with the upgrade of the West Coast Main Line in 2004 and the completion of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link in 2007, could have major impacts on commuting patterns. To understand the effect of these changes on commute distance and mode choice, the relationships between travel-to-work patterns and socio-economic and land-use characteristics are examined. The analysis suggests that the creation of the new growth centres may result in increased car use but is unlikely to result in longer journeys to work. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The annual diameter measurements (four years) of 75 big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) trees in natural forests in northwestern Belize were analysed to determine growth rates. Mean diameter increment exceeded 1 cm year(-1), with slightly higher growth rates in trees > 50 cm dbh. Inter-individual variation in growth rates was significant, with the fastest-growing individuals growing at rates greater than 2 cm year(-1). Inter-annual variation in growth rates was also significant. The diameter growth of 1.21 +/- 0.1 cm during a wetter year (1456 mm) exceeded by 75% the diameter growth of 0.69 +/- 0.1 cm during a drier year (1181 mm). The study revealed that mahogany trees as small as 23 cm dbh that were left standing after harvests could be expected to attain the commercial diameter of 60 cm in the 40 years between cutting cycles.

AB This article examines the Slow Food and Slow City movement as an alternative approach to urban development that focuses on local resources, economic and cultural strengths, and the unique historical context of a town. Following recent discussions about the politics of alternative economic development, the study examines the Slow City movement as a strategy to address the interdependencies between goals for economic, environmental, and equitable urban development. In particular, we draw on the examples of two Slow Cities in Germany-Waldkirch and Hersbruck, and show how these towns are retooling their urban policies. The study is placed in the context of alternative urban development agendas as opposed to corporate-centered development. We conclude the article by offering some remarks about the institutional and political attributes of successful Slow Cities and the transferability of the concept.

TI Renewing people and places: Institutional investment policies that
   enhance social capital and improve the built environment of distressed
   communities
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS

DT Article
AB The challenges confronting distressed communities in the United States are complex and multifaceted. Communities large and small have been significantly affected by a myriad of social, environmental, and economic forces, including a continuing decline in manufacturing employment, uncontrolled sprawl, and the transition to a global economy. The traditional choice between a "place-based" theory of redevelopment strategy versus a "people-focused" theory no longer seems feasible or appropriate. This article outlines sustainable development as an alternative strategy that combines a place-based development strategy, a human development focus, and an environmentally mindful approach. It posits that there exists a direct positive relationship between the creation of social capital, the redevelopment of the built environment utilizing sustainable development practices, and community-based organizations in distressed communities. Furthermore, the authors suggest that through community investment-a socially responsible investment strategy-institutions of higher education can facilitate the rebuilding of communities by providing financial capital while gaining a moderate yet secure financial return as well as a substantial social return.

AB Maintenance of sustainable wildlife populations is one of the primary purposes of wildlife management. Thus, it is important to monitor and manage population growth over time. Sensitivity analysis of the long-term (i.e., asymptotic) population growth rate to changes in the vital rates is commonly used in management to identify the vital rates that contribute most to population growth. Yet, dynamics associated with the longterm population growth rate only pertain to the special case when there is a stable age (or stage) distribution of individuals in the population. Frequently, this assumption is necessary because age structure is rarely estimated. However, management actions can greatly affect the age distribution of a population. For initially growing and declining populations, we instituted hypothetical management targeted at halting the growth or decline of the population, and measured the effects of a changing age structure on the population dynamics. When we changed vital rates, the age structure became unstable and population momentum caused populations to grow differently than that predicted by the longterm population growth rate. Interestingly, changes in fertility actually reversed the direction of short-term population growth, leading to longterm population sizes that were actually smaller or larger than that when fertility was changed. Population momentum can significantly affect population dynamics and will be an important factor in the use of population models for management.

AB Purpose - A central question of governance in our time is how actors in complex, diverse and dynamic contexts can be harmonized, respecting the needs and limitations of their contexts. New technologies enable shaping and modelling interactions to an extent hitherto unknown. They constitute a huge potential to support and integrate interactions and to reshape governance. This paper sets out to explore a concept of interaction applicable to media which captures and addresses the specific characteristics of social systems required to ensure their viability.
   Design/methodology/approach - The potential of cybernetics and systems theory for both the design and application of media in social contexts is explored. Building on an autopoietic concept of social systems, a notion of governance as a process of interaction is established. Beer's Viable Systems Model (VSM) and Schwaninger's Model of Systemic Control is applied to derive the characteristic elements, configurations and types of interaction required to support balancing actors' images in social systems. Links to political and social science theory are provided.
   Findings - Cybernetic and system theories provide a solid conceptual basis for capturing the complexity, dynamics and diversity of interaction. Identifying and addressing the relevant characteristics of interaction in social systems can be achieved through the application of cybernetic tools and vocabulary. These can be used to specify and secure the necessary and sufficient design principles for media through which the viability of social systems can be promoted.
   Originality/value - The paper shows that requirements to the structure of media applied in social contexts can be specified. Analysing interactions in all kind of social systems does provide clues for the development, implementation, and configuration of improved media. When applied properly, these can boost up governing interactions to much more productive and sustainable forms. This turns out to be a remarkable opportunity to promote the governance of social systems.

AB Purpose - To work out an innovative Organisation model for tourism destinations in rural areas.
   Design/methodology/approach - By outlining the problematic of tourism development in rural areas and implementing the concept of network management and the systems theory, we developed an innovative approach to destination management for non-urban areas.
   Findings - Network management means a new lesson for destination management. Our model has been conceived to systematically deal with different subsystems and both systemic and non-systemic entities in a rural destination.
   Research limitations/implications - The focus is limited to destination management in rural areas only. Although several methods suit different types of destinations, some seem to be less adequate for rural areas. The model was intended to search an optimal organisational model only.
   Originality/value - The model introduces an original approach to the destination management and allows its application in a wide range of real situations. It can help achieving a better Organisation and thus an improved competitiveness of a rural destination.

AB In this paper, we argue that participatory approaches should acknowledged e both the irreducible plurality of standpoints and the necessity of common existence in order to be a valuable answer to decision making challenges created by the ecological and societal complexity of environmental issues.
   We propose that participatory approaches be thought on a continuum between consensus-oriented processes ill the pursuit of a common interest and compromise-oriented negotiation processes aiming at the adjustment of particular interests.
   This allows to pinpoint the pitfalls of idealistic conceptions of participators approaches where,here the negotiation dimension tends to be denied and occulted. In particular, we argue that ignoring the negotiation dimension of participatory approaches can impede their legitimacy and effectiveness as learning processes to resolve complex environmental issues beyond the interest of the more powerful actor.
   As an illustration, we look at the relation between multicriteria decision aid and participators processes. We stress the need to explicitly identify areas of consensus and areas of compromise when applying MCDA. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the integration of mediated modelling (MM) techniques with multi-criteria assessment (MCA) in a Participatory decision-making context is discussed. We briefly present the major features of MCA, of system dynamics methodology, and of group model building techniques. The application of MM in a Participatory exercise is illustrated by a Case Study developed in a protected coastal wetland (Ria Formosa, Portugal). Possible avenues to integrate MM into multi-criteria decision making in the framework of sustainable development issues are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Decision making about different energy supply options while aiming for sustainable development is a complex task. Environmental, social and economic goals need to be taken into account. At the same time, energy supply is a topic of high public interest. At times of increased emphasis on accountability and public participation, governments tend to give increased consideration to the values of the general public for and against various electricity generation techniques. A case study of UK energy policy illustrates this new interest in public participation. However, the complexity of the question and the urge for public involvement pose a challenge for decision support. Multicriteria evaluation proves useful as it structures problem formulation, makes use of the best available information while enhancing transparency and facilitating deliberation. This paper illustrates the use of multicriteria evaluation for decision making about energy policy by use of public participation and discusses social learning in this context.

Concepts derived from ecology such as urban environmental carrying capacity and ecological footprint. and concepts coming from economics such as cost benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis are discussed. Social multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) is proposed as a general multi-dimensional framework for urban sustainability policies. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO LARYNGOSCOPE
LA English
DT Article
ID OTOSCLEROSIS SURGERY; STAPEDECTOMY; RESIDENCY
AB Objective. To identify the stapedotomy learning curve of two U.K. otolaryngologists. Study Design: A retrospective review of the outcome of first 100 stapedotomy operations by each surgeon. Included in the study was a postal survey of the incidence of stapes surgery by U.K. otolaryngologists. Setting. Two tertiary referral centers. Patients. All ears in which primary stapedotomy was performed for otosclerosis. Nonotosclerotic cases and malleus stapedotomy cases were excluded. Intervention: One surgeon used the technique of small fenestra stapedotomy with either a Teflon-wire or titanium piston but without vein graft interposition, whereas the second used the technique of stapedotomy with vein graft interposition and a Teflon piston. Main Outcome Measures. A moving average with a window of 15 dB was used to plot learning curves for the postoperative air-bone gaps. Using a postoperative air-bone gap of 20 dB or better as a definition of 'success,' the success rates with the increase in surgical experience of both surgeons were plotted on graphs, the learning curves. The end point of the learning curve was defined as the point where the curve reached its peak, and the results were sustainable. Results: There was no clear-cut end point in both learning curves, although it appears that there is a landmark point at 60 to 80 cases for both surgeons. Both surgeons also had one "dead ear" in their first 15 cases. The postal survey showed that some trainers only performed small numbers of stapes surgery, whereas some otolaryngologists who performed stapedotomies regularly were not trainers. Conclusions: The study supports a learning curve in stapes surgery. To maximize the training opportunity of trainee surgeons, it may be advisable for learning centers to form network to provide target training for the trainee who has demonstrated the necessary dexterity and temperament of an otologist.

AB Use of tags to limit partner selection for playing has been shown to produce stable cooperation in agent populations playing the Prisoner's Dilemma game. There is, however, a lack of understanding of how and why tags facilitate such cooperation. We start with an empirical investigation that identifies the key dynamics that result in sustainable cooperation in PD. Sufficiently long tags are needed to achieve this effect. A theoretical analysis shows that multiple simulation parameters including tag length, mutation rate and population size will have significant effect on sustaining cooperation. Experiments partially validate these observations. Additionally, we claim that tags only promote mimicking and not coordinated behavior in general, i.e., tags can promote cooperation only if cooperation requires identical actions from all group members. We illustrate the failure of the tag model to sustain cooperation by experimenting with domains where agents need to take complementary actions to maximize payoff.

AB People have studied the sky from time immemorial: the recurrence of celestial events has been demarcated by signs in the landscape, from simple megaliths to elaborate monuments at architectural scale. The author introduces her project Sunset Farm, establishes links with historical precedents and explores the potential of an art expression where the celebration of cosmological events coincides sustainable design and production of alternative energy. Furthermore, this art form could promote different lay of awareness in the viewer's perception of land and sky.

TI Crafting change: Envisioning new-media arts as critical pedagogy
SO LEONARDO
LA English
DT Article
AB As India enters the sixth year of the new millennium, there seems to be ample evidence to validate the claim that it is new technologies and their infrastructures that have supported and enabled its current economic revolution. This revolution promises a new society based on knowledge and information. This emphasis poses tremendous challenges to educators and forces them to question the fundamental tenets on which they would develop pedagogies and create learning that is both sustainable and critical. The author argues that the process of creating new-media art can in itself be construed as critical pedagogic practice and that new-media artists have a role to play as public intellectuals.

AB The objective of this document is to promote the use of dynamic daylight performance measures for sustainable building design. The paper initially explores the shortcomings of conventional, static daylight performance metrics which concentrate on individual sky conditions, such as the common daylight factor. It then provides a review of previously suggested dynamic daylight performance metrics, discussing the capability of these metrics to lead to superior daylighting designs and their accessibility to nonsimulation experts. Several example offices are examined to demonstrate the benefit of basing design decisions on dynamic performance metrics as opposed to the daylight factor.

TI Replacing fuel based lighting with light emitting diodes in developing
   countries: Energy and lighting in rural Nepali homes
SO LEUKOS
LA English
DT Article
AB More than one quarter of the world's population, who does not have access to electric light, live in the developing countries. Nepal is one of these countries, where the people in the remote rural areas have to rely on fuel based lighting to bring minimal lighting services in their homes. This paper reviews the quality of lighting, energy and health issues due to the use of fuel based lighting in rural Nepali villages. Recommendations are given on the amount of light needed as the first time electric lighting services in those remote places. The measurement results show that LED technology can bring necessary light in these rural homes with least energy use and it is the potential technology to replace fuel based lighting in a sustainable way. Replacing fuel based lighting by white LEDs can also contribute to the overall development of the underprivileged and underdeveloped communities by helping to improve the health, education and life expectancy of the people as well as income generation.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this article is to review the trend in academic libraries toward including scholarly communication, and by extension, electronic publishing, as part of their core mission, using the Cornell University Library as an example.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes several manifestations of publishing activity organized under the Library's Center for Innovative Publishing, including the arXiv (http://arxiv.org/), Project Euclid (http://projecteuclid.org), and DPubS (http://DPubS.org).
   Findings - Libraries bring many competencies to the scholarly communications process, including expertise in digital initiatives, close connections with authors and readers, and a commitment to preservation. To add publishing to their responsibilities, they need to develop expertise in content acquisition, editorial management, contract negotiation, marketing, and subscription management.
   Originality/value - Academic libraries are making formal and informal publishing a part of their core activity. A variety of models exist. The Cornell University Library has created a framework for supporting publishing called the Center for Innovative Publishing, and through it supports a successful open access repository (arXiv), a sustainable wehhosting service for journals in math and statistics (Project Euclid) and a content management tool (DPubS) to enable other institutions (libraries, scholarly societies, presses) to engage in similar ventures to increase the dissemination of scholarship and to lower the barriers to its access.

AB Scandals and public dangers from the mismanagement and poor disposal of hazardous wastes during the 1960s and 1970s awakened the modern-day environmental movement. Influential publications such as "Silent Spring" (1) and high-profile disposal failures, for example, Love Canal and Lekkerkerk, focused attention on the use of chemicals in everyday life and the potential dangers from inappropriate disposal. This attention has not abated and developments, invariably increasing expectations and tightening requirements, continue to be implemented. Waste, as a surrogate for environmental improvement, is a topic where elected representatives and administrations continually want to do more. This article will chart the recent changes in hazardous waste management emanating from the European Union legislation, now being implemented in Member States across the continent. These developments widen. the range of discarded materials regarded as "hazardous," prohibit the use of specific chemicals, prohibit the use of waste management options, shift the emphasis from risk-based treatment and disposal to inclusive lists, and incorporate waste producers into more stringent regulatory regimes. The impact of the changes is also intended to provide renewed impetus for waste reduction. Under an environmental control system where only certainty is tolerated, the opportunities for innovation within the industry and the waste treatment and disposal sector will be explored. A challenging analysis will be offered on the impact of this regulation-led approach to the nature and sustainability of hazardous waste treatment and disposal in the future.

AB Cutting fluids have seen extensive use and have commonly been viewed as a required addition to high productivity and high quality machining operations. Cutting fluid related costs and health concerns associated with exposure to cutting fluid mist and a growing desire to achieve environmental sustainability in manufacturing have caused industry and academia to re-examine the role of these fluids and quantify their benefits. This work summarizes the traditional purposes of cutting fluids and reports on recent analytical and experimental research to critically examine these functions. To minimize or even eliminate the concerns associated with cutting fluid usage, several recent and novel approaches have been proposed and are examined.

AB As migratory animals, sustainable management of African elephant populations, both within and around protected areas, is a major challenge in the conservation policy of many African countries. We captured seven female elephants, representative members of family groups, in different parts of Tarangire National Park (TNP), Tanzania, and used GPS satellite radio-tracking (November 1997-June 2000) to monitor their space and habitat use and seasonal migrations throughout wet and dry seasons. Patterns of home range overlap revealed the existence of two Large clans that occupied the north-central and southern parts of TNP, respectively. At the end of the dry season, elephants from the southern clan migrated about 100 km southeast of the park boundary, those from the northern clan remained mostly inside the park, or used periodically wet-season core areas in the nearby Game Controlled Areas. No natural mortality occurred during the study, but two elephants were poached outside the park. Human disturbance also affected activity patterns, and elephants were Less active at day outside than inside the park. Home range size varied from 477 to 1078 km(2) for the northern elephants, and from 1630 to 5060 km(2) for the southern elephants. Migration routes were characterised by higher cover (open and closed forest) than core areas. Our results indicate that elephant management must be considered across park boundaries and that migration corridors must be protected against human disturbance and land cultivation. Society problems Linked to elephant conservation can be solved by creating alternative, sustainable, use of natural resources that enhance the livelihood of Local communities.

AB Determining factors responsible for increases in the mortality of freshwater fish larvae are important for the conservation of recruitment processes and for the long-term sustainability of freshwater fish populations. To assess the impact of one such process, Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii Mitchell) and golden perch (Macquaria ambigua Richardson) larvae were arranged into treatment and control groups and passed through different configurations (overshot and undershot) of a low-level weir. Passage through an undershot weir resulted in the death of 95 +/- 1% golden perch and 52 +/- 13% Murray cod. By comparison, mortality was significantly lower in the overshot treatment and both controls. The relatively large number of undershot weirs within the known distribution of these species could impact upon recruitment over a large scale. It is therefore recommended that water management authorities consider the potential threats of operating undershot gated weirs on the survival of larval fish until further research determines appropriate mitigatory measures for these and other species.

AB Demonstrating ecological sustainability is a challenge for fisheries worldwide, and few methods can quantify fishing impacts on diverse, low value or rare species. The current study employed a widely used ecological risk assessment method and incorporated new data to assess the change in sustainability of species following the introduction of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF). Population recovery ranks changed for 19 of the 56 elasmobranch species after the introduction of TEDs, with nine species showing an increase in sustainability. Unexpectedly, ten species showed a decrease in sustainability. This was due to TEDs successfully excluding large animals from the catch, resulting in a lower mean length at capture, which reduced the recovery ranks for two criteria relying on length data. This falsely indicates that TEDs increase the impact on pre-breeding animals, thus reducing the recovery potential of these species. The results demonstrate that existing attribute-based risk assessment methods may be inadequate for reflecting even the most obvious changes in fishing impacts on bycatch species. Industry and management can benefit greatly from an approach that more accurately estimates absolute risk. The development and requirements of a new quantitative risk assessment method to be developed for the NPF, and applicable to fisheries worldwide, are discussed.

AB Biological parameters such as age, growth and age (or size) at maturity are vital for accurate stock assessments and management plans to ensure that fisheries develop sustainably. Despite this, very few validated age studies have been conducted for large tropical pelagic species within the Australian region. Age and growth parameters were estimated for bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus (Lowe, 1839), sampled from longline fisheries in the Australian region using validated techniques based on counts of annual increments. Poor increment clarity reduced the number of otoliths included in the final analysis to only 50% of the 3200 selected for reading (39-178-cm fork length). Microincrement analysis confirmed the position of the first two annual increments in these otoliths. A maximum age of 16 years was obtained, but over 80% of fish in the Australian catch were < 5 years old. Growth is most rapid in the first few years of life and asymptotic length is reached at about age 9 to 10 years. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated at L-infinity = 169.09, k = 0.238, and t(O) = -1.706 for the south-west Pacific Ocean and L-infinity = 178.41, k = 0.176, and t(O) = -2.500 for the eastern Indian Ocean. These parameters were significantly different, suggesting that there is little mixing between populations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Length at 50% maturity for females sampled in northern Queensland was estimated to be 102.4-cm fork length.

AB The harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena experiences high rates of incidental mortality in commercial fisheries, and in some areas these rates are sufficiently high to justify concern over population sustainability. Given this high mortality, conservation efforts may be facilitated by an understanding of how present-day population structure has been shaped by historical demographic changes. To investigate the demographic history of porpoises in the eastern North Atlantic, variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region of 115 porpoises was compared among 4 sampling locations (North Sea, France, Portugal, and West Africa). Genetic variation was investigated by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA). To put the present study in context within the eastern Atlantic, previously published sequence data from Norway (n = 87) and the Black Sea (n = 9) were included. All areas showed substantial geographic structure as indicated by AMOVA and SAMOVA, and there was significant isolation by distance among sampling areas. The haplotype network, mismatch distribution and Fu's F-S test of population equilibrium suggest there has been a relatively recent range expansion into the northernmost area (Norway), probably as a result of re-colonisation into regions previously iced over during Quaternary glaciation events. In all, these results suggest that harbour porpoises within the eastern North Atlantic show geographic structuring as a consequence of limited gene flow along the coast, and their historical biogeography can be interpreted in light of demographic changes that have influenced the evolutionary patterns observed in the mtDNA sequences.

AB Seaweed farming is often depicted as a sustainable form of aquaculture, but suspected habitat alterations and spread of algae outside farms have rendered speculations on the actual degree of sustainability. We conducted an experimental field study on Unguja Island (Zanzibar, Tanzania) to investigate the effects of off-bottom seaweed farming on a tropical seagrass ecosystem, using 1.5 x 2.5 m experimental farm plots. After 11 wk, above-ground seagrass biomass was 40% lower than in control plots, owing to a combination of lower shoot density, shoot length and leaf growth rate. Since the biomass was constant between Day 15 and 75 in the farm (F) treatment, but increased by 67 vs. 48 % in the 2 controls (control treatment [C] and stick-and-line control treatment [CSL]), the effect exerted by the farm was a lack of potential biomass increase rather than an actual decrease. The effect was transplanted to associated organisms both in terms of lower seagrass epiphyte cover and changes in the abundance of 2 dominating epifauna taxa (> 1 cm): sea urchins and sponges. Furthermore, the F treatment caused an accumulation of seagrass leaf litter, but did not affect sediment organic matter (SOM) content. The mechanisms behind these effects were not explicitly tested, but algal shading, emergence stress and mechanical abrasion were identified as likely contributors, Interestingly, the effects were largely restricted to 1 of the 2 seagrass species present, Enhalus acoroides, while the other, Thalassia hemprichii, remained more or less unaffected. This may be due to reduced interspecific competition or species-specific differences in morphology and stress tolerance, and could in the long-term have implications for (amongst others) associated fish communities. Although seaweed farming at the current level is less detrimental than, for example, intensive shrimp farming, and therefore should be seen as a strong option for future aquaculture developments, intensive farming on seagrasses should be avoided or at least minimized by, for example, implementing other farming methods. The risk of ecosystem-level changes in large-scale and uncontrolled farm enterprises warrants a holistic and integrated coastal management approach which considers all aspects of the tropical seascape including human societies and natural resource use.

AB Similar to nearshore systems in temperate latitudes, the nursery paradigm for tropical back-reef systems is that they provide a habitat for juveniles of species that subsequently make ontogenetic shifts to adult populations on coral reefs (we refer to this as the nursery function of back-reef systems). Nevertheless, we lack a full understanding of the importance of the nursery function of back-reef systems to the maintenance of coral reef fishes and invertebrate populations; the few studies that have examined the nursery function of multiple habitats indicate that the relationship between juvenile production in back-reef habitats and their subsequent contribution to adult populations on reefs remain poorly understood. In this synopsis we (1) synthesize current knowledge of life history, ecological and habitat influences on juvenile distribution patterns and nursery function within back-reef systems; (2) outline a research strategy for assessing the nursery function of various habitat types in back-reef systems; and (3) discuss management recommendations, particularly in regard to how improved knowledge of the nursery function of back-reef systems can be used in fisheries and ecosystem management, including habitat conservation and restoration decisions. The research strategy builds on research recommendations for assessing the nursery function of temperate habitats and includes 4 levels of research: (1) building conceptual models to guide research and management; (2) identifying juvenile habitat use patterns; (3) measuring connectivity of juvenile and adult populations between habitats; and (4) examining ecological processes that may influence patterns assessed in Level 2 and Level 3 research. Research and modeling output from Levels 1 to 4 will provide an improved ecological understanding of the degree and importance of interconnections between coral reef and adjacent back-reef systems, and will provide information to managers that will facilitate wise decisions pertaining to habitat conservation, habitat restoration, and ecosystem-based management, and the maintenance of sustainable fisheries.

AB The appropriate configuration of marine reserves for maximizing harvests or ensuring species persistence when there is uncertainty or variability in larval dispersal patterns is not completely understood. This is particularly true in environments with large alongshore advection rates, as the success of a system of marine reserves depends on connectivity through larval and/or adult dispersal between adjacent marine reserves. In this paper, the consequences of alongshore advection in the presence of marine reserves for a fish species with sedentary adults and widely dispersing larvae are examined. First, a uniform configuration of reserves with constant alongshore advection rate is considered. The highest overall catch and recruitment rates occur when the spacing between reserves is precisely tuned to the advection distance. When the alongshore advection distance is allowed to vary in time, catch and recruitment are considerably less sensitive to alongshore advection. At small diffusion distances, catch values differ from what would be predicted from the time-averaged larval dispersal pattern due to density-dependent post-settlement effects. It is important to include short time scale settlement variability in marine reserve models under these conditions. When the spacing between reserves is allowed to vary, the tuning of the system to particular advection distances is less precise. Configurations of marine reserves with a variety of spacings between reserves exhibited more uniform catch levels as a function of advection distance. This suggests that variability in the spacing between reserves is desirable for protecting a diverse group of species with different dispersal patterns.

AB Transformation of South African marine fisheries over the past 10 years has had to balance economic stability, equity and sustainability. This is being done in three ways. First, access rights have been redistributed, increasing the number of rights holders 20-fold and the participation of historically disadvantaged individuals from 0.75% to 62%. Second, established companies have undergone internal transformation. Third, subsistence fishers have formally been recognised. New focuses include co-management, ecosystem-based management and marine protected areas. Further necessary steps include parity in salaries, attention to artisanal fishers, embracement of co-management, expansion of subsistence management and effective enforcement. Most stocks are healthy or recovering but exceptions, such as abalone, warn how quickly stocks can be decimated if co-operation is not achieved. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The shedding of South Africa's international pariah status and currency depreciation enhanced access to and competitiveness on global markets, sparking a demersal-led export boom, which has favoured incumbent producers. Increased exports have also allowed the post-apartheid state and nascent black capital to maximise their returns from the fisheries through cost recovery and share purchases. The protection and promotion of the fisheries' "international competitiveness", inter alia sought through "sustainable fishery" certification of the hake industry with the Maritime Stewardship Council (MSC), has in turn provided a cover-all for the refusal of populist redistribution demands and special treatment for black small capital.

ID COMANAGEMENT
AB Following the enactment of the Constitution in 1996, the South African government undertook a process of legal reform in the fishing sector. This led to the publication of a new fisheries policy endorsing equity and sustainability, as reflected in the Marine Living Resources Act. This paper examines efforts to implement the policy, particularly the objective of "transformation", against the background of law reform in fisheries over the last decade. The discussion is located within the context of related domestic legal developments and current trends in international fisheries law. Methods for enhancing effective implementation of the new fisheries policy are highlighted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO MARINE POLICY

DT Article
DE transformation; implementation process; allocation; small-scale fishing
AB This article follows the transformation process in the fishing industry with specific reference to the emergence of a limited commercial sector. In the policy domain, this sector was accommodated through a "one size fits all approach" to access rights, requiring it to compete with the large-scale commercial sector for the same resources. The strategies and actions of successful and unsuccessful applicants in four fishing communities in South Africa are examined. The paper identifies the key challenges facing the limited commercial sector as being the lack of skills to complete the application process, start up capital or credit, organisation and financial and business acumen. It highlights the disjuncture between the Marine Living Resources Act's stated aims of sustainability, equity and stability and the realities of implementation at a grassroots level.

ID MANAGEMENT; SUBSISTENCE; BENGUELA; CATCH
AB The paper uses the three legislative criteria of resource sustainability, economic stability and social equity to measure the past decade of fisheries reform in South Africa. All three components of the reform process have been successful, although this judgement is subject to a number of important qualifications. First, the data available to measure success are limited. Second, both sustainability and stability are vulnerable to volatile factors external to the reform process (particularly variability in recruitment, climate change and exchange rate fluctuations) capable of derailing the process. Substantial alteration of the fishing industry by internal transformation of existing companies and the reallocation of access rights to new black entrants has led to a composition that closely reflects that of society as a whole and therefore meets the goal of equity. In the process, however, bona fide traditional fishers with a historical dependence on fishing have largely been denied legitimate access to the fisheries, and meeting their aspirations remains a challenge.

AB Using a Before/During/After sampling protocol, the effects of the Le Havre harbour extension, which was started at the end of 2001, on the macrobenthic and suprabenthic communities in the eastern Bay of Seine (English Channel) were examined. As the construction phase has not yet been completed, the results presented here reflect only the data collected before and during the operations (September 2000 and 2002 for benthos sampling and March 2001, September 2001, October 2002 and March 2003 for suprabenthos sampling). Although bio-sedimentary changes did occur at the mouth of the Seine river, an analysis of benthic assemblages reveals that the dredging and construction operations do not seem to have influenced assemblage structure or the spatial distribution of organisms. Comparisons of the suprabenthic assemblages at each sampling date indicate that seasonal dynamics was mainly responsible for determining species distribution. We conclude that, I year into the harbour management plan, the observed changes in benthic and suprabenthic assemblage abundance do not exceed the range of spatial variability that exists naturally in the Seine estuary. Despite this compensatory actions designed to protect the aquatic habitats and to preserve a sustainable and healthy ecosystem have been added to the infrastructure development plan.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The Humber Estuary Shoreline Management Plan provides a long-term strategy for investment in sustainable defences to reduce the risk to people and property from flooding in part of Eastern England. In addition to the estuary's economic importance with its ports, industry and the third of a million people living oil its floodplain, the Humber is of outstanding value for wildlife and its historic environment. The plan has to meet the needs of these activities and take account of rising sea level. It is based on extensive technical studies and modelling. The realignment of some embankments is being examined so that the creation of intertidal habitat will offset losses from coastal squeeze, increase the stability for some lengths of embankment and reduce extreme high flood levels in the tidal rivers. The 80 ha Paull Holme Strays managed realignment wetland was completed in the summer of 2003 and work is in progress oil another at Alkborough. Other such realignment will be developed as part of the implementation of the long term strategy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The ECOMAN was initiated in 2001 by the University of Plymouth, UK, Plymouth Marine Laboratory and the Department of the Environment, Fisheries and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to address the need for more pragmatic assessment techniques linking environmental degradation with its causes. The primary aim of the project was to develop an evidence-based approach in which suites of easy-to-use, cost-effective and environmentally valid biological responses (biomarkers) could be used together to assess the health of coastal systems through the general condition of individuals. A range of sub-lethal endpoints.. chosen to reflect successive levels of biological organisation (molecular, cellular, physiological), was evaluated in common coastal organisms showing different feeding types (filter feeding, grazing, predation) and habitat requirements (estuary, rocky shore). Initially, the suite of biomarkers was used in laboratory studies to determine the relative sensitivities of key species within different functional groups to common contaminants. These results were then validated in field studies performed in a range of ecosystems exhibiting different degrees/signatures of contamination. Here, an example is provided of a field study in the Humber Estuary, UK, which illustrates how multivariate statistical analysis can be used to identify patterns of response to discriminate between contaminated and clean sites. The use of a holistic, integrated approach of this kind is advocated as a practical means of assessing the impact of chemical contamination on organismal health and of ranking the status of marine ecosystems.

ID INDUSTRY; MORTARS
AB The world-wide cement industry is seeking experimental avenues that will lead to cement production that is less energy-intensive, less damaging to the surrounding environment and less prolific in GHG emissions. In Spain and Europe in general, this approach is wholly consistent with the concept of sustainability and compliance with the Kyoto Protocol. The use of different kinds of industrial waste and by-products as alternative materials in cement manufacture has proved to be a very effective way of contributing to such sustainability These alternative materials may be incorporated during cement production by partially replacing conventional fuel and/or the raw materials ground into the raw mix, or by including active additions to the cement and/or clinker
   The present paper discusses the preliminary results obtained in a study of the composition and alkali activation of six types of fired ceramic waste with a view to their viability as partial replacements for some of the prime materials used to prepare raw mix for Portland cement
   The results show that the chemical and mineralogical composition of the six materials makes them apt for such possible use. They are neither toxic nor radioactive. And as might be expected, this type of waste exhibits pozzolanic activity. Alkali activation of the waste, low at the age analyzed (8 days), does not appear to be affected by the vitreous phase content or the nature of the activator The characterization study conducted on the activated paste shows that the feldspar phases are the ones Most susceptible to dissolution and reaction with the alkaline solutions.

AB Materials selection is a difficult and subtle task, due to the immense number of different available materials. Dealing with such exhaustive information was made possible through the systematization of the materials by their properties. Systematization provides enlarging the classical list of materials and offers new possibilities, facing innovation and sustainability.
   A practical example concerning the selection of materials to substitute poly vinyl chloride (PVC) in automobile interiors, is studied. Substitution intends avoiding health damage and environmental burden due to PVC, meeting, at the same time, the innovation quisites and the sustainability exigencies.
   Selection was made by applying the methodologies developed by Ashby and co-workers. Natural materials cork and wood were selected. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are major challenges for the designer to now include Sustainable Development aspects into his/her design; particularly related to the social and wider economic impacts. The designer must, more than ever before, take into consideration the views and concerns of all the 'interested parties' - stakeholders. There are many topics - issues and concerns to consider and often they can be conflicting. The need is to examine the Sustainable Development risks and benefits associated with any particular design so improvements can be made. Both a 'concept' model and a Bournemouth University practical model are described which allows this risk/benefit assessment to be made in a structured manner on a wide range of topics. The assessment can examine the product, the company manufacturing the product and the manufacturing site. The major social, economic and environmental risks and benefits is tabulated or presented graphically for ease of evaluation in order to modify the design and so improve the Sustainable Development aspects.

AB Studies of cultivated varieties historically used in agriculture provide measures of genetic gain and help identify the morphological features, physiological characteristics, and ultimately, the germplasm which contributes those gains. The extent and manner in which genetic diversity is used determines the amount and sustainability of productivity gains. France and the northern Corn Belt of the U.S. represent contrasting regions of maize (Zea mays L.) agriculture which nonetheless share germplasm and challenges associated with breeding at the temperate frontiers of maize environmental adaptedness. We used pedigree data to document germplasm deployed in maize hybrids associated with productivity gains in two regions of France (from 1950s to the present) and in the northern U.S. Corn Belt (from 1930s to the present). Sixty-six founder sources were identified. Six founders (Pyrenees Flint, Learning, Minnesota 13, Iodent, Reid Yellow Dent and Wisconsin 25) were principal contributors at > 5% per decade in one or more regions. Minnesota 13, Iodent and Reid Yellow Dent were principal contributors in all three regions. Twenty-six founders were moderate contributors (mean of 1-4.9% per decade). Only three of these founders (Lancaster Low Breakage, Lindstrom Long Ear and Osterland) were present in each region. Major changes in germplasm backgrounds occurred for each region in nearly every decade. Associations of hybrids on the basis of pedigrees showed that most hybrids used in southern France differed from hybrids used in northern France. Several hybrids used in southern France were associated with hybrids used in northern Iowa. One important pedigree component in all three regions (Iodent) could have been lost had it not been for 50 years of breeding that occurred following Iodent's entry in the 1922 Iowa State yield trials. Future abilities to advance maize productivity to provide for human well-being and environmental security are dependent upon the continued development of well adapted and productive germplasm.

AB Modernization of agricultural systems to increase output causes changes to the nutritional content of food entire populations consume. Human nutritional needs differ from their "food", thus producing healthy agricultural products is not equivalent to providing agricultural products that are healthy for humans. Inclusion of the food production system as a factor in the increase of neuro psychiatric disorders and other chronic diseases helps explain negative trends in modern chronic diseases that remain unchecked despite stunning advances in modern medicine. Diseases in which our own technology plays a significant role include obesity and resulting disorders, such as diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, stroke and arthritis. Modernization's lure leads to importation of modern agricultural practices into a nutritionally vulnerable, malnourished and sometimes starving developing world. Wealthier nations hedge their food portfolio by having access to a wider variety of foods. The developing world's reliance on staple foods means even a minor widespread nutritional modification of one key food can have profound effects. New agricultural techniques may improve or exacerbate neuropsychiatric disorders through nutritional modification in regions where populations walk a nutritional tightrope with little margin for error. In most of the developing world western psychiatric interventions have failed to make inroads. People's consumption of fish has a demonstrated beneficial effect on their mental health and the omega-3 fatty acid content is a significant factor. Epidemiological, biological and agricultural studies implicate a lack of dietary omega-3s as a factor in certain mental disorders. Replenishing omega-3s has improved mental illnesses in controlled clinical trials. This article's detailed tilapia fish-farming model demonstrates how aquaculture/agriculture techniques can function as a public health intervention by increasing dietary omega-3s through creation of sustainable, economical and culturally appropriate food sources for the developing world.

AB Objectives: This paper pursues the challenge of sustaining lifetime electronic health records (EHRs) based on a comprehensive socio-economic-medico-legol model. The notion of a lifetime EHR extends the emerging concept of a longitudinal and cross-institutional EHR and is invaluable information for increasing patient safety and quality of care.
   Methods. The challenge is how to compile and sustain a coherent EHR across the lifetime of an individual. Several existing and hypothetical models are described, analyzed and compared in an attempt to suggest a preferred approach.
   Results: The vision is that lifetime EHRs should be sustained by new players in the healthcare arena, who will function as independent health record banks (IHRBs). Multiple competing IHRBs would be established and regulated following preemptive legislation. They should be neither owned by healthcare providers nor by health insurer/payers or government agencies. The new legislation should also stipulate that the records located in these banks be considered the medico-legal copies of an individual's records, and that healthcare providers no longer serve as the legal record keepers.
   Conclusions: The proposed model is not centered on any of the current players in the field; instead, it is focussed on the objective service of sustaining individual EHRs, much like financial banks maintain and manage financial assets. This revolutionary structure provides two main benefits: 1) Healthcare organizations will be able to cut the costs of long-term record keeping, and 2) healthcare providers will be able to provide better care based on the availability of a lifelong EHR of their new patients.

AB Objectives: This paper pursues the challenge of sustaining lifetime electronic health records (EHRs) based on a comprehensive socio-economic-medico-legal model. The notion of a lifetime EHR extends the emergency concept of a longitudinal and cross-institutional EHR and is invaluable information for increasing patient safety and quality of care.
   Methods: The challenge is how to compile and sustain a coherent EHR across the lifetime of an individual. Several existing and hypothetical models are described, analyzed and compared in an attempt to suggest a preferred approach.
   Results: The vision is that the lifetime EHRs should be sustained by new players in the healthcare arena, who will function as independant health record banks (IHRBs). Multiple competing IHRBs would be established and regulated following preemptive legislation. They should be neither owned by healthcare providers nor by health insuer/payers or government agencies. The new legislation should also stipulate that the records located in these banks be considered the medico-legal copies of an individual's records, and that healthcare providers no longer serve as the legal record keepers.
   Conclusions: The proposed model is not centered on any of the current players in the field; instead, it is focussed on the objective service of sustaining individual EHRs, much like financial banks maintain and manage financial assets. This revolutionary structure provides two main benefits: 1) Healthcare organisations will be able to cut the costs of long-term record keeping, and 2) healthcare providers will be able to provide better care based on the availability of a lifelong EHR of their new patients.

AB The term "forest transition" refers to the phenomenon that in many countries undergoing economic growth, deforestation comes to a halt and forest areas begin to expand again. The author presents data on the development of woodland in Austria since the early 19(th) century and provides evidence for the forest transition in Austria. Based on the Austrian case, forest transition and its driving forces are discussed from a socio-ecological perspective. The results demonstrate that the changes in forest cover must be regarded as an integral part of vast changes in the land-use system and that the land-use and forest cover are closely linked to the transformation of the socio-economic energy system.

TI Ethnic and socio-economic developments in the Ugandian Rwenzor.
   Comparative studies in the high mountainous areas of eastern Africa
SO MITTEILUNGEN DER OSTERREICHISCHEN GEOGRAPHISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
LA English
DT Article
AB In this study, an attempt is made to present the socio-economic development and the ecological as well as the ethno-demographic conflict potential in the Rwenzori mountainous region (Uganda), and these findings are compared with the situation in the high mountainous areas of eastern Africa. A significant event in the lives of the local Konjo people was the foundation of the Rwenzori Mountains National Park in 1992 as it resulted in a reduction of the area available for settlements and economic activities. They had no longer access to those zones at higher altitudes from which a considerable proportion of the household incomes had traditionally been extracted - a development similar to that in the Mt. Kenya and Kilimanjaro regions. The marked increase in population of a society reliant on a subsistence economy did not only lead to an extreme expansion of cultivation into the steepest mountain zones causing considerable ecological problems, but population pressure also resulted in emigration from the overcrowded mountains to the foothills. This migration is associated with ethnic tensions partly due to long-standing problems between pastoral and farming societies - an ethno-social fact throughout all parts of eastern and central Africa. Plans of the mountain people to leave the Toro kingdom and to establish a Rwenzori kingdom created another ethno-political conflict potential. Consequently the locals still do not accept the National Park. As is the case with Mt. Kenya, the costs of the Rwenzori National Park (largely opportunity-costs for alternative forms of utilization) are byJar higher than the economic benefits. Thus, only the central government benefits from the conservation of the Rwenzori, and the local population has to cope with disadvantages.
   This study focuses on the impacts of alpine tourism in the Rwenzori National Park on the local economy: Economic benefits from mountaineering tourism in the Third World are by no means as high as expected. Incomes are low and irregular, and they are distributed unevenly. Therefore the locals have to look for alternative sources of income, mainly in subsistence agriculture. The problems are similar to those in the Mt. Kenya region: alpine tourism does not reduce regional income disparities and obviously fails to promote sustainable development.

SO MITTEILUNGEN DER OSTERREICHISCHEN GEOGRAPHISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT

AB Geospace in cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA produced a school atlas based on satellite maps, using data from a great number of earth observation satellites. In agreement with goals set by the European Union and ESA, it aims at propagating a more intensive use of satellite data in European schools in order to enhance the pupils' awareness of the existence and of the usefulness of earth observation data. Thus, a contribution is made to enhancing interest in environmental issues and global problems as a basis of responsible and sustainable thinking and acting.
   From large overviews to details of landscapes, the atlas shows both the natural and the cultural sphere in comprehensive examples, demonstrating consequences and interactions of natural processes and anthropogenic influence. The comparison of satellite image maps, land cover maps and topographical maps facilitates reading satellite image maps. The integration of thematic layers further illustrates interrelations.
   A detailed handbook provides suggestions for teachers of how to use of the atlas during lessons, explaining the motivation and contents of the maps and providing numerous ideas for exercises with this new teaching material.
   The maps and - in most case - the original earth observation data used in the creation of the maps are comprised in digital form on two DVDs accompanying the atlas. This allows students to actively modify the representation of maps and to apply simple data evaluation procedures. Work with the digital data is supported by the integration of the atlas into Eduspace, the e-learning platform of ESA.
   This paper provides an overview of the aims, the philosophy and the structure of the ESA School Atlas and gives some examples of maps it contains.

AB Sustainable agriculture is a complex concept that aims at 1. meeting the desired production of food, feed, fibre and fuel, 2. economic agricultural production, 3. conservation of natural resources, 4. protecting the environment, 5. gender equity and 6. avoiding regional imbalances. In India the focus has been mainly on the first issue, namely producing enough food and fibre to meet the demands of ever increasing population, which after independence has increased nearly threefold. Deterioration of soil fertility and depiction of country's water resources has just received attention and appropriate ameliorative measures are yet to be taken. Other issues, namely gender equity and growing regional imbalances have yet to be addressed. Economics of Indian agriculture is facing the problem of global market and it is hoped that it survives. Thus sincere efforts are needed to make India's agriculture sustainable.

DE dialectical agriculture; sustainable production; agronomy
AB In order to produce a growth that is sustainable technologically, environmentally and economically, it is suggested that a dialectical approach in agricultural research and development needs to be adopted. The history of dialectics and related concepts on general systems theory, and cybernetics is described. The approach is discussed at the micro-level in relation to the methodology of agricultural research usually followed. It is examined in the context of newer developments in plant and animal biotechnological research and on farm experimentation in plant breeding and agronomic practices. It seems. in most of the cases the approach normally followed is unidirectional - from input factors to the output. The strategy for sustainable crop production, however, depends on understanding how the plant production system influences and is influenced by the environmental system. In intensive cropping systems, plant growth extracts nutrients from the soil that adversely affects its health. If the health status of the soil is to be preserved at some desired level for future use, the production process gets constrained, in that the production would become less than what,it would be if we ignore the effect of increased production on the characteristics of soil. We have therefore to determine by how much the production gets lowered in maintaining die soil status. At the same time when soils deteriorate, as a feedback, the plant productivity goes down. We have then to determine by how much the soil erosion is to be prevented to maintain the productivity at the same level. In other words, an appropriate sustainable production strategy would take into account both, the environmental effect of crop production process as well as the feedback from the quality of environmental resources to crop productivity. This seems to be a novel problem needing the coordinated efforts by agronomists, soil scientists. microbiologists, economists and statisticians.

TI Avalanche risk assessment - a multi-temporal approach, results from
   Galtur, Austria
SO NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; DAMAGE; VULNERABILITY; SETTLEMENTS
AB Snow avalanches pose a threat to settlements and infrastructure in alpine environments. Due to the catastrophic events in recent years, the public is more aware of this phenomenon. Alpine settlements have always been confronted with natural hazards, but changes in land use and in dealing with avalanche hazards lead to an altering perception of this threat. In this study, a multi-temporal risk assessment is presented for three avalanche tracks in the municipality of Galtur, Austria. Changes in avalanche risk as well as changes in the risk-influencing factors (process behaviour, values at risk (buildings) and vulnerability) between 1950 and 2000 are quantified. An additional focus is put on the interconnection between these factors and their influence on the resulting risk.
   The avalanche processes were calculated using different simulation models (SAMOS as well as ELBA+). For each avalanche track, different scenarios were calculated according to the development of mitigation measures. The focus of the study was on a multi-temporal risk assessment; consequently the used models could be replaced with other snow avalanche models providing the same functionalities. The monetary values of buildings were estimated using the volume of the buildings and average prices per cubic meter. The changing size of the buildings over time was inferred from construction plans. The vulnerability of the buildings is understood as a degree of loss to a given element within the area affected by natural hazards. A vulnerability function for different construction types of buildings that depends on avalanche pressure was used to assess the degree of loss. No general risk trend could be determined for the studied avalanche tracks. Due to the high complexity of the variations in risk, small changes of one of several influencing factors can cause considerable differences in the resulting risk. This multi-temporal approach leads to better understanding of the today's risk by identifying the main changes and the underlying processes. Furthermore, this knowledge can be implemented in strategies for sustainable development in Alpine settlements.

DT Article
AB Transport Canada is committed to protect the environment and to achieve a more sustainable transportation system. The Transportation Development Centre of Transport Canada, in collaboration with the Environment Research and Measurement Division of Environment Canada, is conducting research on marine emissions control technologies to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. >> The ongoing work on emissions control technologies comprises both laboratory and field trials. An initial round of laboratory tests demonstrated the viability of a Water Injection System (WIS) to reduce NOx emissions. The results indicate that the WIS has achieved a 20 to 28% NOx reduction over a 25 to 75% load range with a maximum of 33% water injection. The WIS was optimized during laboratory bench tests and will be installed on a RORO vessel operating between Montreal, Quebec, and St. John's, Newfoundland. The WIS provides a cost-effective solution for NOx reduction on Canadian vessels fitted with older medium-speed engines.

AB In the absence of resistant cultivars, the impending loss of methyl bromide (MBr) and few sustainable alternatives available, managing the northern root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne hapla, is a challenge in temperate vegetable and nursery production systems. Many brassica plants, including arugula, Eruca sativa, possess biofumigant and trap crop qualities, and thus have been gaining popularity as potential alternatives to MBr. As part of a project to develop alternatives to MBr, this study was conducted to determine the effects of arugula cv. Nemat on three glasshouse populations of M. hapla from Rhode Island (RI), New York, Geneva (NYG) and Michigan (MI). In two glasshouse experiments conducted at 20 +/- 2 degrees C and 28 +/- 2 degrees C, arugula and Rutgers tomato (standard susceptible) seedlings were inoculated with either 0 (control) or 3000 eggs of 67-85% undifferentiated stages of the three populations. Experiment I was terminated at 20 days and Experiment 2 at 28 days after nematode inoculation. At 20 degrees C, 200 and 280 degree-days (DD, base 10 degrees C) were accumulated, while 360 and 504 DD were accumulated at 28 degrees C in the respective experiments. Total numbers of nematodes recovered from roots varied by host and by nematode population over the course of the study, but the numbers of females in roots did not vary significantly. This suggests variability in reaching the adult female stage. Egg and egg mass production was normal in all nematode-infected tomatoes, but no eggs were produced in more than 80% of arugula plants, and less than 17% of the arugula samples had fewer than five loose eggs and no egg masses. The results show that arugula interferes with development and reproduction of populations of M. hapla and thus has potential as a trap crop to control M. hapla.

AB Previous studies have shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can influence plant diversity and ecosystem productivity. However, little is known about the effects of AMF and different AMF taxa on other important community properties such as nutrient acquisition, plant survival and soil structure.
   We established experimental grassland microcosms and tested the impact of AMF and of different AMF taxa on a number of grassland characteristics. We also tested whether plant species benefited from the same or different AMF taxa in subsequent growing seasons.
   AMF enhanced phosphorus acquisition, soil aggregation and survival of several plant species, but AMF did not increase total plant productivity. Moreover, AMF increased nitrogen acquisition by some plant species, but AMF had no effect on total N uptake by the plant community. Plant growth responses to AMF were temporally variable and some plant species obtained the highest biomass with different AMF in different years. Hence the results indicate that it may be beneficial for a plant to be colonized by different AMF taxa in different seasons.
   This study shows that AMF play a key role in grassland by improving plant nutrition and soil structure, and by regulating the make-up of the plant community.

AB The root hemiparasitic weed Striga hermonthica is a serious constraint to grain production of economically important cereals in sub-Saharan Africa. Breeding for parasite resistance in cereals is widely recognized as the most sustainable form of long-term control; however, advances have been limited owing to a lack of cereal germplasm demonstrating postattachment resistance to Striga.
   Here, we identify a cultivar of rice (Nipponbare) that exhibits strong postattachment resistance to S. hermonthica; the parasite penetrates the host root cortex but does not form parasite-host xylem-xylem connections.
   In order to identify the genomic regions contributing to this resistance, a mapping population of backcross inbred lines between the resistant (Nipponbare) and susceptible (Kasalath) parents were evaluated for resistance to S. hermonthica.
   Composite interval mapping located seven putative quantitative trait loci (QTL) explaining 31% of the overall phenotypic variance; a second, independent, screen confirmed four of these QTL. Relative to the parental lines, allelic substitutions at these QTL altered the phenotype by at least 0.5 of a phenotypic standard deviation. Thus, they should be regarded as major genes and are likely to be useful in breeding programmes to enhance host resistance.

AB Has the science of ecology fulfilled the promises made by the originators of ecological science at the start of the last century? What should ecology achieve? Have good policies for environmental management flowed out of ecological science? These important questions are rarely discussed by ecologists working on detailed studies of individual systems. Until we decide what we wish to achieve as ecologists we cannot define progress toward those goals. Ecologists desire to achieve an understanding of how the natural world operates, how humans have modified the natural world, and how to alleviate problems arising from human actions. Ecologists have made impressive gains over the past century in achieving these goals, but this progress has been uneven. Some sub-disciplines of ecology are well developed empirically and theoretically, while others languish for reasons that are not always clear. Fundamental problems can be lost to view as ecologists fiddle with unimportant pseudo-problems. Bandwagons develop and disappear with limited success in addressing problems. The public demands progress from all the sciences, and as time moves along and problems get worse, more rapid progress is demanded. The result for ecology has too often been poor, short-term science and poor management decisions. But since the science is rarely repeated and the management results may be a generation or two down the line, it is difficult for the public or for scientists to decide how good or bad the scientific advice has been. In ecology over the past 100 years we have made solid achievements in behavioural ecology, population dynamics, and ecological methods, we have made some progress in understanding community and ecosystem dynamics, but we have made less useful progress in developing theoretical ecology, landscape ecology, and natural resource management. The key to increasing progress is to adopt a systems approach with explicit hypotheses, theoretical models. and field experiments on a scale defined by the problem. With continuous feedback between problems, possible solutions, relevant theory and experimental data we can achieve our scientific goals.

AB Population models are useful tools to guide management as they allow us to project growth and persistence of wildlife populations under different scenarios. Nevertheless, good data are needed to produce reliable models, and this requirement is problematic in some situations. North Island saddlebacks (Philesturnus rufusater) were reintroduced to Boundary Stream Mainland Island in September 2004, and this was the first time this species had occurred in an unfenced mainland area since their extirpation in the 19th century. This situation creates a challenging scenario for population modelling, as this species has never been studied in the presence of mainland predators, and management of these predators will be the key factor determining whether the population survives. In this paper we present an approach for developing a "prior model" before a reintroduction takes place. We use data from the reintroduced saddleback population on Mokoia Island to develop a model of how saddleback populations are regulated in the absence of mammalian predators. We use this model to project growth of a reintroduced population when vital rates are reduced by predation and also to project responses of source populations to harvesting of birds for translocation. We then incorporate data from the reintroduced North Island robin (Petroica longipes) population at Paengaroa Mainland Island to model the relationship between population parameters and predator tracking rates. The combined model can be used to predict the level of predator control needed to ensure growth of the saddleback population, but the prediction is contingent on guessing the relative Vulnerability of robins and saddlebacks to predation. We envision using a Bayesian approach to update such prior models as site-specific data become available after reintroduction.

AB This study investigated the effects of different management inputs (fertiliser and seed) and grazing patterns oil plant biodiversity in a short tussock grassland with a strong Hieracium pilosella component. Cover abundance of vascular and non-vascular plants and environmental variables were measured in 32 10 x 10-m plots located in five blocks with different management treatments,. Ordination of the floristic data separated the block with the highest management inputs from other blocks.:Several adventive species were significantly more abundant in this block, while several native species were either absent or uncommon, but were significantly more abundant in other Study blocks. H. pilosella was significantly more abundant in blocks with lower management inputs. Diversity was significantly higher in the block with the highest management inputs. The native tussock Poa colensoi had significantly greater cover abundance while Festuca novae-zelandiae tussocks were significantly taller in this block. Our results suggest that high management inputs reduce the abundance of H. pilosella and diversity of native species, but increase the abundance of other adventive species and the cover and vigour of native tussocks. Our results highlight an interesting management conundrum for short tussock grasslands. No-input management is likely to result in a decline in native biodiversity, as well as production values, as H. pilosella mats deplete soil nutrients and restrict regeneration of native species. However, input of fertiliser and adventive seeds to enhance production values, although resulting in an increase in the vigour and abundance of some native species (mainly tussocks) and a reduction in H.pilosella abundance, will also result in a decline in overall native species richness.

ID GROUNDWATER
AB The Azraq groundwater basin, found in Jordan, is an important resource for available water to the public. Its magnitude and value has been decreasing for the last two decades. The groundwater level has been declining on a yearly basis since the 1980s, and over-pumping, which has tripled since 1983, has led to the drying up of major springs in the 1990s.
   Overexploitation is considered as the adverse effect on groundwater mass balance, where the abstraction increases yearly and beyond the safe yield. Over-pumping and irrigation activities cause groundwater to become more saline.
   The isotopic composition of groundwater is divided into two groups. The first group is associated with EMWL, and the second with GMWL. The recharge origin of the first group, which includes the upper and middle aquifers, originate from outside the Azraq basin with a land elevation higher than 1150 m asl. The groundwater of the second group is considered palaeowater. No major recharge component is identified in the basin. Accurate and reliable scientific approaches are indispensable to better understand, plan and manage the groundwater resources.

AB For an environmental-friendly sustainable society, the global environmental problems should be solved. Here we outline our recent results of environment purification materials with smart functions. For the effective adsorbent for remediation process, zeolite coated with layered double hydroxide (LDH) was prepared by the precipitation of LDH on zeolite-LTA under hydrothermal treatment. This multifunctional material has a possible application for simultaneous uptake of harmful cations and anions, and minimizes environmental pollution during municipal and industrial water management. For novel material for the nuclear waste management, zeolite with hydroxyapatite layers on its surface was obtained by a hydrothermal method on the basis of the cation exchange of Ca2+ in zeolite for NH4+ in solution. The novel nanocomposite is an ideal material for adsorbing and fixing radioactive elements for geological time-scale.

AB Dairy farming is one of the main contributors to nitrate leaching to groundwater, particularly on soils that are susceptible to leaching, such as light well-drained sandy soils. In the Netherlands, as in many other European countries, these soils are predominantly used for dairy farming. A prototype dairy farming system that has been implemented in practice in 1989 has continuously been adapted since then to meet environmental standards (i.e. the EU-standard of 50 mg NO(3)(-) 1(-1)) without reducing milk production intensity (11900 kg ha(-1)). After an initial decline in nitrate concentration from 193 mg l(-1) to 63 upon implementation, it subsequently 'stabilized' at a level higher than the environmental standard: 55 mg l(-1). The goal of this paper is to examine causes of excessive nitrate leaching. This was done by relating measured nitrate concentrations with management characteristics such as N balances, cropping patterns and grazing intensities. Special attention was paid to aspects that were supposed to be conducive for leaching: crop rotation of grass and maize and grazing. No evidence was found for enhanced nitrate leaching due to the rotation of grass with maize compared to permanent cultivation. This could be ascribed to the reduction in fertilization levels in first and second year maize with 90 and 45 kg N ha(-1), respectively to account for the expected N release from the ploughed-in grass sod. Triticale was found to lead to higher leaching than grass or maize which is attributed to its poor growth in the period that it should function as catch crop in maize. Grazing contributed to a nitrate increase of about 30 mg NO(3)(-) 1(-1) on grassland. As grazing management and intensity is already strictly optimized in order to restrict nitrate leaching, this result underpins the need to develop sustainable grazing methods on soil that is susceptible to nitrate leaching.

AB Marine sand is not only essential to the construction industry, but also functions as a habitat, nursery, and buffer for shorelines. As resources of sand oil land arc depleted the demand for marine sand has increased rapidly and is expected to continue. However, marine sand is limited in quantity and sand mining brings environmental externalities Such as environmental degradation, habitat destruction and coastal erosion. Recently, the public and government agencies have recognized the value of marine sand. Although, sand mining is already well established and implemented, both the public and government in Korea are pushing for the sustainable development of marine sand. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper addresses development and problems of the legislative framework for coastal and coral reef resources management in Indonesia. It describes the background to the legal framework of Indonesian coastal and coral reef legislation and proposes an appropriate legal framework for addressing Indonesian coastal and coral reef management. This paper outlines several major challenges faced by the Indonesian legislators. It reviews some of the justifications of creating an appropriate legal framework for coastal management.
   It argues that an adequate and appropriate legal framework will promote sustainable development and management of coastal and coral reef resources. It argues that, the complicated and inappropriate legal framework currently place in Indonesia has contributed to serious degradation of coastal and marine resources. It also argues that this degradation has been exacerbated by the lack of a national marine policy, severe weaknesses in law enforcement of natural resource including those of the fisheries laws and regulations in Indonesia. This paper suggests that there is a general malaise or lack of commitment to sustainable management and development of natural resources. This paper also focuses on the political aspects and their impacts on legislation for coastal and coral reef management at the national and selected regional levels. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We develop a systematic approach for the measurement of overall socioeconomic benefits associated with an integrated coastal management (ICM) program. The analytical framework includes multiple marine industry sectors (e.g., ocean shipping and commercial fisheries) as well as environmental sectors (e.g., coastal erosion). The net benefit measure captures both economic and environmental effects. We apply our analytical model to Xiamen, China, using empirical data from 1992 to 2001. Results of the case study show that the implementation of ICM program in Xiamen has led to a significant increase (over 40%) in annual socioeconomic benefit from its marine sectors. Thus, the Xiamen ICM program has been effective in achieving sustainable development. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Diving user fees and the financial sustainability of marine protected
   areas: Opportunities and impediments
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID PAY
AB Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) worldwide are reported as failing to achieve their conservation objectives due to insufficient funds, resulting in management shortfalls such as inadequate law enforcement and poor visitor management. The implementation of user fee systems has been suggested as a solution to the financial unsustainability of MPAs, with divers commonly willing to pay large sums of money to help protect the parks they visit. Studies assessing the potential and success of tourism user fees in the form of diving user fees have solely concentrated on the Caribbean Region and consequently a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities for revenue generation is not possible. This study investigated existing user fees in two important diving regions of the world, South-East Asia and the Francophone countries of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and the potential for the introduction of new fee systems there. Whilst the majority of MPAs in the Francophone countries of the Indian and Pacific Oceans are rarely visited by divers, MPAs in South-East Asia, like the Wider Caribbean, present a high potential to raise revenue for conservation via the implementation of diving user fees, although this potential is largely unexploited. This potential will be only realised when complex problems linked to governance and revenue collection are resolved. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   The use of data on fish consumption
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT

AB Coastal fisheries in Pacific island countries are characterised by a strong predominance of catches for subsistence purposes which involves mainly finfish and is difficult to quantify. In 1997-1998, a consumer survey conducted in the Northern Province of New Caledonia (Southwest Pacific Ocean) made it possible to indirectly estimate subsistence fishing production. Catch from subsistence fishing did not result in a significant change of the exploitation potential. The catch composition of subsistence fishing differed significantly from commercial fishing, with a higher proportion of species less vulnerable to exploitation. Interpretation of the consumer typology highlighted the importance of factors such as ethnic group and geographical location in explaining eating habits and therefore, indirectly, fishing behaviours. These results suggest that this fish consumption survey could assist in the design of subsistence fisheries monitoring programmes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a systematic process to create frameworks of indicators for monitoring sustainable development in fisheries at the local community level. Indicators are evaluated and selected through a three-stage process: first, potential indicators for general use in fisheries are identified; second, this set is refined for suitability within a specific local context; third, indicators are evaluated according to data-specific criteria. The results suggest that indicators suitable at larger geographic scales are often unsuitable, and insufficient, for use at a local scale. Conversely, many social, economic and institutional fishery indicators appear suitable for use locally, but their implementation has received insufficient attention to date. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ID MARINE CAPTURE FISHERIES; RESPONSIBLE FISHERIES
AB The development of sustainability indicator systems (SIS) has been a response to practically apply and interpret ecosystem-based and precautionary approaches to fisheries management. Fisheries-based indicator systems have been characterised by recognition of their utility, but hampered by a lack of data, clear roles and responsibilities and an uneven distribution of implementation across governance jurisdictions. This paper explores a policy-based holistic model of an indicator system consisting of inputs, core structures and outputs and uses this as the basis of an assessment framework. The framework is applied to two recent reporting systems: the Australian government's Commonwealth Sustainable Fisheries Assessments and the Marine Stewardship Council initiative.

TI Tasmanian marine protected areas: Attitudes and perceptions of wild
   capture fishers
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RESERVES; BIODIVERSITY; CONSERVATION
AB In 1999 the Marine and Marine Industries Council was established by the Tasmanian (Australia) State Government and in 2001 a Tasmanian Marine Protected Area Strategy was launched. The aims of this paper are to: investigate the views, perceptions and attitudes of commercial fishers towards this Strategy and to identify the key issues that influence fisher support or opposition to marine protected areas (MPAs). Fifty-one structured interviews with license supervisors of commercial abalone, rock lobster and scalefish fishers were conducted. Fishers stated that they would conditionally support MPAs if they sustained or increased fish populations, supported research, allowed fishing in multiple use areas, and if multiple use areas contained small 'no-take' zones. Fishers were concerned about the ability of the government to provide adequate marine protected area monitoring and compliance and were critical of the public consultation process that accompanied the development of the Strategy. Concern was expressed regarding the potential negative impact of additional MPAs in terms of resource sustainability and the long-term economic viability of the fishery. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Managing Jamaica's queen conch resources
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Jamaica's industrial fishery for queen conch (Strombus gigas) has produced a substantial amount of much-needed foreign exchange and for at least 10 years has been the most valuable component of all commercial marine fisheries activities. Since its inception in 1990 it has grown tremendously and may now be at some risk of collapse, due to problems including, among other factors, overfishing, poor enforcement, foreign poaching and under-reporting of catches. This paper examines and analyzes the problems relating to management of the conch fishery and speculates on its future. The main problems are overfishing by licensed fishers who take more than permitted, and serious poaching by industrial vessels mainly from Honduras, which exploit poor high seas enforcement by Jamaican authorities. For nearly two years the official fishery was closed due to legal issues. During closures, considerable foreign poaching occurred. The paper suggests that increased roles for the coast guard, continued quota reductions, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES), could be the best options for sustainability.

TI Public perception of development issues: Public awareness can contribute
   to sustainable development of a small island
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Many development projects are undertaken in communities where the local inhabitants have little or no input to the planning and implementation of such projects. Encouraging the active participation of local communities in development projects, through capacity-building and environmental education, has become a major objective of sound development programmes. We have successfully included the local community of Holbox Island, Quintana Roo State, Mexico in our programme for long-term monitoring of coastal pollution in and around their Island. Here we report the progress made by different sectors of the Holbox community over a four-year period during which they have become increasingly responsible for the scientific and technical aspects of assessing water quality. A face-to-face, structured survey was used to evaluate attitudes and perceptions with regard to coastal water pollution and other development issues that concern the Holbox Island community. People in Holbox identified coastal pollution, coastal erosion and garbage dumping as major environmental concerns and have acquired a good level of awareness about the causes and consequences of these issues. Our results also indicate that the public has an improved understanding of the interrelationship between their own behaviour, and that of others, and these environmental issues. Our contribution in the Holbox Island has made a positive step towards providing the local community with essential knowledge regarding environmental, development and social issues, thereby enabling them to become actively involved in the environmental conservation of their island. Continuing efforts in capacity-building and environmental education aim to provide the local community with the knowledge and skills that are necessary for making appropriate choices for the preservation and development of Holbox and the surrounding ecosystems. In the long term, the local community will not only be able to contribute directly to on-going development projects, but will also be in a better position to participate with government agencies in the decision-making process.

AB The Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem (GCLME) extending from Bissagos Island (Guinea Bissau) in the north to Cabinda (Angola) in the south defines the shared transboundary waters off the coast of western Africa, which embodies some of the major coastal upwelling sub-ecosystems of the world and is an important centre of marine biodiversity and marine food production. The GCLME is characterized by distinctive bathymetry, hydrography, chemistry, and trophodynamics and represents the number 28 Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) ranked among the most productive coastal and offshore waters in the world with rich fishery resources. However, over-exploitation of fisheries, pollution from domestic and industry sources, habitat destruction and poorly planned and managed coastal developments and near-shore activities are resulting in a rapid depletion of the rich fisheries resources and degradation of vulnerable coastal and offshore habitats putting the economies, productivity and health of the populace at risk. Recognizing the urgency of the fisheries decline and the environmental and socio-economic consequences for the region, the 16 countries bordering the ecosystem have mobilized complementary resources to the funding from the Global Environment Facility and United Nations Industrial Development Organization to implement priority management actions agreed in the preliminary Strategic Action Programme for the recovery of depleted fish stocks and restoration of degraded habitats for the advancement of the achievement of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) Johannesburg Plan of Implementation targets for recovery of fish stocks.

TI Fisheries biodiversity conservation and sustainable tourism in Mauritius
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper addresses the sustainability of the tourism sector from the perspective of a Small Island Developing State (SlDS), Mauritius. In this respect, the relationship between tourist earnings and fisheries biodiversity is examined. We begin, in the first place, by tracking and analyzing the evolution of fisheries biodiversity, a catalyst of the island's tourism, through the computation of Shannon's entropy index applied to 20 categories of fish experimented over a period of 25 years. In the second stage, this index is introduced, along with other control variables, in a regression equation to ascertain its potential impact on the value added of the tourism sector. Our empirical findings based on 25 years of observations undeniably reveal that fisheries biodiversity does play a major role in enhancing the revenue generated by the tourism sector. Hence, it is vital to promote biodiversity conservation, at least within the fisheries sector, to sustain economic progress; more so, given that tourism constitutes a major pillar of the economy of Mauritius and which is expected to grow even further.

ID PLANS
AB This paper reviews the historic approach to coastal management and the reasons behind the introduction of the littoral 'sediment cell' concept to shoreline management planning in England and Wales. It then reviews the strengths and limitations of the approach and makes practical recommendations on how the approach can be further improved to ensure that a robust methodology exists for assessing coastal evolution; thereby providing a foundation for enabling sustainable future management decisions. Such decisions can relate to both the selection of shoreline management practices, and the identification of appropriate land use planning and development control responses. Both of these items need to take account of natural coastal processes and the interactions that occur within coastal systems at various temporal and spatial scales. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The wide variety of goods and services provided by the coastal zone (food, medicines, nutrient recycling, control of flooding, typhoon protection) account for its many uses (fisheries, aquaculture, agriculture, human settlements, harbors, ports, tourism, industries). Aquaculture now provides a third of total fisheries production. Half of the total aquaculture yield comes from land-based ponds and water-based pens, cages, longlines and stakes in brackish water and marine habitats. But the opportunities for employment, income and foreign exchange from coastal aquaculture have been overshadowed by negative environmental and social effects. The environmental impacts include: mangrove loss, bycatch during collection of wild seed and broodstock, introductions and transfers of species, spread of parasites and diseases, misuse of chemicals, and release of wastes. The socioeconomic impacts include: privatization of public lands and waterways, loss of fisheries livelihoods, food insecurity, and urban migration. The paper gives recommendations on the attainment of responsible and sustainable aquaculture with emphasis on herbivorous and omnivorous species, polyculture, integration with agriculture and mangroves, and self-regulation in the form of codes of conduct and best management practices. Recommended approaches include holistic Integrated Coastal Zone Management based on stakeholder needs, mechanisms for conflict resolution, assimilative capacity of the environment, protection of community resources, and rehabilitation of degraded habitats, to improvements in the aquaculture sector pertaining to management of feed, water, and effluents.

AB Much of Southeast Asia's economic success is based on the under-priced export of valuable natural resources. Nowhere is this more evident than in fisheries-an important commodity in Southeast Asia, with significant export volumes contributing to the foreign exchange earnings of these countries.
   Existing fisheries and aquaculture policy development have lead to increased export earnings over the last decade, but have also resulted in increased extraction rates and incurred huge costs in terms of decreased local economic productivity and destruction of natural coastal resources. What is worrying is that Southeast Asian governments intend to further stimulate the export of fishery products, in particular shrimp from aquaculture, thereby increasingly threatening both domestic food security and the economic opportunities of local communities.
   This paper argues that: (1) current fisheries management and development policies are not contributing to domestic food security, are not profitable to the Southeast Asian macro-economy, and are doing much damage to coastal ecosystems and rural poor communities; (2) development of shrimp aquaculture has a negative impact and further expansion of the industry should be halted; (3) the considerable fisheries resources of the region should be used and managed to ensure domestic food security and economic development of the presently marginalized sectors of the population. Five recommendations that will help ensure sustainable use of coastal resources and deliver profits to the countries and communities that depend on these resources are made at the end of the paper.

AB The ecological integrity of coastal and near-shore environments is at the mercy of social, business, institutional and regulatory norms that dictate human behavior-not just at sea, but on land. The state of coastal lagoons, estuaries, harbours, semi-closed seas, and even the open ocean, is a mirror of anthropogenic activities on land that: (i) alter or destroy habitat; (ii) pollute groundwater, creeks and rivers that drain into the sea; and (iii) fill the atmosphere with particulates that settle on the sea. Land-based activities, such as mining, clearing vegetation for building roads, homes and hotels, destroy critical habitat and cloud river systems and estuaries with mud and silt. Since the broad range of land-based activities has a cumulative impact on coastal and marine environments, the sustainable development and protection of such environments pose challenges that demand multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches and require far more than tough sanctions to punish the environmental "bad guys".
   This paper reviews the strengths and weaknesses of regulatory and non-regulatory options available to governments to manage the destructive and polluting activities of their citizens in coastal and marine environments. It considers the challenge of mixing these options and advocates for a strategic "cocktail" of instruments that best suit respective natural, cultural, constitutional and economic scenarios. The paper discourages rushing towards a single untested alternative to traditional command-and-control regulation, but to incrementally experiment with a variety of instruments and combinations thereof. Governments should avoid the tendency to treat various policy instruments as alternatives to one another rather than as potentially complimentary mechanisms. These may include improved regulation, tradable permits, discharge fees and voluntary programmes. The process of incremental experimentation with regulatory alternatives should be paralleled by timely and comprehensive evaluation of effectiveness, efficiency, and their relationship with other components of the broader system. This is the philosophy underpinning the development of National Programmes of Action as required by the 1995 Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities (GPA).

AB Since the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, considerable movement has been made by international organizations engaged in ocean affairs towards adopting ecosystem-based assessment and management practices. A decade later, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), another significant milestone was reached with the support, by over 100 countries, for a Plan of Implementation that agreed on several specific ecosystem-related targets including: achievement of "substantial" reductions in land-based sources of pollution by 2006; introduction of the ecosystems approach to marine resource assessment and management by 2010; designation of a network of marine protected areas by 2012; and the maintenance and restoration of fish stocks to maximum sustainable yield levels by 2015. An international financial mechanism, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), is assisting developing countries in meeting the WSSD targets by supporting Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) assessment and management projects. Of the 29 LMEs for which published case study information is available on analyses of principal forces driving changes in biomass yields, fishing effort was the primary forcing mechanism in 14 LMEs, climate forcing was the principal factor in 13 LMEs, eutrophication in one case and the data were inconclusive in another. Fishing effort was a secondary driver of change in biomass yields in the 13 LMEs driven by climate forcing. Mitigating actions for reducing fishing effort to promote recovery of lost biomass yield is proving successful in one case study. Actions for improving forecasts of oceanographic conditions affecting fish stocks are underway in four GEF-supported LME projects (e.g., Humboldt Current, Canary Current, Guinea Current and Benguela Current); measures to assess and manage excessive fishing effort are planned for eight LME projects, eutrophication reduction and control in another; and six LMEs with relatively stable decadal biomass yields appear suitable for mandating precautionary total allowable catch levels. The GEF/LME projects include countries that contributed to 45% of global marine biomass yields in 1999. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB The legacy of overfishing, destruction of coastal habitats, and accelerated pollution loading has dramatically reduced the biomass and diversity of marine waters in East Asia. Coasts can no longer support the numbers of people migrating to them, thus risking future economic benefits and social stability. Some countries are adopting needed reforms while, in others, less priority is given to reforms. National budgets for the environment, as well as international financial flows for environmental sustainability, remain disappointing. In the water sector alone, a global shortfall of US$100 billion annually will frustrate the achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The paper argues that reforms are essential in the North and the South in order to reverse the gloomy outlook for East Asia, including global trade reforms and reduction of agricultural/fisheries subsidies in the North. Reforms to facilitate creation of public private partnerships and their international support may be the only viable options for improving water service delivery, sewage/industrial effluent treatment, fisheries, and maritime transport to reduce impacts on coastal and marine waters to meet MDGs. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has supported a series of projects since 1991, totaling US$657 million for East Asia, with an emphasis on practical application of integrated coastal management for the large marine ecosystems. Among reforms identified to mobilize the private sector are revolving funds, reinsurance facilities, sub-sovereign lending, risk mitigation, partnerships, and corporate responsibility. GEF advocated these reforms in the run-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development and is supporting a new generation of projects for countries desiring to pursue them. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wild harvest fisheries support millions of people in Asia, and there is a substantial trade both within and from the region to markets all over the world. As such, many fisheries are under great pressure due to the demand for seafood.
   Governments have a central role in terms of managing fisheries sustainably. However, this does not absolve the private sector from acting in a responsible manner. Mechanisms for encouraging responsible stewardship for fisheries by the private sector are varied. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) operates a certification and eco-labeling program for fisheries that encourages seafood consumers to actively purchase products from certified fisheries. The MSC program-taking into account the views of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other relevant bodies-was designed to address concerns amongst some economies that standards and certification may present trade barriers. This paper provides a description of how the MSC program meets WTO expectations for the operation of labeling programs.
   Certification generally identifies areas where improvements in fisheries management are required and puts the onus on the industry to actively make these improvements. MSC's experience to date is that certification results in demonstrable improvements to fisheries management-with the agreement of all interested parties. Due to the transport of seafood products across many boundaries, the certification and eco-labeling approach facilitates both co-operation across these boundaries and the adoption of best practices.

AB The Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) project in Xiamen, which started in the mid-1990s, is considered a successful example of ICM implementation. Now on its second cycle, the project has achieved significant results and received positive feedback from various international organizations.
   ICM, in general, has proven to be a workable environmental management scheme, and it has been replicated elsewhere in China and in other countries. However, it should be noted that ICM programs need to employ strategies aimed at strengthening human resources and institutional capacities. This paper discusses the establishment of the International Training Center for Coastal Sustainable Development and its role in disseminating the experiences and expertise of the Xiamen ICM site, the advancement of public education on ICM with the implementation of the Community-Based Conservation Management Cooperative Program of the Canadian International Development Agency; and the expansion of professional education in ICM through a Joint Masters Program in Environmental Management with the University of San Francisco. These three programs have been highly successful in developing ICM capacities at different levels (i.e. awareness of policymakers, public awareness and professional education), and they contribute to the formulation, design and implementation of successful ICM initiatives. As such, the formulation and implementation of partnerships in education programs are deemed crucial for Xiamen's success and in its role as one of the training bases for ICM in East Asia.

AB Bohai Sea, China's only inland sea, became seriously polluted because of rapid economic development. The pollution monitoring system of Bohai Sea started in 1978, and has grown to have 215 monitoring stations today. The Chinese government recently increased efforts to improve the environmental quality of Bohai Sea in an effort to achieve the sustainable development of the Wider Bohai Sea Area. This paper presents the current pollution situation and its environmental impacts. It also discusses the existing pollution management mechanisms and pollution abatement programs for Bohai Sea.

AB Balancing the needs of coastal communities, the desire for long-term sustainable resource use, and the maintenance of natural ecosystem equilibrium is a significant issue in most coastal regions. The United States, the United Kingdom and other European nations have used economic instruments (EIs) as an additional tool in curbing pollution. This approach has proven successful in many parts of the world, especially in developed countries.
   In Malaysia, Els for environmental protection have not been introduced, but general tax incentives coupled with others instruments (grants and subsidies) have been in place for the last 10 years. As the present environmental legislation (Environmental Quality Act of 1974) is not very effective in curbing pollution, Els such as green/environmental tax should be considered by the Malaysian Government.

TI Coastal poverty and MPA management in mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English

ID MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; PHILIPPINES; INDONESIA; SUSTAINABILITY; PROJECTS
AB Poverty and resource degradation are persistent features of the lives of a large proportion of the coastal people of Tanzania and Zanzibar. A useful question to raise in preparing poverty reduction and resource management strategies is therefore "how does marine protected area management impact the lives of the poor and reduce poverty?" This paper summarizes selected results of a study on poverty alleviation and marine protected areas (MPAs) in Tanzania and Zanzibar. The data are based on 749 household surveys and 72 focus group meetings in 24 coastal villages conducted in May, June 2003. Unveiling the linkages between poverty and coastal conservation found that poverty is a reality for villagers in the study sites and that it sometimes drives people to break management rules-hence poverty makes it more difficult to reach conservation goals. We conclude that the effectiveness and success of the MPA programs in achieving both conservation and development goals varies, but communities' perceptions of impacts and progress are most positive in those programs that have had the longest and greatest investment of time and resources.

AB This is the first of two articles exploring coastal management in South Africa. Decades of coastal management effort culminated in a Cabinet-approved coastal policy in December 1999. Based on a Government-civil society partnership, the policy aims to promote sustainable coastal development through integrated coastal management. It represents a marked shift from an earlier approach that virtually ignored justice, democracy and poverty. In recent years, attention has focused on empowering poor coastal communities to build sustainable livelihoods. This paper traces the evolution of coastal management in South Africa, and reflects on the challenges of fostering coastal sustainability. The following article explores the sustainable coastal livelihoods approach in more detail. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In 2002, the state of Victoria, Australia increased its "no-take" marine protected areas (MPAs) 100 fold to cover over 5% of its coastal waters in a comprehensive, adequate and representative system of marine national parks and sanctuaries. Given the ambitious targets set for MPA establishment globally in 2003 at the World Summit for Sustainable Development this apparently remarkable achievement could be an example to other nations and states attempting to establish substantial MPA systems.
   This paper describes and discusses the factors that contributed to the establishment of the Victorian system and the relevance of these factors to other jurisdictions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper summarises current knowledge of goods and services in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone of the Baltic Sea ecosystem. It reviews specific properties of the Baltic that could be used for economic valuation. Goods and services range from the familiar resources, of fish and minerals, which were valued with the Productivity Method, to less obvious services provided by the ecosystem such as biofiltration in coastal sands, valued with either the Replacement Cost or Damage Cost Avoided methods. Disservices to the marine ecosystem are also considered, e.g. erosion and coastal flooding, including the costs of planned mitigating measures. This paper emphasises the importance of using valuation methods to help make better-educated decisions for the sustainability of the Baltic Sea.

ID ORGANIC-MATTER; PHYSICAL FRACTIONATION
AB The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of agricultural practices on the characteristics of soil organic carbon (SOC). The study area is located in the Central Volcanic Belt (Michoacan) in Mexico. The soil is an Acrisol, acidic and rich in clays and sesquioxides. Experimental plots were treated with four different agronomic management systems between 2002 and 2003: traditional, improved traditional, organic and fallow. Each treatment was replicated twice. Samples were taken at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm and were subjected to a physical fractionation process by way of particle size. SOC was fractionated into fulvic acids, humic acids and humin. After two years of cultivation, the SOC content increased significantly with the organic management (2.2 mg g(-1) at 0-10 cm and 5.8 mg g(-1) at 10-20 cm). The C content of the soil fine particle fraction increased with the traditional and organic managements. The organic C and N contents of the silt + clay particle-size fraction were mainly concentrated as humin, indicating that this SOM should be stable and have a low risk of mineralization. The humin C content only decreased significantly under the traditional and fallow treatments. The N content of the humin fraction decreased significantly under the traditional management system (from 69% to 54%), indicating the low sustainability of this soil management. The C/N ratio of the soil increased significantly under all treatments, but mainly under the traditional and organic treatments (from 12.1 and 12.8 to 13.7 and 14.0, respectively). This indicates a decrease in humus quality. In addition, the C/N of the humin increased significantly (from 13.3 and 12.7 to 19.2 and 16.0, respectively). (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID CONSERVATION; WORLD
AB In response to a declaration in 2004 from a coalition of conservation and animal welfare organizations to ban imports of wild birds into the European Union, we propose that such blanket or indiscriminate bans are unlikely to be effective as a generic conservation approach to the wild bird trade. We further argue that such trade bans, particularly when imposed by Northern constituencies on Southern countries and communities, can act counter to broader values of equity and sustainable development. Here we draw attention to a range of problems and unforeseen consequences of trade bans and highlight the conservation potential of market-led mechanisms that seek to reform trade chains to make them more ethical and sustainable. We contend that it is time for conservation scientists to critically examine the evidence concerning the efficacy of these two strategies as they relate to the trade in wild birds.

AB It is widely acknowledged that people with advanced heart failure have at least as great a need for supportive and palliative care as those with malignant disease. However, specialist palliative care services are seldom involved in their care in the UK. We describe a three-year collaboration between community-based heart failure nurse specialists and existing specialist palliative care services. In the model of care that has evolved, the heart failure nurses remain key workers throughout the illness. They run a regular support group for patients and carers in the setting of a hospice day therapy unit, referring patients for other palliative care involvement as necessary. Activity data and the results of patient interviews are presented. These suggest that the model is a cost effective, sustainable way of providing high quality care for people with heart failure.

AB Taeniasis/cysticercosis has been reported from several provinces of Indonesia: Papua (=former Irian Jaya), Bali, North Sumatra, East Nusa Tenggara, South East Sulawesi, Lampung, North Sulawesi, Jakarta, West Kalimantan, and East Java. The highest level of endemicity of tacniasis/cysticercosis has been found in Papua. Recent surveys in Jayawijaya District of Papua in 2000 and 2001 showed that 5 of 58 local people (8.6%) harbored the adult tapeworm, Taenia solium, whereas 44 of 96 people (45.8%), 50 of 71 pigs (70.4%), and 7 of 64 local dogs (10.9%) were seropositive for T solium cysticercosis. Current surveys in Bali and Samosir District, North Sumatra during 2002-2005 revealed that Taenia saginata taeniasis has increased in incidence whereas T solium cysticercosis is now rather rare compared to one-two decades ago in Bali. Taenia asiatica taeniasis is still common in Samosir District. Data from other provinces of Indonesia are very limited or unavailable. Control of these diseases is not a priority in the health or veterinary services, neither at central or local government levels. However, limited efforts toward control of the diseases have been implemented such as training of health personnel, community education on disease prevention, and provision of anthelminthics. A working group for control of the disease in Indonesia and an international collaboration have been established among Ministry of Health, Indonesia; University of Indonesia; and Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Japan since 1996. Future goals include implementation of active case finding (active surveillance) and treatment of tapeworm carriers, sustainable public health education, establishment of a system to check the quality of beef/pork and determine the distribution of infected animals and strengthening of laboratory capacity. Efforts to motivate provinces and districts should be implemented in developing the strategic plan to control of the disease. Given the considerable differences in cultures, religions, levels of education, socio-economic levels, daily habits and behaviour etc., control programmes must be adapted to the local situations.

AB It is becoming increasingly necessary in life-cycle analysis (LCA) of infrastructure assets, including pavements, to take a longer-term approach than has been used, mainly to ensure sustainability and assess the impacts of today's decisions accurately. LCA can include primarily life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA), but it also can include considerations of resource conservation, environmental impacts, energy balance, and so forth, and it can involve short-, medium-, and long-term periods. It is thus possible to develop a context for LCA of likely and uncertain societal activities, including transportation, over these periods. Conventional LCCA is directed toward comparing competing alternative investment strategies and can involve a range of stakeholders. Of the methods available, present worth of costs is almost exclusively used in the pavement field. However, when medium- to longer-term life-cycle periods are involved, rate-of-return and cost-effectiveness formulations can be applicable. A numerical example shows how an agency can determine the internal rate of return for two investment alternatives involving different pavement designs and a life-cycle period of 50 years. In addition, a cost-effectiveness example is provided for a sidewalk network, again with a life-cycle period of 50 years. Conventional LCCA for calculating present worth of costs will undoubtedly continue to be used in the pavement field as a primary tool. However, using a rate-of-return or cost-effectiveness formulation, especially for medium- to longer-term life-cycle periods, should be given more consideration.

AB Sustainability is often defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. While other building materials may have to alter their configurations, properties, or both to be applicable to sustainable structures, precast concrete's inherent properties make it a natural choice for achieving sustainability with today's new buildings. In this paper, sustainability concepts are outlined and different rating systems for evaluating sustainable design are introduced. Finally, ways are provided in which precast concrete meets or exceeds one rating system's requirements to achieve sustainability.

AB This article presents an overview of lean manufacturing, a process by which precast concrete plants can reduce waste and improve their production operations. The authors describe eight types of waste that can be eliminated and identify seven principles that can substantially improve success in the application of lean manufacturing. Many examples from the industry are given to show how waste can be eliminated and plant operations improved. Although only a few PCI member companies are currently using lean manufacturing, those that are applying these techniques show decreased production costs, a reduction in rework, and enhanced production capacity.

AB Objective. Pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) have grown in number and size over time in aggregate across the United States, but the factors promoting such changes have not been well characterized. This study was conducted to explore the establishment, expansion, and closure of PICUs.
   Design: A cross-sectional in-depth telephone interview survey of executive hospital administrators.
   Setting. Fourteen institutions representing four newly established PICUs, two PICU expansions, and eight PICU closures.
   Measurements and Main Results: Officials' comments indicate that the establishment of PICUs is driven primarily by the need to care for patients requiring intensive cardiorespiratory monitoring and/or postoperative surgical care and to respond to the needs of outlying community hospitals. The main factors that drive PICU expansion are institutional growth in pediatric subspecialist medical and surgical support for critically ill patients and the need to match increases in demand and patient volume experienced by existing PICUs. With regard to PICU closures, competition from other institutions within the same market for patients and subspecialty care providers, lower-than-expected volumes of patients, and/or negative financial margins were cited as key factors.
   Conclusions: This study provides new insight into decision-making that influences the availability of critical care services for children. The establishment, expansion, and closure of PICUs are driven predominantly by local demand for pediatric critical care services, whereas availability of subspecialists as well as competition between PICUs within the same market affect the long-term sustainability of such services.

AB Knowledge of the effects of species diversity within taxonomic groups on nutrient cycling is important for understanding the rote of soil biota in sustainable agriculture. We hypothesized that earthworm species specifically affect nitrogen mineralization, characteristically for their ecological. group classifications, and that earthworm species interactions would affect mineralization through competition and facilitation effects. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of three earthworm species, representative of different ecological. groups (epigeic: Lumbricus rubellus; endogeic: Aporrectodea caliginosa tuberculata; and anecic: Lumbricus terrestris), and their interactions on the bacterial. community, and on nitrogen mineralization from N-15-labelled crop residue and from soil organic matter.
   Our results indicate that L. rubellus and L. terrestris enhanced mineralization of the applied crop residue whereas A. caliginosa had no effect. On the other hand, L. rubellus and A. caliginosa enhanced mineralization of the soil, organic matter, whereas L. terrestris had no effect. The interactions between different earthworm species affected the bacterial. community and the net mineralization of soil organic matter. The two-species interactions between L. rubellus and A. caliginosa, and L. rubellus and L. terrestris, resulted in reduced mineral N concentrations derived from soil organic matter, probably through increased immobilization in the bacterial biomass. In contrast, the interaction between A. caliginosa and L. terrestris resulted in increased bacterial growth rate and reduced total soil C. When all three species were combined, the interaction between A. caliginosa and L. terrestris was dominant. We conclude that the effects of earthworms on nitrogen mineralization depend on the ecological traits of the earthworm species present, and can be modified by species interactions. Knowledge of these effects can be made useful in the prevention of nutrient losses and increased soil fertility in agricultural systems, that typically have a low earthworm diversity.

AB A major obstacle for promoting sustainable (e.g. ecological) consumer behaviors is people's negative attitude towards these. We tested the potential of a persuasion technique for improving these attitudes. We propose that cueing ecological behaviors people usually engage in, increases the accessibility of previously performed ecological behavior in the memory. As several theories suggest attitudes are inferred from previous behavior, we expected the increased ease of retrieval of ecological actions to result in more favorable attitudes towards these. Two studies confirmed this hypothesis, and further research will verify the success of the technique in promoting actual environmental behavior. Implications for setting up effective social marketing campaigns are discussed.

AB he inverse transfer in the forced-dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation is studied, when the natural dissipation operator mu(-Delta)(1/2) lis employed. The nonlinear transfer of this system conserves the two quadratic quantities psi(1) = (vertical bar(-Delta)(1/4) psi vertical bar(2)>/2 and psi(2) = (vertical bar(-Delta)(1/2) psi vertical bar(2))/2 (kinetic energy), where psi is the stream function and <.> denotes a spatial average. In the limit of infinite domain, the kinetic energy density psi(2) remains bounded, for the natural dissipation operator. For the power-law inverse-transfer region, the inverse flux of T-1 diminishes as it proceeds toward sufficiently low wavenumbers, whenever the kinetic energy psi(2) remains bounded. This implies that no persistent (non-dissipative) inverse cascade of psi(1) to ever-lower wavenumbers is sustainable, as long as the dissipation parameter mu it is held fixed. This result does not rule out the possibility that for sufficiently small mu, a finite inverse flux would reach a certain low wavenumber. Numerical results supporting the theoretical predictions are presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The decreasing availability of energy and concern about climate change necessitate the development of novel sustainable energy sources. Fusion energy is such a source. Although it will take several decades to develop it into routinely operated power sources, the ultimate potential of fusion energy is very high and badly needed. A major step forward in the development of fusion energy is the decision to construct the experimental test reactor ITER. ITER will stimulate research in many areas of science. This article serves as an introduction to some of those areas. In particular, we discuss research opportunities in the context of plasma-surface interactions. The fusion plasma, with a typical temperature of 10 keV, has to be brought into contact with a physical wall in order to remove the helium produced and drain the excess energy in the fusion plasma. The fusion plasma is far too hot to be brought into direct contact with a physical wall. It would degrade the wall and the debris from the wall would extinguish the plasma. Therefore, schemes are developed to cool down the plasma locally before it impacts on a physical surface. The resulting plasma-surface interaction in ITER is facing several challenges including surface erosion, material redeposition and tritium retention. In this article we introduce how the plasma-surface interaction relevant for ITER can be studied in small scale experiments. The various requirements for such experiments are introduced and examples of present and future experiments will be given. The emphasis in this article will be on the experimental studies of plasma-surface interactions.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Governance structures in Botswana are highly centralized and top-down in orientation. For water and related resources management in rural areas, this creates particular difficulties - from lack of decision-making capacity to limited human and financial capital at the level of the resource base. In Ngamiland, government is currently undertaking the Okavango Delta Management Plan project as part of its commitment to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. The project purports to develop an integrated management plan based on an ecosystems approach. Meaningful participation by local people is a requirement of the process. Data from 43 village meetings undertaken under the auspices of the ODMP process reveal that local people's access to their resource base is diminishing. Information from key informant interviews and a variety of government documents, however, suggests that policy makers are either unaware of or uninterested in this growing problem. Although citizens and government are engaged in an on-going dialogue, there is little evidence to suggest that policy and practice are moving toward sustainable solutions for all. This article highlights these issues in the hope that a more meaningful dialogue among all stakeholders may be undertaken. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the early 1990s, Zimbabwe embarked on a process of water reform which culminated in the enactment of the 1998 Water Act [Chapter 20:24]. The 1998 water act emphasizes stakeholder participation in water utilization and management. The process which led to the promulgation of the 1998 Water Act was supposed to involve the participation and consultation of all the groups of stakeholders. This was going to make the majority of the stakeholders become aware of the water governance transformation and the provisions of the new legislation. This article thus explores stakeholder knowledge about the water governance transformation in Zimbabwe. It presents data collected from the Middle Manyame Subcatchment area which falls under the Manyame Catchment Council (CC). The paper shows that the majority of the stakeholders in the study area in general and those from the agricultural sector in particular do not have much knowledge about the 1998 Water Act, Subcatchment Councils (SCCs) and CCs. Moreover, the stakeholders do not know their representatives on water governance institutions. They also do not have much knowledge about how their representatives were elected. This is due to a failure of governance. However, government commitment to a concerted outreach programme may assist in the realization of the fundamental goals - equity, efficiency and sustainability - that lay at the heart of Zimbabwe's initial push for water reforms.

AB An estimated 70% of the national population lives in rural areas in Zimbabwe. Previous studies suggest that groundwater is consumed predominantly without treatment. This study evaluated the sustainability of a rural water point rehabilitation project that was carried out in Mwenezi (Masvingo Province), and Gwanda, Bulilima and Mangwe (Matabeleland South Province) districts by a local NGO. The study was carried out a year after the rehabilitation project. Sustainability indicators considered in the study included the reliability of the system, human capacity development, institutional arrangements, and the impact of the project on rural livelihoods. A combination of field inspections of the water points and interviews with villagers were used as study tools.
   It was found out that 14% of the water points were broken down in Mwenezi, 17% (Gwanda), 13% (Bulilima) and 25% (Mangwe). Water quality was satisfactory for taste for over 90% and for 62-95% of respondents for soap consumption in all districts. Trained repair personnel were available in over 50% of the cases. Awareness of the training workshops for operation and maintenance in all districts was above 75%. Water point committees existed and functioned in all districts for 50-83% of water points. For 84-93% of the responses financial contributions were made only in the event of a breakdown. The walking distance to a water point was reduced after the project according to 83-100% of respondents in all districts. Health and hygiene knowledge was deemed to have improved due to the project in 46-78% of cases.
   It was concluded that opportunities for sustainable water supply are there if active community involvement is enhanced, training is lengthened and water point committees strengthened. There is also need to raise the awareness of ordinary villagers. Future rehabilitation projects should consider stricter supervision and equipping the trained personnel with tools.

AB The Millennium Development Goals' target to halve the proportion of people who suffer from hunger is extremely important in southern Africa, where food security has become increasingly problematic over the last 20 years. One "quick-win" proposal is replenishment of soil nutrients for smallholder farmers, through free or subsidised chemical fertilisers. Other proposals include appropriate irrigation technology, improved inputs and interventions targeted at women.
   Analysis of over 10 years of agro-hydrological and agro-economic studies from southern African show that a different approach is required to interventions proposed. There are sustainability problems with free chemical fertiliser due to transport costs and ancillary costs. Furthermore, recent studies in Zimbabwe and Mozambique show that significant increases in yield can only be obtained when soil fertility management is combined with good crop husbandry, e.g. timely planting and weeding. Ongoing replenishment of fertility would be dependent on a continued free or subsidised fertiliser supply, and transport system. Increasing access to irrigation will help, but is not the only solution and cannot reach even a majority of farmers. It has been determined that short dryspells are often the major cause of low yields in sub-Saharan Africa. Soil-water conservation approaches, e.g. winter weeding and conservation tillage, can reduce risk and increase yield.
   The following specific recommendations are made for urgent interventions to contribute sustainably to food security in southern Africa: (i) To increases access to fertiliser, consider development of strong input markets at end-user level. (ii) Intensification of technology transfer, focusing on capacity building for transfer of existing technologies and much closer collaboration between state and NGO sectors, agronomists and water engineers. (iii) Increasing the uptake of soil-water conservation methods, including conservation tillage and weeding, and supplementary irrigation to minimise adverse effects of dryspells, through investments in farmer training. (iv) Linking crop development strategies to livestock development practices and strategies. (v) Developing non-agro-based livelihood strategies in marginal lands. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The water resources management regime has shifted from one focusing almost exclusively on augmenting supply to one where ensuring access, equity and sustainability are an integral part of process. It is widely recognized that South Africa will face water scarcity in the near future. But 'scarcity', as we show in our case study, is a relative concept. This paper interrogates perceptions of scarcity in the small South African rural community of Greater Genadendal. Using a wide variety of data, we explore the intersection between poverty alleviation and adequate water supply. The results show that notwithstanding sufficient water being available, the community experiences what Mehta [Mehta, L., 2001. The manufacture of popular perceptions of scarcity: dams and water-related narratives in Gujarat, India. World Development 29 (12), 2025-2041] calls 'manufactured scarcity'. This is due to inadequate infrastructure, institutional incapacity and a history of political inequality. In the case of Greater Genadendal, these forms of scarcity are present simultaneously leading to a very complex situation. Overcoming these types of scarcity, however, require more than just new infrastructure. They require socio-economic and socio-political types of intervention that target the bases for manufactured scarcity: abiding poverty and socio-inequality. However, there appears to be a lack of social capital, in particular the trust that would enable government and local people to work together for improved livelihoods and sustainable water supplies. Joint resource rehabilitation activities may be one way of building social capital and moving toward IWRM in the study area. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In resource-poor and low-population-density areas, on-site sanitation is preferred to off-site sanitation and groundwater is the main source of water for domestic uses. Groundwater pollution potential from on-site sanitation in such areas conflicts with Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) principles that advocate for sustainable use of water resources. Given the widespread use of groundwater for domestic purposes in rural areas, maintaining groundwater quality is a critical livelihood intervention.
   This study assessed impacts of pit latrines on groundwater quality in Kamangira village, Marondera district, Zimbabwe. Groundwater samples from 14 monitoring boreholes and 3 shallow wells were analysed during 6 sampling campaigns, from February 2005 to May 2005. Parameters analysed were total and faecal coliforms, NH4+-N, NO3--N, conductivity, turbidity and PH, both for boreholes and 4 3 shallow wells. Total and faecal coliforms both ranged 0-TNTC (too-numerous-to-count), 78% of results meeting the 0 CFU/100 ml WHO guidelines value. NH4+-N range was 0-2.0 mg/l, with 99% of results falling below the 1.5 mg/l WHO recommended value. NO3--N range was 0.0-6.7 mg/l, within 10 mg/l WHO guidelines value. The range for conductivity values was 46-370 mu S/cm while the PH range was 6.8-7.9. There are no WHO guideline values for these two parameters. Turbidity ranged from 1 NTU to 45 NTU, 59% of results meeting the 5 NTU WHO guidelines limit. Depth from the ground surface to the water table for the period February 2005 to May 2005 was determined for all sampling points using a tape measure. The drop in water table averaged from 1.1 in to 1.9 in and these values were obtained by subtracting water table elevations from absolute ground surface elevation. Soil from the monitoring boreholes was classified as sandy. The soil infiltration layer was taken as the layer between the pit latrine bottom and the water table. It averaged from 1.3 m to 1.7 m above the water table for two latrines and 2-3.2 m below it for one pit latrine. A questionnaire survey revealed the prevalence of diarrhoea and structural failure of latrines.
   Results indicated that pit latrines were microbiologically impacting on groundwater quality up to 25 in lateral distance. Nitrogen values were of no immediate threat to health. The shallow water table increased pollution potential from pit latrines. Raised and lined pit latrines and other low-cost technologies should be considered to minimize potential of groundwater pollution. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Irrigation has been found to be central in curbing food scarcity not only in Tanzania but also in many other developing countries. It has been proved that continued reliability on rainfall in agriculture cannot sustain the increase in population. This study examines the impacts of smallholder irrigated agriculture in improving social and economic benefits in Igurusi Ward of Mbarali District which is located in the southern-western part of Tanzania. The study applies the Participatory Rural Appraisal Framework for data collection. The study was confined to five villages in Igurusi ward which are Majenje, Igurusi, Chamoto, Uhambule and Mahango. The study examined critically paddy production for smallholder farmers that practice irrigation and those who cultivates rain-fed paddy. The study examined both existing traditional and modern irrigation systems. It was found that, most of the respondents (79%) practice irrigated agriculture in paddy production while the remaining 21% practice rain-fed agriculture. Forty percent of households that practice irrigated agriculture harvest paddy two seasons per year. The return to labour in paddy production for smallholder farmers who irrigate their paddy fields is about US$ 2.5/manday which is above the poverty line of US$ 1.0/day. The smallest return to labour (US$ 0.85/manday) is obtained by an average smallholder farmer who cultivates rain-fed paddy using hand hoe and family labour. The potential implication of the current irrigation systems is that if irrigation is managed properly it may lead to sustainable increases in small farmer's productivity and income, thus alleviating rural poverty.

AB Resource-poor smallholder farmers in the semi-arid Gwanda and Beitbridge districts face food insecurity on an annual basis due to a combination of poor and erratic rainfall (average 500 mm/a and 345 mm/a, respectively, for the period 1970-2003) and technologies inappropriate to their resource status. This impacts on both household livelihoods and food security. In an attempt to improve food security in the catchment a number of drip kit distribution programmes have been initiated since 2003 as part of an on-going global initiative aimed at 2 million poor households per year. A number of recent studies have assessed the technical performance of the drip kits in-lab and in-field.
   In early 2005 a study was undertaken to assess the impacts and sustainability of the drip kit programme. Representatives of the NGOs, local government, traditional leadership and agricultural extension officers were interviewed. Focus group discussions with beneficiaries and other villagers were held at village level. A survey of 114 households was then conducted in two districts, using a questionnaire developed from the output of the interviews and focus group discussions.
   The results from the study showed that the NGOs did not specifically target the distribution of the drip kits to poor members of the community (defined for the purpose of the study as those not owning cattle). Poor households made up 54% of the beneficiaries. This poor targeting of vulnerable households could have been a result of conditions set by some implementing NGOs that beneficiaries must have an assured water source. On the other hand, only 2% of the beneficiaries had used the kit to produce the expected 5 harvests over the 2 years, owing to problems related to water shortage, access to water and also pests and diseases. About 51% of the respondents had produced at least 3 harvests and 86% produced at least 2 harvests. Due to water shortages during the dry season 61% of production with the drip kit occurred during the wet season. This suggests that most households use the drip kits as supplementary irrigation. Conflicts between beneficiaries and water point committees or other water users developed in some areas especially during the dry season.
   The main finding from this study was that low cost drip kit programs can only be a sustainable intervention if implemented as an integral part of a long-term development program, not short-term relief programs and the programme should involve a broad range of stakeholders. A first step in any such program, especially in water scarce areas such as Gwanda and Beitbridge, is a detailed analysis of the existing water resources to assess availability and potential conflicts, prior to distribution of drip kits.

AB The agricultural economic sector of Botswana is limited mainly to range resources-based livestock and pockets of arable farming based on rainfall and limited irrigated agriculture at several places. In this study agricultural sustainability of rain-fed agriculture is investigated in Botswana by considering the Pandamatenga plains as a case study. Daily soil moisture regimes with respect to crop growth cycle were modelled using a water balance model based on 42 years of daily hydroclimatic inputs and corresponding simulated components of soil moisture, evaporation, surface runoff, and deep percolation. Using a sustainability criterion on crop water requirement and soil moisture availability during the cropping periods, it was found that rain-fed agriculture of maize, sunflower, and sorghum crops is sustainable. The relative sensitivity to drought of these crops was also found to conform to the Agromisa recommendations. In the pursuit to explore more IWRM opportunities, through the simulation of the corresponding direct runoff, we have also explored that more water harvesting opportunities exist in order to manage rainfall excesses effectively.

AB Wetlands are resources of paramount importance with many values and functions that need proper management for their continued functioning and the delivery of benefits to the community. Sustained functioning of wetlands requires proper use of land and management of water. It is commonly said that increased human activities have had negative impacts on the Usangu Plains wetlands and that these wetlands are on the verge of total collapse due to altered flows. Nevertheless, these beliefs are little supported by quantitative data. A study on the dynamics of Usangu Plains wetlands therefore investigated long-term and seasonal changes that have occurred as a result of human and developmental activities in the study area for the periods between 1973 and 1984, and between 1984 and 2000. Landsat-MSS and Landsat-TM images were used to locate and quantify the changes. The study revealed a 14% increase in area covered by vegetated swamp between 1973 and 1984, and a decline by 77% and 70% in area covered by closed and open woodlands respectively. Between 1984 and 2000, the vegetated swamp cover declined by 67%, while the closed woodland and open woodlands declined by 83% and 77% respectively. It has also been revealed that the differences in spatial resolution could impair the detection of change. The continued decline in wetland covers has the potential to cause irreversible changes in these wetlands. Remote sensing and GIS technologies have proved to be useful tools for assisting decision-makers to locate and quantify changes in land resources, and hence to identify appropriate solutions for sustainable management of wetlands.

AB Water use system innovations encompass various techniques for storing and conserving water resources in different mediums for domestic and livestock use including agricultural production. Although, several authors have indicated that rainwater harvesting techniques, especially for upgrading smallholder farming systems, are not new but have been practiced since ancient civilizations, the impacts of such water use innovations on eco-hydrological systems are rarely assessed, especially from a cascading spatial and temporal perspective. The need to quantify the supposedly potential and related hydrological impacts of water use innovations on a catchment and river basin at large, led to the on-going research study aimed at investigating the biophysical consequences at different spatial and temporal scales in the Thukela river basin, of increased productivity in smallholder rainfed agriculture enabled through adoption at larger spatial scale of integrated land use management and water use system innovations. In this paper we discuss and outline the approach used in setting up the research study in one of the catchments in the Thukela river basin, the Potshini catchment, in the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa in an effort to seek answers to the question: "What is the impact of adapting water use innovations in a predominantly agricultural area on catchment ecology and hydrology?" The approach incorporates a catchment monitoring network, hydrological modelling and application of a remote sensing technique, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), for spatially estimating the total evaporation in the region covering the Potshini catchment and beyond. Preliminary results indicate that water use innovations in the Potshini catchment have influenced the partitioning of rainfall, by significantly reducing surface runoff over agricultural lands under conservation tillage practices, with a reduction of above 100%, while encouraging infiltration and deeper percolation into the soil. It is envisaged that, on accomplishment, the study will contribute to formulation of sustainable adaptation of water use innovations and up-scaling strategies to enhance food production and hydro-ecological balance in semi-arid savannahs of Africa, at which stage hydrological modelling will form an important part of the study.

AB The need to improve smallholder rainfed maize production in a sustainable manner is important in South Africa, as maize is a staple food to the rural indigenous population. Smallholder maize production is often characterised by low yields, which are often significantly lower than the potential for the land. However, sustainable maize production is not only a question of yields, but also of protection of the environmental resource base, social welfare, and the livelihoods of farmers as well as adjacent rural and urban communities. Sustainability for the smallholder farmer raises questions of household food security, farmer and community well-being as well as agro-ecosystem integrity.
   Sustainability was assessed at the smallholder agro-ecosystem scale using a goal-orientated sustainability framework. The use of the physically based CERES-Maize crop model within the sustainability framework meant that agro-ecosystem responses to different management options (e.g. tillage systems and fertiliser application) and climate change scenarios could be quantified. The agro-ecosystem that has been simulated is at Potshini village, which is about 10 kin from Bergville in the western-central region of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. The agro-ecosystem was simulated for different management strategies for a range of plausible future climate scenarios for South Africa. The future climate scenarios of '2 x CO2' and '2 x CO2 + 10%rain' had the biggest positive effect on mean grain yield. These scenarios had increases of over 1000 kg/ha with inorganic fertiliser and similar to 200 kg/ha with manure. The largest negative effects on yield are with the '+2 degrees C' scenario. The biggest increase in losses of organic nitrogen were with the '2 x CO2 + 2 degrees C' scenario where losses increased by up to 5%. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The European Water Framework Directive establishes the basis for Community action in the field of water policy. Water authorities in Catalonia, together with users are designing a management program to improve groundwater status and to assess the impact of infrastructures and city-planning activities on the aquifers and their associated natural systems. The objective is to describe the role of groundwater modelling in addressing the issues raised by the Water Framework Directive, and its application to the Llobregat Delta, Barcelona, Spain. In this case modelling was used to address Water Framework Directive in the following: (1) Characterisation of aquifers and the status of groundwater by integration of existing knowledge and new hydrogeological information. Inverse modelling allowed us to reach an accurate description of the paths and mechanisms for the evolution of seawater intrusion. (2) Quantification of groundwater budget (mass balance). This is especially relevant for those terms that are difficult to asses, such as recharge from river infiltration during floods, which we have found to be very important. (3) Evaluation of groundwater-related environmental needs in aquatic ecosystems. The model allows quantifying groundwater input under natural conditions, which can be used as a reference level for stressed conditions. (4) Evaluation of possible impacts of territory planning (Llobregat river course modification, new railway tunnels, airport and docks enlargement, etc.). (5) Definition of management areas. (6) The assessment of possible future scenarios combined with optimization processes to quantify sustainable pumping rates and design measures to control seawater intrusion.
   The resulting model has been coupled to a user-friendly interface to allow water managers to design and address corrective measures in an agile and effective way. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil erosion due to water is a major environmental problem in many parts of the world. Most of Mediterranean countries are concerned because of their specific climate and soils sensitivity, but also because of the recent intensification of human activities and agricultural practices. Accurate estimation of soil water erosion for various land-use and climate scenarios is so an important key to define sustainable management policies. In the last decades, several studies have been carried out to build models suitable for quantifying soil erosion. Among these models, the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP, Flanagan, D.C., Nearing, M.A., 1995. USDA-Water Erosion Prediction Project: Hillslope profile and watershed model documentation. NSERL Report 10, USDA-ARS National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory, West Lafayette, IN, USA.) is a physically based, distributed-parameter model that has been developed and mainly validated in USA. Only few studies have investigated its applicability to environmental conditions that differs from those where the model was developed. The aim of this work is to test the efficiency of WEPP model to predict soil erosion at catchment scale in a Mediterranean semi-arid area. Continuous simulations have been conducted between 1995 and 2002 on an cultivated experimental catchment located upstream from a hill reservoir (Kamech catchment, 2.45 km(2), Cap Bon, Tunisia) where runoff and soil erosion measurements are available at the outlet. Comparison between predictions and measurements shows significant differences. Processes related to seasonal effects (as cracking soils) are pointed out as a weakness of WEPP model for Mediterranean conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Upgrading agriculture in semi-arid areas and ensuring its sustainability, require an optimal management of rainfall partition between blue and green waters in the farmed water harvesting catchment. The main objective of this study is to analyze the influence of heterogeneous land use on the spatial and temporal variation of rainfall partitioning and blue water production within a typical farmed catchment located in north-eastern Tunisia. The catchment has an area of 2.6 km(2) and comprises at its outlet a dam, which retains the runoff water in a reservoir. Overland flow and soil water balance components were monitored during two cropping seasons (2000/2001 and 2001/2002) on a network of eleven plots of 2 m(2) each with different land use and soil characteristics. The hydrological balances of both the catchment and reservoir have been monitored since 1994.
   Observed data showed a very large temporal and spatial variability of overland flow within the catchment reflecting the great importance of total rainfall as well as land use. During the 2001/2002 season the results showed a large variation of the number of observed runoff events, from 27 to 39, and of the annual overland flow depths, from 8 min (under vineyard on calcaric cambisols) up to 43 mm (under shrubs-pasture on haplic regosols), between the plots. The annual runoff amounts were moderate; they always corresponded to less than 15% of the annual rainfall amount whatever the observation scale. It was also observed that changes in land use in years with similar rainfall could lead to significant differences in blue water flow. An attempt for predicting the overland flow by the general linear regression approach showed an r(2) of 31%, the predictors used are the class of soil infiltration capacity, the initial moisture saturation ratio of the soil surface layer and the total rainfall amounts.
   These experimental results indicate that the variation in land use in a semi-arid catchment is a main factor of variation in soil surface conditions and explain the major role played by the former on hydrological behavior of the upstream area and on rainfall partition between overland flow and infiltration. Therefore, to predict the water harvesting capacities in terms of blue water production of a farmed catchment in semi-arid areas it seems essential to consider precisely its land use and its temporal evolution related to management practices.

TI Effect of vermicompost on the growth and health of Impatiens wallerana
SO PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
AB Rhizoctonia solani damping-off and root rot diseases are frequent in impatiens crops in Buenos Aires. Their control is based in fungicide use. In a sustainable nursery production, beneficial microorganisms that develop in organic amendments may suppress diseases and promote Plant growth. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of different proportions of vermicompost on the growth and health of patience-plant (Impatiens wallerana). The experiment was carried out in a polyethylene greenhouse. Treatments were defined as follows: infested substrate, substrate, sterilized Substrate, vermicompost, and vermicompost mixed with infested substrate at 75, 50 and 25% by volume. Seeds of L wallerana were sown in plugs containing the different substrates. Percentage of healthy seedlings was evaluated since emergence, and growth parameters were recorded at day 51. The concentration of pathogen in the different treatments was estimated at the beginning and end of the experiment. Treatments with 100-75% of vermicompost showed important increases of leaf area, plant height and fresh and (try weight of aerial and subterranean organs. Root length was not modified by compost addition. Vermicompost at 75% provided slight control of damping-off caused by R. solani.

AB A new Sim-CYCLE grazing model has been obtained by combining a grazing model (Seligman et al. 1992, Ecol. Model. 60:45-61) with the Sim-CYCLE model (Ito and Oikawa 2002, Ecol. Model. 151:143-176). The new model has been validated against a set of field data obtained at Kherlen Bayaan-Ulaan (KBU) grassland. On the basis of the model, the root responses to grazing of KBU grassland have been studied under different conditions of stocking rates and precipitation. Model results indicate that both belowground biomass (BB) and below-ground net primary production (BNPP) generally decrease with increasing stocking rate. However, if stocking rate is not higher than 0.7 sheep ha(-1), a sustainable state of the grassland ecosystem can be achieved after about 100 years, which suggests that the maximum sustainable stocking rate at KBU should be 0.7 sheep ha-1. At the sustainable state, the maximum BB in a year is about 11 Mg DM ha(-1) under non-grazing condition, 5 Mg DM ha(-1) under 0.4 sheep ha(-1) stocking rate, and 4 Mg DM ha(-1) under 0.7 sheep ha(-1) stocking rate; the BNPP is 1.3 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1) under non-grazing condition, and 0.6 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1) under 0.4 sheep ha(-1) stocking rate, and 0.4 Mg DM ha(-1) year' under 0.7 sheep hat stocking rate. Ratio of non-assimilation organ to assimilation organ (C/F) increases with increasing stocking rate. The C/F ratio is 10.99 under non-grazing conditions, and 12.11 under 0.7 sheep hat stocking rate. Root turnover rate decreases with increasing stocking rate. The rate is 12% each year under non-grazing conditions, and 11% each year under 0.7 sheep ha(-1) stocking rate. In addition, the effect of grazing on the grassland ecosystem under different scenarios of precipitation is also analyzed. Both BB and BNPP increase with increased precipitation, and vice versa. When precipitation is set to be 10% higher than the averaged from 1993 to 2002, the maximum sustainable stocking rate is 0.8 sheep ha(-1), and when the precipitation is set to be 15% lower than the averaged, the maximum sustainable stocking rate is 0.6 sheep ha(-1).

AB Biofertilizers have been used as sources to improve plant nutrients in sustainable agriculture. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) Bacillus megaterium var, phosphaticum and potassium solubilizing bacteria (KSB) Bacillus mucilaginosus inoculated in nutrient limited soil planted with pepper and cucumber. Results showed that rock P and K applied either singly or in combination did not significantly enhance soil availability of P and K, indicating their unsuitability for direct application. PSB was a more potent P-solubilizer than KSB, and co-inoculation of PSB and KSB resulted in consistently higher P and K availability than in the control without bacterial inoculum and without rock material fertilizer. Integrated rock P with inoculation of PSB increased the availability of P and K in soil, the uptake of N, P and K by shoot and root, and the growth of pepper and cucumber. Similar but less pronounced results were obtained when rock K and KSB were added concomitantly. Combined together, rock materials and both bacterial strains consistently increased further mineral availability, uptake and plant growth of pepper and cucumber, suggesting its potential use as fertilizer.

AB Pollination is exclusively or mainly animal mediated for 70% to 90% of angiosperm species. Thus, pollinators provide an essential ecosystem service to humankind. However, the impact of human-induced biodiversity loss on the functioning of plant - pollinator interactions has not been tested experimentally. To understand how plant communities respond to diversity changes in their pollinating fauna, we manipulated the functional diversity of both plants and pollinators under natural conditions. Increasing the functional diversity of both plants and pollinators led to the recruitment of more diverse plant communities. After two years the plant communities pollinated by the most functionally diverse pollinator assemblage contained about 50% more plant species than did plant communities pollinated by less-diverse pollinator assemblages. Moreover, the positive effect of functional diversity was explained by a complementarity between functional groups of pollinators and plants. Thus, the functional diversity of pollination networks may be critical to ecosystem sustainability.

AB This study focuses on two basic questions: Are voluntary programs effective in promoting higher environmental performance by participant firms? If so, which distinct areas of environmental performance are more likely to be improved by firms joining a voluntary environmental program? We address these questions by assessing the environmental effectiveness of the ski industry's Sustainable Slopes Program in the western United States between 2001 and 2005. We found no evidence in our five-year analysis to conclude that ski areas adopting the SSP displayed superior performance levels than nonparticipants for the following areas of environmental protection: overall environmental performance, expansion management, pollution management, and wildlife and habitat management. SSP participants only appear to show a statistically significant correlation with higher natural resource conservation performance rates. For policymakers, these results suggest that caution is needed before a priori assuming that strictly voluntary programs can be effective in promoting comprehensive superior environmental performance.

AB The nature and quality of representation in public participation is crucial to reaching acceptable environmental decisions that can be implemented. Ten case studies of natural resource management groups involved in agriculture in south western Australia were conducted at four spatial scales-state, regional, land conservation district (shire or county), and subcatchment. Qualitative analysis identified the desirable qualities of representatives, and then compared perceptions of current practice at the four scales against these ideals. Desirable qualities were being an active participant, competency (skills and knowledge), credibility, adopting the group identity and commitment, communicating outside the group, having established social networks, and an ability to function in multiple roles. Analysis across scales suggests that for groups at broader spatial scales of organizing, such as the state level, representation was closer to achieving the desired qualities than at other scales. This finding is contrary to much of the current rhetoric in natural resource management, and environmental management more generally, that "local is better." The article concludes with some thoughts as to why this is the case, suggesting that the success or otherwise of representation, and the public participation in which representatives are involved, is influenced not only by the scale of decision making but also by how representatives are selected and what they are expected to achieve.

AB A macroscopic mini-model of Brazil's electrical generating capacity (BRAZELECTRIX, Brazilian Electricity Matrix) was developed using the Energy Systems Language and simulated with iconographic Extend (R) software to explore long-term (200 years) population carrying capacity. South American reserves of natural gas (NG) and Brazilian stream hydro-power potential were assumed as the main inputs to electric power production. Energy values (e.g., kWh, joules) for fuels, electricity and environment were transformed to solar emergy (i.e., solar equivalent joules) to simplify cross comparison with a single metric. BRAZELECTRIX was calibrated using a holistic method that used mean component life-times and conservation of material and energy for each individual unit. Validation of BRAZELECTRIX, based on historical data, gave a root mean square error of 8% for hydroelectricity and 28% for natural gas use. Investments in natural gas infrastructure (e.g., contracts, pipelines, processing plants and electric power plants) accelerated Brazil's expansion of electrical generating capacity for a finite period, allowing the country to reach its renewable (hydro-power only) carrying capacity 100 years sooner than without (2040 vs. 2140). Brazil has a total of 560 zetta-solar equivalent joules per annum (1 Zseja = 1 x 10(21) sej per year) of stream hydro-power potential; 170 Zseja is currently used for electricity generation. According to BRAZELECTRIX, eventually 390 Zseja will be tapped for hydroelectricity. The standard of living, as measured by annual per capita electrical solar emergy, had risen 680% from 166 tera-solar equivalent joules (Tseja) to 1130 Tseja during the 35 year period following 1965 and was predicted to increase another 75% to its maximum (1973 Tseja) in 2050. By comparison, an urbanizing state of the United States (North Carolina) had an annual per capita electrical solar emergy of 7815 Tseja in 1992, indicating that Brazil could reach a living standard, as measured by per capita electricity usage, equal to one-forth the level of United States. Macroscopic minimodels combined with emergy accounting evaluated long-term paths for Brazil's electricity supply and related it to natural environment trade-offs to demonstrate how sustainable carrying capacity of a developing nation can be forecast.

AB Background. This study examines the effectiveness of the school-based campaign "Smoke-Free Class Competition" as a means of preventing young non-smokers from taking up smoking.
   Methods. Based on two measurements of the Heidelberg Children's Panel Study (1998 and 2000), a longitudinal sample of 1704 pupils was examined: 948 in the intervention group and 756 in the control group. In order to evaluate the effects of the intervention, we compared the smoking behavior in the intervention and the control group at two points in time, shortly before, and 18 months after the intervention, on an individual case basis.
   Results. (1) Stabilization of never-smoking rates: the proportion of pupils remaining a never-smoker at the follow-up is 62.1% in the intervention group and 61.5% in the control group (OR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.83-1.24); (2) Lowering of relapse rates among ex-smokers: the proportion of former smokers who had not started smoking again in the follow-tip is 45.1% in the intervention group and 41.4% in the control group (OR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.77-1.49).
   Conclusion. The "Smoke-Free Class Competition" did not prevent smoking among adolescents and does not appear to bean effective substitute to the complete ban of tobacco advertising, the abolition of vending machines and the creation of smoke-free environments in German schools.

AB Development of modern democracy and civic consciousness in the society of spectacle and mass manipulation are the main object of the article. Democratic self government depends both on individual, responsible solutions of citizens and on social, cultural or political propaganda. Propaganda is interpreted as a special, focused persuasion for motivation, consolidation, education purposes. Differences and similarities between social engineering, social propaganda, social marketing and social advertisement are discussed in the paper. Social marketing is interpreted as the response to social needs and the main demands of local people. On the contrary, social propaganda is more didactic, perspective and tries to motivate people for productive activities. Social marketing is more effective in a short period and social propaganda is more useful in a long perspective. Differences between reportage, daily media and propaganda are discussed in the article. Social propaganda needs participatory media. Various forms of participatory media (embedded, engaged and embodied) are analyzed. The topic of social engineering is analyzed on the basis of K Popper's considerations. Popper differentiates between utopian or totalitarian engineering and "piecemeal social engineering". Popper's conception of utopian engineering is partly criticized. Every big social project is not only a form of elimination of mistakes; it also has utopian features and dream perspectives. The truth of democratic development couldn't be evaluated only by Popper's principle of fallibilism. More important are the alternative, competitive forms of social propaganda and open public discussions. The phenomenon and examples of social advertisement are interpreted in the paper. Social advertisement is a necessary part of social propaganda and supports sustainable development and self-government of society. The importance of social advertisement could be compared with other genres of propaganda, such as banners, posters, movies, slogans, etc.
   Development of modern democracy needs alternative and competitive forms of social propaganda. Propaganda without alternatives is one dimensional persuasion and constructs a subject of manipulation or a subject of propaganda. However, the origin of competitive alternatives needs free public domains, a culture of dialogue, open criticism and experience in protest. Young eastern democracies like in Lithuania tend to destroy public spaces, especially cultural public domains. Different cases and practices of destroying the public spaces are analyzed as the erosion of democracy. On the contrary, public interest and civic consciousness need to defend publicity and to develop critical and dialogue issues of civic society. For these purposes, modem democracy needs to develop alternative civic education. Alternative civic education presupposes education of protest culture, analysis of international and local civic conflicts and protest actions, preparing its manifestations and artificial representations, special projects and civic competitions. Examples of alternative protest laboratories, actions, petitions, manifestations, banners, performances, movies are interpreted in the article.

AB Purpose - To explore the effectiveness of large-scale consortia for disseminating local heritage via the web. To describe the creation of a large geographically based cultural heritage consortium in the South East of England and management lessons resulting from a major web site digitisation project. To encourage the improved sharing of experience amongst similar projects in the future.
   Design/methodology/approach - A selective literature review seeking lessons on sustainable cultural heritage collaboration is presented. The composition of a consortium set-up with public lottery funding to build a cross-domain collaborative public web site containing cultural heritage materials from many local authorities and local partners is described. Practical experiences from the first three years of collaboration are presented in a manner loosely based on the European Union Digitisation Policies Benchmarking Model.
   Findings - Staff in local government libraries, archives and museums have, until recently, lacked experience in major web site publishing and even in the basic digitisation of locally held heritage materials. Local governments in England have traditionally co-operated within the library or museum sectors, but not across the whole domain. New communication methods and a formally structured consortium have so far enabled the collaborative publication of a major web site allowing cross-searching of partner materials as well as access to individual sites. More importantly, staff have begun to understand how to proceed in a sustainable way to support the future development of more sophisticated digital primary and learning resources that are preserved for the future and yet accessible to many more people.
   Practical implications - The paper notes the importance of shared values, common objectives and a practical approach to collaborative service delivery. It also highlights the challenges in situations where operational staff have multiple responsibilities and project staff may be available only while external short-term funding lasts. It is suggested that encouraging the documentation of operational experiences and sharing skills through a large-scale formal consortium can support sustainable development.
   Originality/value - The consortium described hopes to form a major part of the future framework for digital cultural heritage services in the South East of England. This paper offers a rare, reflective contribution from experienced, operational service practitioners who have completed a three-five year digitisation programme offering free public access to materials that serve to support and disseminate local and regional identity.

AB Purpose - To provide an overview of how open access (OA) repositories have grown to take a premier place in the e-research knowledge cycle and offer Southampton's route from project to sustainable institutional repository.
   Design/methodology/approach - The evolution of institutional repositories and OA is outlined raising questions of multiplicity of repository choice for the researcher. A case study of the University of Southampton research repository (e-Prints Soton) route to sustainability is explored with a description of a new project that will contribute to e-research by linking text and data.
   Findings - A model for IR sustainability.
   Originality/value - The TARDis project was one of the first IRs to achieve central university funding in the UK. Combined with increased visibility and citation, the research assessment exercise route has become the "hook" on which a number of IRs are basing their business models.

AB This article investigates the connection between the apparently uncorrelated issues of tax evasion and privatisation in a political economy framework. We first consider how the political process - given a country's level of development and income distribution - will affect the efficiency of the tax system. We then discuss the impact of the efficiency of the taxation system on the outcomes of privatisation. We consider under which condition privatisation will proceed, and who will be the political supporters as well as the main winners of the privatisation process. Moreover, we investigate the impact of different forms of corruption both on the initial public support for privatisation, as well as on its long term political sustainability.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the emergency medical services (EMS) based in Islamabad, Pakistan. Rescue-15 is an innovative EMS collaboration project between the police, the private sector and the community.
   Methods: Data from Rescue-15 were used for systems analysis. The institutional setup, private-public partnership, client satisfaction and sustainability issues were examined. The access and efficiency of EMS were assessed in terms of ambulance response time.
   Results: Primarily, systems analysis showed community participation to explain the project's strength. Since its establishment, the project has been meeting its own recurrent expenditures without levying an extra burden on the Government. Sustainability issues such as amendments to legislation have been addressed at departmental and governmental levels. Data analysis showed that rescue time is, on average, 10.4 min (SD=2.6 min). A client survey also demonstrated user satisfaction and increased confidence in the service.
   Conclusions: This EMS programme exemplifies the potential of public-private partnership involving the police and the private sector in project implementation and management in a developing country with scarce resources. This initiative to involve the public and the private sector may provide a model for implementation of such services in other resource-poor developing countries, which may in turn facilitate realistic solutions for better prehospital care in developing countries.

AB Funding agencies are increasingly focused on community coalitions as effective entities for promoting public health programs. Yet, there has been no conceptual model for understanding how effective coalition infrastructure works to facilitate a learning environment, wherein coalition members and leaders receive ongoing training and technical assistance needed to accomplish their external programing goals. This article presents a conceptual model for measuring the internal effectiveness of coalitions [Internal Coalition Outcome Hierarchy (ICOH)]. The ICOH model served as the basis for development of the evaluation instrument, Internal Coalition Effectiveness, which measures internal coalition effectiveness based on achievement of organizational outcomes at each of the model's seven hierarchical levels. The ICOH conceptual model has broad application for public health nurses who are frequently called on to serve as evaluators for community coalitions engaged in health programing. The model has implications for evaluators to use in teaching coalition members and leaders about their internal strengths and areas for improvement, so that coalitions can develop more effective internal structures and thereby promote long-term sustainability.

ID VALIDITY
AB This article presents the development and psychometric testing of the Internal Coalition Effectiveness (ICE) instrument, which was based on the conceptual model Internal Coalition Outcome Hierarchy. Sixty-one items were derived from literature about successful coalitions, and the ICE instrument was tested for reliability and validity. A national panel of eight experts conducted content validity. Remaining tests involved a sample of 61 members and leaders of a large midwestern coalition (77% response rate, n = 47). Content validity involved a two-stage process for rigorous item development and quantification (0.88, p < 0.05). Internal consistency was based on bivariate Pearson's correlation of 0.30-0.70 for two-item scales and Cronbach's alpha(alpha = 0.70). Construct validity was assessed by correlation analysis, independent Student's t tests, and informal coalition feedback. The final 30-item version of ICE is psychometrically sound. Findings were shared with the local coalition, and, in support of the instrument's validity, members and leaders found this information useful for promoting coalition sustainability by identifying internal strengths and areas for improvement. The ICE instrument adds to the body of literature by measuring critical constructs of coalition effectiveness and has significant application for public health nurses working as evaluators for coalitions engaged in community health programing.

AB The subsoil of the Vale do Ribeira was the focus of mining industries for the exploration of lead, mainly inside the park-PETAR. Despite the fact that the exploration has ended, the environmental effects of those activities are still present, due to great amounts of heavy metals that are leached. Concentrations of pseudo-total and bioavailable metals were deter-mined in sediment samples of the Betari River, using atomic absorption spectrometry. The results demonstrated that the sediments are contaminated by Pb, Zn and Cu. The findings can contribute to an efficient and environmentally and economically adequate management of the park, for the conservation and the protection of the area.

AB The unified economic structure of the European market requires a unified transport infrastructure to ensure seamless and barrier-free transportation of passengers and goods. The European Commission has been funding the European Integrated Project, Sustainable Bridges, to comply with future traffic demands. The main objective of the project is to assess reliably and upgrade the bridge infrastructure for the required increase of axle loads and transport volume. Thirty-two institutes from 12 countries have developed unified procedures for the assessment and improvement of the existing railway bridge stock under the guidance and review of six major European railway companies. Nondestructive testing (NDT) has been given a high priority. One of the work packages concentrates on the potential of advanced NDT methods and creates a toolbox with advisable methods for,the condition assessment of all types of railway bridges. Although NDT methods are implemented in the quality assurance process in many industries, their application in the railway infrastructure is not common. Only a few countries have included selected NDT methods in their advanced condition assessment procedures for the management of their bridge stock. This paper describes current activities to enhance pulse-phase thermography, impulse radar, and acoustic methods. The advanced methods enable infrastructure owners to verify construction plans; assess structures, repair, and strengthening quality; or identify in-service damages. An automated scanning system for combined acoustic and electromagnetic measurements has been developed recently. The results can be combined through data fusion techniques to increase their value for the bridge owners.

ID RANGELAND MANAGEMENT
AB Land degradation in the arid Aletai Region in northern China is not only detrimental to animal production, but also reduces the ability to conserve water resources by destabilising the catchments of rivers which affects runoff, thus, threatening the sustainable use of these grasslands. A new approach to grassland management based on carrying capacity and ecological services value of grassland types, using an index of classification management (ICG), was designed to ensure the sustainability of grassland ecosystems. In this approach, grassland is classified into 3 management sectors. The first is conservation grassland, which is mainly devoted to ecological and social values; the second is the moderately productive grassland, dedicated to multiple benefits by rational use; and the third is intensively productive grassland, focusing on maximum economic effect. For the arid Aletai region, no intensively productive grassland was available. Conservation grassland occupied 2.5 million ha, accounted for 25.4% of grassland area, and included alpine meadow, mountain meadow, mountain meadow steppe, mountain steppe and. at meadow. In these grasslands, grazing should be eliminated to allow restoration of degenerated areas, protect grasslands with important ecological values from destruction, and to further improve the environment. Moderately productive grassland covered 7.3 million ha, and the grassland types were alpine steppe, mountain desert steppe, plain desert steppe, steppe desert, and plain desert. Agricultural measures, such as fertiliser and irrigation application, should be used to enhance the productivity of these grasslands.

AB Purpose. To verify the actions and degree of progress achieved in countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in the implementation of the Sustainable and Tenable Renal Health Model promoted by the Latin American Society of Nephrology and Hypertension (SLANH), together with local societies and the participation of the Pan-American Health Organization. (PAHO/ WHO). Method The implementation of workshops (e.g., "Toward a Sustainable and Tenable Renal Health Model") in each country involving health ministries, social security agencies, PAH, scientific societies, medical organizations, and NGOs, among others, as well as start-up conferences with a special emphasis on local problems. Working teams will state the bases for planning, programming and evaluation in the Logical Framework Matrix and Matrix of Activities and Resources in the First Level of Care. The signature of the document "Declaration" with commitments undertaken by both public and private parties and a work schedule are required. Results. So far, eleven countries in the region have conducted workshops and started activity in the frame of the Model/Program of Renal Health, which articulates the traditional vertical programs and generates a cross-program in the First Level of Care. Its components and strategies make up a cost-efficient control of cardiovascular, renal and endocrine-metabolic health. Conclusion. The Renal Health Model and its program is being built into public health care policies of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and adapted to the needs of each country with an increasing acceptance on the part of health care professionals. It should not be implemented in isolation but within the framework of non transmissible diseases.

AB This paper examines the 1-year anthropogenic stocks and flows of silver as it progresses from extraction to final disposal on the European continent. The primary flows of silver include production, fabrication and manufacturing, use, and waste management. A substance flow analysis (SFA) was used to trace the flows and inventory data, and mass balance equations were used to determine the quantity of flows. The results reveal that Europe has a low level of silver mine production (1580 Mg Ag/year) and instead relies on silver imports and the recycling of scrap in production and fabrication. In the year 1997, Europe imported 1160 Mg Ag of ore concentrate and 2010 Mg Ag of refined silver, and recycled 2750 Mg Ag of new and old scrap. There is a net addition of 3320 Mg Ag/year into silver reservoirs at the use stage. This is the result of a greater amount of silver entering the system from manufacturing than is leaving the system into waste management. The waste flow with the highest content of silver is municipal solid waste, which contains 1180 Mg Ag/year. In total, 62% of all discarded silver is recycled and 38% is sent to landfills. The results of this study and other element and material flow analyses can help guide resource managers, environmental policy makers, and environmental scientists in their efforts to increase material recovery and recycling, address resource sustainability, and ameliorate environmental problems.

ID NATIONAL PRODUCT; SUSTAINABILITY; DETERMINACY; RESOURCES; NNP
AB This paper derives a concept of aggregate real income for a competitive economy in general equilibrium consisting of heterogeneous infinitely lived people and relates it to current and future consumption possibilities. An important characteristic of our measure of income, which we call Real Income. is that deflation is carried out using a consumption deflator rather than any price index of output. We suggest that it may be inappropriate to regard capital gains as income. We also present a coherent treatment of the effects of changes to the terms of trade on Real Income and explain the implications of this for resource-exporting economies.

AB Native southwestern fishes have declined markedly in range and numbers. The factors responsible for their decline are many and varied. However the primary stressors to native fish assemblages in southwestern rivers and streams are habitat alteration and introduction of non-native species. We present data that compare the fish assemblages in two desert rivers-the Gila and Verde (Arizona-New Mexico)-over a period of 7-12 years, respectively. We also present data on hydrographs, broadscale and local geomorphology, and past fisheries, water and land management activities. Peak flow mean volume of flow, variability of flow, canyon-bound and broad alluvial reaches, dams, and introduced fishes are all either directly or indirectly related to fish assemblages in southwestern rivers and streams. We suggest that three primary influencing factors-two natural and one human induced (hydrograph, geomorphology, management)-are critical features in delimiting native fish assemblages. Conserving and sustaining native fish assemblages in these and other southwestern rivers and streams will require land managers to address all aspects of these three major influencing factors with administrative and legal mandates.

AB Issues relevant to management of and land aquatic ecosystems include: (1) a poor understanding of the extent and linkages of an aquatic ecosystem, (2) human population growth coupled with a highly variable water supply, (3) hydrologic modifications of rivers associated with dams, levees, canalizations, and diversions, (4) impairment of water quality, (5) alteration of vegetative communities of catchments and riparian zones, (6) introduction of invasive non-native species, and (7) imperiled native species. All of these issues occur in the Middle Rio Grande of New Mexico and the first six in combination have been responsible for the imperilment of its native aquatic biota. Pie extinction of two fish species, extirpation of 13 others, and endangerment of the Rio Grande silvery minnow, a pelagic-spawning species with an enormous potential for recolonization of habitats, has been caused by a century of river and landscape modifications. Erosion from heavily grazed grasslands coupled with appropriation of surface flows for irrigation, both associated with human population expansion in New Mexico, led to increased sediment deposition in the Middle Rio Grande. Sediment deposition exacerbated problems due to flooding and droughts, which led to a series of political and technological actions that progressively extirpated most of the large-bodied native fishes and all but one of the pelagic-spawning minnows. Restoration of the Middle Rio Grande and recovery of the endangered silvery minnow will require many changes in the way humans use the river and its floodplain. If those changes occur they should consider the Rio Grande within a Landscape context that includes strategies for humans to live in and regions without damaging fragile and lands and their aquatic ecosystems.

AB The European Commission report that was outlined by President Jose Barroso at the 2005. Spring European Council, addresses European economic and social issues in the context of the expiration of the first half of the ambitious Lisbon strategy. With that strategy, the heads of states and governments stated their commitment to make the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, capable of achieving sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs, stronger social cohesion, and respect for environment. However, the results to date have not matched the aspirations of growth and high employment, so the process has frequently stalled, and was dispersed in the sphere of implementation and legislation. Therefore this report was intended as a new start for the Lisbon strategy that would provide a sharper focus and more transparent mechanisms in achieving the common goal. The main guidelines are: to make Europe a more attractive place to invest and work, to encourage knowledge and innovation for growth, and to create more and better jobs.
   The emphasis lies primarily oil giving a boost to technological development, infrastructure, services, enterprise and competitiveness-as a path that would lead to more and better jobs. In terms of social policy measures, the document stresses the necessity of development and accessibility of higher education and lifelong learning, as well as the adjustment of work and family obligations in the context of new demographic patterns in Europe. In achieving these targets, the Commission is counting on the partnership of all participants, from the regional and national governments, through the business sector to civil society. During 2005. these guidelines have been embodied in a number of European documents.

AB Soil tillage systems and the crop residue management are essential for the sustainability of cassava production in sandy and sandy loam soils of Northwestern Parana State, Southern Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different tillage systems used for planting cassava: no-tillage (NT), minimum tillage using chiseling (MT) and conventional tillage with moldboard plow and disking (CT) on some physical properties of a dystrophic Red Latosol. The following soil physical properties were evaluated in the 0-0.15 m and 0.15-0.30 m soil layers: soil bulk density (BD), soil water retention curve, soil resistance to penetration curve and least limiting water range (LLWR). Higher values of BD and soil resistance to penetration were verified in the NT and MT treatments. The soil water retention curve was only influenced by BD, which incorporated the effects of the soil tillage systems independent of sampled layers. The soil resistance curve to penetration was influenced by tillage systems and layers, indicating that the soil resistance to root penetration was higher in NT > MT > CT, and was accentuated at the 0.15-0.30 m depth. The increase in the BD led to a reduction in the LLWR due to the effects of soil resistance to penetration and air-filled porosity, which in turn determined the range of soil available water. Results indicated that LLWR value followed the sequence: PC = PM > PSR in the 0-0.15 m soil layer, and was not influenced by tillage systems in the 0.15-0.30 soil layer The critical bulk density value (BDc), the BD value at which LLWR = 0, was lower in NT and MT tillage systems compared with CT, therefore resulting in a smaller frequency of higher BD values than BDc in the soil under CT.

SO SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES

DT Article
ID DEMOCRACY; POWER
AB This article explores the ongoing debate on whether popular government is a continually improving or a continually deteriorating constitutional principle in Scandinavian politics. In particular, three recent articles that address this question are reviewed. One puts an almost entirely positive light on developments in Denmark. By contrast, the authors of the articles on Sweden and Norway are less inclined to see any parallel between economic growth, a sustainable welfare state and good public finances, on the one hand, and improved popular government, on the other. The aim here is to bring some clarity into this paradoxical picture by distinguishing between popular government as such and the prerequisites for popular government's long-term legitimacy. What makes popular government self-reinforcing, this article concludes, is the underlying, more fruitful question to pose. This query should be brought into the open and answered.

AB The premise of this special series is that evidence-based interventions and systems change are key foci for building capacity to serve children. In this article, we preface the series by introducing issues relevant to understanding the interplay of these foci and by describing the articles and their contributions. Common elements across these articles include the following: (a) consideration of the importance of evidence-based interventions; (b) data-guided, systematic, formative evaluation within a problem-solving model for localized service delivery and continuous quality improvement; (c) research, policy, and practice alignment; (d) comprehensive, multilayered service delivery informed by public health prevention perspectives; and (e) attention to systems factors related to adoption, adaptation, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions in school contexts.

AB This paper describes a 4-year project that partnered psychologists based in universities and those in educational service districts to support development and implementation of school-wide academic and behavioral support systems in four elementary schools across four districts, representing different communities with varying demographic characteristics within one state in the north central region of the United States. We describe the methods for capacity building and sustainability embedded within the project, its course, and preliminary evaluation data, with discussion of successes, indicators of increased capacity and sustainability, lessons learned, and future directions for practice and research. Implications for the potential role for school- and university-based child-serving professionals in facilitating organizational change efforts, and subsequent implications for training and professional development of these professionals, are considered.

ID FORMATIVE EVALUATION; INTERVENTIONS; REFORM
AB Heartland Area Education Agency in Iowa illustrates how it has sustained a problem-solving service delivery system for 15 years and adapted to changing state and federal requirements while remaining consistent with its guiding principles that emphasize direct assessment, intervention, progress monitoring, and the evaluation of student results. The infrastructure supporting organizational transformation to a problem-solving system occurred on two levels, global and local. The reform effort is described in four phases. The system is evolving from individual problem solving in all cases to a more efficient system that integrates both group-level and individual interventions. Once the reform process is established, scaling up is refocused on the depth, or integrity, of implementation.

   SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY; EVOLUTION
AB Educators and psychologists are concerned about problem behavior. Fortunately, effective interventions and practices have been documented for addressing this problem behavior. However, sustained and expanded uses of these interventions and practices have not been consistent or widespread. One promising approach to the systemic and sustained implementation of these practices is school-wide positive behavior support (SWPBS). The SWPBS effort emphasizes an integration of measurable outcomes, data-based decision making, evidence-based practices, and overt support systems for implementers. This behaviorally based, comprehensive systems approach is suggested as a means of achieving durable implementation of effective school-based interventions. Although the SWPBS approach is conceptually sound and comprised of supportable behavioral practices, further systems-level demonstrations and validations of efficacy, effectiveness, and expansion are recommended.

AB Agricultural engineers' jobs are especially related to sustainability and earth life issues. They usually work with plants or animals, and the aim of their work is often linked to producing food to allow people to improve their quality of life. Taking into account this dual function, the moral requirements of their day-to-day professional practice are arguably greater than those of other professions.
   Agricultural engineers can develop their ability to live up to this professional responsibility by receiving ethical training during their university studies, not only by taking courses specifically devoted to ethics, but also by having to deal with moral questions that are integrated into their technical courses through a program of Ethics Across the Curriculum (EAC).
   The authors feel that a suitable pedagogical technique for achieving this goal is the use of moral dilemmas, following Kohlberg's theory of levels of morality (1981), with the final objective of attaining a post-conventional level. This paper examines the possibilities and limitations of using moral dilemmas as a pedagogical technique for training agricultural engineers. The cases, discussions, and evaluation used in the Agricultural Engineering Department of the Technical University of Valencia (Spain) are also presented.

AB There are over 800 seventh to tenth grade students at the College d'Enseignment Generale (CEG) School in Azove, Benin. Like most children in the developing world, these students lack access to clean water and basic sanitation facilities. These students suffer from parasitic infection and health ailments which could be directly offset with short term aid to supply water and medical aid.
   Promoting proper sanitation and providing the technology to implement water and wastewater treatment in the community will decrease childhood and maternal disease and mortality rates in Azove. However, these measures may take several years to implement and will require a significant investment in the infrastructure of the school. Is it ethical to spend $10,000 towards the long-term goals of providing water and sanitation to the students of CEG Azove, compared to spending the same amount on short-term relief efforts?
   This paper addresses the ethical dilemma of dealing with immediate medical needs in developing countries while trying to implement sustainable technologies. The views and frustration of students working on the project are discussed, as they realize the monetary and short-term impacts on human health when implementing sustainable technologies. The opportunity costs associated with the education principles of sustainable development were also considered The anticipated costs and health impacts in the short-term and long-term will be evaluated for a period of 1, 2, 5 and 10 years.

AB Modifications to the ABET Criterion 3 are suggested in support of the effort to promote the pursuit of peace in engineering education. The proposed modifications are the result of integrating the United Nations' sponsored "Integral Model of Education for Peace, Democracy and Sustainable Development" into the modern engineering curriculum. The key elements of the model are being at peace with oneself, being at peace with others, and being at peace with the planet. In addition to proposing modifications, specific classroom activities are described and implemented and students' reactions and the effectiveness of the various exercises are discussed.

ID ACTIVATED-SLUDGE; FILTRATION; SYSTEM
AB The long term sustainable flux behavior of a submerged membrane bioreactor operated under a steady state conditions at a range of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations has been examined. Comparison of fouling rates at a number of imposed fluxes has been made between long term filtration trials and short term tests using the flux step method. Results indicate an exponential relationship between fouling rate and flux for both long and short term trials, although the value was an order of magnitude lower during long term tests. Moreover, operation during long term trials is characterised by a period of pseudo stable operation followed by a catastrophic rise in TMP at a given critical filtration time (t(filt)) during trials at 6 g (.) L-1 . This time of stable operation, t(filt), is characterised by a linear relationship between fouling rate and flux. Results have been compared with the literature. Data for membrane fouling prior to the end of t(filt) yielded a poor fit with a recently proposed model. Trends recorded at t > t(filt) revealed the fouling rate to follow no definable trend with flux, contrary to the notion that fouling beyond the critical filtration time relates to solids deposition.

AB The effect of powdered activated carbon (PAC) addition to the activated sludge (AS) in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) has been investigated. The long term nature of the tests allowed the PAC to gradually incorporate into the biofloc forming biologically activated carbon (BAC). One series of tests involved 4 bench scale (2 L) MBRs operated at sludge retention times (SRTs) of 30 days with PAC inventories of 0, 1, 3 and 5 g/L and steady state biomass concentrations of 12.0 +/- 1.0 g/L. The characteristics of the mixed liquors (MLSS) from the 4 reactors were compared. Short term filtration tests, including measurement of specific cake resistance (SCR), flux decline profile, and irreversible fouling resistance in an unstirred cell and "sustainable flux (by monitoring transmembrane pressure (TMP) rise) in a crossflow cell all showed better filtration performance for the MLSS with BAC compared with the AS alone. In terms of SCR and flux decline profile the 1 g/L PAC addition performed best, but in terms of minimizing irreversible membrane fouling and maximizing "sustainable flux the 5 g/L PAC was best. All 4 systems showed lower total organic carbon (TOC) in the permeate compared to the bioreactors, but the lowest permeate TOC (and the best removal) was for the highest PAC loading.
   The benefit of PAC addition was confirmed in a second series of tests with two 20 L MBRs with submerged hollow fibers, one operated without PAC, the MBR(AS), and the other with 5 g/L PAC, the MBR(BAC). For an SRT of 30 days (which involved 3.3% sludge wastage per day and 3.3% new PAC addition per day) and a fixed flux of 21 L/m(2) hr the MBR(AS) showed a TMP rise of about 2.4 kPa/day whereas the MBR(BAC) showed a rise of only 0.8 kPa/day. However when the MBRs were operated without wastage the performance of the MBR(BAC) was worse than the MBR(AS). Thus the improved performance of the MBR(BAC) requires regular replenishment of aged BAC with fresh PAC.

AB Concerns about decline in soil fertility and long-term productivity of fast-growing plantations have promoted interest in using nitrogen-fixing trees in mixed species plantations. Populus deltoides and Alnus subcordata were planted in five proportions (100P, 67P:33A, 50P:50A, 33P:67A, 100A) in Noor, Iran. After 7 years, the effects of species interactions on tree growth and nutrient concentration in live and senescent leaves and soil properties were assessed. Diameter at breast height and total height of individual Populus trees were positively affected by the presence of Alnus. Nitrogen concentrations in fully expanded and senescent leaves of Populus were higher in mixed plantations than monoculture plantations. The results of nutrition and nutrient return and growth indicated that mixed plantations of these two species were more productive and sustainable than their monoculture plantations. Within the framework of this experiment, it appeared that production was maximized when these two species were grown together in the relative proportions of 50% Populus and 50% Alnus.

   provenance regions in southern Germany by using nuclear and chloroplast
   microsatellites
SO SILVAE GENETICA

DT Article
DE common ash; Fraxinus excelsior; genetic variation; microsatellites;
   genetic structure; differentiation of populations
AB The genetic structure of 14 populations from three ash provenance regions (Fraxinus excelsior L.) in southern Germany (Aid Infodienst, 2003) is described by analysing the variation of four nuclear and five cpDNA microsatellites. The study of the nuclear microsatellites revealed high levels of genetic diversity but low levels of genetic differentiation, suggesting a high degree of gene flow among regions and/or human interference by introducing plant material coming from different provenances. The distributions of the allele frequencies and the genetic structures at these four microsatellite loci did not allow the identification of distinct provenance regions, although "private alleles" were encountered with moderate to low frequencies (above 5 percent). Specifically, the Rhine valley populations (provenance region 81105) and these from the Swabian Jura and Black Forest (provenance region 81107) revealed private alleles at the two microsatellite loci Femsat14 and Femsat112. A more distinct differentiation between provenances was found based on the cpDNA markers. Evidence on genetic delineation and characterization of ash provenances is discussed. Based on these results, provenance regions can be genetically characterised but further analysis of ash populations and of reproductive material (seeds or seedlings) would be of great importance for provenance delineation, as well as gene conservation and sustainable management of ash populations.

DT Article
AB The central argument of this article is that regional economic integration must be complemented by the creation of regional frameworks for environmental management. Beyond working to expand market access, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Mechanism (APEC) countries must cooperate to create conditions which provide incentives for sustainable resource and ecosystem use. In this way, trade and environmental policies can mutually reinforce each other. In one way or another, it is likely that environmental issues will be on the agenda. The crucial issue is how deep and broad will be the integration of trade and environmental concerns innovative strategies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Antipoverty initiatives strive to improve distressed communities by producing outputs, such as housing, new businesses, and enhanced social services, and by building the capacity of communities to address their own problems. Although crucial for addressing the social and cultural factors contributing to community problems and for the sustainability of initiatives, capacity building is frequently set aside once implementation of initiatives begins. This article explores the funding realities, implementation demands, and power dynamics between stakeholders that result in output production being favored over capacity building. Examples from past and ongoing initiatives illustrate points and drive recommendations to help future initiatives maintain a balance between producing outputs and building capacity.

AB This paper is the third and final of a series that has previously presented the rationale (Rier and Indyk, this volume) and major program elements (Indyk and Rier, this volume) of an approach to link community and tertiary sociomedical providers, clients/patients, sites, and systems Into an integrated response to HIV/AIDS. The primary goal has been to improve socioMedical HIV/AIDS services for a hard-to-reach inner city population. The Current paper first summarizes the main advantages (e.g., greater efficiency; more realistic, effective programs with greater credibility among the community; stimulation of knowledge production and dissemination amongst players rarely formally engaged in Such activities; creation of a platform useful for other applications) of this work. It then examines some of the main organizational challenges in conducting the work (involving issues such as personnel, coordination, funding, turf conflicts, sustainability). From this discussion emerge organizational requisites to conducting this work (e.g., development of key boundary-spanning figures; attention to the specific interests of potential linkage partners; translation efforts to demonstrate the value of participation; a continuous quality improvement approach featuring wide distribution of feedback in User-friendly form; flexibility, tact and patience), so that others can adapt and apply the linkage approach to manage HIV/AIDS or other problems. Finally, we explain how theory and practice have driven one another in this work.

ID POLICY
AB Two spheres of social regulation are analysed in the study: the environment protection and agriculture. In the last decades, both of these areas have become frequently discussed topics in the media and in public debates. Representatives of environmental movements as well as scientists have played an important role in promoting an environmental agenda in the political arena. Environmental aspects of human activities have been incorporated into many legislative acts and regulations. The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has also been modified to fulfil environmental requirements. The new concept of multifunctional agriculture, introduced in the reformed CAP, aspires to reflect the principle of sustainable development that seeks to take economical, social, and environmental facets of agriculture equally into consideration. Focusing on the case of northern Slovakia, we analysed the context of launching the reformed CAP into agricultural practice using the example of the implementation of agro-environmental measures. Drawing on interviews with local farmers, we conclude that the main barrier to enlarging the participation in agro-environmental schemes is not due to the farmers' attitude to environmental or economic aspects, but to the social conditions of their agricultural enterprise.

DT Article
AB 21st century industrial activities are faced with the challenge of sustainable development. The current state of affairs of the chemical industry as seen in its historical context offers a perspective for the future. The chemical industry developed in the 19th century from efforts to replace naturally occurring materials e. g. rubber and ivory. Revisiting nature for inspiration with today's far more advanced chemistry knowledge offers an abundance of opportunities for fundamental research as well as applied technology development with commercial perspectives. Beyond the covalent bond as practiced by synthetic petrochemistry for making a wealth of small-, oligo-, and macro-molecules there exists a vast area, barely explored, of bio-materials with seemingly endless structure-forming capability and functionality. These non-covalent, intermolecular forces working at several length and time scales define functional materials that may offer opportunities to tackle the challenges of sustainability. Such bio- inspired materials coming from a combination of synthetic polymer chemistry and chemistry inspired by nature form a future path to innovation and sustainable growth. They bring a basis for materials differentiation and renewed competitiveness in the chemical industry.

AB The microcalorimetric technique was used to analyse the influence of successive reforestations with Eucalyptus globulus Labill, a fast growing species, on the microbial activity in soil. With this aim, samples of similar origin soils, humic-eutrophic Cambisol, were collected from two adjacent land plots. One of the plots, to be taken as the reference, was not subjected to man activities for the last 100 years. The other plot was subjected to two reforestations in the last 20 years. For collection of the two samples, 100 m 2 homogeneous and perfectly defined zones were chosen in each of the adjacent land plots to obtain final representative bulk samples of 400 g each.
   The study was carried out using the microbial population as a bioindicator of the productive potential in soil. The experiments were carried out using I g soil samples that were treated with 1.25 mg glucose and stored at 4 degrees C for 3 months. The analysis was complemented by the determination of physical, chemical, and biological properties and environmental parameters.
   The study was performed over I year and samples were seasonally collected (spring, summer, autumn and winter) in the same zone situated in Viveiro (Galicia, NW Spain) with the objective of checking the influence of environmental conditions on the microbial activity in the two soils studied.
   From the measured results, it can be observed that soils subjected to reforestations suffer not only important changes in physical structure, such as an increase in bulk density, from 600 to 660 kg m(-3), a reduction in hydraulic conductivity, from 8.85 x 10(-3) to 4.4 x 10(-3) m s(-1), or a decrease in the C-to-N ratio, from 13 to 8, but also they have lower microbial activity, for example 2.84 J g(-1) in the reforested soil versus 6.14 J g-1 in the reference soil, in spring, thus presenting a lower productive potential that suggests the use of both amendments and adequate management techniques to ensure a sustainable exploitation, thus avoiding future degradation of soil.

SO SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION

DT Article
DE health risk assessment; brownfields; redevelopment
AB Brownfield redevelopment is sustainable only when it is a transparent process protective of public health. The objective of the brownfield health risk screening matrix is to provide a scientifically based, transparent process to evaluate human health risks on proposed redevelopment sites as well as a framework that can be critically evaluated by both environmentalists and the community in general. Public discussion and understanding of current health risk assessment, as well as the risks specific to each brownfield redevelopment site, are essential for an effective brownfield redevelopment program.
   The Brownfields Redevelopment Program was started by the EPA in 1995 and seeks to use already contaminated sites rather than contaminate even more greenfields. Two of the biggest difficulties are making redevelopment profitable and protecting human health. Traditional human health risk assessment evaluates single chemical exposures and identifies the level below which no adverse effect will occur to the most sensitive subgroups of the population. For cancer-causing chemicals the risk must be lower than 1: 1, 000, 000. When brownfield redevelopment sites are associated with high cost, extensive time and unmanageable uncertainty, additional greenfield sites will become contaminated and the contamination on current brownfield sites will remain un-remediated.
   The citizens' advisory group addressing brownfields in a southern New York county has developed a risk matrix to evaluate the uncertainty of the available data, the toxicity of the known or suspected contaminants and the likely exposure routes for each brownfield site in the county. The matrix categorizes sites as high, medium or low risk according to exposure groups. The risk matrix complements the triad approach currently being developed by EPA to identify and manage project decision uncertainties, addresses uncertainty as well as toxicity and has the potential to reduce the cost Of traditional health risk assessment at brownfield redevelopment sites.

AB Although reduced tillage (RT) may preserve soil biota and improve the productivity and sustainability of arable lands in temperate regions, the extension of RT is limited by difficulties in controlling weeds. We studied the effect of RT without herbicide application on weed communities and soil biota in a 1-year 2-crop rotation system with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) on Andosols in Japan. RT of the surface 3 cm and conventional moldboard plowing (CT) were conducted before seeding twice per year. For the first 3 years, from autumn 1997 to spring 2000, one field was managed with RT and another with CT. For the second 3 years, from autumn 2000 to spring 2003, RT and CT were conducted in two replicated plots in each field. Weed communities and soil biota were studied in the last 2 years. Dominant weed species in winter wheat cropping were Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in 2002 and common vetch (Vicia angustifolia L.) in 2003, and their biomass was high where RT or CT was continuously conducted. Switching of tillage methods, from RT to CT or vice versa, reduced the biomass of winter weeds. In summer maize cropping, several annual and perennial weed species tended to increase under RT in the second 3 years. However, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), the most dominant weed in 2002 and 2003, responded to tillage inconsistently and its biomass was not always increased by RT. Species diversity of winter weeds was decreased by CT conducted in the first 3 years, and that of summer weeds was decreased by CT conducted in the second 3 years. The seedbank in the 0-10-cm soil layer under recent RT was large (7200-16 300 seeds m(-2)) compared with that under CT (2900-7300 seeds m(-2)). The microbial substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and the population densities of nematodes and mites were higher under RT in the second 3 years and were not affected by previous tillage practices. Both were highly correlated with soil total nitrogen. The positive effect of RT on these soil organisms was primarily attributable to the accumulation of organic matter in soil, but not to plant cover as a result of incomplete weed control by RT. Occasional adoption of RT in current CT systems may be effective at enriching soil organisms with little risk of weed infestation. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Some perceptions on typical weather year- from the observations of Hong

SO SOLAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
DE typical weather year; building simulation; climate change
AB Accurate prediction of building energy performance requires precise information of the local climate. Typical weather year files like test reference year (TRY) and typical meteorological year (TMY) are commonly used in building simulation. They are also essential for numerical analysis of the sustainable and renewable energy systems. The weather year file of one city is often employed by the nearby cities for such purposes. In this paper, the developments of customized weather year formulation are reviewed. The key issues are discussed making reference to two neighboring cities, Hong Kong and Macau, using their weather data records over a century, and the typical weather year files developed. The findings support the preference of TMY over TRY. It is also suggested that the TMY selection process should include the most recent meteorological observations, and should be periodically reviewed to well reflect the long-term climate change.

AB Feeding systems in which young ostriches feed on pasture but have access to concentrates provide better welfare than confined systems but are sustainable only if nutrition is carefully controlled. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of "excretal NIRS", a methodology that associates excretal spectral information in the near infrared (NIR) region with dietary attributes, in predicting dietary quality and nutrient intake in grazing ostrich chicks. Sixty sets of excretal and dietary information from chicks fed only concentrate or also grazing lucerne, barley, sulla or natural pastures, were used. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and the standard error of cross validation (SECV) served to evaluate calibration quality. The prediction of dietary concentrate content ranging 420 to 1000 g/kg of DMI, was highly linear (R-2 = 0.96), with SECV of 63 g/kg. Similar R-2 values were noted for the dietary contents of crude protein (CP), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and ash; that for the prediction of neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was lower (0.87). Ash, CP, NDF and ADF were predicted with SECV values of 14.8, 5.0, 8.9 and 10.7 g/kg DM diet, respectively. The calibration for apparent total organic matter digestibility was of poor quality. Good (R-2 = 0.95) and acceptable (R-2 = 0.86) calibrations were obtained for the daily intakes of pasture and concentrate, ;respectively, with SECVs of 75 and 131 g/d. Predictions of ash (R-2 = 0.85, SECV = 11 g/d) and ADF (R-2 = 0.80, SECV = 19 g/d) intakes had mediocre accuracy, and calibrations for CP and NDF intakes were even poorer. These results suggest that excretal NIRS may be useful to predict dietary intake and composition for grazing ostriches when applied to a known nutritional environment attended with calibration standards.

AB Adolescence, defined as the period between puberty and maturity, provides a 'window of opportunity' for positive skeletal adaptations to mechanical loading unlike any other period in life. Age-related bone loss highlights the importance of accumulating sufficient bone mass during formative years. Adolescents who regularly engage in weight-bearing mechanical loading appear advantaged in site-specific markers of bone mass. The positive influence of physical activity on bone mineral accrual during growth has been extensively studied; however, few studies have examined skeletal responses to mechanical loading during adolescence. Weight-bearing physical activity, particularly high-impact sports such as gymnastics, is recognised as being more osteogenic than weight-supported activities. Unilateral loading activities such as tennis or squash provide a direct comparison of skeletal response without sampling bias or genetic confounding. Intervention and longitudinal studies show evidence of positive skeletal adaptations; however, sustainability of skeletal advantages remains unclear. Limitations inherent with single-plane dual x-ray absorptiometry technology are well recognised. The integration of densitometric data with structural responses to mechanical loading using 3-dimensional imaging technologies such as peripheral quantitative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging appears vital to enhancing our understanding of adolescent musculoskeletal health.

TI Managing the distribution channel: the case of Scot Trout and Salmon
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE supply chain management; partnership; distribution channels and markets
ID SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - Small and medium-sized companies often struggle to achieve sustainable growth or access wider markets. This insight from industry aims to describe the case of Scot Trout and Salmon a company that acts as a distribution hub for a number of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) specialist fish producers in the west of Scotland.
   Design/methodology/approach - This article provides a qualitative case study method.
   Findings - A total of 90 per cent of Scottish companies are SMEs and with a fragile economy it is imperative that these SMEs can grow and flourish. The "loadshare distribution initiative" demonstrates one supply chain strategy by which this could be achieved.
   Research limitations/implications - Further research is required to extend understanding of the case through attention to the impact on the SME Organisation in the longer term.
   Practical implications - The distribution initiative enabled all members of the supply chain to achieve the goal of cost reduction by simply sharing transport.
   Originality/value - The case study illustrates a positive example of supply chain co-operation.

TI Effects of supply chain management practices, integration and
   competition capability on performance
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE supply chain management; competitive strategy; organizational
   performance
AB Purpose: The purpose of this research is to examine the causal linkages among supply chain management (SCM) practice, competition capability, the level of supply chain (SC) integration, and firm performance.
   Design/methodology/approach: This is helpful in developing a framework for linking a firm's SC integration strategy to its competitive strategy, and in identifying how such a linkage can be connected to the improvement of organizational performance. Such effort also should enable us to derive a set of recommended strategies of SCM practices for SC integration.
   Findings: From the results of LISREL analysis on small and large manufacturing firms, this paper finds that, in small firms, efficient SC integration may play a more critical role for sustainable performance improvement, while, in large firms, the close interrelationship between the level of SCM practices and competition capability may have more significant effect on performance improvement. It is concluded that, in early stage, the emphasis on systemic SC integration may be more crucial, Once SC integration has been implemented, it may be advisable to focus on SCM practice and competition capability.
   Orginality/value: Attempts to show how the potential benefits of integrating supply chain can no longer be ignored.

TI The sustainability of the supply chain for fresh potatoes in Britain
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE economic sustainability; social factors; United Kingdom
AB Purpose - In the context of increased interest in the sustainability of food supply chains, this paper aims to assess perceptions of the relative importance of economic, social and environmental factors as they influence decision making by growers, merchants and retailers, using fresh potatoes in Britain as a case study.
   Design/methodology/approach - Following exploratory interviews with key informants, a two-staged survey of 240 potato growers, 17 potato merchants, and four retailers was carried out to assess perceptions of sustainability. Data analysis used a range of non-parametric statistical methods.
   Findings - Economic and related market factors associated with staying in business and maintaining competitive advantage were the dominant concern for all supply chain participants. Greater importance, however, is now given to social and environmental factors both as influences on decision making and as indicators of business performance. The social capital of the supply chain, as it describes relationships amongst participants, is an important moderator of business uncertainty. Environmental performance, measured in terms of the use of natural resources and the risk of pollution, is driven by a mix of compliance requirements and perceived market drivers.
   Research limitations/implications - This research design was constrained by limited access to objective verifiable quantitative data, in part due to commercial confidentiality.
   Practical implications - This paper confirms the relevance of sustainability criteria to measure and report supply chain performance.
   Originality/value - This paper measures perceptions of sustainability as it affects business decisions in the supply chain. It confirms the need for a set of objectively verifiable indicators to guide and report supply chain performance.

TI Trust in institutions as a precondition for economic development? An
   analysis of selected south-east European countries
SO SWS-RUNDSCHAU
LA German
DT Article
AB As a point of departure for this article serves the observation that several European transformation countries still are confronted with serious problems, even though political and economic systems changes already were implemented. This leads to the question, why the beneficial effects of the market could not evolve in these countries so far. The authors' hypothesis claims that this, at least partially, can be ascribed to a lack of public trust in the existing institutions. Leveraging ideas and concepts of New Institutional Economics at the beginning of the article, and after defining the key terms, the relevant theoretical interrelations of the research question are explained in greater detail. The second part of the article applies an empirical check of these interrelations. The analysis shows that to a certain degree the interviewed experts as well as the results of the correlation analysis confirm the theoretically conceptualized interrelations. Therefore, one of the primary objectives for economic policy in transition countries should be a sustainable consolidation of public trust in institutions.

AB The greening of product innovation process has been under study by researchers, but mostly it is at an anecdotal level. Extant literature asks for empirical study to explore how to make greener products more successful at the market place. This paper reports on a survey of environmental new product development (ENPD) projects in North America wherein influences on the market performance are investigated. New activities such as design for environment/life cycle analysis and supplier involvement for environmental responsiveness are identified in the ENPD process. The paper uses hierarchical regression method to find relative and incremental impact of eco-innovation activities in ENPD projects on market performance. Factors that influence market performance of greener products are found to be cross-functional co-ordination between new product development professionals and environmental specialists, supplier involvement, market focus and life cycle analysis.

AB Stimulating new industries from emerging technologies is central to successful high-tech based economic growth, employment, competition and sustainability in modem market economies. The Taiwanese experiences in developing new technology-based industries (e.g. integrated circuits, personal computers, notebooks, scanners, and TFF LCDs) illustrate some of the ways policy makers can shape the development of emerging technologies into new industries. These ways of actions are manifold, but at least policy attentions to three key mechanisms are critical. These mechanisms encourage partnership in the commercialization process, foster entrepreneurship and venture initiatives in the innovation system, and sustain commercialization and the creation of new firms. The study of Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan on biochips and nanotechnology further shows how the policy makers can build a statutory body to effectively address the functions of three mechanisms as a whole.

AB In this paper, we propose a new model for development, one that transcends the North-South dichotomy and goes beyond a narrow conception of development as an economic process. This model requires a paradigm shift toward a new metaphor that develops sustainability, rather than sustains development. We conclude by defending a 'report card on development' as a means for evaluating how countries perform within this new paradigm.

AB The idea of a holistic approach towards public health planning presented itself through a food-related and trivial curiosity. It is, however, emphasized that food and nutrition are only one aspect of public health. The aim is to reintroduce a holistic approach to achieve sustainable public health with emphasis on the interpretation of the term "holistic". Holistic decision making is not a new phenomenon and has historical basis. In line with shifts in social norms, decision making has evolved. In particular, various complex models for public health have been proposed to respond to ever-increasing health issues. The advancement in mathematical sciences and technology has led to the quantification of health models. However, mathematical representations pose a major limitation on the holistic approach. Due to its evolutionary nature, human health is dynamically related to social, environmental, and other processes. With the current knowledge, it is difficult to quantify the evolution and feedback effects in holistic models. In this paper, the individual's and public's health is viewed as a dynamic process, but not independent of other dynamic processes (e.g., agriculture, economy, politics) that are all part of a much bigger process. Furthermore, it is argued that it is not merely sufficient to account for all known factors to be holistic. In this paper, the holistic conceptual model is illustrated, using public health as the central issue. The application of the conceptual model is also discussed using two practical examples.

TI Challenges to Peace: conflict resolution in the Great Lakes region of
   Africa
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Efforts to bring peace and reconstruction to the Central African region have been fashioned by contemporary conflict resolution models that have a standard formula of peace negotiations, with a trajectory of cease. re agreements, transitional governments, demilitarization, constitutional reform and ending with democratic elections. Local dynamics and the historical and multifaceted nature of the conflicts are rarely addressed. Furthermore, participants in the peace process are restricted to representatives of political parties, the state and rebel movements, to the exclusion of civil society. Using as examples the conflicts and peace processes in three Great Lakes countries Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo - the paper contends that contemporary global frameworks for peacemaking and peace building that rest on the acceptance of neoliberal political and economic models cannot lay the foundations for the conditions necessary for sustainable peace. This necessitates the utilisation of a more inclusive concept of peace, the starting point of which has to be the emancipation of African humanity.

TI Plastic yam and plastic yam sticks - Perspectives on indigenous
   technical knowledge among Jamaican farmers
SO TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE
LA English
DT Article
DE indigenous technical knowledge; Jamaica; participatory research; yam
   farming; resource sustainability
AB Yam farming in Jamaica has been one of the few success stories in agriculture since Independence in 1962. Production is entirely dominated by small farmers who have intensified production systems. Over the last decade yam farmers experienced a 'yam stick problem' due to the scarcity, poor quality and high prices of yam sticks. This paper focuses on the content and contextualisation of indigenous technical knowledge among yam farmers. The intrinsic dynamic nature of indigenous technical knowledge is revealed by showing how farmers have adapted their cultivation methods and have themselves innovated new ways of staking yams in efforts to solve the yam stick problem. In effect they have had to rely on their own indigenous knowledge base as a source of new ideas. We discuss a series of alternatives to traditional yam staking methods with a large sample of farmers, including both real and hypothetical examples of externally-induced innovations. Farmers' responses to these innovations are reported and analysed in the context of Briggs' recent review of indigenous knowledge and development issues. Our research suggests that farmer innovation is a normal consequence of coping with farming problems. Further, farmers are not intrinsically unresponsive to externally-induced innovations, which supports the view that 'Western science' and indigenous knowledge are not necessarily bipolar and mutually exclusive knowledge systems. We conclude that indigenous technical knowledge can provide a nexus for research in fostering partnerships with farmers, NGOs and planners in their search for sustainable solutions to the yam stick problem and broader aspects of rural development and resource management.

AB Using the carrying capacity value stretch (CCVS) model incorporated into nominal group technique (NGT) methodology, this paper investigated a rural community's determinants of socio-cultural carrying capacity perceptions in the wake of rural tourism development. The case of Kibbutz Yiron in Northern Israel was used to detect the tourism impacts, to evaluate to what extent rural tourism in this community is violating its limits for acceptable change and what necessary steps should be taken in order to mitigate existing, and to avoid future negative impacts? Results of this study support previous tourism impact studies. However, they are unique in their interpretation of carrying capacity measures in a qualitative and multidimensional manner. Based on the analysis of perceived intolerable, current and expected tourist impacts, these results can guide planning and policy oriented benchmarks for socio-culturally sustainable rural tourism.

AB Community-based therapeutic care (CTC) is a community-based model, for delivering care to malnourished people. CTC aims to treat the majority of severely malnourished people at home, rather than in therapeutic feeding centres. This paper describes the potential of the CTC approach to provide effective care and support for people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA). CTC includes many of the components of a home-based care model. for PLWHA. It provides outpatient treatment for common complications of HIV and AIDS, such as acute malnutrition and simple infections, and an energy-dense ready-to-use food that could be made with the appropriate balance of micronutrients for the HIV-infected patient. Through the decentralisation of outpatient treatment sites, CTC improves accessibility by moving treatment closer to people's homes and helps to promote the sustainability of care by building on the capacity of existing health infrastructure and staff. The CTC model contains many features that are appropriate for the care and support of HIV-affected people and, in its present form, can provide effective physical care for many HIV-affected individuals. We are currently working to adapt the CTC model to make it more suitable for the support of PLWHA in the longer term. (c) 2005 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB This paper analyses the actual and inherent national economy problems for any of the transition period countries, i.e. the impact of the socio-economic differentiation on social inequality and the potential for economic growth. The author evaluates the substantial political and economical changes of the turn of the 21(st) century that occurred both in Europe and Latvia by emphasizing the specific features of the situation of Latvia. These alterations have modified the frame of the society and economy in many countries. Special attention is paid to the characteristics of the transition period situation which established a new system of values thereby influencing both rural and urban evolution. An accent is pill oil the social stratification and the polarization processes which arose due to the economic restructurization. These changes have been causing overall development of social tension and increasing the social segmentation. Such marginalization processes enlarge both the possibility of social stagnation in the territorial aspect and pill greater demands for social policy. Changes in income distribution also encouraged changes in social order.

AB This paper presents a review of the research on the sustainability of transport systems carried out over the last 15 years for the European Union (EU), identifies some missing gaps and elaborates on the prospective future ideas. The general concept of sustainable development and definitions of sustainability of transport systems and their operationalization are discussed. These are followed by the general review of the research on the sustainable transport systems funded by the EU 4th, 5th and 6th Framework Programs. Consequently, refinement of existing and/or developing an innovative system for monitoring sustainability of transport systems in the EU based on the indicator system(s) of performances is suggested as a prospective research idea.

AB With the increasing trend of charging for externalities and the aim of encouraging the sustainable development of the air transport industry, there is a need to evaluate the social costs of these undesirable side effects, mainly aircraft noise and engine emissions, for different airports. The aircraft noise and engine emissions social costs are calculated in monetary terms for five different sized airports, ranging from hub airports to small regional airports. The number of residences within different levels of airport noise contours and the aircraft noise classifications are the main determinants for accessing aircraft noise social costs. The environmental impacts of aircraft engine emissions include both aircraft landing and take-off and 30-minute cruise. The social costs of aircraft emissions vary by engine type and aircraft category, depending on the damage caused by different engine pollutants on the human health, vegetation, materials, aquatic ecosystem and climate. The results indicate that the relationship appears to be curvilinear between environmental costs and the traffic volume of an airport. The results and methodology of environmental cost calculation could be applied to the proposed European wide harmonised noise charges as well as the social cost benefit analysis of airports.

DE yellow signal; countdown timing; driver behavior; signalized
   intersection; red-running; traffic safety
AB This paper reports a before-and-after study which evaluated the difference in driver response along an approach of a signalized intersection installed with a green signal countdown device (GSCD). The main purpose of a GSCD is to provide drivers with a countdown timing that would help them make informed stopping/crossing decisions during the critical phase-change period. Using a special-purpose data logger, four continuous days of before-and a series of four continuous days at various months' after-GSCD data were collected. The findings indicated that red-running violations were significantly reduced by about 65% at 1.5-month after-GSCD but its effectiveness tended to dissipate over time as the violation numbers had bounced back to almost the before-GSCD level. The dwindling effect of GSCD in curbing red-running violations in the longer term generally occurred under high traffic flows. On the other hand, the numbers of vehicles choosing to stop during the onset of amber had increased significantly by about 6.2 times at 1.5-month after-GSCD installation. The increase in red-stopping was however sustainable over the longer term, albeit a relatively small reduction was noted. The findings indicated that GSCD was practically effective in encouraging red-stopping actions under heavy traffic flows. In effect, one may conclude that the longer term performance of GSCD would only help to encourage stopping but not curbing red-violations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GEOLOGY
AB The careless or unprofessional handling of hazardous wastes in many places around the world led to severe damage of nature, concurrent with considerable long-term health risks to human beings. This motivated several countries to develop new secure and sustainable waste management strategies in order to enhance the future quality of nature and life. The process of world globalization and the coalescence of its markets increased the importance of formulation and implementation of accepted environmental standards. The rising environmental and ecological awareness in Israel puts the contemporary and common waste handling practices under close scrutiny. An intensive exchange of experiences with other countries is called for, so that the responsible authorities can formulate improved and sustainable waste management strategies, which are specifically tailored to the particular environmental, demographic, economic and political conditions of Israel.
   The German environmental protection and waste legislation demands an underground disposal of highly contaminated wastes, in order to guarantee that harmful substances are excluded durably from the biosphere. In view of its size and the political situation in Israel, this way of waste disposal seems to be an appropriate waste management strategy aimed at minimising the environmental risks, and the harmful effect of hostile actions against deposits of hazardous wastes. The German waste management policies and practices, which are based on many years of experience, are reviewed first as a guideline for safe long-term underground disposal of hazardous wastes in Israel. Using these guidelines, potentially suitable locations in Israel are selected with special reference to their geohydrological, geological and geomechanical conditions, and then they were evaluated using environmental criteria derived from German standards of waste disposal. The results of this preliminary environmental evaluation, and some relevant geomechanical designs, are presented and discussed. Finally, economic aspects, and further steps, which are needed to safeguard future implementation of the underground disposal system, are considered. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Using economic development programs as tools for urban revitalization: A
   comparison of empowerment zones and new markets tax credits
SO UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB This note examines the Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities (EZ/EC) and the New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC) and their reliance on tax incentives to revitalize economically distressed, low-income areas. After examining the history, purpose, program requirements, and projects resulting from the two market-based initiatives, the author concludes that the current tax incentives primarily benefit private interests. While the goal of both programs is to reduce poverty in low-income areas through economic growth, the programs are built on two distinct theoretical frameworks. The EZ/EC program is built on a "place-based people" policy that focuses on building the community as a method to help the local residents. The NMTC program, in contrast, adopts a "pure place strategy." This policy focuses on a specific geographical area rather than the economic needs of the area's residents. Ultimately, these programs fall short of economic revitalization goals because they do not effectively promote sustainable social change. Finally, the note proposes that the tax-incentive programs should shift their focus from place-based restrictions to the development of human capital within the inner-city residents. This direct investment of resources, which would include training programs, counseling services, and more direct residential involvement on project advisory boards, would ultimately create solid social structures within economically depressed areas and support the goal of the economic initiatives in present and future years.

AB A cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) nematodes and flukes (Fasciola and amphistomes) infection in communally grazed traditional cattle, zero-grazed small-scale dairy cattle and intensively grazed large-scale dairy cattle through examination of helminth eggs in faeces. Results indicated that the type of management, especially the grazing habit, has a significant influence on the prevalence and intensity of GI nematodes and flukes. The prevalence of GI nematodes in traditional, large-scale dairy and small-scale dairy cattle was 67%, 44.4% and 37%, respectively, with the highest faecal egg counts in calves. The overall prevalence of Fasciola gigantica in traditional, large-scale dairy and small-scale dairy cattle was 63.8%, 46.2% and 28.4%, respectively. The prevalence of amphistomes was 81.9%, 55.5% and 41.1% in traditional, large-scale dairy and small-scale dairy cattle, respectively. The high prevalence of flukes in the traditional system was attributed to communal grazing and watering management practices. Stomach flukes recovered in examined cattle at the abattoir were Calicophoron microbothrium and Cotylophoron jacksoni. About 42.1% of infected animals had both Fasciola and amphistomes. The prevalence of both GI nematodes and flukes varied greatly among villages and farms. The prevalence of both Fasciola and amphistomes was higher in adults (58.5%, 75.2%) than in yearlings (36.5%, 51.5%) or calves (24.9%, 47.2%). The variation in the prevalence of both GI nematodes and flukes among management and age groups within systems can be used as an entry point towards rational use of anthelmintics for each management system. More studies on seasonal transmission pattern of all these parasites are required in order to design rational, economic and locally sustainable parasite control programmes.

TI Municipal solid waste management challenges in developing countries -
   Kenyan case study
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper provides an overview of the state of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) by local authorities in Kenya as a case study of a low-income developing country. Approaches of possible solutions that can be undertaken to improve municipal solid waste (MSW) services are discussed. Poor economic growth (1.1% in 1993) has resulted in an increase in the poverty level which presently stands at 56%. Migration from the rural areas to the urban areas has resulted in unplanned settlements in suburban areas accommodating about 60% of the urban population on only 5% urban land area. Political interference also hampers smooth running of local authorities. Vulnerability of pollution of surface and groundwater is high because local authorities rarely considered environmental impact in siting MSW disposal sites. Illegal dumping of MSW on the river banks or on the roadside poses environmental and economic threats on nearby properties. Poor servicing of MSW collection vehicles, poor state of infrastructure and the lack of adequate funding militate against optimization of MSW disposal service. The rural economy needs to be improved if rural-urban migration is to be managed. Involvement of stakeholders is important to achieve any meaningful and sustainable MSWM. The role of the informal sector through community-based organizations (CBOs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and the private sector in offering solutions towards improvement of MSWM also is explored.

CY NOV 29-DEC 02, 2004

AB Results of investigations from many old landfills in Germany and Europe indicate that significant emissions occur under conventional landfill operating conditions (i.e., anaerobic conditions). Significant emissions via the gas phase are predicted to last at least three decades after landfill closure, while leachate emissions are predicted to continue for many decades, potentially even lasting for centuries [Heyer, K.-U., Stegmann, R., 1997. Langfristiges Gefahrdungspotenzial und Deponieverhalten von Ablagerungen; Bericht zum Teilvorhaben TV 4 im BMBF-Verbundvorhaben, "Deponiekorper"', Arbeitsbereich Abfallwirtschaft der TU Hamburg-Harburg, Projekttrager PTA-WAS (Umweltbundesamt Berlin); Krumpelbeck, I., 2000. Untersuchungen zum langfristigen Verhalten von Siedlungsabfall-deponien. Dissertation; Heft 3 der Veroffentlichungen der Bergischen Universitat - Gesamthochschule Wuppertal; Kjeldsen, P., Christophersen, M., 2001. Composition of leachate from old landfills in Denmark. Waste Management and Research, 200 1; 19(3):249-56]. When considering the specific type and quality, and quite often lack of, protection barriers associated with old landfills, these leachate and gas emissions may result in a significant negative impact on the environment. However, complete sealing of the landfill only temporarily reduces emissions because dry-conservation of the biodegradable waste fraction results, thus not allowing any severe reduction in the emission and hazardous potential of the landfill to occur. If noticeable damage of the surface capping system occurred in these landfills, infiltrating water would restart the interrupted emission formation.
   In contrast, aerobic in situ stabilization by means of low pressure aeration [AEROflott (R), Stegmann, R., Hupe, K., Heyer, K.-U., 2000. Verfahren zur abgestuften beschleunigten in situ-Stabilisierung von Deponien und Altablagerungen. Patent Nr. 10005243. Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt, Munchen] attempts to stabilize and modify the inventory of organic matter inside the landfill, acting to reduce the emission potential in a more sustainable manner. By enabling faster and more extensive aerobic degradation processes in the landfill (compared with anaerobic processes), the organics (e.g., hydrocarbons) are degraded significantly faster, resulting in an increased carbon discharge via the gas phase, as well as reduced leachate concentrations. Because carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main compound in the extracted off-gas (instead of methane (CH4), which dominated under anaerobic landfill conditions), the negative impact of diffuse LFG emissions towards an increased global warming effect may be significantly lowered. With respect to leachate quality, a reduction of organic compounds as well as ammonia-nitrogen can be expected. In addition to these positive ecological effects, aerobic in situ stabilization is associated with significant cost savings potential due to both quantitative and qualitative reductions in the aftercare period. This paper describes the fundamental processes and implications of in situ landfill aeration. Additionally, possible criteria for defining an endpoint of the active aeration process are presented and discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Leachate emissions from landfill sites are of concern. primarily due to their toxic impact when released unchecked into the environment, and the potential for landfill sites to generate leachate for many hundreds of years following closure. Consequently. economically and environmentally sustainable disposal options are a priority in waste management. One potential option is the use of soil-plant based remediation schemes. In many cases, using either trees (including short rotation coppice) or grassland. phytoremediation of leachate has been Successful. However, there are a significant number of examples where phytoremediation has failed. Typically, this failure can be ascribed to excessive leachate application and poor management due to a fundamental lack of understanding of the plant-soil system. On balance, with careful management. phytoremediation can be viewed as a sustainable. cost effective and environmentally sound option which is capable of treating 250 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1). However. these schemes have a requirement for large land areas and must be capable of responding to changes in leachate quality and quantity, problems of scheme establishment and maintenance. continual environmental monitoring and seasonal patterns of plant growth. Although the fundamental underpinning science is well understood, further work is required to create long-term predictive remediation models, full environmental impact assessments. a complete life-cycle analysis and economic analyses for a wide range of landfill scenarios.

TI Urban solid waste management in Chongqing: Challenges and opportunities
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The dual influences of the resource supply and protection in ecological environments will pose a significant challenge to China's sustainable development. Solid waste management offers opportunities to improve profits by conserving resources and improving environmental performance. This paper examines municipal solid waste (MSW) management in urban Chongqing, the nation's fourth largest municipality after Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. In this paper, we will provide information on the quantity and composition of MSW, as well as give an overview of different methods for collection, transport, treatment and disposal of MSW. At present the daily amount of MSW generated per person is about 1.08 kg; food waste accounts for about 59% of total MSW. MSW in Chongqing has a higher moisture content (64.1%) and a lower LHV (3728 kJ/kg) than other cities in Asia, which is an obstruction for incineration. Landfills are the main method of disposal in Chongqing, but pollution caused by simple landfills and lack of backup MSW disposal capacity are becoming major problems in the main districts of Chongqing. In this paper, the challenges being faced and opportunities to MSW in Chongqing are analyzed and some suggestions are given for improving the MSW system in the future. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Acute toxicity test of leachates from traditional and sustainable
   landfills using luminescent bacteria
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID AMMONIA
AB Landfilling is a fundamental step in any waste management strategy, but it can constitute a hazard for the environment for a long time. The need to protect the environment from potential landfill emissions makes risk assessment a decision tool of extreme necessity. The heterogeneity of wastes and the complexity of physical, chemical and biological processes that occur in the body of a landfill need specific procedures in order to evaluate the groundwater risk for the environment. Given the complexity of the composition of landfill leachates, the exact contribution of each potential toxic substance cannot be known precisely. Some reference contaminants that constitute the hazard (toxicity) of leachate have to be found to perform the risk assessment. A preliminary ecotoxicological investigation with luminescent bacteria has been carried out on different leachates from traditional and sustainable landfills in order to rank the chemicals that better characterize the leachate (heavy metals, ammonia and dissolved organic content). The attention has been focused on ammonia because it is present in high concentration and can last for centuries and can seriously contaminate the groundwater. The results showed that the toxicity of the leachate might reliably depend on the ammonia concentration and that the leachate toxicity is considerably lower in sustainable landfills where the ammonia had been degraded. This has an important consequence because if the containment system fails (as usually occur within 30-50 yr), the risk of groundwater contamination will be calculated easier only in terms of the probability that the ammonia concentration is higher than a reference concentration.

ID PRIVATE-SECTOR PARTICIPATION
AB Waste is an unavoidable by product of human activities. Economic development, urbanization and improving living standards in cities, have led to an increase in the quantity and complexity of generated waste. Rapid growth of population and industrialization degrades the urban environment and places serious stress on natural resources, which undermines equitable and sustainable development. Inefficient management and disposal of solid waste is an obvious cause of degradation of the environment in most cities of the developing world. Municipal corporations of the developing countries are not able to handle increasing quantities of waste, which results in uncollected waste on roads and in other public places. There is a need to work towards a sustainable waste management system, which requires environmental, institutional, financial, economic and social sustainability.
   This study explores alternative approaches to municipal solid waste (MSW) management and estimates the cost of waste management in Mumbai, India. Two alternatives considered in the paper are community participation and public private partnership in waste management. Data for the present study are from various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and from the private sector involved in waste management in Mumbai. Mathematical models are used to estimate the cost per ton of waste management for both of the alternatives, which are compared with the cost of waste management by Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). It is found that the cost per ton of waste management is Rs. 1518 (US$35) with community participation; Rs. 1797 (US$41) with public private partnership (PPP); and Rs. 1908 (US$44) when only MCGM handles the waste. Hence, community participation in waste management is the least cost option and there is a strong case for comprehensively involving community participation in waste management.

AB Formal waste management services are not accessible for the majority of primary healthcare clinics on the African continent, and affordable and practicable technology solutions are required in the developing country context. In response, a protocol was established for the first quantitative and qualitative evaluation of relatively low cost small-scale incinerators for use at rural primary healthcare clinics. The protocol comprised the first phase of four, which defined the comprehensive trials of three incineration units. The trials showed that all of the units could be used to render medical waste non-infectious, and to destroy syringes or render needles unsuitable for reuse. Emission loads from the incinerators are higher than large-scale commercial incinerators, but a panel of experts considered the incinerators to be more acceptable compared to the other waste treatment and disposal options available in under-serviced rural areas. However, the incinerators must be used within a safe waste management programme that provides the necessary resources in the form of collection containers, maintenance support, acceptable energy sources, and understandable operational instructions for the incinerators, whilst minimising the exposure risks to emissions through the correct placement of the units in relation to the clinic and the surrounding communities. On-going training and awareness building are essential in order to ensure that the incinerators are correctly used as a sustainable waste treatment option. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID NEW-YORK-CITY; PERSPECTIVES; POLICY; TOOLS
AB Waste as a management issue has been evident for over four millennia. Disposal of waste to the biosphere has given way to thinking about. and trying to implement, an integrated waste management approach. In 1996 the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) defined 'integrated waste management' as 'a framework of reference for designing and implementing new waste management systems and for analysing and optimising existing systems'. In this paper the concept of integrated waste management as defined by UNEP is considered, along with the parameters that constitute integrated waste management.
   The examples used are put into four categories: (1) integration within a single medium (solid, aqueous or atmospheric wastes) by considering alternative waste management options, (2) multi-media integration (solid, aqueous, atmospheric and energy wastes) by considering waste management options that can be applied to more than one medium, (3) tools (regulatory, economic, voluntary and informational) and (4) agents (governmental bodies (local and national), businesses and the community).
   This evaluation allows guidelines for enhancing success: (1) as experience increases, it is possible to deal with a greater complexity; and (2) integrated waste management requires a holistic approach, which encompasses a life cycle understanding of products and services. This in turn requires different specialisms to be involved in the instigation and analysis of an integrated waste management system. Taken together these advance the path to sustainability.

AB Understanding the process controls on episodic fluxes of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) is becoming increasingly important for the sustainable management and accurate modelling of water quality in both recreational and shellfish harvesting waters. Both environments exhibit transitory non-compliance with microbiological standards after rainfall episodes despite significant expenditures on control of sewage derived pollutant loadings in recent years.
   This paper demonstrates the role of wave propagation in the entrainment of FIOs from river channel beds as a contributor to episodes of poor microbial water quality. Previously reported data is reviewed in the light of relationships between wave and mean water travel velocities. High flows and rapid changes in river flow, driven by releases of bacterially pure reservoir water, resulted in elevated FIO concentrations and transient peaks in concentration. The new interpretation of these data suggest three modes of entrainment: (i) immediate wave-front disturbance, (ii) wave propagation lift and post-wave transport at mean flow velocity, and (iii) stochastic erosional mechanisms that maintain elevated bacterial concentrations under steady high flow conditions. This is a significant advance on the previously proposed mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms provides an aid to managing streams intended for recreational use and emphasises the need to control the timing of high flow generation prior to use of the water body for e.g. canoeing events. In addition the processes highlighted have relevance for the protection of shellfish nurseries, drinking water supply intakes and episodes of poor bathing water quality, and associated health risks.

AB in this study, the Fe-0/CO2 process was investigated for removing nitrate from aqueous solution under different operating conditions such as CO2 bubbling rate (0-400 mL/min), Fe-o dosage (1-6g/L), initial nitrate concentration (6-23mgN/L), batch mode, and fresh Feo supplementing (0-1 g/L). Results show that the bubbling of CO2 flow rate at 200 mL/min was sufficient for supplying H+ into solution to create an acidic environment favorable to nitrate reduction reaction. it was found that sigmoidal model equation describes the S-curve behaviors of nitrate reduction, ferrous accumulation and ammonium formation satisfactorily, and the parameter t(1/2) of the proposed model equation serves as a powerful tool for the comparison of nitrate reduction rate. Sustainability test demonstrates that Feo powder began to deteriorate after three batches operation. Concerning the operating modes, the batch mode with the treated solution emptied and freshly refilled outperforms the one, which was operated by retaining the treated solution and spiking concentrated nitrate into it for the next batch treatment. To guarantee satisfactory nitrate removal using the former mode, supplement of appropriate amount of Fe-o needs to be optimized (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Management of a karoo fractured-rock aquifer system - Kalkveld water
   user association (WUA)
SO WATER SA

DE groundwater; management tool; Karoo; fractured aquifer
AB Due to large-scale development of groundwater resources for irrigation purposes the Kalkveld area has been identified by DWAF as an area where a water user association ( WUA) should be established in order to achieve better management of the resource. The area represents typical Karoo type fractured-rock aquifers, which consist mainly of sandstone, mudstone, shale and siltstone. The majority of boreholes drilled in Karoo formations have very low immediate yields (< 1 l/s). However, large volumes of groundwater are pumped from boreholes in the Kalkveld area for irrigation of commercial crops. Thus, these aquifers have a more complex and unpredictable behaviour than normally described in the literature.
   Groundwater management units have been delineated based on: similar hydraulic properties; recharge characteristics; land use; geology (including the distribution of surface calcrete deposits); rainfall; and hydrochemistry. A numerical flow model was constructed for the area to evaluate the impact of increased abstraction on the groundwater resources as well as to evaluate the response of the delineated water management units/areas. To facilitate long- term management of the groundwater resources a user-friendly prediction and management tool was developed. The tool together with the recommended monitoring and management measures should enable DWAF and the WUA to manage the groundwater resource in a sustainable manner.

   irrigation with gypsiferous mine-water on groundwater resources
SO WATER SA

DT Article

AB Irrigation of agricultural crops is one of the most cost-effective options for the utilisation of gypsiferous mine wastewater. In addition, it creates the opportunity to produce crops during the dry season. Gypsum is a slightly soluble salt and concentrating the gypsiferous soil solution through crop evapotranspiration precipitates gypsum in the soil pro. le, removing it from the water system and reducing the potential for groundwater pollution. In previous research, it was found that crops can be commercially produced under irrigation with gypsiferous mine-water with no obvious impact on groundwater in the short term ( 3 years). It was, however, recommended that monitoring should continue to confirm findings over a longer period and for different conditions. A research project was therefore initiated in 2001 to determine the impact of irrigation with several gypsiferous water/ soil combinations on crop performance, soil properties and groundwater quality. Field trials were carried out in South Africa on three mines: Kleinkopje and New Vaal Collieries ( Anglo Coal), and at Syferfontein ( Sasol). Different crop and pasture species were grown on different soil types under centre-pivot irrigation with different mine-water qualities.
   Intensive monitoring systems were established in each irrigated. eld to determine the components of the soil-water and salt balance. Boreholes were also installed to monitor groundwater level and quality. Field water and salt balance data were used for calibration and validation of the mechanistic, generic crop, Soil-Water Balance (SWB) Model. The results of the. eld trials indicated that high crop and pasture yields can be obtained, provided site selection, land preparation, fertilisation and irrigation water management are appropriate. The results of the soil-water and salt balance studies indicated that considerable volumes of mine-water can be used and substantial amounts of salts can be removed from the water system through precipitation of gypsum in the soil pro. le. The groundwater impact was limited based on borehole measurements, indicating the presence of a zone of attenuation between the cropped soil pro. le and groundwater, but this should be monitored over a longer period. With appropriate management, water and salt runoff, and under specific conditions, drainage and salts leached can be intercepted, thereby minimising unwanted impacts on groundwater. Thirty-year scenario simulations were run with SWB and the generated salt loads from this model were used as input into a separate groundwater model in order to predict the likely long-term effects of irrigation with gypsiferous mine- water on groundwater. The results of these simulations showed that while salts reached the groundwater, there was a drop in concentration of the plume as it moved away from the irrigated area. This was due largely to dilution by infiltration from rainfall recharge and the dispersive characteristics of the aquifer. The simulations also showed the importance of matching the amount of drainage from an irrigated site with the transmissivity and storage properties of the aquifer below. These results suggest that large-scale irrigation with gypsiferous water could be viable if irrigated. elds are carefully sited to prevent water-logging and are well managed. A site-specic approach is essential.

AB In conventional environmental protection the parallel development of advanced technical solutions alongside ever more stringent environmental standards increasingly conflicts with the moral and practical imperatives to ensure sustainability and drastically improve the life conditions of the world's poor. Such priorities are far better tackled by technological and social innovations based on relatively simple and highly sustainable concepts: e.g., applying Natural Biological Mineralization Routes (NBMR) for wastewater and waste treatment, implementing Decentralized Sanitation and Resource Recovery and Reuse (DESAR(3)) where transport of waste(water)s is kept to an optimum level and pollutants valorized, etc. With developing countries now taking a lead in applying these concepts in public sanitation, the more prosperous countries will gradually abandon the expensive, vulnerable and non-sustainable conventional approaches to wastes treatment and environmental protection.

AB Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are emerging as promising technology for the treatment of wastewaters. The potential energy conversion efficiencies are examined. The rates of energy recovery (W/m(3) reactor) are reviewed and evaluated. Some recent data relating to potato-processing wastewaters and a hospital wastewater effluent are reported. Finally, a set of process configurations in which MFCs could be useful to treat wastewaters is schematized. Overall, the MFC technology still faces major challenges, particularly in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency.

AB Some industrial wastewaters may contain ammonium-nitrogen and/or sulphate, which need to be removed before their discharge into natural water bodies to eliminate their severe pollution. In this paper, simultaneous removal of ammonium-nitrogen and sulphate with an anaerobic attached-growth bioreactor of 3.8 L incubated with sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) was investigated. Artificial wastewater containing sodium sulphate as electron acceptor, ammonium chlorine as electron donor and glucose as carbon source for bacteria growth was used as the feed for the bioreactor. The loading rates of ammonium-nitrogen, sulphate and COD were 2.08 gN/m(3).d, 2.38 gS/m(3).d, 104.17 gCOD/m(3).d, respectively, with a N/S ratio of 1:1.14. The results demonstrated that removal rates of ammonium-nitrogen, sulphate and COD could reach 43.35%, 58.74% and 91.34%, respectively. Meanwhile, sulphur production was observed in effluent as well as molecular nitrogen in biogas, whose amounts increased with time substantially, suggesting the occurrence of simultaneous removal of ammonium-nitrogen and sulphate. This novel reaction provided the possibility to eliminate ammonium-nitrogen and sulphate simultaneously with accomplishment of COD removal from wastewater, making wastewater treatment more economical and sustainable.

AB Developed for tertiary nitrification, this biofilter also removed carbonaceous BOD (cBOD) and (SS). Because the biofilter is expanded, it cannot clog, and therefore does not require backflushing; yet, it removed a significant proportion of the influent SS. This unanticipated capability was due to the activities of heterotrophic bacteria, protozoa, and metazoa (nematode and oligochaete worms). The expanded bed is an intensified process, which is based on natural immobilization of microbes to small support particles. Using glassy coke as the support material, an attached layer of microbes develops, forming particulate biofilms having a superficial surface area of 1800 m(2) m(-3). Autotrophic nitritifiers (Nitrosomonas spp.) were detected in the biofilm using rRNA-based molecular methods and were likely responsible, at least in part, for reducing the ammonia concentration by up to 99% (to 0.1 mg L-1), while the other organisms reduced cBOD and SS by up to 56% and 62%, respectively. Furthermore, the influent concentrations of Escherichia coli, coliform and heterotrophic bacteria were reduced by over 80%. It thereby provides a single process solution for combined tertiary nitrification and solids removal. Operating the process to consistently achieve < 0.5 mg NH3N L-1 and at the same time removing a significant fraction of cBOD and SS, it can replace processes such as SAFs or NTFs followed by a sandfilter.

DE integrated water management; saltwater intrusion; sustainability; water
   scarcity
AB Water scarcity and water pollution are severe problems in the Northern part of China, strongly affecting socio-economic development and standards of living and environment. The Shandong province is specifically plagued by water scarcity. In the coastal catchments of the Shandong province the water scarcity is even increased due to saltwater intrusion, reducing the usability of water resources available. The pressing water problems in the costal catchments in the Shandong province and resulting socio-economic troubles forced the Chinese authorities to implement a variety of measures to relieve water scarcity and abate saltwater intrusion. But not much has been achieved so far as the measures are not coordinated in their effects and cost-benefit relations have not been considered sufficiently. Such a situation calls for good, which means integrated, sustainable water management. The assessment of this situation in the project "Flood Control and Groundwater Recharge in Coastal Catchments" financed by the German Ministry of Research and Education is presented. Further objectives and first ideas for an IWRM-concept are explained. These ideas are based on concepts developed in Germany in the context of the fulfilment of the European Water Framework Directive.

AB The Greater Moncton Sewerage Commission has developed, in concert with National Defence Canada, an environmentally sustainable and cost effective biosolids management and land reclamation programme at the Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Gagetown, New Brunswick, Canada (the second largest land based Military Training Facility in the British Commonwealth). The use of composted biosolids to revegetate military training lands is thought to be a unique application for the beneficial use of biosolids. Results and practical experience gained from this approach to successfully re-vegetate initial sections of extremely large and vast tracts of these lands are described. The paper also overviews the Commission's modern 115 000 m(3).d(-1) advanced, chemically assisted primary wastewater treatment facility and associated alkaline (lime) sludge stabilisation process. Planning strategies, security aspects, special and unique challenges in operating adjacent to an active military training facility, costs, spreading techniques, monitoring, next steps and conclusions are also presented.

AB The use of wastewater sludge on arable land in Sweden has been limited for some years due to the low quality, in some respects, of the sludge and to the reluctance of farmers and the food industry to use it. To improve the quality of the sludge, the ReVAQ project has been started, and it now involves seven municipal wastewater organisations. The goal of the project is to introduce a process in which the quality is successively improved by a series of actions taken by society. These actions include tracking and eliminating sources of heavy metals and other substances. As there are numerous sources of some of the substances, the work concentrates on the major sources. Another important activity is to provide information to the users of the wastewater system. The project is being evaluated by Urban Water AB. The results from the first two years indicate that it may be possible to reach the primary technical goal: to obtain a sludge quality that corresponds to that of household wastewater. The more ambitious goal of reaching a quality corresponding to that of WC water (the sum of urine and faeces) does not seem realistic without far-reaching changes in society. The organisations involved, which take the work seriously and are goal-oriented, have achieved measurable results in a short time. The work is also accepted and supported by the board members. More effort is needed, however, to inform the users about the system, and to [motivate them to] change their behaviour regarding matters such as the purchase of everyday products and the use of the toilet facilities.

AB Snow quality and its variations due to distance from the road were,studied. Also, how the snow quality changes over time during the melting period was discussed. Snow samples were collected at three occasions during the winter of 2004. The samples were taken along a highway in the Lulea region, Sweden, with an average daily traffic load of 9,200 vehicles. Snow samples were taken perpendicular to the road and at different distances. The snow samples were analysed for metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Also, weather parameters such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed and wind direction were measured. The highest total metal and PAH concentrations were found at the sample site closest to the road and at the end of the season. Before the melting period started, 42-57% of the total amount of metals and PAH were found in the first 1 m of the snow pack. This information could be valuable when one is discussing how to achieve sustainable snow-handling management.

AB The presence, in sewage sludge, of excess levels of the potentially toxic elements (PTE) copper, zinc, chromium, cadmium, nickel, lead and mercury, could impact on our ability to recycle these residues in the future. Far stricter limits on the levels of PTEs are likely in proposed legislation. A method involving the dosing of Fenton's reagent, a mixture of ferrous iron and hydrogen peroxide, under acidic conditions was evaluated for its potential to reduce metal levels. The [Fe]:[H2O2] (w/w) ratio was found to give a good indication of the percentage copper and zinc elution obtainable. Sites with no iron dosing as part of wastewater treatment required extra iron to be added in order to initiate the Fenton's reaction. A significant reduction, in excess of 70%, of the copper and zinc was eluted from both raw primary and activated sludge solid fractions. Cadmium and nickel could be reduced to below detection limits but elution of mercury, lead and chromium was less than 40%. The iron catalyst concentration was found to be a crucial parameter. This process has the potential to reduce the heavy metal content of the sludge and allow the recycling of sludge to continue in a sustainable manner.

AB Source control by on-site retention and infiltration of stormwater is a sustainable and proven alternative to classical drainage methods. Unfortunately, sedimentary particles and pollutants from drained surfaces cause clogging and endanger soil and groundwater during long-term operation of infiltration devices. German water authorities recommend the use of infiltration devices, such as swales or swale-trench-systems. Direct infiltration by underground facilities, such as pipes, trenches or sinks, without pretreatment of runoff is generally not permitted. Problems occur with runoff from metal roofs, traffic areas and industrial sites. However, due to site limitations, underground systems are often the only feasible option. To overcome this situation, a pollution control pit was developed with a hydrodynamic separator and a multi-stage filter made of coated porous concrete. The system treats runoff at source and protects soil, groundwater and receiving waterways. Typically, more than 90% of the pollutants such as sedimentary particles, hydrocarbons and heavy metals can be removed. Filters have been developed to treat even higher polluted stormwater loads from metal roofs and industrial sites. The treatment process is based on sedimentation, filtration, adsorption and chemical precipitation. Sediments are trapped in a special chamber within the pit and can be removed easily. Other pollutants are captured in the concrete filter upstream of the sediment separator chamber. Filters can be easily replaced.

ID OPTIONS
AB We studied user behavior and acceptance of NoMix toilets by collecting 271 questionnaires from young adults. We discriminated between short- and long-term users (months of habituation). Most respondents noticed that the NoMix toilet is different. Nevertheless, the existing NoMix technology was well accepted regarding design, hygiene and smell in this institutional setting. Only few respondents changed their sitting or flushing behavior. The necessity to sit when urinating might be slightly problematic (62% sit), but it seems possible that people adopt this new behavior required by the NoMix toilet. General acceptance of the NoMix toilet was high: 70% of respondents found the idea convincing - many for environmental reasons - 87% were willing to move into an apartment with a NoMix toilet, and 20% would pay substantially more for a NoMix toilet. We informed about the NoMix toilet with instructions for use in the toilet cabin, an information poster, and an information leaflet that we distributed after questioning. Our information was noted by most respondents and significantly increased the knowledge about and the acceptance of the NoMix toilet. We recommend that future pilot projects with NoMix toilets consider a well devised information policy to support decision making and acceptance of this new technology.

AB Urine separation is a promising alternative to present-day waste water management. It can help to manage our nutrient flows in a sustainable way. Currently, techniques are being developed to recycle and treat source-separated urine. These techniques, however, must consider the spontaneous processes that change the separated urine. The initial cause of changes is the contamination with microorganisms, which can hardly be avoided in urine-collecting systems. The most important transformation processes are microbial urea hydrolysis, mineral precipitation and ammonia volatilisation. Additionally, a variety of microorganisms may grow in source-separated urine, because the content of biodegradable organic compounds is very high. These microorganisms may also include pathogens. In this paper we give an overview of the effects that the spontaneous transformation processes may have. We focus on nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, potassium, sulphur, organic substances, pathogens and the buffering capacity. The discussion is based on own experiences and literature reviews. This overview will help to develop appropriate technologies for urine recycling.

AB It is now well accepted that there are significant challenges to realising the widespread and self-sustaining implementation of sustainable urban water management. It is argued that these challenges are entrenched within the broader socio-political framework, yet often unsuccessfully addressed within the more narrow scope of improving technical knowledge and design capacity. This hypothesis is investigated through a comparative analysis of three independent research projects investigating different dimensions of the water cycle, including stormwater management in Australia and sanitary waste management and implementation of innovative technologies in the UK. The analysis reveals significant and common sociopolitical impediments to improved practice. It was evident that the administrative regime, including implementing professionals and institutions, appears to be largely driven by an implicit expectation that there is a technical solution to solve water management issues. This is in contrast to addressing the issues through broader strategies such as political leadership, institutional reform and social change. It is recognised that this technocratic culture is inadvertently underpinned by the need to demonstrate implementation success within short-term political cycles that conflict with both urban renewal and ecological cycles. Addressing this dilemma demands dedicated socio-technical research programs to enable the much needed shift towards a more sustainable regime.

AB New guidelines have been developed and trialled in Australia to assist urban stormwater managers to assess options for projects that aim to improve urban waterway health. These guidelines help users to examine the financial, ecological and social dimensions of projects (i.e. the so-called "triple-bottomline"). Features of the assessment process described in the guidelines include use of multi criteria analysis, input from technical experts as well as non-technical stakeholders, and provision of three alternative levels of assessment to suit stormwater managers with differing needs and resources. This paper firstly provides a background to the new guidelines and triple-bottom-line assessment. The assessment methodology promoted in the new guidelines is then briefly summarised. This methodology is compared and contrasted with European guidelines from the "SWARD" project that have been primarily developed for assessing the relative sustainability of options involving urban water supply and sewerage assets. Finally, the paper discusses how assessment methodologies that evaluate the financial, ecological and social dimensions of projects can, under some circumstances, be used to evaluate the relative progress of options for urban water management on a journey towards the widely pursued, but vaguely defined goal of "sustainable development".

AB The city of Calgary has been one of fastest growing cities in Canada in recent years. Rapid population growth and a warming climate trend have raised concerns about sustainable water supply. In this study, historic climate, stream flow and population data are analyzed in order to develop models of future climate trends and river-water resource availability. Daily water demands for the next 60 years were projected using the relationship between daily maximum temperature and water demand under simulated climate and population growth scenarios. To maintain sustainable growth Calgary will require water conservation efforts that reduce per capita water use to less than half of the current level over the next 60 years, an interval when the civic population is expected to be doubled.

ID WATER-POLLUTION; POINT
AB Water quality in China shows an overall trend of deterioration in recent years. Nonpoint source pollution from agricultural and rural regions is the leading source of water pollution. The agricultural nonpoint source pollutants are mainly from fertilization of cropland, excessive livestock and poultry breeding and undefined disposal of daily living wastes in rural areas. Agricultural nonpoint sources contribute the main source of pollution to most watersheds in China, but they are ignored in management strategy and policy. Due to the lack of full understanding of water pollution control and management and the lack of perfect water quality standard systems and practical legislative regulations, agricultural nonpoint source pollution will become one of the biggest challenges to the sustainable development of rural areas and to society as a whole. The system for agricultural nonpoint source pollution control in China should include an appropriate legislation and policy framework, financing mechanisms, monitoring system, and technical guidelines and standards. The management of agricultural nonpoint source pollution requires multidisciplinary approaches that will involve a range of government departments, institutions and the public.

AB Water shortage and water environment deterioration are becoming the bottleneck of the continuous socioeconomic growth of China in the 21 st Century. Based on the development of water utilisation and the natural matter cycle rule, the authors argued that the fundamental approach to resolve the water crises and achieve the sustainable utilisation of water resource is to establish a healthy water cycle. The key strategy to establish this is advanced wastewater treatment and recycling to entire cities. The successional researches and practices of sustainable water utilisation and water environment restoration in Dalian, Shenzhen, Beijing and the north-east region were presented. These projects were the initial applications of the primary healthy water cycle theory, and indicated that the Chinese water industry gradually tends to the water environment restoration and water recycling.

DE cleaner production; eco-efficiency; ecological fingerprint
AB In the frame of the Petroleos Mexicanos Institutional Program for Sustainable Development, processes were evaluated in the manufacture operation of the petrochemical industry, with the purpose of reducing their ecological fingerprint. Thirteen cleaner production opportunities were registered in six process plants: ethylene oxide and glycols, acetaldehyde, ethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene switch and acrylonitrile, and 45 recommendations in the waste water treatment plant. Morelos is the second most important petrochemical complex in the Mexican and Latin American petrochemical industry. A tool was developed to obtain eco-efficiency indicators in operation processes, and as a result, potential savings were obtained based on best performance, as well as the integrated distribution of Sankey diagrams. Likewise, a mechanism of calculation to obtain economic savings based on the reduction of residues during the whole productive process is proposed. These improvement opportunities and recommendations will result in economic and environmental benefits minimising the use of water, efficient use of energy, raw materials and reducing residues from source, generating less environmental impacts during the process.

AB A sustainable aquatic environment, which relates to the issues of pollution mitigation and ecological restoration, is one of the important indicators of the vitality and prosperity of a city. Traditionally, resort to engineering efforts is always the first priority in dealing with such problems. Nevertheless, treated as an integrated system, the nature of the problem should involve many aspects including economic, ecological, environmental, and engineering factors. Meanwhile, the special feature of the time-dependent state has also made such a system a dynamic and complex problem. The current research has employed the concepts of integrated assessment trying to aggregate related studies and tackling the problem as a complete system. With the aid of the system dynamic modeling tool, which is capable of dealing with dynamic and complex problems, the simulation model was formulated following the macrostructure of system behavior. Various strategies for improving the sustainability of the aquatic environment in Love River, Kaohsiung, Taiwan have been evaluated. The decision makers are therefore allowed to choose more effective strategies based on the integrated perspectives.

AB Climate change has been identified as a major influence on basin water balances. However, land use and water use practices have also been identified as players. This case study was completed to better understand a changing water balance affecting a major basin in Alberta. The Beaver River basin is located in east central Alberta. Much of the basin has been developed for agricultural use; however, a number of heavy oil operations also exist. Both sectors use surface and groundwater. Evidence exists that the basin hydrology has changed since the mid-1970s. Coincidently, it was at this time that much of the land was cleared for agricultural development and commercial-scale oil development began. Oil industry use of water was suspected as the main cause for the changes observed. To investigate this further, data from regional hydrometric and meteorological stations were assessed along with water well hydrographs and historical satellite images. A significant correlation was found between basin responses and a climate phenomenon known as the Pacific decadal oscillation. Although the correlation between the Pacific decadal oscillation and basin hydrology appeared strong, deforestation for agricultural development also seemed to have an effect. Use of the local water resources was found to be of minor significance.

AB Investigations were focused on the development of a technology for phosphorus (P) recovery straight from wastewater. Facing the finiteness of the natural resources of this essential nutrient, the declared goal must be the sustainable use of available phosphorus sinks such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) for the generation of P rock substitutes. A feasible method for simultaneous elimination and recovery of phosphorus from wastewater proved to be the P-RoC process - the phosphorus recovery from wastewater by induced crystallisation of calcium phosphate, applying tobermorite-rich waste compounds of the construction industry. The experiments were performed in fixed bed-, stirred- and expanded bed reactors in laboratory- as well as in pilot-scale experiments. The efficiency and longevity of the P-RoC process was determined by the supply of Ca ions and the initial P concentration. Total P (P-tot) contents in the generated crystallisation products of up to 13% P-tot (30% P2O5) were achieved. Mineralogical investigations proved the formation of a hydroxy-apatite- (HAP)-like coating onto the seed material's surface. Reuse options for the generated crystallisation products, such as substitute for phosphate rock or as new fertiliser, were assessed.

AB The USEPA (2001) water quality nutrient criteria will have a significant impact on water pollution control industry due to stringent N and P requirements. This paper presents an update of findings on successful total N (TN) and total P (TP) technologies being implemented at existing wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) to achieve low TN and TP effluents and some key challenges in achieving lower levels. Plants consistently achieving < 5 mg TN/L and < 0.5 mg TP/L were identified from a worldwide literature search and plant data collection. Technology gaps and research needs to improve successful technologies to achieve very low TN and TP effluents are summarised in this paper. The dissolved and colloidal organic N have been identified as major challenges in achieving very low levels of TN. Technical and economic challenges to achieve very low TP effluents include alkalinity deficiency, high chemical usage, high sludge production and lack of sufficient influent BOD for biological P uptake.

   sustainable sanitation system
AB In order to make a breakthrough for the acute problem of water shortage in the world, the key words "decentralization and re-use" are very important for new sustainable sanitation systems that will be developed. Therefore, we focused on a new treatments system called "a slanted soil treatment system" which combines a biotoilet system with a domestic grey water treatment system. Because this system is a low cost and compact system, the system can be easily introduced to homes in urban areas or in the suburbs of cities in many developing countries. In this study, we performed on site experiments carried out on Shikoku Island, Japan, for several years. We obtained the following results. The slanted soil treatment system could remove organic pollutants and total nitrogen and total phosphorus in grey water effectively. Furthermore, the system performance became high in the case of the high concentration of the influent water. The nitrification reaction and denitrification reaction were speculated to exist due to aerobic zones and anaerobic zones present in the slanted soil treatment system. The slanted soil treatment system could perform for approximately 3 years with zero maintenance. The plug flow model of 1 st order reaction kinetics could describe the reaction in the slanted soil treatment system. However, it is necessary to improve the system to maintain the performance in all seasons.

AB Israel is one of the world's leaders in agricultural re-use of wastewater, currently re-using over 60% of produced wastewater. The effects of arid climate, intensive irrigated agriculture and limited water resources make re-use necessary to conserve fresh water for domestic use. Quality standards for wastewater re-use are needed to protect public health and prevent environmental and agricultural damage. This paper examines the environmental and economic sustainability of the proposed upgrade of wastewater quality standards. A tertiary treatment standard was proposed, but has not been approved due to objections from local authorities and farmers. An upgrade will require higher treatment costs, which will be divided between farmers and local authorities through the pricing of the wastewater. Farmers oppose the upgrade because they will not be able to pay higher prices for wastewater, which they use to irrigate low-profit crops. If the price is too high, these farmers may be forced out of business and a substantial reduction in cultivated lands may result. If the price is too low, the poorer local authorities may not be able to comply with the standards, and may discharge improperly treated wastewater, causing environmental damage. A successful policy balances the needs for environmental protection with the economic realities of farmers and local authorities and may require compensation for local authorities or farmers in order to achieve maximum environmental protection.

AB Since removal and disposal of sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) sediment can incur high maintenance costs, assessments of sediment volumes, quality and frequency of removal are required. Sediment depth and quality were surveyed annually from 1999 - 2003 in three ponds and one wetland in Dunfermline, Scotland, UK. Highest sediment accumulation occurred in Halbeath Pond, in the most developed watershed and with no surface water management train. From comparison of measured potentially toxic metal concentrations (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Zn) with standards, the average sediment quality should not impair aquatic ecosystems. 72-84% of the metal flux into the SUDS was estimated to be associated with coarse sediment (> 500 mu m diameter) suggesting that management of coarse sediment is particularly important at this site. The timing of sediment removal for these SUDS is expected to be determined by loss of storage volume, rather than by accumulation of contaminants. If sediment removal occurs when 25% of the SUDS storage volume has infilled, it would be required after 17 years in Halbeath Pond, but only after 98 years in Linburn Pond (which has upstream detention basins). From the quality measurements, sediment disposal should be acceptable on adjacent land within the boundaries of the SUDS studied.

AB Alberta's Water for Life Strategy was introduced in 2003 with three main-goals: safe, secure drinking water supply; healthy aquatic ecosystems; and, reliable, quality water supplies for a sustainable economy. The strategy establishes a framework of partnerships within the province that are charged with stakeholder consultation, integrated watershed planning, policy recommendations and implementation of a broad range of initiatives within this diverse prairie ecosystem.
   The Government of Alberta has established a framework of partnerships charged with implementation of the strategy: the province-wide Alberta Water Council, watershed planning and advisory councils that work on a basin-wide basis and watershed stewardship groups that deliver on-the-ground programs at the local and community level. The authors discuss the mandate(s) of each partnership group, key actions and deliverables. Examples are provided of specific projects undertaken by each partnership and a summary is provided of lessons learned based on the authors' direct experience over the past five years.

AB The protection and sustainable management of the aquatic ecosystems is the central aim of the European Water Framework Directive. Due to the aspiration for good ecological status of the water bodies free fish passage will play an important part in river basin management. The Ruhr River has seen severe anthropogenic modifications due to urbanisation and industrialisation in the 19th and 20th centuries leading in the existence of approx. 1,300 weirs within the Ruhr River Basin. The majority of the barriers are assessed as not passable or restricted passable.
   Against this background the Ruhrverband made a holistic approach towards restoring fish passage within the Ruhr catchment. Besides the scientific and technical aspects, such as the determination of potential (spawning) habitats and the development of measures in order to reach them, they also considered cost-benefit-ratio considerations for the Ruhr catchment as a whole as well as for site-specific designs of fish passage structures. Various benefits were evaluated taking into account different fields of economic interest.
   The model of financing all necessary measures should involve all responsible parties benefiting from the water utilizations. Such a mutual procedure delivers a fair cost distribution as well as an efficient implementation of measures.

   approach; Quebec Water Policy; watershed-base management
AB The Quebec Water Policy was launched in November 2002 in support of reform of the water governance. One of the government commitments is to gradually implement watershed-based management for 33 major watercourses located primarily in the St. Lawrence plain. At the local and regional levels, watershed organizations are responsible for implementing integrated management, from a sustainable-development perspective, by preparing a master plan for water (MPW), which will include watercourses, lakes, wetlands and aquifers. These watershed organizations rely on public consultation, as well as local and regional expertise, on the responsibilities for water of the municipalities and regional county municipalities of the territory, as well as those of the ministries and other government agencies. They are also required to observe national priorities regarding protection, restoration, and development of water resources and to comply with relevant guidelines, directives, standards, regulations, and legislation.
   The role of watershed organizations is to act as planning and consultation tables. Government representatives are present, on the initial process, as the facilitator and for scientific and technical support. They do not have, at this moment, any voting or decisional rights. After two years, integrated water management mobilized water stakeholders on watersheds and they are on their way to initiating their first MPW.

AB Fully autotrophic nitrogen removal processes, such as the combined SHARON-Anammox process, help to improve the sustainability of wastewater treatment. Successful operation of such a completely autotrophic system is, among others, based on the strict control of the SHARON reactor in order to produce an Anammox-suited influent with a 1:1 ammonium:nitrite ratio. The high quality and high frequency measurements provided by a titrimetric set-up measuring the total ammonium (TAN) and total nitrite (TNO2) concentrations facilitate this control considerably. In this study, the use of a titrimetric set-up for monitoring the combined SHARON-Anammox process is investigated. The technique that interprets on-line collected titration curves was applied to a lab-scale system. Comparison with classic colorimetric results gave statistically indistinguishable results for TAN and TNO2 concentrations in the SHARON reactor. In the Anammox reactor, only TAN could be determined by the investigated method due to the very low TNO2 concentrations. Phosphate, a potential inhibitor of the Anammox process, is available as an additional measurement in the effluent of the SHARON reactor. Three measurements are thus combined in one single instrument. The proposed measuring technique holds different advantages over the other TAN and TNO2 measurement techniques such as on-site availability, easy automation, the absence of the need for high dilutions and cost reduction.

AB This paper discusses the use of intelligent information access (HA) technologies in the development and services of digital libraries. After an introduction of the definition, subfields, and the characteristics of IIA, this paper reviews IIA-related research that has been recently published at leading digital library conferences. The authors suggest that applying IIA technologies to digital libraries may have the potential to greatly speed up the development of digital libraries and to improve the quality of user services. Digital library developers should consider collaborating with IIA researchers in order to build sustainable digital libraries. The paper concludes with a framework for integrating IIA technologies into digital library development and services.

AB Conservation tillage systems, such as no-tillage, are ecologically advantageous because they reduce soil erosion; however, they rely heavily on herbicide use. Our goal was to determine how weed Communities of no-tillage systems are affected when the system is modified to reduce herbicide use through a combination of banded herbicides and interrow cultivation. To this end, we conducted a 9-yr study in a no-tillage corn-soybean-winter wheat rotation. All management systems had a preplant application of glyphosate, followed by either broadcast PRE herbicides (conventional no-tillage), interrow cultivation with banded PRE herbicides, or interrow cultivation alone. Aboveground weed densities were assessed each year and data were grouped into early (1991 to 1993) and late (1996 to 1998) time periods. Over time, weed communities became more distinct, showing a strong response to management and crop. In the early years, weed communities separate more in response to management than crop. In the late years, this was reversed. Weed communities in systems with interrow cultivation were more diverse than those in conventional no-tillage. The response to weed management system and crop was species specific. For example, the abundance of yellow foxtail was higher when interrow cultivation was employed, but abundance was equal in all crops. Dandelion was more abundant in conventional no-tillage of corn and soybean; however, it was equally abundant in all management systems in wheat. Seed bank species richness increased over time and was highest in systems with interrow cultivation. Herbicide use can be reduced in a modified no-tillage corn-soybean-wheat rotation by incorporating interrow cultivation, with or without banded herbicides, into the management plan. The weed community trajectory changes, and the weed community becomes more diverse. A more diverse weed community will not necessarily alter how we manage weeds.

AB The effects of crop rotation and management system on annual variability in weed communities and crop yields were assessed in a 4-yr study in Michigan. Variability of the weed community and corn yields were assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV) and a multivariate dissimilarity index (Bray-Curtis) that accounted for changes in both weed species abundance and composition. The treatments included two rotations: continuous corn and a corn-corn-soybean-wheat rotation, and two management systems: conventional (CONV) and organic-based (ORG). Weed biomass was significantly higher in the ORG system; however, there was no effect of crop rotation on weed biomass or number of weed species in a treatment (species richness). Annual variability in weed community composition and structure was affected by both crop rotation and management system and was highest in the ORG rotation. In contrast to the weed community, variability in corn yield was highest in the least-diverse cropping system (CONV monoculture), despite that system having a more constant weed community. Corn yield in the ORG rotation was not significantly different from that in the CONV monoculture. Results of this study suggest that management aimed at increasing cropping system diversity may have additional effects on weed communities and crop yields beyond those commonly reported, and these may have important implications for the development of more efficient and sustainable weed and crop management practices.

AB The Chelidae is a family of side-necked turtles restricted in distribution to South America and Australasia. While their biology in Australia is reasonably well known, species in New Guinea are very poorly known despite high diversity, especially in the southern lowlands. In this paper, we report on the diversity, distribution, habitat and reproductive biology of the freshwater turtles of the TransFly region of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, with special emphasis on reproduction of Emydura subglobosa, Elseya branderhorsti and Elseya novaeguineae. Seven species were captured, with reliable records of an eighth. A key to the freshwater turtles of the TransFly region is provided. Harvest methods, consumption, and trade in turtles by the TransFly communities are documented. There is mounting pressure to take advantage of revenue opportunities afforded by the Asian turtle trade, but this is impeded by lack of transport infrastructure. There is also insufficient demographic information on any New Guinean turtle species to make a reasoned judgment on the level of harvest that would be sustainable. Nor is there sufficient information on captive rearing for most species, and where it is available it is not accessible by local villagers. These knowledge gaps need to be addressed and factored into a management plan that is implemented before local communities can capitalise on the commercial opportunities provided by the turtle fauna without risking collapse of the resource and the implications for their concurrent subsistence economy that would follow.

AB Today large companies often have to cope with complex and heterogeneous IT infrastructures. The main target of IT architects being responsible for those architectures is to align IT to business needs at the lowest costs possible. A recent approach to this issue is Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). Our study examines how EAI is used in large-scale companies and which effects it has on the organizational architecture of those companies. The results illustrate that EAI is a major component in complex IT infrastructures which has a significant influence on business processes. But the study also shows that there is a considerable gap between the importance of EAI in enterprise architecture and the way it is used in companies today. Eventually this article points out what has to be done to come closer to an internally sustainable enterprise architecture.

AB One hundred women participated in a needs assessment and goal-planning process at a community-based agency soon after release from prison. The assessment indicated some fit between women's identified needs and how they placed themselves on "contemplation" ladders that facilitated their planning for reentry. Follow-up interviews with 14 women found a high level of satisfaction with the process, though they struggled with unmet goals. participants and social service providers made programmatic recommendations that go beyond social services to address economic and self sustainability in the transition from prison to community.

SO WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The article empirically examines the determinants of debt distress, defined as periods in which countries resort to any of three forms of exceptional finance: significant arrears on external debt, Paris Club rescheduling, and nonconcessional International Monetary Fund lending. Probit regressions show that three factors explain a substantial fraction of the cross-country and time-series variation in the incidence of debt distress: the debt burden, the quality of policies and institutions, and shocks. The relative importance of these factors varies with the level of development. These results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications, and the core specifications have substantial out-of-sample predictive power. The quantitative implications of these results are examined for the lending strategies of official creditors.

AB Biomass is increasingly used in energy plants of different size and sophistication in Sweden. Biomass is also available in Sweden owing to its large forest-covered areas. Incineration of biomass in an environmentally friendly manner is one of the key issues in Swedish policy for sustainable development. Hence there is ongoing research on the effects of biomass burning on the air quality in Swedish cities. The relative contributions of anthropogenic sources to pollution in the urban environment are usually difficult to evaluate owing to the complexity of the ambient aerosol. In order to investigate the contribution of biomass incineration to air quality, energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis was performed on aerosol particles sampled in the centre of the small City of Vaxjo. PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 fractions were sampled with the special aim of determining the contribution of biomass burning to particulate air pollution. In order to identify typical indicators for biomass burning, principle component analysis was performed on data on elemental contents and black carbon. Analysis suggests that the K/Zn ratio will be useful as an indicator for biomass incineration. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI In the art of writing ethnography - The Atany community studies
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR VOLKSKUNDE
LA German
DT Article
AB The three monographs on the Hungarian village of Atany written by Edith M and Tamas Hofer in the 1970s are regarded as classic community studies in Cultural Anthropology. Although they stand as superior works of their time, they are worth re-reading from time to time. This article traces the different modes of re-analysing and re-interpretation of the Atany studies through the last decades of German Volkskunde. In a first step the paper tries to explain the reasons why the Atany studies could have such an impact: they are based on extensive fieldwork, they are very well constructed and well written and they seem - although not denying the ethnographic gaze - to always argue from the midst of their informants. The reader gets immersed into the small but perfectly comprehensible world of village life in the Hungarian plains. In a second step it shows how Fel and Hofer's work was used to introduce and underpin new theoretical and political trends and how certain quotes served to cherish working class and peasant wisdom, collective and community sense, notions of sustainable economy and last but not least concepts of doing fieldwork, participant observation and research on material culture. The re-reading and the analysis of the different periods of re-reading their works by colleagues also shows the charisma these text have and what a longstanding impact well constructed ethnographic writing can have for our discipline and how it can be used to introduce or induce changes of paradigms.

TI Sustainability for the cement and concrete industry Part 1
SO ZKG INTERNATIONAL
LA German
DT Article
AB Concrete is a very sustainable material with relatively low embodied energy. Yet at over 14 billion tonnes produced, comprising the largest material flow on the planet, the impact it has on the environment is monumental. It is no surprise then that in the concrete industry sustainability issues are growing in importance. The Kyoto treaty came in to force on the 16(th) February, 2005 and member nations are wondering how they can meet their objectives. More recently the Asia Pacific Forum Cement task force got underway. Behind all this and possibly unnoticed will be the influence of rising oil prices which will have the effect of pushing the cement and concrete industry towards greater energy economy and thus sustainability. This paper analyses why these changes are important, why they are happening and how they will happen.

AB Buyukcekmece Reservoir, located in the western outskirts of Istanbul, is one of the major water resources of Istanbul, and supplies drinking water to about 4 million people. Erosion in the catchment of the reservoir is an important problem in terms of its longer-term sustainability for water supply. There is an urgent need to obtain reliable quantitative data regarding erosion and deposition rates within the catchment to assess the magnitude of the problem and to plan catchment management strategies. In the absence of existing data, attention has focussed on the potential for using Cs-137 measurements to provide retrospective estimates of medium-term soil erosion rates within the catchment over the past ca. 40 years. To date, the Cs-137 approach has not been used to document soil redistribution rates in Turkey and this contribution reports an attempt to confirm the viability of the approach and the results of a preliminary investigation of rates of soil loss from uncultivated areas within the catchment. The soil redistribution rates estimated using the profile distribution conversion model varied from - 16.11 (erosion) to 4.59 (deposition) t/ha/year. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The contribution of local knowledge to ecological sciences has not been fully exploited: there is still a gap between the recognition of farmers' knowledge as valid and an effective use of such knowledge in activities aimed at sustainable development. This study explores the use of farmers' indicators of erosion for developing a rapid tool for water erosion assessment at field level in the West Usambara Mountains (Tanzania). Two extensive field surveys were conducted in the research area concurrently. One survey consisted of applying an established erosion assessment method, the Assessment of Current Erosion Damage (ACED). According to the erosion features observed, fields were classified into five erosion classes, from very slightly eroded to very severely eroded. The second survey consisted of recording the type and number of indicators of erosion listed by farmers and present in the fields. The number of farmers' indicators per field increased with erosion intensity, from less than four in slightly eroded fields to more than eight in severely eroded fields. All farmers' indicators were positively correlated to the ACED erosion assessment classes. However, two groups of farmers' indicators could be distinguished in terms of erosion assessment: strong indicators, which were observed in more than 70% of cases in severely eroded fields, and weak indicators, which were observed more frequently in slightly and moderately eroded fields. Weak indicators appeared to be indicative of other land degradation phenomena, such as chemical fertility decline. Strong indicators and number of indicators were used to create a field erosion assessment tool in the form of a classification tree. The tree was built using one half of the field survey data and validated using the other half The tree consisted of a hierarchical sequence of questions. Presence of rills and number of farmers' indicators were the most important factors of the tree. The validation yielded a highly significant Spearman's rho correlation coefficient (0.81). The contingency table showed that more than 80% of very severely eroded fields were correctly classified, whereas most misclassification occurred among slightly and moderately eroded fields. Farmers include land degradation phenomena and soil fertility decline in their definition of soil erosion. Soil and water conservation planning should address this broader farmers' perception by including, e.g., soil fertility improvements beside soil conservation. The distinction between strong and weak indicators of erosion is important in recommending the right intervention in the right spot, e.g., by counteracting soil erosion where strong indicators are present and by improving chemical fertility where weak indicators are present. The classification tree is of empirical nature and may need adaptation before being applied to other areas. The proposed methodology can be easily replicated and showed a high potential to provide extensionists with a field tool for erosion assessment.

AB The growth gap between supply and demand for water in the GCC countries can be attributed to limited available surface water, high population growth and urbanization development, deficient institutional arrangements, poor management practices, water depletion and deterioration of quality, especially in shallow groundwater aquifers. Increasing demand for water in the domestic sector has shifted attention to the role of desalination in alleviating water shortages. Experience in the Gulf states demonstrates that desalination technology has developed to a level where it can serve as a reliable source of water at a price comparable to water from conventional sources. Desalination remains in GCC countries the most feasible alternative to augment or meet future water supply requirements. It is considered a strategic option for satisfying current and future domestic water supply requirements, in comparison to the development of other water resources. Reduction in cost is making desalination increasingly attractive in comparison with other alternatives. In this paper, the present and future water statues in GCC countries is outlined. The role of desalination for augmentation of water supply and the future needs for desalinated water are discussed. The cost analysis and the approaches for reducing the cost of desalted water are outlined. Increasing the investment in the research and development to reduce the costs through improved design and operation features is very important. Development of a water policy and effective strategies in each country for stressing the sustainable water resources management and optimizing allocation of water in accordance with market value, conservation, pollution control and cooperation among water involved institutions is also essential.

DE thermoeconomic analysis; reverse osmosis; wind-powered desalination
AB dThe prospective success of sustainable development in the Canary Islands, an insular land, will be essentially determined by the interrelation between four basic fields: water, energy, economy and environment. Economical, conventional and renewable energy resources and the local situation of water demand establish that the Canary Islands constitute a significant meeting point for desalination and renewable energy technologies. This paper aims to quantify the unit cost of fresh water generated from a representative wind-powered seawater reverse osmosis system (WPRO) as well as the exergy efficiency of the process (second law of thermodynamics) by means of thermoeconomy. Backup from the grid to balance temporary wind fluctuations is assumed; however, the mean annual energy back-Lip is nil. Therefore the calculated unit cost of fresh water is determined exclusively by considering a wind-powered desalination system.

ID BIODIVERSITY
AB Land cover is an important component of landscape character. The spatial configuration and heterogeneity of land cover can influence species distributions and patterns of biodiversity. Sustainable countryside planning and land management policy in Great Britain require the mapping of land cover heterogeneity at a national scale. Here, we map four measures of land cover heterogeneity across Great Britain using Land Cover Map 2000. We calculate land cover richness, diversity, evenness and similarity within and between I x I km grid cells of the British National Grid. From this we are able to identify assemblages of land cover types that are associated with high or low landscape heterogeneity, and where they occur geographically.

   LOTUS; WETTABILITY; BEHAVIOR; LENGTH; WATER
AB The underlying mechanisms of stability, metastability, or instability of the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel wetting modes and their transitions on superhydrophobic surfaces decorated with periodic micropillars are quantitatively studied in this article. Hydraulic pressure, which may be generated by the water-air interfacial tension of water droplets or external factors such as raining impact, is shown to be a key to understanding these mechanisms. A detailed transition process driven by increasing hydraulic pressure is numerically simulated. The maximum sustainable or critical pressure of the Cassie-Baxter wetting state on a pillarlike microstructural surface is formulated for the first time in a simple, unified, and precise form. This analytic result reveals the fact that reducing the microstructural scales (e.g., the pillars' diameters and spacing) is probably the most efficient measure needed to enlarge the critical pressure significantly. We also introduce a dimensionless parameter, the pillar slenderness ratio, to characterize the stability of either the Cassie-Baxter or the Wenzel wetting state and show that the energy barrier for transitioning from the Cassie-Baxter to the Wenzel wetting mode is proportional to both the slenderness ratio and the area fraction. Thus, the Cassie-Baxter wetting mode may collapse under a hydraulic pressure lower than the critical one if the slenderness ratio is improperly small. This quantitative study explains fairly well some experimental observations of contact angles that can be modeled by neither Wenzel nor Cassie-Baxter contact angles and eventually leads to our proposals for a mixed (or coexisting) wetting mode.

AB This paper examines sustainability of the fiscal stances of South Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa and Turkey. Using the usual intertemporal borrowing constraint, we have tested for a long-run relationship between revenue and expenditure plus interest payments. In our empirical analysis of the sustainability of fiscal stances, cointegration approaches have been used. Empirical results suggest that there exists a unique long-run or equilibrium relationship among variables for South Korea and Turkey. The cointegration results suggest that the Turkish and South Korean fiscal stances satisfy the weak sustainability condition. In the case of Mexico, the Philippines and South Africa cointegration results suggest that in these Countries the fiscal stance is not sustainable (and violates their intertemporal budget constraints) in the long run.

TI Life cycle assessment of switchgrass- and corn stover-derived
   ethanol-fueled automobiles
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Utilizing domestically produced cellulose-derived ethanol for the light-duty vehicle fleet can potentially improve the environmental performance and sustainability of the transport and energy sectors of the economy. A life cycle assessment model was developed to examine environmental implications of the production and use of ethanol in automobiles in Ontario, Canada. The results were compared to those of low-sulfur reformulated gasoline (RFG) in a functionally equivalent automobile. Two time frames were evaluated, one near-term (2010), which examines converting a dedicated energy crop (switchgrass) and an agricultural residue (corn stover) to ethanol; and one midterm (2020), which assumes technological improvements in the switchgrass-derived ethanol life cycle. Near-term results show that, compared to a RFG automobile, life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are 57% lower for an E85-fueled automobile derived from switchgrass and 65% lower for ethanol from corn stover, on a grams of CO2 equivalent per kilometer basis. Corn stover ethanol exhibits slightly lower life cycle GHG emissions, primarily due to sharing emissions with grain production. Through projected improvements in crop and ethanol yields, results for the mid-term scenario show that GHG emissions could be 25-35% lower than those in 2010 and that, even with anticipated improvements in RFG automobiles, E85 automobiles could still achieve up to 70% lower GHG emissions across the life cycle.

TI Flow of natural versus economic capital in industrial supply networks
   and its implications to sustainability
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID EMBODIED ENERGY; CRITICALITY; SERVICES
AB Appreciating the reliance of industrial networks on natural capital is a necessary step toward their sustainable design and operation. However, most contemporary accounting techniques, including engineering economics, life cycle assessment, and full cost accounting, fail in this regard, as they take natural capital for granted and concentrate mainly on the economic aspects and emissions. The recently developed "thermodynamic input-output analysis" (TIOA) includes the contribution of ecological goods, ecosystem services, human resources, and impact of emissions in an economic input-output model. This paper uses TIOA to determine the throughputs of natural and economic capitals along industrial supply networks. The ratios of natural to economic capitals of economic sectors reveals a hierarchical organization of the U.S. economy wherein basic infrastructure industries are at the bottom and specialized value-added industries constitute the top. These results provide novel insight into the reliance of specific industrial sectors and supply chains on natural capital and the corresponding economic throughput. Such insight is useful for understanding the implications of corporate restructuring on industrial sustainability metrics and of outsourcing of business activities on outsourcer, outsourcee, and global sustainability. These implications are discussed from the standpoints of weak and strong sustainability paradigms. The calculated ratios can also be used for hybrid thermodynamic life cycle assessment.

AB Land use planners in many countries have recognized the importance of the aesthetic values of landscape. Their desire to incorporate these values into decision-making processes has created a need to identify valid ways to quantify the scenic characteristics of landscapes. This has led to an increasing interest in the use of spatial data and geographic information systems (GIS) methodology in assessing visual attributes of the landscape. The objective of the present study is to assess the visual changes in a rapidly developing coastal area of Egypt using remotely sensed data (satellite images and aerial photographs) and raster GIS modeling. The analysis assesses changes between a period characterized by a vernacular, relatively natural landscape (1950s) and the beginning of the exploitation of the region for resorts (1990s). Using land use/land cover classes extracted from the satellite images and aerial photographs, four visual attributes of landscape are identified: land use/land cover diversity, activity (degree of naturalness), proximity to the shoreline, and topographic variety. A composite index is also developed. Although these attributes and the composite index rely mostly on the type of land use/land cover information on the landscape under consideration, the adopted techniques succeed in detecting several changes in the attributes, spatially locating them and mapping the magnitude of their changes. This study demonstrates what can be done to analyze and assess what is usually considered an incommensurable resource, the visual attributes of landscapes. It also reveals the extent of the impact of unplanned or ill-planned activities on one of the fragile resources of and landscapes. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The economic value of an improved malaria treatment programme in Zambia:
   results from a contingent valuation survey
SO MALARIA JOURNAL

AB Background: Zambia is facing a double crisis of increasing malaria burden and dwindling capacity to deal with the endemic malaria burden. The pursuit of sustainable but equity mechanisms for financing malaria programmes is a subject of crucial policy discussion. This requires that comprehensive accounting of the economic impact of the various malaria programmes. Information on the economic value of programmes is essential in soliciting appropriate funding allocations for malaria control.
   Aims and objectives: This paper specifically seeks to elicit a measure of the economic benefits of an improved malaria treatment programme in Zambia. The paper also studies the equity implications in malaria treatment given that demand or malaria treatment is determined by household socio-economic status.
   Methods: A contingent valuation survey of about 300 Zambian households was conducted in four districts. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) was elicited for an improved treatment programme for malaria in order to generate a measure of the economic benefits of the programme. The payment card method was used in eliciting WTP bids.
   Findings: The study reports that malaria treatment has significant economic benefits to society. The total economic benefits of an improved treatment programme were estimated at an equivalent of US$77 million per annum, representing about 1.8% of Zambia's GDP. The study also reports the theoretically anticipated association between WTP and several socio-economic factors. Our income elasticity of demand is positive and similar in magnitude to estimates reported in similar studies. Finally, from an equity standpoint, the constraints imposed by income and socio-economic status are discussed.

AB The photoformation of azobenzene by the oxidation of aniline on ZnO in ethanol with natural sunlight and UV irradiation (365 nm) was studied as a function of [aniline] catalyst loading, airflow rate, solvent composition, etc. The photocatalyst exhibits sustainable catalytic activity. The product formation is larger with illumination at 254 nm than at 365 nm. Electron donors like triphenylphosphine, diphenylamine and hydroquinone enhance the photocatalysis. Singlet oxygen quencher azide ion does not suppress the catalysis. The photocatalysis occurs in protic and aprotic solvents. The mechanism of photocatalysis is discussed and the product formation analyzed using a kinetic model. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID HOMOGENEITY
AB Tungsten (T-m = 3410 +/- 20 degrees C) is traditionally sintered at temperatures in excess of 2000 degrees C under hydrogen atmosphere using high temperature furnaces. The process is extremely expensive and it is difficult to gain a control over the microstructure. One of the important applications of this metal makes use of its porous form as a high current density cathode employed in flashlamps (high power laser lamps). For an improved performance and longer lifetime, a controlled porosity is essential. This study briefly highlights the advantages of an alternative sintering technique based on the concept of reactive sintering previously introduced. This novel process makes use of a small amount of Al addition. Consequently, the sintering temperature is reduced considerably (T-s <= 1200 degrees C) and a more homogeneous porous tungsten is obtained irrespective of the compaction method employed.

AB Large and usually unpredictable variation in species interaction strength has been a major roadblock to applying local experimental results to large-scale management and conservation issues. Recent studies explicitly considering benthic-pelagic coupling are starting to shed light on,and find regularities in, the causes of such large-scale variation in coastal ecosystems. Here, we evaluate the effects of variation in wind-driven upwelling on community regulation along 900 km of coastline of the southeastern Pacific, between 29 degrees S and 35 degrees S during 72 months. Variability in the intensity of upwelling occurring over tens of km produced predictable variation in recruitment of intertidal mussels, but not barnacles, and did not affect patterns of community structure. In contrast, sharp discontinuities in upwelling regimes produced abrupt and persistent breaks in the dynamics of benthic and pelagic communities over hundreds of km (regional) scales. Rates of mussel and barnacle recruitment changed sharply at approximate to 32 degrees-33 degrees S, determining a geographic break in adult abundance of these competitively dominant species. Analysis of satellite images demonstrates that regional-scale discontinuities in oceanographic regimes can couple benthic and pelagic systems, as evidenced by coincident breaks in dynamics and concentration of offshore surface chlorophyll-a. Field experiments showed that the paradigm of top-down control of intertidal benthic communities holds only south of the discontinuity. To the north, populations seem recruitment-limited, and predators have negligible effects, despite attaining similarly high abundances and potential predation effects across the region. Thus, geographically discontinuous oceanographic regimes set bounds to the strength of species interactions and define distinct regions for the design and implementation of sustainable management and conservation policies.

AB International protocols, such as those of the Montreal Process (MP), specify desired outcomes without specifying the process and components required to attain those outcomes. We suggest that the process and its components are critical to achieve desired outcomes. We discuss recent progress in northwestern North America, on three topics that will facilitate development of and reporting in sustainability protocols: (1) common terms and comparable guidelines for soil disturbance, (2) cost-effective techniques for monitoring and assessing soil disturbance, and (3) improved methods to rate soils for risk of detrimental soil disturbance. Uniform terms for soil disturbance will facilitate reporting and exchange of information. Reliable monitoring techniques and tracking the consequences of soil disturbance for forest growth and hydrology are paramount for improving understanding and predictions of the practical consequences of forest practices. To track consequences, we urge creation of regional research and operations databases that can be used to: (1) address MP values, (2) define detrimental soil disturbances, (3) develop risk rating systems for operational application, and (4) improve best management practices (BMPs) and ameliorative treatments that avoid or correct detrimental disturbances.

AB An adequate supply of nitrogen (N) is essential for the successful establishment and sustainable productivity of forest stands. N deficits may necessitate the use of artificial fertilisers. Availability of N in the inorganic forms, and the relative abundance of the NO3-N and NH4-N components, influences the species composition of natural forest vegetation. Hence it is essential to use reliable measures of soil N supply that fully reflect its ecological significance. The new Ecological Site Classification (ESC) used in British forestry employs a multi-factorial definition of soil nutrient regime (SNR), including soil N. To develop this, a soil and vegetation study was made at 89 forest sites throughout Great Britain covering the major soil types used for forestry. "Total N" levels were compared with separate pre- and post-incubation measures of the two inorganic N components as potential indices of soil N supply. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that the major discriminant chemical variables for the sampled soils were pH, calcium and NO3-N and that these were also the main variables influencing the species composition of the ground vegetation. Total N and NH4-N were less effective discriminant variables for these sites. In some infertile soils the levels of NH4-N or total N may be of greater importance, as NO3-N is usually in very limited supply. A multivariate gradient of SNR, which incorporates the NO3-N measures, has been adopted for use within the ESC system. The position of a site on this gradient can be estimated quantitatively from soil type, ground vegetation species composition and humus type. This enables soil N supply and overall SNR to be assessed in a simple but effective way that guides the operational management of British forest soils for sustainable productivity. It will also be possible to use these techniques to monitor the nutritional status of forest sites over time. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) has been adopted as an indicator of soil fertility based on the rationale that SOM contributes significantly to soil physical, chemical, and biological properties that affect vital ecosystem processes of forests in Australia. A study was undertaken to evaluate the utility of SOM as an indicator of SFM at two long-term experimental sites in native eucalypt forests, including Silvertop Ash (E. sieberi L. Johnson) and Mountain Ash (E. regnans F. Muell.) in Victoria. This study examines the relative contributions made by various sources of carbon in soil profiles (0-30 cm) of forest soils, viz. mineral soil (< 2 mm), plant residues, charcoal (> 2 mm), and rock fragments (> 2 turn). The long-term changes in these fractions in response to management-induced soil physical disturbance and fire (unburnt, moderate and high intensity) were evaluated. After 10 years, carbon levels in the fine soil fraction (soil < 2 turn including fine charcoal) were similar across the range of fire disturbance classes in Mountain Ash forest (20-25 kg/m(2)) and Silvertop Ash forest (7-8 kg/m(2)). Likewise differences in carbon associated with other fractions, viz. microbial biomass, labile carbon, plant residues and rock fragments were comparatively small and could not be attributed to fire disturbance. Burning increased the charcoal carbon fraction from 5 to 23 kg/m2 in Mountain Ash forest and from I to 3 kg/m(2) in Silvertop Ash forest. Taking into account, the percentage area affected by fire, increases in total soil carbon in these forests were estimated at 25 and 7 t/ha, respectively.
   The effects of physical disturbance of soils were examined at one site in Mountain Ash forest where soil cultivation was used as site preparation rather than the standard practice of burning of logging residues. Total carbon in soil profiles decreased from 29 to 21 kg/m(2) where soil disturbance was severe, i.e. topsoil removed and subsoil disturbed. This was mainly due to a decrease in charcoal carbon from 6.8 to 1.7 kg/m(2) but severe soil disturbance also increased the amount of carbon associated with rock fragments from 1.6 to 3.5 kg/m(2).
   Management-induced fire increased the coarse charcoal content of soil profiles substantially, thus increasing total carbon content as well as the proportion of recalcitrant carbon in SOM. In contrast, there was little change in the carbon content of the fine soil fraction including the labile and biologically active fractions indicating that these SOM fractions most relevant to ecosystem processes showed little long-term impact from soil disturbance and fire. Conventional sampling of the fine soil fraction (< 2 mm) only represented between 50% and 70% of total carbon in the soil profiles. In contrast, total nitrogen in this fraction represented between 75% and 90% of the nitrogen in soil profiles and was less affected by changes in the contributions of N made by coarse fractions. Monitoring of soil N rather than C as an indicator of soil fertility and SFM may be more appropriate for forest soils with significant charcoal content. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated how multiple-crop forestry has influenced the magnitude and variability of soil and plant phosphorus (P) fertility and site disturbance. Kinleith Forest, on Mamaku Plateau, covers >100,000 ha and comprises mainly plantation Pinus radiata. Three study areas in the forest were chosen to represent natural state (native forest), first crop of P. radiata (24 years growth), and second crop of P. radiata (4 years growth of second crop). The adjacent areas have similar relief and climate, and the soils are all the same age, being predominantly Andic Haplohumods developed in 1770 calendar-year-old non-welded tephra (Taupo Ignimbrite, ca. 0.5-0.8 m in thickness) and overlying a buried paleosol on earlier tephric material.
   Soil properties were compared using a random geometric sampling scheme stratified in a 40-m grid. Soil samples (020 cm) were taken at 1.5, 4.5 and 13 m spatial intervals in random directions away from each primary node, providing 192 sample sites for each study area. Additionally at selected sites, samples of the current year's foliage from the upper crowns were collected, the thickness of Taupo Ignimbrite (i.e. depth to buried paleosol) was recorded by angering, and site disturbance was assessed using a new six-point scale based on change relative to a modal soil profile. Geostatistics and geographical information systems (GIS) were used to assess variability and effects of forest management on the measured properties. Soil Bray-2 P concentrations were below guidelines for satisfactory growth (12 mg kg(-1)) at all sites, and no differences were recorded between the different management areas. However, the amount of within-site variability in Bray-2 P increased with the number of crops. Foliar P concentrations were only marginally deficient in both the first and second crops, indicating that P is currently not significantly limiting growth. The lack of difference in foliar P between first and second crops indicates no crop-to-crop decline in foliar P status and suggests that no site P fertility decline has occurred. The soils have an unusual ability to continue releasing P through successive sequential extractions in the Bray-2 P test, indicating a strong buffering capacity, and this may explain the apparent lack of deficiency even with Bray-2 P values of < 12 mg kg(-1). The site disturbance index increased and the spatial distribution of P data became increasingly variable with crop rotation.

AB Sustainable management of wetland ecosystems requires monitoring of vegetation dynamics, which can be achieved through remote sensing. This paper assesses the use of hyperspectral imagery to study the structure of wetlands of San Francisco Bay, California, USA. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) were applied on an AVIRIS (Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) image to investigate their appropriateness to characterize marshes, with emphasis on the Spartina species complex. The role of rms. error as a measure of model adequacy and different methods for image endmember extraction were also evaluated. Results indicate that both SMA and MESMA are suitable for mapping the main components of the marsh, although MESMA seems more appropriate since it can incorporate more than one endmember per class. rms. error was shown not to be a measure of SMA model adequacy, but it can be used to help to assess model adequacy within groups of related models.

AB This work examines the experimental assessment of the conditions required for sustainable autothermal catalytic combustion of mixtures of lean fuels (methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), acetone, propane, and methane) in a small nonadiabatic laboratory auto-cyclic reactor (ACR) loaded with a combination of laboratory-prepared monoliths and commercial palladium catalyst pellets. Despite the non-optimized physical parameters of this reactor, the experiments demonstrated that, for a given fuel, the domain of autothermal operation is dependent primarily on fuel/catalyst reactivity that, in turn, dictates the minimum heat output (power) requirement of the air/fuel mixture and, to a lesser degree, flow rate. In correlation with the reactivity of individual fuels, the power requirement for a flow rate of 64 L/min (ambient) increased, from 375 W for MEK and acetone to similar to 480 W for propane and 613 W for methane. For propane and methane combusted under the limiting conditions, oscillatory behavior was observed with the periods that correlated with the power of the fuel/air mixture. When the methane/air feed mixture was heated to 400 degrees C before entering the ACR, sustained combustion was assured for 0.6% methane flowing at a rate of 97.2 L/min.

TI Multidecadal North Atlantic climate variability and its effect on North
   American salmon abundance

LA English
DT Article
ID PACIFIC-OCEAN; TEMPERATURE; OSCILLATION; CENTURIES; RAINFALL; IMPACTS
AB Climate variability is now known to play a key role in the abundance of marine fisheries, and must be accounted for to implement sustainable management strategies. We show that North American Atlantic salmon abundance has fluctuated in parallel with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO); a basin-wide, low frequency climate mode producing cold-warm-cold sea surface temperatures over the last century. During the AMO warm (cool) phase salmon abundance is lower (higher). Changes in sea surface temperature associated with the AMO are most pronounced in the winter season near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, a known overwintering area for salmon and an important time for determining survival. A moratorium on salmon fishing was established in 1992, but has so far contributed few signs of improvement in stock size. This may be explained by a shift in the AMO to a positive phase, producing persistently warm temperatures in the marine environment. Our findings show that a continued warming near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland will have a detrimental impact on this already depleted stock despite the reduction in commercial fishing.

AB This article draws a distinction between European integration of diplomacy and law and Europeanization of the public sphere and public culture in European Union member states. The Dutch case of EMU membership is used to show that the frame of economism may be conducive to the formal adaptation of member states to European policies but may equally lead to avoidance of domestic discussion and struggle. The increasing political nature of the EU necessitates debate in order to safeguard sustainable support for, and political identification with, the EU. Consequently, next to economic frames, ethical and constitutional ones will be necessary to stop increasing euroscepticism.

AB Estimates of contaminant fluxes from DNAPL sources as a function of time and DNAPL mass reduction are important to assess the long-term sustainability and costs of monitored natural attenuation and to determine the benefits of partial source removal. We investigate the accuracy of the upscaled mass transfer function (MTF) proposed by Parker and Park [Parker JC, Park E. Modeling field-scale dense nonaqueous phase liquid dissolution kinetics in heterogeneous aquifers. WRR 2004;40:WO5109] to describe field-scale dissolved phase fluxes from DNAPL sources for a range of scenarios generated using high-resolution 3-D numerical simulations of DNAPL infiltration and long-term dissolved phase transport. The results indicate the upscaled MTF is capable of accurately describing field-scale DNAPL dissolution rates as a function of time. For finger-dominated source regions, an empirical mass depletion exponent in the MTF takes on values greater than one which results in predicted mass flux rates that decrease continuously with diminishing DNAPL mass over time. Lens-dominated regions exhibit depletion exponents less than one, which results in more step-function like mass flux versus time behavior. Mass fluxes from DNAPL sources exhibiting both lens- and finger-dominated subregions were less accurately described by the simple MTF, but were well described by a dual-continuum model of the same form for each subregion. The practicality of calibrating a dual-continuum model will likely depend on the feasibility of obtaining spatially resolved field measurements of contaminant fluxes or concentrations associated with the subregions using multilevel sampling or some other means.

TI The role of capital flight and remittances in current account
   sustainability in sub-Saharan Africa
SO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The literature on capital flight and remittances is copious, as a plethora of studies in recent years have focused greater attention on the determinants and impact of capital flight and remittances in the development process. These issues are particularly pertinent to Africa in view of its relatively high incidence of capital flight in the presence of foreign exchange constraints, limited foreign capital inflows, external indebtedness and high dependence on overseas development assistance. The principal aim of this paper is to estimate the extent and magnitude of capital flights from Africa and remittance inflows to Africa, and to assess their role in current account sustainability.
   The paper employs standard methodological approaches to estimating capital flight and remittances for selected African countries and analyses their relationships with current account balance and key economic indicators. The findings from the statistical exercises in the paper yielded a number of important results:
   The magnitude of capital flight from Africa has increased considerably in recent years, with widespread fluctuations and volatility.
   The volume of remittances into Africa has increased dramatically but steadily.
   There is a negative association between balances on current account and capital flight, implying that capital flights tend to worsen current account difficulties.
   There is a positive relationship between remittances and current account, suggesting that remittances could play an important role in mitigating current account problems.
   The link between remittances and economic growth is positive, albeit insignificantly in the statistical sense, suggesting some evidence of the crucial role of remittances in the economic growth and development process.
   External debt and capital flight are positively intertwined, providing support to the so-called 'round-tripping' or 'back-to-back' hypothesis
   The policy implications of these findings are that in spite of the good progress made by many African countries towards economic and political reforms, more innovative policy thinking and reform deepening must be initiated to create a conducive environment for private sector participation in general and foreign capital (including capital flight reversal) in particular. Similarly, there is a need for incentivising and mainstreaming remittances into national development strategies with the view to promoting the growth-enhancing effects of remittances. A wide range of policy options and forward thinking analyses were advanced in the paper.

TI Beyond HIPC: What are the prospects for debt sustainability?
SO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The pronouncement by the G-8 Summit at Gleneagles in July 2005 on debt cancellation under the HIPC Initiative, affirmed by the G-8 Ministers of Finance in Washington in September, should signal the beginning of debt relief for the world's heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC), mostly African. It is expected that debt cancellation should return the beneficiary countries to debt sustainability and afford their governments the fiscal space to invest in basic infrastructure and social services. Countries could significantly enhance their prospects for maintaining debt sustainability mainly by adopting debt management strategies that de-emphasize excessive borrowing, checking the expansion of unproductive public sector activities and the associated fiscal deficits, financial restructuring to reduce the bias against autonomous capital flows, and taking deliberate actions to expand exports.

AB Sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor ( L.) Moench] is important both as a food and feed crop in Zimbabwe. Its yield losses of sorghum can be up to 100% when the crop is heavily infestated by witchweeds [Striga asiatica ( L.) Kuntze]. Witchweed resistant cultivars offer the most practical control option under smallholder (SH) farmer conditions and could become part of a sustainable integrated control strategy. Development of S. asiatica resistant cultivars by conventional breeding is slow and has been hampered by the lack of efficient and reliable screening techniques in breeding programs. Molecular markers that are linked to witchweed resistance can expedite the development of resistant cultivars through adoption of appropriate marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategies. The objectives of this investigation were to study the inheritance or low germination stimulant (lgs) production in cultivar SAR 29 and to identify molecular markers that are linked to this trait. Low germination stimulant production is one of the recognised mechanisms of witchweed resistance. A segregating F2 population derived from crosses between cultivars SV-1 ( high germination stimulant producer, Striga-susceptible) and SAR 29 ( low germination stimulant producer, Striga-resistant) was used for this purpose. Parental and F2 genotypes were screened for lgs production using the agar gel technique (AGT). Maximum germination distance (MGD) was used as the index of resistance. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from agar gel-screened F2s, and DNA bulks were created from 16 resistant ( MGD< 10 mm) and 25 extremely susceptible (MGD> 25 mm) progeny. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) was done using random amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Ninety-nine of the primers that were polymorphic between parent genotypes ( 10 SSR and 89 RAPD) were then used to screen a total of 77 segregating F2 progeny. Linkage analysis was performed using the computer software MAPMAKER 3.0b. Segregation ratios of high to low F2 stimulant producers did not differ significantly ( P >= 0.05) from the expected ratio of 3: 1. It was therefore deduced that a single recessive gene controlled lgs production in cultivar SAR 29. No molecular marker was found to be linked to the lgs locus. Instead, linkage analysis resulted in the construction of a molecular marker linkage map consisting of 45 markers that were distributed over 13 linkage groups (LGs). The other fifty-four loci, including the locus for lgs production, were completely unlinked and could not be assigned to any linkage group. The LGs consisted of 2-8 markers, identified at a LOD grouping threshold of 4.0. The map spanned a total distance of 494.5 cM, Haldane.

AB Following the solid state fermentation of banana leaves ( Musa sapientum lina) by lignin degrading mushroom ( Volvariella volvacea), yield of fruiting bodies and compositional changes of the substrate were evaluated using a student parametric "T" test model. The biological efficiency was 5.21 while the total weight of fruit yield was 2.5 kg. The percentage biomass loss was 18.20%. The banana leaves treated with V. volvacea exhibited losses primarily in the polysaccharide components and with a greater percentage of the fibre components being degraded. The crude protein content was enhanced by the incubation of the mushroom due probably to the addition of microbial protein. The acid detergent lignin (ADL) was significantly reduced in the fungus treated sample. The acid detergent fibre (ADF) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) followed similar trend but, the cellulose and hemicellulose increased. The development of this simple technology is expected to improve the yield of mushroom as well as provide sustainable feed ( spent substrate) for ruminant animals.

TI Ecological impact of tobacco farming in miombo woodlands of Urambo

SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English

DE deforestation; richness; species composition; tobacco
AB This paper examines the ecological threat of tobacco farming in Urambo District, the leading producer of flue-cured tobacco in Tanzania with other major producers being Tabora, Iringa and Chunya Districts. Structured interviews were conducted in four villages while 39 Modified-Whittacker plots were laid in tobacco fallow lands for inventory of woody species to ascertain ecological performance and the impact of tobacco on species diversity, richness and standing stock functions. There was higher than expected species richness with a total of 115 tree and shrub species identified. Tobacco farming showed no significant negative effect on the floristic composition and stem density. However, the significantly reduced biomass and change in vegetation structure illustrate the potential loss in ecological function of the woodlands. Land clearing for tobacco planting account to an annual deforestation of 3.5% while on average a farmer requires 23 m(3) of stacked wood only for curing per season which adds another 3% of deforestation. Shifting cultivation is no longer sustainable given the shortened fallow periods of 4 years. Improved barn structures, alternative sources of fuel like coal, tree planting, mixed cropping and cash crops that are environment friendly are recommended for ecological restoration.

DE Brazilian Amazon; forest resources; participatory extension; rural

AB Public extension services play a key role in the implementation of strategies for rural development based on the sustainable management of natural resources. However, the sector suffers from restricted financial and human resources. Using experiences from participatory action research, a strategy for rural extension in the Amazon was defined to increase the efficiency and the relevance of external support for local resource users. This strategy considered activities initiated and coordinated by local people. Short-term facilitation visits provided continuous external support for the purpose of establishing locally based planning and learning mechanisms. In collaboration with the municipality of Muana in the Eastern Amazon, the strategy was tested in two traditional communities-Monte Moriat and Boa Esperanca. Both communities recognized as most important the need to reduce their dependence on acai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.), the principal source of food and income. This forest resource has been overexploited, seriously affecting acai stands and diminishing the forest benefits fundamental for survival. Two local groups decided to raise chickens as a way to reduce nutritional problems and as an alternative source of income. Supported by monthly, short-term planning and evaluation visits, the groups managed to achieve significant progress in their endeavor. The groups identified (1) the control of decision-making and information, and (2) the absence of external obligations to be the greatest advantages of the development initiative. The study confirmed the potential of participatory strategies for public extension in the Amazon. Special attention was given to realistically define the role of forests for local development. However, drastic measures are necessary to smooth the way for real participation in governmental and non-governmental organizations acting in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB In an increasingly globalized food economy, local agri-food initiatives are promoted as more sustainable alternatives, both for small-scale producers and ecologically conscious consumers. However, revitalizing local agri-food communities in rural agro-industrial regions is particularly challenging. This case study examines Grant and Chelan Counties, two industrial farming regions in rural Central Washington State, distant from the urban fringe. Farmers in these counties have tried diversifying large-scale processing into organics and marketing niche and organic produce at popular farmers markets in Seattle about 200 miles away. Such strategies invoke the question, "How are 'local' agri-food networks socially and geographically defined?" The meaning of what constitutes "local" and/or "sustainable" systems merits consideration in the linking of these rural counties with distant urban farmers markets. Employing historical, in-depth interview and survey research, we analyze production and consumption networks and the non-market systems that residents in these counties access for self-provisioning and food security.

AB The clearing land of trees and introduction of exotic pastures to enhance pasture production and associated monetary gains has been a common practise in Queensland. Previous studies on tree clearing emphasised the gains in pasture production. but over periods of less than 10-15 years after clearing, thus potentially misleading land managers who plan to continue grazing beyond that time. The present research follows an integrated approach to quantify the pasture yield and the effects of tree clearing on pasture species composition, soil properties (organic carbon, available N (NO3-) pH(w) and microbial biomass (C and N)), and litter production over time-since-clearing on a grazing property in central Queensland, and to evaluate the implications of our findings for the region. The cleared pasture systems were taken at < 5, 11-13 and > 33 year age of clearing in comparison to their paired uncleared pastures for three major tree communities representative of the region: Eucalyptus populnea, Eucalyptus melanophloia and Acacia harpophylla. The paper evaluates the effects of clearing on individual attributes as well as an integrated effect of these attributes, i.e. overall ecological services. Pasture production generally increased with clearing but plant diversity, litter production and potential return of N and P through litter decreased. Among soil attributes, clearing of trees adversely impacted upon soil pH and microbial biomass, which play an important role in nutrient availability and mineralisation. This, the initial gains in pasture production are not sustainable over time. The multivariate analysis for such ecological attributes suggests that at the > 33 year age of clearing, the ecological state of pasture systems changed compared to that at 5 year or 11-13 year or to the uncleared system. A disturbed pasture system will most likely take longer to revert to the original state compared to the time that would have taken to harvest the benefits. The results are important for landholders and policy makers to comprehend the real gains and losses following tree clearing for pasture development over the long term. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Finding ways of maintaining or increasing crop yields without degrading soil fertility is an important goal in sustaining livelihoods in many parts of the world. In the mid-hills of Nepal, the problem is of particular importance due to the fragility of mountain ecosystems. Previously reported field experiments have investigated the influence of different combinations of inorganic fertilisers and farmyard manure (FYM) on crop yields in maize/millet cropping systems at two sites in this region, Pakhribas and Dordor Gaun, but due to the short-time period involved (three years), long-term trends in crop yields could not be determined, neither could changes in soil carbon and nitrogen levels be measured. In this paper, we describe the use of the PALM simulation model to address these questions, and its parameterisation and validation based on data from the field experiments. Using weather data generated for 100 years at each site, the model was then used to investigate the effect of different nutrient management treatments on long-term trends in crop yields and soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics.
   Overall, crop yields were higher at Pakhribas than Dordor Gaun, due both to the lower temperatures causing slower crop development and hence a longer period of biomass accumulation, and to the higher inherent soil nutrient status causing faster crop growth rates. At both sites, the highest crop yields were obtained in the treatment receiving only inorganic fertiliser at a rate of 90 kg N ha(-1). Declines in soil organic C and N were predicted for all fertiliser and FYM treatments, with the severest rates of loss in the treatment receiving no nutrient inputs at all and the slowest rates of loss in the treatment receiving 7 t ha(-1) of organic manure.
   Economic analysis showed that, at current prices, the use of inorganic fertilisers was by far the most rational option for farmers in terms of net returns, regardless of the site, and despite the associated decline in soil C and N levels. It was estimated that if greater use of organic manure is to be promoted as a way of increasing carbon sequestration in the soil, then farmers in the mid-hills of Nepal will need to be compensated at a rate of at least US$9.90 (t C)(-1) for the lower crop yields they will obtain.

AB Live fences are conspicuous features of agricultural landscapes across Central America but there is remarkably little information about their abundance, distribution, and function. Here we present a detailed analysis of: (1) the abundance, composition, structure and distribution of live fences in four contrasting cattle-producing areas of Costa Rica and Nicaragua; (2) the management of live fences by farmers; and (3) the ecological roles of live fences in providing habitat, resources and connectivity for wildlife. Data on botanical composition and structure are complemented by documentation of local knowledge about live fences and associated management practices, as well as an assessment of fauna that utilize them. Live fences were common, occurring on between 49% and 89% of cattle farms, with an overall mean of 0.14 +/- 0.01 km ha(-1) of farm land and almost 20 fences per farm. They were generally short (164.3 +/- 5.4 m), narrow (3.76 +/- 0.03 m) and densely planted (323.1 +/- 8.6 trees km(-1)), consisting primarily of planted trees. The mean tree species richness for individual fences in each landscape was low (from 1.4 to 7.5 species per fence), but landscape species richness was higher (from 27 to 85 species, with over 70 species in three out of four sites). A total of 161 tree and palm species were recorded in the live fences across the four sites. The abundance, tree species composition and structure of live fences varied across farms and landscapes, reflecting differences in environmental conditions and management strategies. In all landscapes the main productive roles of live fences were to divide pastures and serve as barriers to animal movement, although they were also sources of fodder, firewood, timber and fruit. The main ecological roles were to provide habitats and resources for animal species and structural connectivity of woody habitat across the agricultural landscape. More than 160 species of birds, bats, dung beetles and butterflies were recorded visiting them. Their value for biodiversity conservation depended on their species composition, structural diversity and arrangement within the landscape, all of which were heavily influenced by management currently undertaken by farmers in pursuit of production rather than conservation goals. Live fences are important features of agricultural landscapes that merit much greater attention in sustainable land management strategies and need to be an explicit element in regulations and incentives that aim to enhance the ecological integrity of rural landscapes in Central America.

AB Slash-and-burn land use offsets heavy nitrogen losses both via volatisation and nitrate leaching. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by legume-rhizobia symbiosis is believed to be the main pathway for secondary fallow regrowth to recuperate these losses, thus constituting an important mechanism for maintaining the sustainability of this agro-ecosystem. By contrast, BNF in mature rainforest is believed to be low. However, these assumptions have never been unambiguously verified, since serious methodological constraints make all quantitative BNF estimates in tropical forests questionable. The present study, therefore, pursues indirect evidence on the role of BNF in 2-25 years of secondary forest regrowth and in mature rainforest of central Amazonia, at 100 km to the north and 70 km to the east of the city of Manaus, Brazil. We show BNF to be high throughout secondary regrowth, as opposed to low BNF in mature rainforest. Our main evidence is based on the high vegetation share of legume species capable of BNF in secondary regrowth as opposed to lower shares in mature rainforest. Furthermore, clusters of potentially N-2-fixing legumes in secondary regrowth but not in mature rainforest were associated with low delta N-15-signals of leaf litter and with an above-average vegetation biomass. Positive correlations between the individual plant sizes and foliar delta N-15-signals of potentially N-2-fixing legumes suggest that physiological limitations in the dominating legume tree giants may be one factor responsible for the low BNF in mature rainforest. The role of legume BNF appears quite constant throughout the first 25 years of secondary forest regrowth covered by this study, contrary to previous notions on a BNF maximum in early or mid-succession. Thus, BNF-rates do not provide an adequate criteria for defining minimum or optimum fallow periods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In a heathland pasture in the Montseny Biosphere Reserve and Natural Park (NE Spain) the replacement of traditional burning by shrub harvesting has lead to encroachment on intermixed dry grasslands by Erica scoparia. Permanent in situ quadrats were used at two study sites from Spring 2001 to Spring 2003. Orientation, percentage of bare ground, grass cover, distance from mature plants and morphometry of seedlings were recorded in order to determine their influence on distribution, structure, abundance and seedling survival. Results showed that E. scoparia seedlings grow mainly on the first metres at the edge of the heathland with a clear spatial aggregation pattern. Factors such as the percentage of bare ground, grass cover, distance to the nearest neighbour, age and height of mature plants located at the edge of the heathland influenced the colonizing patterns.
   A higher harvesting frequency at the heathland border and a reduction in grazing pressure on the patches of grassland are proposed as sustainable management strategies to prevent encroachment and conserve the grassland. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nutrient concentrations in plant and soil and their rates of cycling in poplar (Populus deltoides)-based agroforestry systems were studied at Pusa, Bihar, India. The nutrient concentrations in the standing biomass of the crop were more than those in tree, whereas the nutrient contents showed the reverse trend. Soil, litter and vegetation accounted for 80.3-99.5, 0.1-5.0 and 0.4-14.7%, respectively, of the total nutrients in the system. Considerable reduction (40-54%) in concentration of nutrients in leaves occurred during senescence. The uptake of nutrients by vegetation, and also by different components with and without adjustment for internal recycling, were calculated separately. Annual transfer of litter nutrient to the soil by vegetation was 37.3-146.2 N, 5.6-17.9 P and 25.0-66.3 K kg ha(-1) year(-1) in young (3-year-old) and mature (9-year-old) plantations. Turnover rate and time for different nutrients ranged between 0.86-0.99 year(-1) and 1.01-1.16 years, respectively. Compartmental models for nutrient dynamics have been developed to represent the distribution of nutrient contents and net annual fluxes within the system. This study shows that the poplar-based agroforestry system can be sustainable in terms of soil nutrient status.

AB The World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg 2002 (WSSD), highlighted the urgent need for coordinated observations relating to the state of the earth. A meeting of the Heads of State of the Group of 8 Industralized Countries Summit in June 2003 in Evian, France, affirmed the importance of earth observation as a priority activity. The first Earth Observation Summit convening in Washington, DC, in July 2003, was attended by high-level officials from 33 countries and the European Commission and 21 international organizations involved in earth observations. The Group of Earth Observation developed to the Global Earth Observations System of Systems and has been run by its secretariate at WMO in Geneva since May 2005. The GEOSS 10-year implementation plan, together with a reference document, addresses not only cost effectiveness and technical feasibility, but also institutional feasibility. GEOSS is focused on 9 societal benefit areas where allergy is touched in several of these areas. A summary of airborne ambrosia pollen in Switzerland shows the necessity of boarder crossing of environmental observations because national networks can hardly detect, for example, invasion of new plants and its pollen in a country early enough.

AB On the basis of research conducted in the Ankarana region of northern Madagascar, I discuss the speculating that Malagasy participants in the local sapphire trade do about foreign ecotourists who come to this region. Although some have been promoting international ecotourism in the region as a viable means to a sustainable future for local people and ecosystems, others, including many of the observers discussed here, see the rise of the ecotourist trade and the increasing presence of its clients in Ankarana as signs of foreigners' long-standing interests in Malagasy resources. I argue that to understand the perspectives of these critical observers, it is necessary to appreciate what they take to be obvious about ecotourism and the conservation projects with which they are commonly associated.

ID PREVENTION; HEART; RISK
AB The escalating burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide warrants an urgent public health response. Resource constraints and other factors necessitate an integrated and concerted approach to the range of NCDs. A necessary prerequisite for effective planning, implementation, and evaluation of NCD prevention programs is access to reliable and timely information on mortality, morbidity, risk factors, and their socioeconomic determinants. However, there is limited experience in the setting up of integrated NCD surveillance models in low-resource settings.
   As part of the National Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs in Pakistan, an integrated systematic, and sustainable population-based NCD surveillance system is being established, and will be maintained and expanded over time. This is a common population surveillance mechanism for all NCDs (with the exception of cancer). The model includes population surveillance of main risk factors that predict many NCDs and combines modules on population surveillance of injuries, mental health, and stroke. In addition, the model has been adapted for program evaluation; this will enable it to track implementation processes using appropriate indicators, facilitating an assessment of how interventions work and which components contribute most to success. This paper outlines the first activity in this sequential process, including its merits and limitations.

TI Community health workers as interventionists in the prevention and
   control of heart disease and stroke
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID BLOOD-PRESSURE; HYPERTENSION CARE; INNER-CITY; FOLLOW-UP; URBAN;
   MORTALITY; BARRIERS; PROGRAM; MEN
AB A considerable body of research indicates that community health workers (CHWs) are effective in improving chronic disease care and health outcomes. Much of the focus of cardiovascular research involving CHWs has been on hypertension because of its high prevalence and because it is a major risk factor for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases. Adding CHWs to the patient-provider team has a beneficial effect on the quality of care for populations most in need. CHWs have contributed to significant improvements in community members' access to and continuity of care and adherence to treatment for the control of hypertension. CHWs assume multiple roles, including patient and community education, patient counseling, monitoring patient health status, linking people with health and human services, and enhancing provider patient communication and adherence to care. Current recommendations for CHWs to be interventionists on healthcare teams and in community-based research increase opportunities for CHWs to play an important role in eliminating disparities in heart disease and stroke. Adequate translation of research into clinical practice remains a major challenge, however. Addressing this issue, which has national implications, will require sustainable funding; appropriate reimbursement; enhanced efforts to incorporate CHWs into healthcare teams; better utilization of their skills; improved CHW supervision, training, and career development; policy changes; and ongoing evaluation, including a reporting of costs.

SO ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE

ID HISTORY
AB At some point in time, man has influenced nearly all forests in Western Europe. Most of the original forest cover has been converted to arable land and pastures, or has been cut for the supply of firewood and construction timber. In order to secure a sustainable source of firewood, the structure of the remaining forests was often altered. Especially coppice of European oak became increasingly popular during the Roman era and the Middle Ages. Ring-width series of oak trees from Roman times and Medieval settlements were recorded. In order to extract more detailed information regarding past forest structure and management, those series were compared to growth patterns of contemporary oak. The modern oaks were selected on forests sites in Flanders (northern Belgium) with well-known structure and management. Some remarkable similarities in growth patterns were observed. These findings yield tentative assumptions regarding past forest structure and management.

TI The efficiency of Swedish regional policy
SO ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, I evaluate the efficiency of Swedish regional policy. I analyze the government's regional policy goals and means as presented in Government Bills 1997/1998:62 and 2001/2002:4. In the light of the literature on where growth occurs as well as the results of the regional policy so far, the realism of the government's goal of "sustainable economic growth in the whole country" could be questioned. Subsidies to companies in problematic regions have uncertain or even negative effects. The government could therefore eliminate these subsidies and replace them with venture capital loans. It could also stop its subsidies to municipal housing companies for shutting down apartments. The positive effects of the government's tax and subsidy system for the municipalities, motivated by its distribution goal, come at the price of negative effects on incentives for a high national rate of growth. The government could replace this system with extended general subsidies. Investments in transportation projects that do not show a net benefit, such as the large Bothnia Railway in northern Sweden should be reconsidered. However, I find significant and systematic evidence that the government's investments in regional colleges, particularly in research, have been successful.

AB Are we failing to acknowledge the impact of global changes (e.g. UVB, invasive species, climate, land use, atmosphere) on the terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem processes of Antarctica? Antarctica is considered a pristine environment and has low terrestrial species diversity and trophic complexity, and yet while scientifically possible, we still do not know the number of species, where they are, or how their influence on ecosystem processes (e.g. nutrient cycling, carbon flux, decomposition, feedbacks to climate, hydrology) will be affected by multiple global changes. Increased recognition of human dependence on services provided by biodiversity and ecosystem functioning combined with documented impacts of global change already occurring on Antarctic soil ecosystems, increases the urgency to expand investigations regionally in Antarctica. We cannot measure the effects of global change or sustainably manage Antarctica's future if we underestimate the contribution of soil communities. Evidence indicates habitats of rocky moraines, soils and cyroconite holes of glaciers in the continental interior may host not only microbes, but also a complexity of algae and invertebrates. Scientists of many disciplines, together, need to assess the benefits humans derive from Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem processes, how these will be affected by global change, and link their findings to the rest of the world.

AB Water reclamation and reuse is playing an increasingly important role in sustainable water resources management. But is water reuse sustainable? To be sustainable, a water reuse project must serve its long-term functional roles without shifting environmental burdens to future generations or producing adverse socio-economic effects. In this paper, we review sustainability assessment methods to aid decision makers in comparing alternative systems, improving environmental performance, and tracking progress toward sustainability. We discuss concerns regarding long-term environmental effects of water reuse systems, including energy demands, impacts on irrigated land, and accumulation and health effects of trace contaminants. We also suggest socio-economic considerations that are key to maintaining long-term benefits of water reuse systems.

SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

DT Article

   pollution control; sustainable water use; groundwater modeling
AB Lack of water management in the Sana'a Basin in Yemen has led to mining of groundwater and massive groundwater quality deterioration. In the last four years, management of waste water has changed dramatically and entire city neighborhoods have been connected to a conventional sewer system. In this paper, the effects of this measure on long-term groundwater quality development of the aquifers underlying Sana'a and, more specifically, on water quality of the public supply peri-urban wellfields are analyzed. The results, obtained with a transient groundwater model, indicated that by 2020 the construction of the sewerage will have considerably reduced the area polluted by groundwater, but the process is slow. Furthermore, construction of the sewerage will hardly affect the groundwater quality of the wellfields, since flow is not directed towards most of the production wells. The Yemeni authorities should realize that less expensive sanitation alternatives are available, but they need user participation, which, in turn, would raise public awareness that water supplies and sanitation are not to be seen as solely a government responsibility.

DE St Lucia; environmentalism; participatory planning; metayage; social

ID SPACE
AB In this paper I seek to highlight some differences between elite systems of participatory planning, on the one hand, and class-driven social transformation in St Lucia, on the other. In doing so, I refer to two periods in time in St Lucia's history. The first is between 1840 and 1957, when the agricultural system of metayage dominated. This example will be used to illustrate a period of time when social transformation was driven by the peasant classes, acting against the power of the plantocracy, giving the peasant class greater control over the means of agricultural production and land. The second period of time I focus upon is the post-independence period, after 1979, when participatory planning techniques are used by a narrow group of environmentalist elites in order to attempt to implement their vision for sustainable development. The difference illustrates the substantial material and social aspirations within the population, on the one hand, and the narrow concerns of a group of elites on the other.

AB The full potential of discussion groups to further geographic interest in the relationship between discourse, individual and society can still be developed further. This paper briefly reviews previous applications of discussion group methodologies before suggesting a new discourse-centred approach that explores how broad social discourses impact everyday conversations. The approach is demonstrated through a case study involving supporters of environmental movements in Australia. It is concluded that small groups can be used in new ways that provide important methodologically unique insights into the reception of transient, but powerful, discourses upon everyday lives.

AB During the past 27 years, China's economy and relationship with the outside world has been transformed. The magnitude of annual economic growth and rapid increase in the volume of output of goods and services raise unsettling questions about potential threats to the sustainability of current growth levels and implications for economic and political stability. This paper examines the sources of economic growth and concludes the strong state system, high rates of saving and investment and demographic structure will sustain growth. Chinese authorities must be aware that a failure to maintain the process of financial and political institutional reform or to address the widening regional income inequalities poses potential domestic threats to sustainable growth. Tensions remain in China's international relationships, forcing China to consider further adjustment and accommodation in its regional security and economic relationships.

AB Rodents are an important food source for villagers near the Lama forest reserve, located in the south of Benin between 6 degrees 55-7 degrees 00N and 2 degrees 04-2 degrees 12 E. This stud), was designed to look at the consumption of rodents as a food source combined with a survey of rodents sold in markets. Data was collected oil : rodents species consumed, frequencies of consumption and food preferences. Some animals were captured in order to confirm the species. Rodents were a major part of diet included 10 species : grasscutler (Thryonomys swinderianus), giant rats (Cricetomys gambianus), Gambian Sun-squirrel (Heliosciurus gambianus), crested porcupine (Hystrix cristala), ground squirrel (Xerus erythropus), grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus), slender gerbil (Taterillus gracilis), Kempi's gerbil (Tatera kempii), multimammate rats (Mastomys spp.) and grass mouse (Lemniscomys striatus venustus). On average, young people and children consumed rodents 6 times per person per month. The preferences of local populations were grasscutter and giant rats which were sold in local markets at relatively high prices US$8-10 and US$2-4 respectively. It is important to conduct further Studies to look at the impact of this hunting on the rodent populations and to ensure Sustainable harvesting.

DE rodent management; knowledge; attitudes; practices; Tanzania; Ethiopia
AB A Study was conducted using a structured questionnaire to obtain information about the nature and extent of rodent damage to crops, farmer's perceptions of crop pests and their knowledge, attitudes and practices to their management in Tanzania and Ethiopia. The Study was carried out in Five localities (Makuyu -Central Tanzania; Chunya-Southwest Tanzania; Ziway and Adami Tulu (South of Addis Ababa) and Gumer/Limmo-South-west of Addis Ababa, both in Central Ethiopia). In Tanzania, maize is the major crop, both for food and sale. Other crops are sorghum, rice, simsim, groundnuts and millet. In Central Ethiopia, farmers grow maize, sorghum, teff, beans, barley, wheat, potatoes and enset. The Study showed that farmers in Tanzania and Ethiopia are well aware of rodent problems and considered them to be number one pest. Rodent problems are regular and maize is the most affected crop in Tanzania. In Ethiopia, maize, enset and potatoes are the most affected crops. Maize in Ethiopia and Tanzania is susceptible to rodent damage, most seriously at planting and seedling stage. Although different rodent control techniques are practiced in Tanzania, farmers prefer using rodenticides (68.7%) to other strategies. In Ethiopia, trapping, hunting and rodenticides are the most practised techniques for rodent control. Farmer's attempts to control rodents in both Countries are based oil economic reasons and generally, rodent control is not undertaken when there are no crops in the fields. Farmers are responsible for rodent control activities in their individual fields. The study shows that farmers in Tanzania and Ethiopia are concerned with rodent infestation and are also aware of the critical growth stage when the crops are most susceptible. A lack of multiple rodent management methods and inadequate knowledge of appropriate and sustainable techniques appeared to be the main reasons for the over dependence oil rodenticides, particularly in Tanzania. Therefore, this Suggests that farmers require a strong extension input to manage rodent problems.

AB From 27 to 29 September 2004, the 44(th) annual meeting of the German Society for Economic and Social Sciences in Agriculture (Gesellschaft fur Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften des Landbaues; GEWISOLA) took place at Humboldt University in Berlin. The overall topic of the conference was '' Environmental and Product Quality in Agriculture ''. Protection of the natural environment and food safety are two important aspects of multifunctional agriculture, the guiding principle of the '' new '' European agricultural policy. Quality management strategies, management of the food chain and sustainable production systems were discussed from the perspective of individual economic units. The impact of recent changes in agricultural policy and the design of agri-environmental programs were addressed from a sectoral point of view. In addition to the key topic of the conference, participants also presented topics of their own choice, e.g. contributions on advanced quantitative methods or special problems in transformation countries. For the first time, the best contributions were awarded a prize and presented in the scope of a plenary session.

AB The seed sector situation in Northwest Somalia is critical. The availability of food has decreased and many people are at risk of hunger. Food security can be restored by enhancing the local genetic resources and creating an efficient seed sector. Sorghum is important as a food and fodder crop in this region. It is close to Ethiopia, which is considered as the probable origin and domestication of Sorghum. Twelve morphological and productive characteristics were chosen to assess the phenotypic variability of 16 accessions of sorghum from Northwest Somalia. Univariate (analysis of variance and G test) and multivariate (discriminant and cluster analysis) methods were used to assess the morphological variation within the accession and to group the 16 accessions into clusters based upon quantitative and qualitative characters. Elmi Jama Cas, Masego Cas, Masego Cad and Carabi clearly represent distinct landraces with specific features suitable for different purpose, such as grain and/or forage production. Each landrace tested is able to grow under harsh environmental conditions, thus ensuring a low, but stable production for small poor resources farmers. Knowledge and conservation of local landraces will provide a broad base of genetic variability from which improved sorghum varieties can be developed, thus aiding in the stabilisation of a secure and sustainable food supply for farmers of Northwest Somalia.

AB Sustainable use of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) can be affected by levels of extractions as well as by other anthropogenic influences such as fire and grazing. We examined the effects of fire on the demography of Phyllanthus emblica, an important NTFP in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. We then assessed demographic responses to the combined effects of fire and current fruit harvesting patterns. Fruits of Phyllanthus are commercially harvested by an indigenous forest dwelling people. Using matrix population models, we compared demographic indices across a chronosequence of time since last fire. Population growth rates (lambda) ranged from 0.7692 to 1.1443 across the five times since last fire. lambda was the lowest at times since last fire of 2 and 3 yr. Frequent fires increased time to maturity by altering growth and survival rates, thereby causing a demographic shift from growth to regressions or negative growth. Elasticity analysis revealed that stasis of adults makes the biggest contribution to lambda. Simulations of periodic and stochastic fire regimes suggest that higher lambda and population persistence can be achieved at fire-return intervals of >= 7 and >= 9 yr, respectively. These fire-return intervals became longer when the simulations included harvesting and fire. Extinction probabilities under the current fire regimes (every 2-3 yr) suggest that populations will decline to lower densities. Our findings provide critical information for developing guidelines for sustainable use and management of NTFPs in Biligiri Rangan Hills, and demonstrate the need to incorporate various human-generated physical regimes in assessing sustainability of NTFPs.

AB Subsistence hunting practiced by poor rural and indigenous people in Latin America differentially affects the three species of peccaries (Artiodactyla: Tayassuidae). Sustainability of subsistence hunting of peccaries in the Argentine semi-arid Chaco, where the three species coexist, was unknown. My objectives were to determine the importance of peccaries for the local people, describe the current pattern of hunting and its impact on the three species of peccary and identify the factors that affect hunting sustainability. I found that many rural (70%) and village people (40%) consumed peccaries. White-lipped and chacoan peccaries were more susceptible to overharvesting than collared peccary. Current rates of hunting of white-lipped and chacoan peccaries are likely not sustainable because: (a) density of both species was between two to three times higher inside a protected area than outside; (b) populations have declined near larger villages and in older settlements; (c) herds sizes were small in comparison with other regions; (d) large number of juveniles less than one year old were harvested; (e) hunting did not discriminate based on sex or reproductive status and (f) The unified harvest model indicated unsustainable harvest because more than 40% of the reproductive production was taken and populations densities were less than 60% carrying capacities. In contrast, harvest of collared peccary seems sustainable at the current rates of hunting by rural peasants. Other threats such as forest exploitation, however, are accelerating, and are likely to reduce sustainability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The dehesa (oak woodland) is an extensive agro-pastoral ecosystem characteristic of the Western Mediterranean countries which is suffering a great transformation process since 1950. Although its distribution largely overlaps with several endangered species, there is scarce information on how they use this human-transformed habitat. We studied the foraging habitat selection of one of them, the cinereous vulture Aegypius monachus. We radio-tracked 14 cinereous vultures in one of the largest European colonies from 1998 to 2000. Used and available habitats were compared at two scales using compositional analysis. Moreover, we developed a distance-based GLMM for assessing habitat selection in this central-place forager species, by taking into account the spatial distribution of habitat patches in relation to the location of the colony. Home ranges overlapped over a total surface of 592,527 ha around the colony, and both individual home ranges and travel foraging distances (mean 27.86 km, maximum 86 km) were larger during the breeding season. All cinereous vultures avoided agricultural lands within their home ranges throughout the year. Habitat use in relation to the distance to the colony pointed out that dehesas were positively selected in spite of being on average far away from the colony than other habitats, a result that was consistent among individuals and seasons. The cinereous vulture thus depends for its conservation not only on the protection of breeding areas, as has been so far considered, but also on the maintenance of well-conserved dehesas close to the colonies. Preserving the cinereous vultures could contribute to the economic sustainability of dehesas by attracting PAC funds for their traditional low-intensity exploitation. Although other species may also benefit from this study since cinereous vulture could be a "flagship" for the large-scale conservation of Mediterranean oak woodlands and associated biodiversity, more fine local management guidelines should be performed on the basis of studies on more sensitive species.

AB The topic of ecological, practical, and political considerations in the selection of weed targets for biological control has been widely discussed during the past two decades, mostly from the perspective of insect herbivores. For conceptual and practical purposes, plant pathogens have been treated in these discussions as if they are a subset of inoculative biocontrol agents, with little said about the inherent differences between pathogens and insects as biocontrol agents or the selection of weed targets for control by the inundative. bioherbicide strategy. Herein, I attempt to address the question of what makes a good biological control target for plant pathogens used as inoculative as well as inundative agents, basing my analysis on examples from the past three decades. Despite the small number of examples available for this analysis, the following generalizations can be made: (1) Weeds with robust capacity for vegetative regeneration are more difficult to control with pathogens than those that lack this trait. (2) A plant's growth habit is not a reliable guide for target selection; weeds that have been successfully controlled include annual and biennial herbs, perennial shrubs, perennial vines.. and trees.. while numerous failures have been reported irrespective of the target's growth habit or reproductive mode. (3) It is more challenging to control species with genetic heterogeneity and capacity for introgression than genetically homogeneous and reproductively conserved species. (4) Matching the target host's susceptibility with the candidate pathogen's virulence is of utmost importance for biocontrol success since host-pathogen interactions at the species and subspecies levels are often governed by single-gene differences (e.g., varietal specificity). (5) Practical and political considerations are central to the selection of targets for control with pathogens. (6) Demand from influential stakeholders for control and/or for a nonchemical or economically sustainable control typically drives the initiative as well as the continuance of biocontrol projects to their completion. (7) In the case of inundative, bioherbicide agents, the continuity and ultimate implementation of a project will be dictated by the prospects of economic returns from developing and using a pathogen. (8) The stakeholders' perceptions of the effectiveness of a biocontrol program call be unpredictable, leading to conflicting views of "success." In the final analysis, a good weed target for control by a pathogen is one that has strong stakeholder backing and the list of available pathogens for the target suggests a possibility of acceptable control at a cost that is competitive with those of other control options. While this conclusion is also applicable to target selection for insect biocontrol agents, it is more relevant for pathogens because of limited funding and personnel available for development of pathogens and the added cost and technological complexity of implementing bioherbicides compared to classical biocontrols.

ID MARINE RESERVES; FISHERIES; EXPLOITATION; FISH
AB Inland waters have received only slight consideration in recent discussions of the global fisheries crisis, even though inland fisheries provide much-needed protein, jobs, and income, especially in poor rural communities of developing countries. Systematic overfishing of fresh waters is largely unrecognized because of weak reporting and because fishery declines take place within a complex of other pressures. Moreover, the ecosystem consequences of changes to the species, size, and trophic composition of fish assemblages are poorly understood. These complexities underlie the paradox that over exploitation of a fishery may not be marked by declines in total yield, even when individual species and long-term sustainability are highly threatened. Indeed,one of the symptoms of intense fishing in inland waters is the collapse of particular stocks even as overall fish production rises-a biodiversity crisis more than a fisheries crisis.

AB Our understanding of the human and biophysical dimensions of tropical (fry forest change and its cumulative effects is still in the earl), stages of academic discovery. The papers in this special section on Neotropical dry forests cover a wide range of sites and problems ranging from the use of multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing platforms to the impact of hurricanes on tropical dry forest regeneration. Here, we present to the Scientific Community the results of a workshop on which research priorities For tropical dry forests were discussed. This (discussion Focuses on the need to develop linkages between remote sensing, ecological, and social science research. The incorporation of social sciences into ecological research Could contribute dramatically to Our understandings of tropical dry forests by providing important contextual information to ecologists, and by helping to develop an important science-policy-public nexus on which environmental management can succeed.

AB Tropical dry forests are located predominantly in the northern portion of Venezuela, above 6 degrees N. Although their potential extent covers ca 400,000 km(2) (44% of the land), they currently occupy about 10 percent of this area. The diversity and complexity of Venezuelan dry forests increases from north to south along a gradient of decreasing severity of the dry season. A typical dry forest in Venezuela presents ca 110-170 species of plants front ca 40 to 50 families with in an area of approximately 10 ha. Species composition and forest structure, however, are dependent oil local landscape conditions (e.g., soil type, topography), and nearby forest types call be very different. Our analysis of five dry forest variants showed a maximum family similarity of 67 percent, although most values fell in the 50-60 percent interval. They are currently considered as one of venezuelas most threatened ecosystems, but only 5 percent of extant dry forests are included in protected areas; this represents 0.5 percent of their potential extent. It is fundamental to promote the creation of at least 3 or 4 more large protected areas (ca 5000 ha), with different climatic and orographic characteristics, in combination with the recovery of threatened species, the restoration of degraded systems, and the implementation of sustainable development projects. Their apparent high resilience suggests Chat with the proper management we call restore and maintain the integrity of Venezuelan dry forests.

AB Sediment-rich rivers seasonally flood central Amazonian varzea forests, leading to periodic anoxic conditions in the rhizosphere and requiring morphological and structural adaptations, such as aboveground root systems. We investigated some possible relationships between root types and environmental factors in forest plots covering 3.1 ha of varzea in the Maruiraua Sustainable Development Reserve, Brazil. Digital elevation models of the Study sites were obtained; sedimentation and soil texture were investigated to check relationship between position of trees on the flood gradient, soil conditions, and aboveground root systems. Different types of aboveground roots were closely related to flooding duration and habitat dynamics. Species Subjected to higher and more prolonged floods tended to produce more aboveground roots than Species Subjected to lower and shorter inundations. Plank-buttressing species increased with decreasing flood height and/or flood duration, and with increasing growth height and basal area. Habitats inundated for long periods were dominated by species with low growth heights and low basal areas, which formed stilt roots and aerial roots. Root system and sediment deposition showed a close relationship, plank buttressing being more common in sites subjected to lower sediment rates. In the disturbed sites close to the main river channel colonized by pioneer species, the occurrence of buttresses was lower than in less disturbed climax stages. No clear relationship was found between root systems and sediment grain sizes.

AB Breast cancer represents 10% of the global cancer burden and there is no population, or population sub-group, which has yet been identified to be at a truly low risk of developing the disease. Mortality rates have been steadily growing for nearly a century in many countries and it is only during the past decade that there have been signs of a sustainable decrease in mortality rates in a number of western-lifestyle countries. This represents considerable progress in breast cancer control and, although different factors contribute to different degrees in different countries, is mainly due to increased breast awareness, earlier detection and the delivery of the most appropriate therapy to women with the disease. The failure to prevent the incidence from continuing to rise represents to a great extent the failure to understand the precise mechanisms of breast carcinogenesis and the rote of risk determinants whose alteration in society could lead to a reduced risk of developing the disease. The declines seen in mortality represent a considerable success, but there is no room for complacency until research can impact positively on reducing incidence. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI The ways that people talk about natural resources: Discursive strategies
   as barriers to environmentally sustainable practices
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY

DT Article
ID EXTREME CASE FORMULATIONS; SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONISM; ENERGY-CONSERVATION;
   AUSTRALIANS; KNOWLEDGE; POLITICS; BEHAVIOR
AB In this paper, we analyse talk about water and energy use taken from nine interviews with citizens of Perth, Western Australia. Participants' talk offered representations of water as a scarce, shared, natural resource that must not be wasted, whereas talk about energy use focused on the environmental impacts of different technologies for generating electricity, rather than on energy as a consumable resource. Participants accounted for their water-use habits by positioning themselves as caught between a personal desire to conserve water and an (incompatible) social obligation to maintain the appearance of their gardens in keeping with the aesthetic appeal of the suburbs in which they lived. We identify several discursive strategies by which people construct the environmental impact of their actions as minimal or unavoidable. These constitute a barrier to the promotion of more environmentally sustainable practices. Potential implications for environmental policy development are discussed, as are the wider issues associated with the development of 'applied' discourse analysis.

AB Although vector control has proven highly effective in preventing disease transmission, it is not being used to its full potential, thereby depriving disadvantaged populations of the benefits of well tried and tested methods. Following the discovery of synthetic residual insecticides in the 1940s, large-scale programmes succeeded in bringing many of the important vector-borne diseases under control. By the late 1960s, most vector-borne diseases - with the exception of malaria in Africa - were no longer considered to be of primary public health importance. The result was that control programmes lapsed, resources dwindled, and specialists in vector control disappeared from public health units, within two decades, many important vector-borne diseases had re-emerged or spread to new areas. The time has come to restore vector control to its key role in the prevention of disease transmission, albeit with an increased emphasis on multiple measures, whether pesticide-based or involving environmental modification, and with a strengthened managerial and operational capacity. Integrated vector management provides a sound conceptual framework for deployment of cost-effective and sustainable methods of vector control. This approach allows for full consideration of the complex determinants of disease transmission, including local disease ecology, the role of human activity in increasing risks of disease transmission, and the socioeconomic conditions of affected communities.

AB When is it better to retrofit a building as opposed to demolishing and rebuilding it? Life cycle environmental and economic analyses are used to address this question through the study of a typical four bedroom detached house in Toronto. Three vintages of the reference house are used: 1930s solid masonry; 1960s wood frame; and post oil crisis, 1980s wood frame. Retrofit studies considered include insulating the attic and basement walls and air leakage sealing. Over a 40-year life cycle, the rebuild option has lower life cycle energy, global warming potential, and air pollution, which are predominantly associated with building operation. But the retrofit options have lower water pollution, solid waste generation, and weighted resource use, associated with material flows. The retrofit options also have lower life cycle economic costs than rebuilding. In this respect, the preferred options are basement plus air leakage sealing retrofit for the 1930s house, basement retrofit for the 1960s house, and no change for 1980s house. There are ways to overcome the trade-off in negative environmental impacts between retrofitting and rebuilding, such as use of renewable energy sources or re-use and recycling of deconstruction and demolition materials in new construction.

AB Currently, there is a "divide" between cancer suivivorship initiatives and minority participation. The level of participation is nearly nonexistent in many cancer support and control initiatives. Cancer survivorship resources that facilitate access to treatment, psychosocial interventions, clinical trials, and research are key components to eliminating this divide. Differences in cancer results among minority populations are caused by several factors, including biologic reactions to environmental activities, socioeconomic status, perceived beliefs and notions of medical professionals, a lack of resources to participate in cancer support groups, and having personal contact with cancer survivors. Health professionals, advocates, and researchers hold the key to opening more opportunities for the improvement of cancer survivorship among minorities. The belief that "one size fits all" is unrealistic. These beliefs can influence participation in innovative clinical trials, decisions about treatment, emotional responses, and social support relationships. help ensure participation in these programs, researchers and health workers must understand the role of social and psychosocial implications and results of the strategies, and sustainability that must be included in the develop-stage of any cancer support and survivorship initiatives. For this article, the examined mechanisms that can be used by cancer-control researchers and staff to limit the divide between cancer survivorship initiatives and participation. They identified three strategies that must be used to address this divide effectively: the inclusion of minorities in clinical trials, intervention studies, treatment, and research programs; the development of culturally environments; and the ability to sustain minority participation. In summary, cancer survivorship includes many components that are developed individually and collectively to formulate sound strategies for including minorities in initiatives. These programs should go beyond basic support groups should include research Studies, clinical trials, and alternative treatments for cancer survival rates and quality of life among minorities. The divide be addressed only through a proactive initiative that brings cancer survivor-ship initiatives and minority communities together in full partnership.

AB We previously reported elevated cytosolic calcium levels in tobacco cells in response to elicitors [D. Lecourieux, C. Mazars, N. Pauly, R. Ranjeva, A. Pugin, Analysis and effects of cytosolic free calcium elevations in response to elicitors in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia cells, Plant Cell 14 (2002) 2627-2641]. These data suggested that in response to elicitors, Ca2+, as a second messenger, was involved in both systemic acquired resistance (RSA) and/or hypersensitive response (HR) depending on calcium signature. Here, we used transformed tobacco cells with apoaequorin expressed in the nucleus to monitor changes in free nuclear calcium concentrations ([Ca2+](nuc))in response to elicitors. Two types of elicitors are compared: proteins leading to necrosis including four elicitins and harpin, and non-necrotic elicitors including flagellin (flg22) and two oligosaccharidic elicitors, namely the oligogalacturonides (OGs) and the beta- 1,3-glucan laminarin. Our data indicate that the proteinaceous elicitors induced a pronounced and sustainable [Ca2+](nuc) elevation, relative to the small effects of oligosaccharidic elicitors. This [Ca2+](nuc), elevation, which seems insufficient to induce cell death, is unlikely to result directly from the diffusion of calcium from the cytosol. The [Ca2+](nuc) rise depends on free cytosolic calcium, IP3, and active oxygen species (AOS) but is independent of nitric oxide. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mechanochemistry offers a wide spectrum of possible applications. The standard preparation methods of solid state chemistry often require high temperatures or pressures, well defined gas atmospheres or special reactants' conditions. In the mechanochemical process not more than an adequately powerful ball mill with accessories is required. With this method, a lot of chemical reactions can be carried out via a non-thermal, sustainable reaction pathway.

DE Wuxi; urban evolvement; urban spatial structure
ID AGRICULTURAL LAND
AB With the quick development of urbanization, urban expansion has been paid more and more attention to by researchers from western countries and China. Here Wuxi City of China is selected as a case study. Located in the core-area of Changjiang (Yangtze) River Delta, as the sources of Chinese township enterprise, Wu culture, and national industry, Wuxi has experienced great change in the urban spatial structure, especially in the land use structure, and urban shape and scale. The ratio of industrial land was about one-third of the construction land in 2003. Residential and public infrastructure land had decreased a little from 1956 to 2003, but it remains to be the main construction land at present. Green land has increased at the highest speed due to the demand of sustainable development. After the reform and opening to the outside world, this kind of evolvement of urban spatial expansion is helpful for sustainable development. Economic development, transportation, and administrative planning are the main reasons for these changes. During different periods, the main drives are different. Economic development is the basic factor that influences urban expansion. Transportation influences urban evolvement in different times, but now the importance is not as great as 30 years ago, because administrative force plays an important function in urban planning of China and influences urban evolvement.

AB By the use of the software of ARCGIS, dynamic changes of the landscape elements, landscape structure, conversion processes of the landscape gradients and the responses of wetland eco-security to land use/cover changes (LUCC) in the western Jilin Province were studied from 1930 to 2000. The results show that the landscape elements of grassland, wetland, forestland and water area shrank rapidly, and wetlands underwent huge losses in the study period due to the conversion from wetland into arable land and grassland in large quantities. The responses of wetland eco-security to LUCC were inverse evolvement of wetland vegetation, loss of biodiversity, water deficiency in wetland ecosystem, the changes of the heterogeneity of wetlands and the fragmentation of the wetland habitats. Suggestions were given for protection of wetlands and the regional sustainable development.

AB Chaohu Lake, located in the central Anhui Province, is one of the five largest fresh lakes in China. Now it is one of the three most eutrophication lakes in China. The deterioration of its water quality has influenced the sustainable development of society, economy and environment of Hefei City, the capital of Anhui Province. A series of measures have been carried out to control its eutrophication, but it is still serious. On the basis of the lake water quality data from 1984 to 2003, the causes of the eutrophication of Chaohu Lake are analyzed. Studies indicated that the suitable natural conditions and human activities played a crucial role in the process of the eutrophication of Chaohu Lake. A great amount of industrial, agricultural and domestic sewage discharged into the lake is the main cause of eutrophication in the lake. Land use, soil erosion and shoreline collapse destroyed the watershed eco-environment and the terrestrial ecosystem of Chaohu Lake. And the building of Yuxi Gate extends the sluggish of the nutritious substance and speeds up the process of the eutrophication. From the view of systematic engineering and watershed ecology, a series of the countermeasures have been put forward to control the eutrophication.

AB Surface sink is a main geological calamity of gold mining areas and a main factor to restrict economic sustainable development of minilig zone. Based on former investigations, this article draws the environment information of surface sink of exploration vacancy in gold mining area of Zhaoyuan City, Shangdong Province by RS technology. Through spatial simulation analysis and expert diagnoses on the basis of GIS technology, the article affirms the inducement factors of the surface sink. Then using these factors as distinguishing ones the authors prognosticate the criticality of other exploration vacancies. The results indicate that the surface sink area of study area in Zhaoyuan City, has already come to 0.78km(2) and it is forecasted that 0.97km(2) of the exploration vacancy belongs to high danger area. Decisive measures need taking in order to prevent this crucial problem. Another 1.57km(2) of the exploration vacancies belongs to middle danger area, which will sink when meeting some inducing factors, such as earthquake. Still another 1.53km(2) of the exploration vacancies belongs to low danger area that can not lead to surface sink when meeting common inducing factors.

AB There is a noticeable increase in pinhole corrosion in copper plumbing pipes. Home is the most valuable asset for the majority of homeowners. The possibility of falling home value and health concerns have caused considerable anxiety among affected homeowners. There is a need for a decision tool that can determine whether to continue repair or to replace the system. In this article, a model capable of replicating time-dependent failure rate is proposed to generate synthetic sequences of leak arrivals. An economically sustainable optimality criterion is exploited to designate optimal replacement time of the plumbing system. The analysis is applied to a real system.

AB We explored the interaction of science and society in attempts to restore impaired marine ecosystems in Channel Islands National Park and National Marine Sanctuary California. Deteriorating resource conditions triggered a community's desire to change public policy Channel islands National Park, one of 40 marine protected areas in the US. National Park System, was proclaimed a national monument in 19.38 and expanded substantially in 1980 by an act of Congress. Collapse of marine life populations and loss of 80% of the giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forests in the park between 1980 and 1998 showed that habitat and water quality protection alone bad not secured sustainable ocean ecosystems or fisheries. The failed fishery management strategies and practices prompted formal community and agency requests in 1998 for a network of reserves protected from direct fishing impacts to serve as marine recovery areas. A 2-year attempt to build a community consensus based on science for a reserve network successfully identified recovery goals for fisheries, biodiversity, education, economics, and heritage values. Nevertheless, the community group failed to garner unanimous support for a specific reserve network to achieve those common goals. The group submitted a recommendation, supported by 14 of 16 members, to state and federal authorities in 2001 for action in their respective jurisdictions. California adopted the half of the network in state waters in 2003. This process exposed the socioeconomic factors involved in the design of marine protected areas that can be negotiated successfully among groups of people and factors determined by nature that cannot be negotiated. Understanding the differences among the factors was crucial in reaching consensus and changing public policy.

AB There is growing interest among conservation decision markers in promoting harvesting of forest products as an incentive for communities to retain forest coven Assessments of the sustainability of existing harvests arc, essential for implementing such policies. Madagascars endemic freshwater crayfish, Astacoides spp., are harvested throughout Their range. Despite their importance to human communities, Madagascar's crayfish, like much of the island's freshwater biodiversity are poorly known, and there is concern that the harvest may be unsustainable. We investigated sustainability of the crayfish harvest in and around Ranomafana National Park in eastern Madagascar, focusing on the heavily harvested. A. granulimanus. Several villages around the park, have traditional taboos against-selling crayfish, resulting tit widely varying levels of crayfish exploitation. We used two approaches to assess sustainability of the harvest First we used participatory mapping combined with a geographic information system analysis to produce a spatially accurate map of harvesting intensity. We then carried out mark-and-recapture sampling at 74 sites across a range of harvest intensities to test whether the level of harvesting wets a significant predictor of crayfish density and structure. Second, we used size-structured matrix population models to estimate the forest area necessary to provide the observed annual harvest from one harvesting village and compared this estimate with the area available to the harvester,,;. Our findings show that the crayfish harvest in Ranomafana may be sustainable under current socioeconomic conditions, suggesting that A. granulimanus is less vulnerable to overexploitation. than previously thought We emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to assessing sustainability involving both ecological information about the harvested species and socioeconomic data about The level and spatial pattern of the harvest.

AB We evaluated the utility of combining metapopulation models with landscape-level forest-dynamics models to assess the sustainability of forest management practices. We used the Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) in the boreal forests of northern Ontario as a case study. We selected the Brown Creeper as a potential indicator of sustainability because it is relatively common in the region but is dependent on snags and old trees for nesting and foraging; hence, it may be sensitive to timber harvesting. For the modeling we used RAMAS Landscape, a software package that integrates RAMAS GIS, population-modeling software, and LANDIS, forest-dynamics modeling software. Predictions about the future floristic composition and structure of the landscape tinder a variety of management and natural disturbance scenarios were derived using LANDIS. We modeled eight alternative forest management scenarios, ranging in intensity from no timber harvesting and a natural fire regime to intensive timber harvesting with salvage logging after fire. We predicted the response of The Brown Creeper metapopulation over a 160-year period and used future population size and expected minimum population size to compare the sustainability of the various management scenarios. The modeling methods were easy to apply and model predictions were sensitive to the differences among management scenarios, indicating that these methods may be useful for assessing and ranking the sustainability of forest management options. Primary concerns about the method are the practical difficulties associated with incorporating fire stochasticity in prediction uncertainty and the number of model assumptions that must be made and tested with sensitivity analysis. We wrote new software to bell) quantify the contribution of landscape stochasticity to model prediction uncertainty.

AB Conservation management is becoming increasingly resource intensive as threats to biodiversity grow through habitat destruction, habitat disturbance, and overexploitation. To achieve successful conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, we need to scientifically evaluate the effectiveness of conservation interventions and provide an efficient framework through which scientific evidence can be used to support decision making it? policy and practice. We conducted the first formal assessment of the extent to which scientific evidence is used in conservation management through a questionnaire survey and follow-up interviews of compilers of protected-area management plans from major conservation organizations within the United Kingdom and Australia. Our survey results show that scientific information is not being used systematically to support decision making largely because it is not easily accessible to decision makers. This, in combination with limited monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness of management interventions, results in the majority of decisions being based on experience rather than on evidence. To address this problem we propose using an evidence-based framework, adapted from that used in The health services and explain how we are currently putting an equivalent framework into practice by establishing review and dissemination Units to serve The conservation sector.

AB Tropical marine ornamentals comprise an increasingly important fishery worldwide. Although the potential for overexploitation of marine ornamentals is great, few studies have addressed the population-level impacts of ornamental exploitation and few ornamental fisheries are managed. Analysis of catch records obtained from collectors over a four-month period in the vicinity of Cebu, Philippines, showed that anemonefish and anemones comprised close to 60% of the total catch. Underwater visual census surveys revealed that both anemone and anemonefish densities were significantly lower in exploited areas than in protected areas. The low density of anemones on exploited reefs accounted for over 80% of the reduced density of anemonefish at those sites. There were similar numbers of anemonefish per unit area of anemone in protected and exploited sites; however, biomass of anemonefish per unit area of anemone was lower in exploited areas. Reduction of anemone removals is recommended to support the sustainable harvest of anemonefish from this region.

   DEATHS; RATES
AB Introduction It is unknown whether the reported short-term reduction in cardiac arrests associated with the introduction of the medical emergency team ( MET) system can be sustained.
   Method We conducted a prospective, controlled before-and-after examination of the effect of a MET system on the long-term incidence of cardiac arrests. We included consecutive patients admitted during three study periods: before the introduction of the MET; during the education phase preceding the implementation of the MET; and a period of four years from the implementation of the MET system. Cardiac arrests were identified from a log book of cardiac arrest calls and cross-referenced with case report forms and the intensive care unit admissions database. We measured the number of hospital admissions and MET reviews during each period, performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of mortality following cardiac arrest and studied the correlation between the rate of MET calls with the rate of cardiac arrests.
   Results Before the introduction of the MET system there were 66 cardiac arrests and 16,246 admissions (4.06 cardiac arrests per 1,000 admissions). During the education period, the incidence of cardiac arrests decreased to 2.45 per 1,000 admissions ( odds ratio ( OR) for cardiac arrest 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43 - 0.86; p = 0.004). After the implementation of the MET system, the incidence of cardiac arrests further decreased to 1.90 per 1,000 admissions ( OR for cardiac arrest 0.47; 95% CI 0.35 - 0.62; p < 0.0001). There was an inverse correlation between the number of MET calls in each calendar year and the number of cardiac arrests for the same year (r(2) = 0.84; p = 0.01), with 17 MET calls being associated with one less cardiac arrest. Male gender ( OR 2.88; 95% CI 1.34 - 6.19) and an initial rhythm of either asystole ( OR 7.58; 95% CI 3.15 - 18.25; p < 0.0001) or pulseless electrical activity ( OR 4.09; 95% CI 1.59 - 10.51; p = 0.003) predicted an increased risk of death.
   Conclusion Introduction of a MET system into a teaching hospital was associated with a sustained and progressive reduction in cardiac arrests over a four year period. Our findings show sustainability and suggest that, for every 17 MET calls, one cardiac arrest might be prevented.

AB Aims: To study the long-term (1- and 2-year) effect of a lifestyle intervention on non-diabetic first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients, i.e., the 1-year effect of diet versus diet and exercise in relation to a control group and the 2-year sustainability of these treatment effects.
   Method: Seventy-seven healthy first-degree relatives (men and women) between the ages of 25 and 55 were allocated to one of three groups: diet group (D), diet and exercise group (DE) and control group (C). For ethical reasons, after I year the control group began the intervention and were followed for another 2 years. Diet and physical activity counselling was based on current nutrition recommendations, including increased intake of fatty fish and low glycaemic index foods. The fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane was studied as an objective measure of dietary change. Assessments included fasting insulin, 2-h insulin, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), anthropometry and blood lipid measurements. Groups D and DE received intensive follow-up through unannounced telephone interviews during the first 4 months.
   Results: Dietary changes were significant at I year, and to a large degree sustained at 2 years. Adherence to advice regarding fat quality was confirmed through changes in the fatty acid composition of the erythrocyte membrane. The least active subjects in DE increased their physical activity (PA). At I year, group D showed a reduction in the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol (p = 0.028) while group DE decreased their body weight by 2.7% (p < 0.029) and increased HDL (p < 0.037) versus controls. At 2 years, cholesterol levels (total, LDL and the ratio LDL/HDL) were reduced within group D and when compared to DE (p = 0.022, 0.009, 0.035, respectively). Fasting insulin was reduced within group DE and when compared to group D (p = 0.025).
   Conclusions: Positive changes in lifestyle, blood lipids and fasting insulin can be achieved and maintained in a non-diabetic population at risk of type 2 diabetes after 2 years. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID UNITED-STATES; SUBURBANIZATION; TRANSPORT; MOBILITY; CITIES; ENERGY
AB One of the most controversial ideas in the debate on urban sustainability is that urban sprawl causes problems of ecological stress. This widespread assumption has been tested by measuring the ecological footprint left by commuters in the 163 municipalities of the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR). This paper explores the determinants of the ecological footprint of commuting municipal variability by using the following regressors: population density, accessibility, average household income, and job ratio. The results confirm that urban form appears as the main determinant of ecological footprint variation among the municipalities of BMR. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In order to evaluate the landscape and its agrarian components in the low mountainous region of the Alpujarras in Southeastern Spain, Conjoint Analysis (CA) was used, and both alternative ranking and rating approaches were considered as a way of assessing preferences. Data was obtained from a preference test carried out with a sample survey of 165 visitors to the area.
   Three main real landscape components were considered for this analysis as follows: type of vegetation layer, density of rural building and level of incline. Several levels were also considered for each component: abandoned fields, dry fan-ning, irrigation fanning and virgin lands were included for the vegetation layer; and three levels (low, intermediate and intense) were considered for the level of incline and rural building.
   Finally, conclusions were drawn concerning both the preferences for landscapes and the comparative analysis of the results when using either the ranking or scale rating approach. From these conclusions, some strategies have been suggested to maintain the highest valued landscape in the area, within the scope of a sustainable rural development process. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

ID INDICATORS
AB Dozens of frameworks of sustainability assessment that focus on the performance of companies have been suggested by now. They propose using numerous sustainability, indicators, which are generally measured in very different units. While it is important to assess sustainability with several indicators, it may sometimes be difficult to make comparisons among companies based on a large number of performance measurements. This paper presents a model for designing a composite sustainable development index that depicts performance of companies along all the three dimensions of sustainability-economic, environmental, and societal. In the first part of the paper, the procedure of calculating the index that would enable comparisons of companies in specific sector regarding sustainability performance is presented. However, the emphasis of the paper is on the second part, where the effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated with a case study in which two companies from specific sector are compared regarding their sustainability performance.

AB In order to consider the depletion of natural capital in national income accounting, the World Bank has developed a composite indicator known as 'genuine savings' incorporating several environmental indicators. This paper examines the conceptual and empirical characteristics and policy implications of the measure. Analysis shows that the measure is conceptually and empirically imperfect. The policy implications based on this measure are erroneous. The paper suggests that a global approach is needed to appropriately address sustainability issues and to incorporate natural capital in national accounting. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Constructed wetlands that mimic natural marshes have been used as low-cost alternatives to conventional secondary or tertiary wastewater treatment in the U.S. for at least 30 years. However, the general level of understanding of internal treatment processes and their relation to vegetation and habitat quality has not grown in proportion to the popularity of these systems. We have studied internal processes in surface-flow constructed wastewater-treatment wetlands throughout the southwestern U.S. since 1990. At any given time, the water quality, hydraulics, water temperature, soil chemistry, available oxygen, microbial communities, macroinvertebrates, and vegetation each greatly affect the treatment capabilities of the wetland. Inside the wetland, each of these components plays a functional role and the treatment outcome depends upon how the various components interact. Vegetation plays a uniquely important role in water treatment due to the large number of functions it supports, particularly with regard to nitrogen transformations. However, it has been our experience that vegetation management is critical for achieving and sustaining optimal treatment function. Effective water treatment function and good wildlife quality within a surface-flow constructed wetland depend upon the health and sustainability of the vegetation. We suggest that an effective tool to manage and sustain healthy vegetation is the use of hummocks, which are shallow emergent plant beds within the wetland, positioned perpendicular to the water flow path and surrounded by water sufficiently deep to limit further emergent vegetation expansion. In this paper. we describe the use of a hummock configuration, in conjunction with seasonal water level fluctuations, to manage the vegetation and maintain the treatment function of wastewater-treatment wetlands on a sustainable basis.

AB For decades ecologists have recognized the potential importance of marine-derived nutrients (MDN) deposited in freshwater ecosystems by spawning anadromous salmon. Previous studies have shown that some MDN are retained in freshwater ecosystems. A popular hypothesis linking MDN to salmon population productivity posits that MDN provided by post-spawning mortality of salmon are critical for salmon population dynamics because they enhance prey populations in the freshwater ecosystems used as nursery habitats. We tested this hypothesis by reconstructing historical sockeye salmon populations for the last 300 years in Bristol Bay, Alaska. Stable nitrogen isotope chronologies in lake sediments and sockeye catch and escapement histories show that commercial fisheries intercepted about two-thirds of MDN bound for freshwater spawning grounds since about 1900. Reconstruction of lake algal production using, fossil pigments shows that this loss of MDN has reduced lake algal productivity to about one-third of its level before commercial fishing. However, contrary to expectation, recent sockeye population sizes (sum of spawning escapement and fishery catch) in the last century were equivalent to those before the advent of commercial fishing. These data demonstrate that the MDN subsidy is important for the productivity of coastal lakes but that some sockeye salmon populations are limited by other features of ecosystems such as the amount of suitable spawning habitat.

AB Developing the capacity for individuals to learn effectively from their experiences is an important part of building the knowledge and skills in organizations to do good adaptive management. This paper reviews some of the research from cognitive psychology and phenomenography to present a way of thinking about learning to assist individuals to make better use of their personal experiences to develop understanding of environmental systems. We suggest that adaptive expertise (an individual's ability to deal flexibly with new situations) is particularly relevant for environmental researchers and practitioners. To develop adaptive expertise, individuals need to: (1) vary and reflect on their experiences and become adept at seeking out and taking different perspectives; and (2) become proficient at making balanced judgements about how or if an experience will change their current perspective or working representation of a social, economic, and biophysical system by applying principles of "good thinking." Such principles include those that assist individuals to be open to the possibility of changing their current way of thinking (e. g., the disposition to be adventurous) and those that reduce the likelihood of making erroneous interpretations (e. g., the disposition to be intellectually careful). An example of applying some of the principles to assist individuals develop their understanding of a dynamically complex wetland system (the Macquarie Marshes in Australia) is provided. The broader implications of individual learning are also discussed in relation to organizational learning, the role of experiential knowledge for conservation, and for achieving greater awareness of the need for ecologically sustainable activity.

AB Xa'an palm (Sabal yapa) has been used to thatch traditional Maya houses for over 3000 years. In the Yucatan Peninsula, this palm has been introduced to pasturelands, maize fields (milpas), and homegardens. These and other traditional management systems are usually believed to be sustainable, but there is as yet little evidence to support this hypothesis. Demographic models have been used for this purpose, mainly focusing on population growth rate (lambda). So far, retrospective analysis has not been applied, even though it examines how changes in the the life cycle of a species, caused by different management regimes, affect its lambda. In this study, we assess whether ecologically sustainable use of xa'an occurs in homegardens, pasturelands, and milpas, and if so, how it is achieved. We constructed matrix population models for four populations of xa'an that were followed for 3 years, and then conducted a retrospective analysis on them. Management in homegardens seems to be oriented to increasing the availability of xa'an leaves, favoring the survival of seedlings, and increasing the density of harvestable-sized palms. However, in the milpa and the pastureland, the population size structure resembles that of unmanaged populations. Our lambda values suggest that the traditional use of xa'an in all the studied management regimes is sustainable. Nevertheless, the processes that lead to sustainable use are different in each system, as shown by our retrospective analysis. Although fecundity contributes positively to lambda only in homegardens, permanence and growth maintain palm populations at an equilibrium in the pastureland and in the milpa, respectively. Between-year climatic differences had a smaller impact on lambda than management practices, which may vary from one year to another, leading to different balances in the sustainable use of the populations involved. Even though no significant differences were found in lambda values, Maya achieve sustainable use of xa'an palm under diverse scenarios by managing the great plasticity of the species, as was revealed by the retrospective analysis. Hence, this approach proved to be effective, not only for assessing sustainable use, but also for understanding the factors that favor or limit it.

AB As part of developing an international network of community-based ecosystem approaches to health, a project was undertaken in a densely populated and socio-economically diverse area of Kathmandu, Nepal. Drawing on hundreds of pages of narrative reports based on surveys, interviews, secondary data, and focus groups by trained Nepalese facilitators, the authors created systemic depictions of relationships between multiple stakeholder groups, ecosystem health, and human health. These were then combined to examine interactions among stakeholders, activities, concerns, perceived needs, and resource states (ecosystem health indicators). These qualitative models have provided useful heuristics for both community members and research scholars to understand the eco-social systems in which they live; many of the strategies developed by the communities and researchers to improve health intuitively drew on this systemic understanding. The diagrams enabled researchers and community participants to explicitly examine relationships and conflicts related to health and environmental issues in their community.

AB Building resilience in integrated human and nature systems or social - ecological systems (SES) is key for sustainability. Therefore, developing ways of assessing resilience is of practical as well as theoretical significance. We approached the issue by focusing on the local level and using five lagoon systems from various parts of the world for illustration. We used a framework based on four categories of factors for building resilience: (1) learning to live with change and uncertainty; (2) nurturing diversity for reorganization and renewal; (3) combining different kinds of knowledge; and (4) creating opportunity for self-organization. Under each category, the cases generated a number of items for building resilience, and potential surrogates of resilience, that is, variables through which the persistence of SES emerging through change can be assessed. The following factors were robust across all five lagoon SES cases: learning from crisis, responding to change, nurturing ecological memory, monitoring the environment, and building capacity for self-organization and conflict management.

AB Deliberate progress towards the goal of long-term sustainability depends on understanding the dynamics of linked social and ecological systems. The concept of social-ecological resilience holds promise for interdisciplinary syntheses. Resilience is a multifaceted concept that as yet has not been directly operationalized, particularly in systems for which our ignorance is such that detailed, parameter-rich simulation models are difficult to develop. We present an exploratory framework as a step towards the operationalization of resilience for empirical studies. We equate resilience with the ability of a system to maintain its identity, where system identity is defined as a property of key components and relationships (networks) and their continuity through space and time. Innovation and memory are also fundamental to understanding identity and resilience. By parsing our systems into the elements that we subjectively consider essential to identity, we obtain a small set of specific focal variables that reflect changes in identity. By assessing the potential for changes in identity under specified drivers and perturbations, in combination with a scenario-based approach to considering alternative futures, we obtain a surrogate measure of the current resilience of our study system as the likelihood of a change in system identity under clearly specified conditions, assumptions, drivers and perturbations. Although the details of individual case studies differ, the concept of identity provides a level of generality that can be used to compare measure of resilience across cases. Our approach will also yield insights into the mechanisms of change and the potential consequences of different policy and management decisions, providing a level of decision support for each case study area.

ID TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY; INEFFICIENCY
AB The relationship between productive efficiency and sustainable development of fishing industries in developing countries has received little attention. III-structured property rights in common-pool resources lead to a contradiction between private and social technical efficiency, with private and social costs dependent on the level of technical efficiency. Development policies that increase private efficiency can increase the social cost with ill-structured property rights and common-pool resources, and thereby increase social inefficiency. This paper examines this relationship through a case study of the mini purse seine fishery of the Java Sea, and finds that private technical efficiency does not depend on any measurable attributes of human capital, diverges substantially between the peak and off seasons, and differs between vessels more within the off season.

AB The authors explore Ireland's growing involvement in the world economy. For many years, Ireland's foreign-direct-investment-led (FDI-led) development policy was associated heavily with low-skill, dependent branch plants. However, over the past fifteen years the shift towards internationally traded services notably improved the quality of this investment. This transition allows Ireland an opportunity to alter its position within the world economy. The authors use corporate case studies to demonstrate the extent to which Irish-based affiliates of information and communication technology multinationals now assume more significant positions within their wider corporate networks. In addition, it considers the role of the emerging cadre of Irish managers in enhancing the sustainability of Ireland's FDI-led development model.

AB The role of entrepreneurship and small businesses in economic development has received particular attention in the postcommunist countries. Transition studies have recently emphasised the role that institutions play in orienting the entrepreneurial spirit toward capital formation, investment, export expansion, and generation of new jobs, and fair competition which will lead to sustainable economic growth. The author discusses the business-support infrastructure in Albania and the operational issues it faces. Interview data have been collected from various actors involved in the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in the country. The combination of the interview content with background information on each of the organisations has highlighted various issues such as the need for greater exposure of enterprises to business opportunities through the promotion of role-model businesses, the need to respond to the specific needs of enterprises in terms of skills and knowledge, and the need for a wider access through a better sectoral and regional coverage.

ID REQUIREMENTS; TOURISM; ENERGY
AB Academic interest in ecotourism has grown rapidly in recent years, fuelled by the increasing popularity of ecotourism holidays. This paper adopts ecological footprint (EF) analysis as a means of estimating the potential net EF of hypothetical international ecotourism scenarios involving air travel. A procedure for the rapid calculation of indicative, potential minimum net EF estimates using secondary data sources was applied to a variety of source/host country scenarios with the aim of establishing a reasonable and conservative range of EF values associated with ecotourism. The influence of changing assumptions about the broad nature of resource demand at the destination and of three length of stay pcriods was considered. In total, 252 estimates were made of the potential net per tourist EF, assuming conservative resource use at the destination. For a 14-day holiday, potential net EF estimates ranged between 0.02 and 4.26 global hectares. Only one, a 21-day scenario, produced a net negative EF value, suggesting the potential for an overall reduction in absolute demand on global renewable resources. Some 80% of 14-day holiday scenarios produced potential per tourist EF estimates greater than the annual average per caput EF in low income countries. The size of the transit component was very important to overall net EF estimates, supporting largely anecdotal concerns about the environmental impact of long-haul flights to ecotourism destinations. The implications of these findings for judging the impact of ecotourism were found to vary according to different absolute and relative benchmarks, although the global EF of ecotourism is likely to be considerably less than that of mass tourism.

ID COMMODITY CHAIN
AB Data on prices and quantities of wildlife on sale in markets are increasingly being used as indicators of the sustainability of bushmeat hunting, being relatively easy to collect. However, it is not clear how much can actually be inferred from trends in such data. This study analyses changes in price, quantity, method of capture and kill location of bushmeat species entering the Atwemonom bushmeat market in the city of Kumasi (Ghana) over the period 1987-2002, using data collected by an official of the Ghana Wildlife Department. The analysis was confined to the seven most commonly traded species and to the open season only, in order to maximize the reliability of the data. Over the period, there was an increase in real bushmeat prices, in the proportion of animals killed by means other than guns and the trade made up by grasscutters (Thryonomys swinderianus). A higher proportion of animals originated from distant areas, rather than from villages close to Kumasi. These trends are compatible both with depletion of the bushmeat resource and with an economically rational response by hunters to increasing prices. The analysis highlights both the utility and the limitations of detailed long-term market data as a tool for assessing the sustainability of wildlife hunting. Data on the origin of animals sold in the market and the gear type are necessary but not sufficient for understanding the drivers of changes in price and quantity of species on sale in markets; without complementary detailed local data on hunter behaviour, market data are of little value.

AB In this article we describe a research partnership between the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation and scientists at the University at Albany, State University of New York, initiated to address community and scientific concerns regarding environmental contamination and its health consequences (thyroid hormone function, social adjustment, and school functioning). The investigation focuses on cultural inputs into health disparities. It employs a risk-focusing model of biocultural interaction: behaviors expressing cultural identity and values allocate or focus risk, in this instance the risk of toxicant exposure, which alters health status through the effects of toxicants. As culturally based behaviors and activities fulfill a key role in the model, accurate assessment of subtle cultural and behavioral variables is required and best accomplished through integration of local expert knowledge from the community. As a partnership project, the investigation recognizes the cultural and socioeconomic impacts of research in small communities beyond the production of scientific knowledge. The components of sustainable partnerships are discussed, including strategies that helped promote equity between the partners such as hiring community members as key personnel, integrating local expertise into research design, and developing a local Community Outreach and Education Program. Although challenges a-rose during the design and implementation of the research project, a collaborative approach has benefited the community and facilitated research.

AB In Europe, the development of Environmental Information Systems for the water domain is heavily influenced by the need to support the processes of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The aim of the WFD is to ensure that all European waters, these being groundwater, surface or coastal waters, are protected according to a common standard. While the WFD itself does only include concrete information technology (IT) recommendations on a very high-level of data exchange, regional and/or national environmental agencies build or adapt their information systems according to their specific requirements in order to deliver the results for the first WFD reporting phase on time. Moreover, as the WFD requires a water management policy centered on natural river basin districts instead of administrative and political regions, the agencies have to co-ordinate their work, possibly across national borders. On this background, the present article analyses existing IT recommendations for the WFD implementation strategy and motivates the need to develop an IT Framework Architecture that comprises different views such as an organisational, a process, a data and a functional view. After having presented representative functions of operational water body information systems for the thematic and the co-operation layer, the article concludes with a summary of future IT developments that are required to efficiently support the WFD implementation.

AB Suspended sediment fluxes to and from tidal wetlands are of increasing concern because of habitat restoration efforts, wetland sustainability as sea level rises, and potential contaminant accumulation. We measured water and sediment fluxes through two channels on Browns Island, at the landward end of San Francisco Bay, United States, to determine the factors that control sediment fluxes on and off the island. In situ instrumentation was deployed between October 10 and November 13, 2003. Acoustic Doppler current profilers and the index velocity method were employed to calculate water fluxes. Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) were determined with optical sensors and cross-sectional water sampling. All procedures were analyzed for their contribution to total error in the flux measurement. The inability to dose the water balance and determination of constituent concentration were identified as the main sources of error; total error was 27% for net sediment flux. The water budget for the island was computed with an unaccounted input of 0.20 m(3) s(-1) (22% of mean inflow), after considering channel flow, change in water storage, evapotranspiration, and precipitation. The net imbalance may be a combination of groundwater seepage, overland flow, and flow through minor channels. Change of island water storage, caused by local variations in water surface elevation, dominated the tidally averaged water flux. These variations were mainly caused by wind and barometric pressure change, which alter regional water levels throughout the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Peak instantaneous ebb flow was 35% greater than peak flood flow, indicating an ebb-dominant system, though dominance varied with the spring-neap cycle. SSC were controlled by wind-wave resuspension adjacent to the island and local tidal currents that mobilized sediment from the channel bed. During neap tides sediment was imported onto the island but during spring tides sediment was exported because the main channel became ebb dominant. Over the 34-d monitoring period 14,000 kg of suspended sediment were imported through the two channels. The water imbalance may affect the sediment balance if the unmeasured water transport pathways are capable of transporting large amounts of sediment. We estimate a maximum of 29800 kg of sediment may have been exported through unmeasured pathways, giving a minimum net import of 11,200 kg. Sediment flux measurements provide insight on tidal to fortnightly marsh sedimentation processes, especially in complex systems where sedimentation is spatially and temporally variable.

AB The Yunnan Chinese who settled in northern Thailand's Golden Triangle after 1964 used their traditional knowledge of hill farming and crop diversity, plus their extensive ethnic networks based on multi-layered Chinese identity, to establish viable communities in a mountainous region. By focusing on producing cash crops such as lychee nuts, tangerines, ginger roots, and bamboo shoots, they established a sustainable rural livelihood that is environmentally friendly, economically profitable, and socio-culturally self-renewing. This study addresses issues of sustainable agriculture and livelihood.

AB The paper, by two prominent American specialists on the Soviet and post-Soviet economies, explores the role of Russia's energy resources. The authors offer a more inclusive definition of oil and gas rents than is traditionally given and analyze how the mechanisms for distributing those rents have changed over time. They show how fluctuations in the level of rents have played a key role in Russian economic performance. Oil rents, in particular, are shown to have varied widely over the past 35 years. The paper also examines how the distribution of rents affects the sustainability of production. It concludes with some reflections on the proper organization of the energy sector.

AB The progress of modernization is accompanied by an emphasis on urban mobility and economic growth together with increasing environmental awareness. This article aims at analysing the transformation of transport systems (car-road system and public transport) together with related urban changes and their societal effects in three very different cities: Santiago, Tehran and Copenhagen. In these cities vehicle ownership is increasing and motorized mobility is further facilitated. Mass motorization is an essential part of modernization. However its impact on societal development is an area of research that has received little attention. Moreover, mass motorization is handled in different ways in different socio-political settings. In Tehran the emphasis is on technological upgrading and enlargement. In Santiago, an important re-regulation and modernisation of the systems is taking place. In Copenhagen all kinds of improvements are made partly inspired by the Agenda 21. Furthermore, as this article points out, the local political order and chosen strategies to handle motorization problems are diverse. My analysis emphasizes mass motorization, political interventions, civil society urban governance, sustainable development and the management of urban mobility. I conclude that political strength at the city level seems to be weaker than what is observed at the national level.

AB The calculation of critical loads and their exceedance is one method to describe the vulnerability of forests to environmental stress caused by anthropogenic impact. Exceedance of critical loads for acidifying inputs and nitrogen was compared to different indicators of the soil and forest conditions in the German part of the extensive forest monitoring (ICP Forests/EU Level I), including more than 1,800 plots. In addition, an empirical relationship between the C/N ratio of the forest floor humus layer (C/N (Humus)) and the estimated nitrogen output for ten plots of the intensive monitoring (ICP Forests/EU Level II) was established in order to estimate the potential nitrogen output on Level I plots dominated by Norway spruce. Regarding all tree species assessed, the exceedance of critical loads for nitrogen and sulphur is negatively correlated with pH and base saturation up to 30 cm soil depth. The sulphur deposition and the exceedance of critical loads are highly correlated with the sulphur content of leaves and needles, whereas the respective relations for nitrogen were lower. The crown condition was weakly positively related to the sulphur content in tree leaves and needles. For Norway spruce sites, high exceedance of critical loads for nitrogen and nitrogen deposition corresponded well with low C/N (Humus). In regions with high nitrogen load and low C/N ratios in the humus layer, the calculated nitrogen output was high. The results support the concept of critical thresholds in that way that their exceedance can impair forest ecosystem functions like nitrogen retention.

DT Article
DE telecentres; governance reform; sociology of governance; Kerala; Akshaya
ID BUREAUCRACY; INDIA
AB Telecentres are seen as essential components of governance reform in the international development community and great optimism has been expressed in academic and policy literature regarding their developmental potential. The scope of our paper is to move beyond the confines of conventional governance ideology and to propose a broader conceptual lens through which to study the complexity of issues that need to be addressed in order to make telecentres sustainable. Following several years of experience with these projects, evidence shows that their long-term survival depends upon how interactions are managed between a host of players including the government, private entrepreneurs, international donors, telecommunications suppliers, local companies, civil society organisations and individual community members. This paper proposes that the sociology of governance approach is highly relevant for a study of telecentre sustainability. This theoretical approach is used as a lens through which to investigate issues regarding the sustainability of the Akshaya telecentre project in Kerala in terms of interactions between various groups of players. We adopt a practical reflexive-interpretive methodological approach to encourage the development and reshaping of theoretical ideas about governance through our empirical data. We identify five critical issues currently affecting sustainability of the Akshaya project focusing on how relations and exchanges have been managed over time. Our analysis has important theoretical and policy implications for the Akshaya project and more generally for telecentre initiatives launched as part of governance reform in developing countries.

AB In many parts of Africa, illegal hunting is considered the most pressing issue in protected areas. Poaching has remained a persistent problem through the 50 year long history of Serengeti National Park. Around 2 million people live along the borders of the park. Poverty is widespread, and the population is increasing rapidly. In this paper we examine the local perceptions of importance and reasons for hunting, gender differences and opinions about mitigating measures among villagers around Serengeti's Western Corridor. The data were collected through interviewing 590 persons in eight villages close to the borders of the park. Hunting is driven by the need to not only increase food supply and cash income, but also fulfil cultural and social needs. We also identified a proactive attitude in the rural communities towards reducing illegal hunting and more constructive relationships with the management authorities of the national park. The role of hunting in community life extends beyond the immediate poverty issue, and should be seen as an element in the larger development agenda of rural Tanzania and the quest for models for sustainable wildlife management.

AB The Finnish economy has done enormously well in recent international comparisons of technological advancement and economic competitiveness; it has reached a notable runner-up position in just a couple of decades, measured by a range of indicators. The paper looks at the process of national scale competitiveness building in a historical perspective and discusses the reasons for the Finnish success. It analyses the main actors and features in the national innovation system and seeks befitting characterizations of tire country-specific social capital that are believed to have provided the resource base for the competitiveness of the Finnish technology sector and the economy at large. Lastly, the paper takes up issues related to the sustainability of the system in light of contemporary understanding of what creates competitive advantage in the present-clay world economy.

AB Lough Neagh produces over 500 t of grown eel annually and employs 300 people fishing yellow and silver eel. Glass eel are transported upstream and stocked into the Lough. Since glass eel returns crashed in the 1980s, additional glass eel seed has been purchased from other fisheries. The fishery now faces ecological, social and economic pressures. Prices for the product have fallen; recruitment to the fishery has declined, and seed has decreased in availability and increased in price. Fishers are less inclined to take up the hard work required to make a living fishing eel and the fisher population is ageing. The European Commission has recognised the decline of eel and proposed emergency measures, which may further affect the viability of the fishery. The sustainability of the fishery is examined, based on the relationship between glass eel input and grown eel outputs over a period of 45 years, set against increasing environmental, socio-economic, and natural resource pressures. Spawning escapement of silver eel is estimated by mark-recapture experiments.

AB The recent creation of the Tun Mustapha Park (TMP) in the northern waters of Sabah, Malaysia has brought up the need for understanding the coral reef fisheries system in Pulau Banggi, for which there has been no previous documentation. This study draws upon field data collected in June and August 2004 to accomplish two things, namely, to build a profile of the ecological and socio-economic aspects of Pulau Banggi's reef fisheries, and undertake a preliminary assessment of the status of these fisheries. This research is important because it provides information that will help managers develop policies for the long-term ecological and socio-economic sustainability of Pulau Banggi's reef fisheries.

ID STAND STRUCTURE; BIOMASS; ECOLOGY; AREA
AB Sustainable forest management and conservation require understanding of underlying basic structural and competitive relationships. To gain insight into these relationships, we analyzed spatial continuity of tree basal area (BA) and crown projection area (CPA) on twelve 0.64-ha plots in four mixed bottomland hardwood stands in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. Variogram range indicated that BA spatial continuity of trees with dbh > 10.0 cm extended an average 4.5 m. This distance equaled the quadratic mean crown radius (QMCR) of the overstory trees. Overall, 95% of the variability in BA was accounted for by the spatially structured variance and could be modeled as spatial dependence. Removal of suppressed trees from the analyses reduced the variability in BA at small separation distances and increased the variogram range. The average spatial continuity of unsuppressed trees averaged 18.2 m and was 17.6, 18.5, and 18.5 in based on the BA variograms, CPA variograms, and cross-variograms, respectively. This distance corresponded to four times the QMCR of the overstory trees and extended far enough to encompass the first- and second-order neighbors. The results suggest an existence of complex competitive influences and confirm findings in nonwoody vegetation that competitive effects can propagate beyond the direct neighbors.

TI Local-level criteria and indicators: an Aboriginal perspective on
   sustainable forest management
SO FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY; KNOWLEDGE; RESOURCE
AB As tools for improving the sustainability of forest management, criteria and indicator (C&I) frameworks have grown in popularity over the last decade. Such frameworks have been largely derived from top-down approaches to determining critical measures of forest management success. While useful, they fail to capture many C&I of critical importance to local populations, who experience forest management strategies first hand and who have their own definitions of sustainability. Using archival materials, our research begins to identify one First Nation's forest values and compares these local-level C&I with three well-known C&I frameworks for sustainable forestry. We demonstrate that local-level definitions can provide additional C&I, as well as additional levels of detail to C&I that they share with the national and international frameworks. Both are crucial to developing strategies for sustainable management that meet local as well as broader needs and desires.

AB 1. Vernal pools are small precipitation-fed temporary wetlands once common in California. They are known for their numerous narrowly endemic plant and animal species, many of which are endangered. These pools experience the typical wet season/dry season regime of Mediterranean climates. Their hydrological characteristics are determined by a complex interaction between the highly variable climate and topographic relief.
   2. Hypotheses regarding the effects on ponding of total precipitation, storm intensity and pattern were examined using long-term weather records combined with two decades of data on the length and depth of inundation in 10 individual pools. Similarly, data on pool landscape position and microtopography allowed examination of the interactions between topography and rainfall amount and pattern.
   3. The total amount of precipitation and length of inundation were strongly correlated. Landscape position affected ponding duration, with collector pools holding water longer than headwater pools. Basin microtopography interacted with climatic variability to determine the nature and extent of within-basin microhabitats sufficiently different in hydrological and/or soil conditions to support or exclude individual species. The effect on hydroperiod of precipitation concentrated in a few months rather than spread more evenly over the season depended on total precipitation.
   4. Changes in climate, the mound-and-depression landscape or pool microtopography could have profound impacts on the hydrology of individual pools as well as the array of hydrological conditions in the system. Given the individualistic responses of the numerous endemic species supported by vernal pools, any of these environmental changes could diminish their sustainability and increase the risk of species extinction. Conservation, restoration and management decisions should take these factors into account.

AB A regional copper scenario model has been developed from the perspective of the generic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change framework for greenhouse gas emissions scenarios for the four world regions: OECD90, ASIA, REF, and ALM. A set of three scenarios: Tech World, Green World, and Trend World, each representing the significant driving forces influencing population and economic growth, technological change and environmental consciousness, is presented. Intensities of copper use converge in the long-term in the Tech and Green World as GDP per capita level approaches $100,000. Global copper use, currently 15 Tg Cu/yr, is expected to rise to 30-130 Tg Cu/yr by the year 2100. The rate of copper use in the ASIA and ALM regions exceeds the copper use in the OECD90 and REF regions beyond 2020. A Green World corresponds to per capita global copper use of 4 kg Cu/(capita-yr) as compared to the contemporary global level of 2.6 and 10 kg Cu/(capita-yr) in developed regions, symbolizing the sustainability theme. For the OECD90 region, the results are more sensitive to the copper intensity of use variable whereas for ASIA and ALM regions, variations in GDP per capita can influence copper use.

AB The increasing complexity of our global society means that sustainable development cannot be addressed from a single perspective or scientific discipline. By using the concept of transitions, we examine current and future tensions between welfare, well-being and the environment, and focus on four major issues that are of global importance: two of our key natural resources, water and biodiversity; the health of human populations; and the developments related to global tourism. In our global assessment, we base ourselves on the most recent scenario efforts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Future developments are explored along the lines of four development paths (scenario groups), defined along two dimensions (global versus regional dynamics and emphasising economic objectives versus environmental and equity objectives.

AB Soil enzyme activity can be used as an indicator of soil quality for assessing the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of conservation tillage practices, such as no tillage and reduced tillage (subsoil-bedding and shred-bedding), and conventional tillage practices, such as mouldboard ploughing, on physical-chemical, biochemical and physical soil quality indicators in a degraded sorghum field under warm subtropical conditions, after a period of 3 years. An adjacent soil under native vegetation was used as a standard representing local high quality soil. Conservation tillage systems, in particular no tillage, increased crop residue accumulation on the soil surface. Soil electrical conductivity and pH were not affected by the tillage practices. In the 0 to 5 cm layer, organic matter content increased with decreasing tillage intensity and was 33% greater with no tillage compared with the average of the other tillage treatments. The no tilled soil had higher values of water soluble C, dehydrogenase, urease, protease, phosphatase and beta-glucosidase activities and aggregate stability than tilled soils, but had lower values than the soil under native vegetation. The enzyme activity and aggregate stability showed higher sensitivity to soil management practices than did physical-chemical properties. The no tillage system was the most effective for improving soil physical and biochemical qualities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Much research in recent years has addressed the contribution of indigenous knowledge (IK) to development initiatives in developing countries. An IK system that continuously evolves and adapts in response to environmental and socio-economic change is often considered to be at the core of sustainable natural resource management practices and rural livelihoods. In the context of indigenous wetland management in western Ethiopia, this paper examines the relationship between IK and wetland sustainability, focusing oil the mechanisms through which IK evolves and how local adaptive capacity is built up. A series of participatory research activities undertaken in four wetland communities revealed spatial variations in the degree of innovation and communication taking place. The paper argues that these mechanisms are key factors influencing adaptive capacity, suggesting a key link between wetland sustainability and the occurrence of innovation and communication among communities.

ID ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT
AB Knowledge integration, the blending of concepts from two or more disciplines to create innovative new worldviews, is a key process in attempts to increase the sustainability of human activities on Earth. In this paper, we describe a 'conceptual template' that can be used to catalyse this process. The template comprises (a) a list of high-level concepts that capture the essential aspects of any significant human-environment problem, plus (b) broad lists of low-level basic concepts drawn from a range of disciplines. Our high-level concepts, which we call 'conceptual clusters', are labelled Dynamics & System, Organisation & Scale, Controlling Models, Management & Policy, Adaptation & Learning, and History. Many of the clustered, lower-level concepts are synonyms and thus provide possible connections between disciplines-for this reason we call them 'nexus concepts'. We suggest that a conceptual template like that presented here can provide strong support to the initial phases of integrative research programs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Urban environment, spatial fragmentation and social segration in Latin
   America: Where does innovation lie?
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE globalisation; technology innovation; social disparities; urban
   environment; Latin America; Argentina; Bolivia
AB To "review the urban question" in terms of sustainable development, the premise is formulated that improving infrastructures, equipment and services to preserve the natural and built urban environment is costly and generates expenses of all kinds-at economic and social levels. Without the introduction of equalisation mechanisms, these expenses will increase inequalities between different parts of the urban population.
   As confirmed by 2 Latin American case studies in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and La Paz Bolivia, the quality of urban environment depends directly on improving living conditions for the resident population. The aim is to assist the poor in developing a rubbish disposal service for the families living in the informal settlements of La Paz, or to extend water supply to the poorer areas on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. The collective benefits of these "innovations" are self-evident. However, understanding the environmental issues involved, and evaluating the social impact of these innovations, means examining what motivates their implementation.
   The first difficulty was in finding financial and economic information on the global cost of the new technologies, due to the lack of managerial culture and the discretional attitude of private enterprises and public administration.
   A second observation is that the social dimension of the environmental upgrading process in Latin America cities has been neglected by the main urban decision-makers. In all the contexts, the evolution of the projects' implementation clearly demonstrates that social issues cannot be dissociated from political ones. Although the players themselves often find it difficult to estimate economic costs, these are nonetheless real and represent burdens that should be distributed equitably among the beneficiaries of services; but which are, in practice, often viewed in terms of profit. This leads to conflicts between different population groups, the political authorities and private intermediaries. Rather than viewing technological action as an unique "source" of innovation, we must consider its global dimension via the social practices it generates. On the other hand, we should reposition every specific event in its immediate environment and see how it reflects contemporary macro-social processes, in a world of "globalisation".

TI Medicare financial status, budget impact, and sustainability - Which
   concept is which?
SO HEALTH CARE FINANCING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Medicare is continually undergoing change, as it must in order to reflect advances in medical technology, new health care delivery systems, financial pressures, and other developments. Modifications to the program are debated by policymakers in Congress and the administration, together with academic experts and others. These debates would be improved if policymakers and the public had a clearer understanding of Medicare and certain commonly cited views of the program's overall status. Three such concepts-the financial status of the Medicare trust funds, the impact of Medicare on the Federal budget, and the long-run sustainability of Medicare-are often confused with each other and are sometimes used interchangeably. Each concept is important but needs to be used for its own purpose. This article clarifies the differences among these three views of Medicare and provides examples of each.

AB By locating expertise within an institutional framework, this paper examines the roles of regulators, the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession in drug risk assessment and in the construction of `acceptable' drug injury in particular. It is suggested that, while public perceptions of risks are important, they may be extremely limited due to relative secrecy surrounding some risk-generating activities, such as pharmaceutical development and regulation. Under these circumstances, a necessary starting point is the investigation of the formation of expert risk assessments. Taking the case of the anaesthetic drug, Althesin, the article explains how drug risks, largely unknown to the public, came to be defined as acceptable by expert and regulatory interpretation for over a decade. The reasons for and drivers of the regulatory route taken, together with alternative regulatory approaches are identified in relation to the salient risk-benefit problems: extrapolation of animal toxicology to humans, construction of therapeutic benefit, comparative risk assessment, unpredictability of risk and risk benefit evaluation. It is argued that professional closure between expert regulators, the manufacturer and sections of the anaesthesiology profession led to passive decision-making and a regulatory approach towards acceptable drug injury unlikely to have been sustainable if it had been subjected to public accountability. The Althesin experience also suggests that regulators, the medical profession and other stakeholders concerned about drug risks should focus their attention not only on improving the evidence-base of risk assessment, but also on more robust interpretation and informative communication of the evidence already available at any particular time. Finally, the Althesin case demonstrates that, contrary to popular claims, major drug risks have not necessarily only been discovered upon widespread use after marketing approval and that, even after discovery of life-threatening risks, drugs have not necessarily been withdrawn quickly by the UK regulatory authorities despite the availability of safer alternatives.

AB Sustainable economic growth is enabled by the production of wealth, i.e., development of entrepreneurship. Opportunities for its development, and so the sources of the country's economic wealth, may be found today not only in the proper level of macroeconomic indicators (labor cost, interest rates' level, currency exchange rate, etc.), but also in regional (effective and efficient use of locally diverse opportunities, development predisposition, and cooperation between organizations) and microeconomic conditions (differences in management styles). The sine qua non condition of the entrepreneurship development is the effectiveness of actions taken in all three interrelated levels enabling achievement of the synergy effect. Our aim here is to present an innovative concept of entrepreneurship, realized in Poland on the basis of the cooperation between science, business, authorities, institutions, and media.

ID HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR-1; TRANSCRIPTION; EXERCISE; PERFORMANCE;
   HOMEOSTASIS
AB EPAS1 is a gene involved in complex oxygen sensing. It is expressed in microvascular endothelial cells, lung epithelial cells, cardiac myocytes and the brain. An association study was undertaken comparing elite endurance athletes classified into two groups according to a power-time model of performance intensity: power-time-maximum (PT-MAX; N=242, event duration 50 s to 10 min) and power-time-steady state (PT-SS; N= 151, event duration similar to 2-10 h), with normal controls (N = 444) using 12 SNPs across EPAS1. Ordinal regression analysis of allele frequencies revealed significant differences at SNPs 2 and 3 (P=0.01). Haplotype analysis revealed the presence of haplotypes involving SNPs 2-5 that significantly differentiated (P < 0.05) the groups based on an ordinal ranking using the power-time classification. These same haplotypes differentiated the PT-MAX group in which a significant decrease in a haplotype (F: G-C-C-G; OR=0.57, P=0.02, 95% CI 0.36-0.92) and increase in a second haplotype (G: A-T-G-G; OR= 1.75, P=0.03, 95% CI 1.05-2.91) was observed compared to controls. The PT- SS group was differentiated from the PT-MAX group by a third haplotype (H: A-T-G-A; OR=0.46, P=0.04, 95% CI 0.22-0.96). Since EPASI has a role as a sensor capable of integrating cardiovascular function, energetic demand, muscle activity and oxygen availability into physiological adaptation, we propose that DNA variants in EPAS1 influence the relative contribution of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism and hence the maximum sustainable metabolic power for a given event duration.

SO HUMAN ORGANIZATION

AB In Latin America, the role of the state in funding and implementing environmental protection has been consistently inadequate. As alternative responses develop, national and international conservation NGOs replace governments in the quest for environmental sustainability. The environmental discourses and practices-and the morality accompanying resource use and conservation-privileged by the donor organizations become the environmental truth by which environmental sustainability is planned and designed. The goal of this article is to contribute to the more recent literature on power dynamics product of the collaboration among allies in global environmental and indigenous rights issues. It addresses the alliances developed among North American conservationist organizations, Panamanian authorities and NGOs, and Ngobe indigenous peoples to create a master plan for the management of a marine protected area in the Archipelago of Bocas del Toro, Panama. I focus on the conflicts among apparent allies in the quest for environmental protection and on how the environmental truth (in the name of global environmentalism) of donor organizations shaped the creation of a management plan in the Archipelago. The process of the creation of the Assembly and the development of the plan illustrate both the efficacy and the limits of grassroots activism in situations of uneven status and power.

AB Wetlands in arid and semi-arid areas face intensifying pressure for their water resources yet harbour unique biota and ecological processes that rely on the "boom and bust" regime of alternating flood and drought. Recent research in Australia has revealed that models of ecosystem processes derived from northern temperate zone wetlands are often inapplicable to arid zone wetlands, confounding efforts to manage or protect these threatened habitats. We review four case studies from inland Australia that demonstrate different degrees of successful management, aiming to draw out lessons learned that will improve our sustainable use of these delicate systems. Inappropriate extrapolation across scales that ignores the inherent spatial and temporal variability of arid-zone wetlands, "reactive" rather than "collaborative" research and management, and a reluctance to adopt functional indicators to complement state variables are several common themes. We are optimistic that managers and researchers are collaborating to tackle these issues but warn that a parched future faces some wetlands where jurisdictional boundaries hamper their effective management or entrenched beliefs and community distrust of managers threaten ecologically sustainable resource use. In and areas where water is so precious, environmental allocations are costly and their long-term effects are difficult to identify against a backdrop of high inherent variability. Preservation of this variability is the key to successful management of these "boom and bust" systems but diametrically opposes the desire for regulated, reliable water supplies for human use. Social and institutional acceptance and change now appear to be greater barriers than limited ecological understanding to effective management of many "parched wetlands" in Australia.

AB It is now accepted that most of the rivers and streams of Australia have been degraded to varying extents by European settlement. The scale and level of this degradation have been documented by State and Federal government authorities. To halt and reverse the degradation in the next two decades, it is crucial that the conservation and restoration of streams, rivers, riparian zones, and catchments become paramount in land and water management. Effective stream restoration requires a coordinated effort at the catchment level rather than at the level of many individual local sites. Monitoring, including the gathering of before-restoration data, and the setting of feasibly-attainable goals are key components of effective restoration. In planning projects and setting goals, it needs to be recognized that some goals may only be attained in the long-term. Large-scale restoration projects will require partnerships to be formed between resource managers and scientists, with other stakeholders possibly involved. Selected projects could be adaptively managed with the emphasis on gaining scientific knowledge on the effects of management interventions.

AB Successful stream restoration requires the setting of appropriate goals and an ability to measure restoration success using quantitative ecological indicators. At present., a dichotomy exists between the setting of restoration goals to enhance ecosystem 'processes' or 'functions' such as sustainability, and measuring the success of these goals using 'patterns' or 'structural' ecosystem attributes. The presence of a structural facade may be no indication of a viable ecosystem as this requires evaluation of whether key ecosystem processes have been restored and whether the system is ecologically sustainable. We briefly discuss the benefits and drawbacks associated with setting restoration goals and measuring their success based on ecosystem patterns and processes. Two case studies are provided based on measurements of biofilm chlorophyll a and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) to debunk the myth that these structural variables can be used as surrogates for ecosystem processes of productivity and respiration in rivers. We suggest that the discipline of restoration ecology will benefit and grow from a greater appreciation of the functional role of biological communities within stream ecosystems, and from targeting some restoration towards the re-establishment of structurally significant species and functionally significant processes. This approach to stream restoration with a well-founded conceptual base and defined scientific and management goals should expand our knowledge of stream function and contribute to the effective restoration of stream systems.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Implementing more holistic forms of fisheries management (e.g. Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD), Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management) usually increases the number and scope of impacts requiring assessment. This study examined the effectiveness of a qualitative risk assessment process, developed as part of a National ESD framework, for prioritizing issues across the seven most valuable Western Australian commercial fisheries. Structured stakeholder workshops were used to identify issues across three ecological areas: retained species (i.e. target and by-product), non-retained (i.e. discarded and protected) species, and the broader ecosystem for each fishery. The risk associated with each issue was assessed using one of five sets of consequence criteria specifically developed to cover fishery-related impacts. The risk scores, for which suitably detailed justifications were written, determined the level of reporting and management required for each issue. Despite an additional 96 "non-target species issues" being identified at the workshops from a total of 115 issues, of the 27 issues requiring explicit management actions, just six new issues were added by this process. In addition, it identified where modifications of some of the existing arrangements were necessary. Finally, the system significantly improved stakeholder involvement and therefore acceptance of the outcomes. Given this success, risk assessment has now been applied to all Western Australia's export fisheries and to the development or review of many other systems, thereby improving the entire management process.

AB An array of photoconductive photomixer/antenna elements as a continuous-wave terahertz source is proposed, and its radiation characteristic is studied. Employing photomixer/antenna elements in an array configuration increases available terahertz power, while each of the array elements consumes optical power less than its maximum sustainable power. A few microwatt terahertz power is achievable from a typical array structure. It is shown that the radiated beam can be steered by changing the angle between the two exciting laser beams.

TI Growth rates over four rotations of pine in Swaziland
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; long-term productivity; rotations; yield
AB This short paper continues the regular reporting of performance of successive rotations of pine grown on a 15-17 year rotation in the Usutu Forest, Swaziland. Evidence suggests that the mean height of 5-6 year old fourth rotation P. patula is significantly greater than in all preceding rotations. The increase in mean height of 6-10% probably arises from genetic improvement. Factors of hail damage and variable stocking affect the comparison but do not invalidate the significant overall conclusion.
   In view of the intensive management of the highly productive plantations on the relatively poor soils at Usutu, namely short rotations, no thinning, and a clearfelling silvicultural system, the data reported here augur well for the sustainability (narrowsense) of plantations more generally.

TI Sustainability of sawn timber supply in Tanzania
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE Tanzania; timber; pit-sawing; sustainability; regulation
AB Timber is an important commodity in African towns. This paper reports the findings from research into the supply of timber to Dar es Salaam and Mwanza (Tanzania). Tanzania has reserves of hardwood timber in the natural forest and softwood timber in plantations. Information gathered from consumers, producers and traders was used to estimate consumption, analyse changing patterns of supply and assess sustainability. Analysis of the hardwood supply system (presented as a sub-sector diagram) found it to be 'slippery', evolving in response to diminishing resources and a cumbersome and ineffective regulatory regime. With the advent of pit-sawing and other changes, control over the cutting of timber in the natural forest has been lost. Regaining control is unlikely unless effective local community participation can be established. Sustainable management in the plantations is achievable and offers the best chance of ensuring a supply of timber to meet future demands.

AB Like most other species, sustainable management of mahogany in natural forests ultimately relies on continued seed production by the population. Because larger trees produce more fruit, previous authors have emphasised the importance of retaining large trees. In this paper, we investigate levels of fruit production of mahogany in two ecologically distinct forests. Fecundity was related to tree size in some years, but this relationship was neither consistent nor strong. The contribution of any given size class to population-level fruit production depended on both its fecundity and its relative abundance and this differed between forests. The fecundity of small and medium-sized trees was also significantly different between forests and this was consistent with patterns of increased crown exposure caused by differences in forest structure. From a forest management perspective, these results suggest that size-fecundity relationships are insufficient to guide forest management prescriptions without also quantifying the size structure of the population.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE deformation; metal powder; metal shell; powder packing; rapid tooling
AB The requirements for faster product development cycles, lower product cost and environmental sustainability are ever increasing in today's globally competitive market. Tooling is a very important phase in the product manufacturing cycle. To overcome the shortcomings of long lead-time and high cost associated with conventional tooling processes, new tooling methods with shorter lead-time and lower cost are strongly under demand.
   In this study, the feasibility of the proposed new rapid tooling process based on back support of a metal shell with packed metal powders is examined. First, the effect of metal powder properties, such as powder shape, size, and size distributions, on powder-packing behaviour is investigated experimentally. Then, the compressive behaviours of the metal shell and the shell-powder assembly are analysed numerically with different compressive loading. The study indicates that the proposed new rapid tooling method can potentially be used for injection moulding applications.

AB Information, education and communication (IEC) has an important role to play in HIV/AIDS prevention and harm reduction among injecting drug users and their sexual partners. This paper reviews what is known about the effects of IEC within this context. It distinguishes between six types of individual level intervention in which IEC has a role to play (mass reach interventions, outreach work. harm minimisation, drug cessation/treatment programmes, voluntary and confidential counselling and testing, and risk reduction counselling) and two different styles of structural intervention (structural and environmental outreach work to tackle the structured vulnerabilities associated with HIV/AIDS). Though the evidence base is weak, evidence relating to IEC's contribution and effects in each of these fields is reviewed. Overall, and by itself, IEC can do little more than raise levels of knowledge, awareness and understanding; however. when combined with other measures, including service provision and a supportive social environment, more positive and sustainable effects can be achieved.

   linear programming; multi-objective optimization; greenhouse gas

AB Increasingly, hydrogen is being promoted as an alternative energy carrier for a sustainable future. Many argue that its use as a transportation fuel in fuel cell vehicles offers a number of attractive advantages over existing energy sources, especially in terms of well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions. Following this interest, several of the leading energy companies, like BP, have started investigating strategies for its introduction. The challenge of developing a future commercial hydrogen economy clearly still remains, though: what are the energy efficient, environmentally benign and cost effective pathways to deliver hydrogen to the consumer? Establishing what these "best" pathways may be is not trivial, given that a large number of technological options exist and are still in development for its manufacturing, storage, distribution and dispensing. Cost, operability, reliability, environmental impacts, safety and social implications are all performance measures that should be considered when assessing the different pathways as viable long-term alternatives. To aid this decision-making process, we present a generic optimization-based model for the strategic long-range investment planning and design of future hydrogen supply chains. By utilizing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques, the model is capable of identifying optimal investment strategies and integrated supply chain configurations from the many alternatives. Realizing also that multiple performance criteria are of interest, the optimization is conducted in terms of both investment and environmental criteria, with the ultimate outcome being a set of optimal trade-off solutions representing conflicting infrastructure pathways. Since many agree that there is no one single template strategy for investing in a hydrogen infrastructure across the globe, emphasis is placed on developing a generic model such that it can be readily applied to different scenarios, geographical regions and case studies. As such, the model supports BP's strategic hydrogen infrastructure planning using high-level optimization programming, and is coined bplC-H2. The features and capabilities of the model are illustrated through the application to a case study. (c) 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper on Low External Input Agriculture (LEIA) has explored how indigenous hill farming systems in a developing country setting of rural Nepal are functioning and which ecological properties of such systems could contribute to the development of Low External Input and Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA). Three cases were studied using direct field observation, group discussion and interviews, and the important practices of LEIA were ranked into eight classes to analyse the ecological sustainability of the hill farming systems. The study shows that the hill farming system is complex, diverse, heavily reliant on local resources and focuses on the renewability of production resources within the farm. All this can greatly contribute to make the system ecologically sustainable. However, demands for increased production put considerable pressure on farmers to apply external inputs which, if in excess, may jeopardise the whole system. A prerequisite for guidance in careful soil management is the strengthening of supportive research aimed at teaching farmers how to use external inputs. This must agree with the principles of sustainable agriculture and take into account the site-specific variations which are characteristic of Nepalese hill farming systems. We defined the term Ecological Dynamics as 'the pattern of changes in structure and/or forces in processes which govern the development of natural and artificial ecosystems'. This definition assists in identification of trends in ecological sustainability. Understanding indigenous farming systems reveals important ecological clues essential for the development of sustainable agriculture.

AB Vocational training as an inter-temporal investment will bring returns in the future as people responsible take the necessary initiatives to invest today. However, training must be dynamic in nature, especially for agro-entrepreneurship to create structural changes in production, distribution, marketing and consumption. In the preparation of youth to meet future requirements of economic growth, biotechnology, nanotechnology and intelligence in computer technology play prominent roles in the context of knowledge and skill development of the population. In this process, youth should be well informed of conditions and situations of demographics, socio-cconomics, scientific, energetic and pragmatic aspects of potentials in development through effective vocational training processes in the sphere of sustainable development. By so doing, it would be easy to visualize new production vistas with a new generation of agro-entrepreneurs to yield dynamic production systems for a new world.

AB The 1992 Earth Summit highlighted the critical role of consumption in affluent nations as a source of global environmental deterioration. While most developed countries have begun over the past decade to grapple with the difficult challenges of reducing household demand for energy and materials, sustainable consumption has yet to attract substantive attention in the United States. There exist, however, several strategic openings that American proponents of more environmentally benign household provisioning could exploit to launch a public dialogue about the environmental implications of contemporary consumption. First, public health professionals have in recent years begun to make significant strides publicizing the nutritional inadequacy of the American diet and the contributory role it plays in elevating incidences of chronic disease. Second, the rapid increase in the rate of obesity in the country is now coming to be understood as a health problem that is attributable to the prevalence of sedentary lifestyles. Finally, there is growing public concern in the United States over the accumulation of unprecedented levels of consumer debt and the epidemic of personal bankruptcies. The intent of this paper is to highlight the need to consider the personal dimensions of everyday life when formulating strategies to foster more sustainable consumption.

   security problems in China

ID MANAGEMENT; COUNTRIES; ISSUES
AB Water, as a source of food security, plays an essential role in ensuring sustainable food resources for a growing population. However, water scarcity has increasingly become a constraint to economic development, particularly food production. The water-food challenge is impending because of China's increasing population and water demand. The concept of virtual water is useful to analyze this problem. In this paper, the implications and policy relevance of virtual water are expounded. Based on imported food volumes, it is calculated that an annual average of 10.52 X 16(9)m(3) of virtual water embodied in imported wheat and maize in the period between 1990 and 2000 is equivalent to 23% of the annual average transfer water volume of the South-North Water Transfer (SNWT) project. Consequently, this 29.3 x 10(6) ha of virtual land is equivalent to 19% of China's arable land in 2000. Using the grain import prediction and the agricultural production conditions of China, the virtual water equivalents of China in 2010 and 2020 arc evaluated, and are about 88 x 10(9) m(3) in 2010 and 95 x 10(9) m(3) in 2020, respectively. Importing virtual water embedded in traded food can alleviate water stress and even achieve food security. Virtual water trade may compensate for water demands for not only the past but also the future. Meanwhile, water trade can store water in its virtual water form, enabling food storage to play a potential role in solving food problems, as well as promoting sustainability of water resources in China.

AB China has seen rapid economic growth over the past two decades, but severe environmental problems have accompanied this, such as the looming danger of Asian Brown Clouds. This paper analyzes the regional development of China by examining economic performance and environmental factors. Technical efficiency and productivity changes in 31 regions of China are computed for the period 1997-2001. In the case of regional GDP, the fast-developing eastern (coastal) regions experience higher technical efficiency and productivity growth than the inland central and western regions. When environmental factors are incorporated, the eastern regions still perform better than inland regions, both from static and dynamic analysis. This phenomenon is termed the 'double deterioration' of the inland areas in China. Double deterioration is attributed to the lack of economic resources to replace highly-polluting production equipment and technology in those less developed regions.

DE cleaner production; sustainable development; China
AB The paper explores the objectives, strategies and barriers to cleaner production (CP) implementation in China. Successful demonstration projects in China have shown that CP is a strategy for reducing pollution and costs, increasing competitiveness and achieving an integrated balance between economic and environmental benefits. As such, it is an inevitable choice and important contribution to sustainable development. However, it has not progressed enough as a strategy for continuous improvement since its effects are limited to industrial sectors or regions. CP implementation can be assisted by further popularization, policy system improvement, perception and awareness raising and technology innovation. These dimensions are the key tasks and incentives for all levels of government, enterprises and social organizations in moving toward sustainability.

To attain such integration, it is necessary to assess the EEB in detail, after the economic benefits have also been thoroughly assessed. The shadow engineering and market value methods are the major EEB assessment methods used in this study. We have assessed the EEB of the forest and grassland ecosystems in the recipient regions of the Western Route Project (WRP) for 2020, 2030 and 2050. Finally, some proposals are also made for efficient and sustainable management of the WRP.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE environmental management; resource management; impacts; globalisation
AB Socio-economic development of mankind and well-being depend on the environment and the way in which development influences the environment. Thus, environment and development are interdependent. In fact, economic development is closely linked with the development of resources. These resources can be classified into three categories: public goods, semi-public goods (also known as common property resources) and private goods. In poor countries common property resources make a valuable contribution to the sustainable livelihoods of rural populations. The impact of globalisation on the commons shows various patterns of ownership, control, use and misuse. The commons were subjected to degradation as well as conservation in the process of centralized management in India. After the reform period, the administration of natural resources was given significant attention by specialized departments such as the Forest Department and the Revenue Department. All the land, apart from private land, was regarded as state property and controlled by the state. This paper highlights the need to examine the common property resources sector in the context of wider economic policy reform processes in the Indian economy.

TI Status and trends in research and development projects in the mountains:
   A situational analysis in the Indian Himalaya
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE mountain ecosystems; India; Himalaya; research and development; trends
AB The mountains hold the key to global ecological and social stability by virtue of being centres of biological and cultural diversity and the storehouse for water and other resources. However, they are becoming unable to sustain the demands of the changing life style of the growing number of inhabitants as well as the population in the plains and, therefore, the resources are depleting rapidly. Inadequacy of research and development (R&D) projects undertaken in mountain ecosystems is, perhaps, a major factor that has not enabled us to evolve and introduce suitable interventions to replenish and restore the health of the degraded mountains. In this article, taking the Indian Himalayan region as a case study, an effort has been made to understand the adequacy and appropriateness of R&D projects in mountain ecosystems by analysing the research and development projects implemented in this region from 1985-86 to 1998-99. The analysis revealed inadequacy in the number and budgets of R&D projects implemented in this mountain ecosystem as a whole as well as in specific subject areas; the number of R&D projects implemented during this period was only 5.28% of the total projects, with a fund allocation of 4.45% of the total R&D budget of India, which appears to be inadequate considering the geophysical and bio-social importance of the Himalaya. The finding suggests that national funding agencies of mountain nations need to increase the number of R&D projects in mountain regions as a priority, with the intention of developing scientific packages capable of restoring the degraded ecosystem of the mountains and ensuring their sustainable development.

TI Good governance and market-based reforms: a study of Bangladesh
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB 'Good governance' is increasingly regarded as pivotal to development in developing countries. The six indicators recognized as the most effective measurement tools of 'good governance' across the world are: voice and accountability; political stability and absence of violence; government effectiveness; regulatory quality; rule of law and control of corruption (Kaufmann, Kraay and Lobaton, 2003: 8-9). This paper investigates how lack of 'good governance' affects the success and sustainability of the market-based reforms undertaken in the agriculture sector of Bangladesh. The reforms have been associated with increased food grain production, improved food security conditions and easy access by farmers to agricultural inputs. However, a significant problem has arisen recently: the sale of low quality and underweight agricultural inputs sometimes at higher prices has become common. Not only is this problem undermining the positive impact of the reforms, it is also threatening their sustainability. The paper argues that the problems with regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption - indicators of good governance - are the underlying reasons for this problem. In the context of increasing pressures from donors to pursue market-based reforms, this paper stresses the need for integrated governance linking government, business and civil society as paramount for promoting good governance for the success and sustainability of the reforms.

TI Building dynamic democratic governance and HIV-resilient societies
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB HIV epidemics continue to spread around the world. Although most responses have emphasized medical approaches, the HIV and AIDS Situation could be further improved by applying good governance principles. In analyzing national responses to HIV and AIDS from Brazil, Thailand, and Uganda, common factors consistent with democratic governance principles can be found. These factors are the strategic vision of political leaders, timely responses, strong and effective civil society participation, multisectoral mobilization, balancing prevention and treatment approaches, respecting human rights, and transparency. By building knowledge-bases, advocating policy improvement and taking strategic actions for programmatic responses, countries in South-East Asia have developed an Early Warning Rapid Response System which applies good governance principles for multisectoral actions in building HIV resilience. Engaging the construction sector to prevent HIV can ensure sustainable returns on economic investments. In mobilizing nonhealth sectors such as agriculture and construction, broader strategic action programmes can be devised to complement the efforts of the health sector in mitigating socio-economic crises aggravated by HIV and AIDS. The article concludes that the democratic governance approach is an essential option worth pursuing because it makes a critical contribution to reversing the relentlessly expanding trend of the HIV and AIDS pandemic.

AB At the beginning of the 1990s the period of transition from a central planning economy to a market economy started in all Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC). During this period distinct economic difficulties and a rather critical situation have been observed. A lot of common issues in agriculture and water management were recognised. In irrigated agriculture the majority of CEEC faced similar problems: decrease of agricultural production, deterioration of irrigation and drainage on-farm infrastructure and breakdown of the previous markets. Everywhere in CEEC, the process of agricultural reforms as well as reforms in water management were started and developed to solve these problems. Reforms in agriculture and water management in different countries were initiated with respect to the local natural conditions, traditional farm practice, infrastructure particularities as well as institutional and legislative developments. During the implementation of the reforms new experiences were gained and new approaches developed.
   To learn from these experiences and to analyse the results of reform processes the international project on "Irrigation Management Transfer in European Countries of Transition" was initiated by the Ukrainian National Committee of ICID and embodied in the activities of the European Work Team on Sustainable Irrigation Management (EWTSIM), a working unit of the European Regional Working Group (ERWG) of ICID. The project was funded by the German GTZ and started in 2003. Eleven countries were involved in the project. The main objectives of the project are: prepare country reports using a common structure; perform comparative assessments of irrigation reform processes in the participating countries; work out recommendations for further developments. In this report the project coordinators present the first results of the comparative assessment of irrigation reform processes:
   analysis of the basic conditions and the initial situation in agriculture and water management practice at the beginning of the reforms
   assessment of the differences in agriculture reforms
   comparison and analysis of changes (in irrigation management practice, irrigation management transfer policy and institutional development, legislation and financing systems) and their results
   comparison of proposed scenarios for future developments.
   The comparative assessment of different reform processes is understood as a useful tool to identify obligatory actions in order to successfully implement a transformation policy. This procedure may also serve to identify advantages and disadvantages of its implementation as well as of definite stages or lacking stages of the transformation process. Internationally recognised advanced experiences in irrigation management transfer are additionally applied for the conclusions. On the basis of the comparative assessment the drafted lessons learned are presented. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB School-based mental health (SBMH) programs and services have grown progressively in the United States in the past two decades, related in part to increased recognition of their advantages and heightened federal support. However, SBMH is an emerging field, with many issues needing attention. This introductory article provides a context for the special issue by highlighting the importance of increased conceptual clarity about SBMH, enhanced mental health-education systems integration, and advancement of the SBMH research base. Key elements for success of SBMH programs and services are discussed, as underscored recently by the report of the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) and other important initiatives. These elements include (a) school-family-community agency partnerships, (b) commitment to a full continuum of mental health education, mental health promotion, assessment, problem prevention, early intervention, and treatment, and (c) services for all youth, including those in general and special education. A synopsis of the articles in the special issue is provided, emphasizing their conceptual and empirical contributions to delivery and sustainability of effective mental health practices in schools.

AB Evidence-based prevention and intervention programs are increasingly being implemented in schools and it therefore is becoming increasingly important to understand the complexities of program implementation under real-world conditions. Much research has focused on the contextual factors that influence program implementation but less work has attempted to provide an integrated understanding of mechanisms (e.g., teacher-training processes) that affect teachers' program implementation. In this paper, we review literature on factors related to teachers' implementation of school-based prevention and intervention programs, then from this review abstract what we believe are four basic ingredients that characterize potentially sustainable teacher-implemented classroom programs. Finally, we present a sequential model, based on these ingredients, of the naturalistic processes underlying sustainability of teachers' program implementation and describe how this sustainability can be enhanced through provision of teacher training and performance feedback from a classroom consultant.

TI On-farm conservation strategy to ensure crop genetic diversity in
   changing agro-ecosystems in the Republic of Korea
SO JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE

AB With the recognition of certain limitations of ex situ methods for conservation of plant genetic resources the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at the 'Earth Summit' in 1992 highlighted the importance of traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities that are relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and gave considerable attention to on-farm and other forms of in situ conservation. Unlike semistatic nature of ex situ conservation the in situ or on-farm conservation (OFC) is a dynamic evolutionary process. In developing countries like Republic of Korea, where there is a continuum between the use of traditional and modern cultivars, integration of OFC with already existing gene-bank activities in the country will be an effective approach for conservation and sustainable use of the country's crop genetic resources. However, very little efforts have been made so far in developing strategies for OFC, therefore, in this paper we describe the importance of OFC and strategies for its development in Republic of Korea. Surveys over the last 20 years have shown that the landraces of major crops have been almost replaced by newly bred varieties in the country. But some vegetatively propagated or minor crop species are still being maintained in the farmers' fields. We have identified crop landraces, which can be classified into four different categories from the OFC point of view. These are vegetatively propagated landraces, sexually reproduced landraces, landraces with improved varieties and landraces cultivated for the reasons of personal preference. The related issues oil OFC including implementation methods from the point of national cooperative system in designated specific condition are also discussed to ensure the genetic diversity in the fast changing agro-ecosystem of the country.

ID SHIFTING CULTIVATION; TECHNOLOGIES; MANAGEMENT
AB Improved short- or long-term fallows are considered suitable low external input technologies for maintaining productivity and sustainability of tropical smallholder upland cropping units, although comparisons on the benefits of this technology are not widely reported. A field study evaluated the impact of improved short (6 months) and long-term fallow (18 months) using Crotalaria juncea and Tithonia diversifolia, in relation to a natural fallow of the same durations, on the productivity of maize (Zea mays), the most important upland cereal in tropical Asia, over a minor season. The use of improved fallows, especially Tithonia, increased maize yields over the Crotalaria or natural fallow. While the overall yields of maize after a long fallow were greater, the beneficial impact of the green manures was significantly higher in the short fallows. The causal factors for this trend, including biomass production of the improved fallows and possible impact on soils, along with the greater benefits of short-term fallows for increasing maize yields in the tropics due to lower requirements of unproductive time are presented.

AB 1. The spatial dynamics of farmland invertebrates can provide essential information relevant to their management for pest control and biodiversity conservation in sustainable agriculture. Carabid beetles are one of the most important groups contributing to biological control in arable fields. Previous studies have focused on spatial dynamics within single fields and years. In this study we examined their larger scale, long-term dynamics, thereby taking into account the impact of changes in crop rotation and the influence of field size.
   2. The spatial distributions of four beetle species were investigated at an unprecedented spatial scale in a grid of 973 pitfall trap locations across six fields encompassing 64 ha of arable land. Week-long trapping was conducted four times in the first year and twice in the two following years.
   3. All species showed strong aggregation but the size and location of patches differed among species. The distribution of Pterostichus melanarius was stable within and between years, with a single large patch close to the field boundaries. Patches of Poecilus cupreus were also located close to field boundaries but their location changed between years. Pterostichus madidus and Philonthus cognatus distributions extended across field boundaries and were less stable, with patch locations changing between years.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The spatial extent of a population patch for a given species was species-specific. Species overwintering in field boundaries remained in proximity to these throughout the summer, whereas patches of mid-field overwintering species were more extensive. Patches were generally stable within years but varied for some species between years. Species therefore differ in their response to crop management practices and consequently blanket management approaches for these important generalist predators of crop pests are inappropriate. For spatially stable species (e.g. Pterostichus melanarius) it may be possible to determine their specific habitat requirements and to devise predictive and protective measures to preserve populations or manipulate them at the farm-scale. More mobile species may be better at responding to pest aggregations at the farm-scale. However, operations that deplete populations, e.g. soil cultivations, should be spatially and temporally desynchronized at the farm-scale to conserve populations and enable functional biocontrol.

AB This paper models the behaviour of discounted US debt using a Markov-switching time series model. The significance of modelling fiscal policy within this framework derives from the implications it has for long-term sustainability. The two-regime framework used in this paper identifies periods where the present value of US Federal debt is expanding versus periods when it is collapsing. Using an updated data series from Hamilton and Flavin (1986), a test is conducted to establish if the expanding periods pose a threat to the long-run sustainability of fiscal policy. For the USA, it is found that they do not. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Environmental history is a multidisciplinary enterprise united by shared interests in ecological change and the complex interactions between people and the environment. Its practitioners include expertise in the natural sciences, ill history or archaeology, or in political ecology and related social sciences; but there is no agreement on a common agenda and limited success in bridging methodological and epistemological divisions that impede integrative and interdisciplinary research. World-systems history and environmental history also have overlapping interests in long-term change and matters of sustainability. The Mediterranean world sustained agricultural lifeways across some 8000 years, yet its environment has repeatedly been described as degraded, suggesting conceptual confusion between transformation and destruction. This paper is didactic in purpose and uses landscape histories for the Peloponnese and eastern Spain to show that the impact of recurrent, excessive precipitation events and of reduced quality of land cover are difficult to unravel, because they commonly appear to work in tandem. As a result (a) environmental change cannot be assumed or "predicted", but must be studied inductively by experts with science skills, and (b) cause-and-effect relationships demand an understanding of ecological behavior, for which humanistic insights are indispensable. Social science models highlight systemic relationships from socioeconomic and structural perspectives., but are less suited to deal with the complexity of environmental change or the contingencies exemplified by human resilience. Near Eastern.. Greek and Roman agronomic writings offer elite "voices" that speak to cumulative technological change, scientific understanding, and the context of intensification. Rural voices can be heard through ethnography, and in eastern Spain are extended into the past by archaeology and archival research. In the absence of structural constraints, they reveal collective decision-making with respect to a shifting repertoire of agricultural strategies that take into account market opportunities, demographic growth, finite resources and environmental problems. Such adaptability spells resilience, and "good farming" is culturally embedded as a civic responsibility, both in the ethnographic present and in the older, elite agronomic writings. But if the "moral economy" erodes in the wake of food stress, tax extortion, instability, insecurity, or ideological oppression, there is little incentive to pursue long-term strategies, so that behavior focuses on short-term survival. The context for this dialectic of poor versus good ecological management may be structural, but cause-and-effect in the traditional Mediterranean world ultimately depended on ecological and human resilience. Long-term sustainability is similarly non-predictive. It depends on people, rather than social theory. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID NEIGHBORHOOD; SAFETY
AB This paper addresses issues relative to evaluating the effectiveness of a community-security approach to reducing crime, with a critical analysis of after-dark design, night animation, and interpersonal interaction as key components. The construct linking these factors is an attitude that assumes responsibility for places and emerges as congruent spatial behavior. The community-security paradigm proposed here as a strategy in the generation of habitable (thus safe) and socially sustainable urban environments has as its antithesis the realm of the dormant domain - isolating and ambiguous public open spaces, alienating parks, blind carparks, silent suburbs and shopping malls, and railway stations and city centers deserted at night. The approach involves a range of spatial design and place management issues, all of which are mutually interdependent.

AB This research examines the possibility of developing a new corporate social responsibility (CSR) auditing system based on the analysis of current CSR literature and interviews conducted with a number of interested and knowledgeable stakeholders. This work attempts to create a framework for social responsibility auditing compatible with an existing commercially successful environmental audit system. The project is unusual in that it tackles the complex issue of CSR auditing with a scientific approach using Grounded Theory. On the evidence discovered to date in the literature review and the interviews, CSR seems to be perceived by many as the social strand of sustainable development. However, there is far less agreement regarding its measurement. Both the literature review and the interview analysis indicate that developing an applied CSR auditing procedure will be a challenging task. This is principally due to the lack of formal study of this complex subject, which, despite the widespread debate it has engendered, still lacks a single and broadly accepted definition. The concepts developed from the findings of this research, together with the key factors identified in a literature review of CSR, were developed into a prospective CSR audit protocol.

Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, pp. 481-504.] posits that superior resource management involves four sequential activities: (a) efficient acquisition of resources, (b) bundling/combining resources, (c) positioning resources, and (d) maintaining/ protecting resources. The present study links firm strategy to Morgan's resource management tasks. Specifically, the authors suggest that managers at businesses emphasizing a low cost strategy should stress efficient acquisition and maintenance/protection of resources; managers at firms emphasizing a differentiation strategy should stress bundling/combining and positioning of resources. Regression analyses confirm that (a) managers link firm strategy and resource management and (b) firms benefit financially from this practice. However, these models have low explanatory power. Strategy and resource management activities, therefore, are perhaps not the major factor in business performance. Other factors must also play a major role in determining firm financial performance.

AB Wetland restoration in urban estuaries involves unique challenges, risks, and uncertainties that often cause both the proponents and the public to question their investment. In certain cases, recovery of damaged natural resources or other legal obligations (e.g., Native American treaty rights) mandate urban restoration, but non-regulatory restoration in urban settings may often be viewed as particularly counterproductive. Limited opportunities for siting, size, and design options often result in less than optimum restoration of habitat functions within the urban landscape. In addition, persistent sources of contaminants and invasive species may threaten the sustainability of a restoring site's performance. This may be especially true when fish and wildlife resources are drawn to a restoration site that has evolved into an attractive nuisance. Conversely, strategic restoration in urban estuaries can easily offset many of these constraints, when rare, quality patches in the disturbed landscape (a) contribute high ecological function in proportion to their size or complexity, (b) remove blockages for mobile or migratory fish and wildlife, (c) provide public exposure and appreciation for the value of restoration and protection, and (d) enhance the quality of the urban landscape. We examine a decade of estuarine intertidal restoration in the Duwamish River estuary, one of the Pacific Northwest's most heavily industrialized, to illustrate the "value-added" contribution that may be attainable within such challenging settings. Despite intense port and other commercial development, and a long history of watershed and estuarine modification and contamination, completion of eleven restoration sites and plans for two more in the near future has enhanced the ecological and societal values of this estuary. We illustrate this both by evidence of fish and wildlife utilization and by public involvement and investment in a broad spectrum of restoration initiatives above and beyond regulatory mandates. The potential contribution of restoration to the recovery of threatened/endangered Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) is of particular interest. Our observations suggest that acceptable performance depends on strategic planning at the landscape scale, unusual institutional commitment, and acknowledgement that rehabilitation must often be the acceptable substitute for restoration.

TI Coastal Hazards Representation for Praia do Barril (Algarve, Portugal)
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Coastal hazards; set-back lines; Ria Formosa
AB Coastal areas are exposed to a number of hazards that, by threatening human development, can cause expensive damage and loss of life. Therefore, identifying hazardous areas in the coastal zone, with a view to restricting the type or extent of development, is necessary in order to attain a sustainable and secure exploitation of the coastal environment. This goal can be achieved by zoning the coast through the determination of set-back lines for various coastal hazards. In this study, an integrated method for the definition of set-back lines was applied to a moderately-eroding coastal stretch, on the Ria Formosa barrier island system, Praia do Barril, southern Portugal. This method considers shoreline change trends, the acceleration of sea level rise, and extreme storm impacts in order to forecast 50-year set-back lines. The set-back lines obtained delimit the land strip that will likely be affected by coastal processes during the 50-year forecast period, and indicate areas in which it is inadvisable to locate development. The shoreline position projected for the end of the forecast period in 2051 intersects the location of an established tourism resort, which is therefore likely to sustain severe damage sometime during the next 50 years. This scenario suggests that the relocation of the resort should be considered in the future management of Praia do Barril.

TI Erosion by human impact on the Valencian coastline (E of Spain)
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE dams; sand extraction; groins; beach nourishment; dune destruction
AB There is a worldwide tendency towards shoreline erosion increased by climatic change, sea level rise, and different human activities in the coastal area. The Mediterranean coasts are, unfortunately, a very good example of how human activities and economical affairs may interfere with the coastal environmental system. During the last decades human actions have strongly influenced the equilibrium of the coastal zone. The main human disturbances along the Valencian coast are the following: extraction of sand and gravel from rivers and beaches; building of dams that reduce fluvial sedimentary inputs; building of jetties and breakwaters associated with ports and coastal recreational activities interfering with the longshore current sediment transport; destruction of littoral dunes to build marinas, hotels, summer houses, golf courses, and tourist resorts. All these factors are affecting littoral system dynamics. They are reducing the sediment inputs direct or indirectly. The littoral transport is strongly modified or completely stopped. The littoral dune system is an important factor in maintaining the sedimentary equilibrium of beaches; if dunes are removed the created imbalance will lead to increased beach erosion. The main challenge for Valencian society, including coastal scientists, managers, and politicians, is to develop solutions for the sustainable coastal development.

TI Land Use Tourism Models in Spanish Coastal Areas. A Case Study of the
   Valencia Region
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Tourism; beach nourishment; damming; urban planning; sustainability
AB The "sun and beach" tourist product is of major economic importance in Spain and particularly in the region of Valencia. Beaches are natural fragile resources that contribute greatly to a country's economic productivity. In this paper, intensive and extensive tourism models are analyzed, concluding that from the economic as well as the environmental perspective, intensive tourism models are more efficient than extensive ones. The generalized erosion problem of the Valencia coastline is described and three fundamental causes are examined: damming, port breakwaters and urban development. "Beach sand" and "littoral space" are identified as critical natural resources limiting future economic development of the coastal areas. Restoration of the natural fluvial coarse sediment drift together with reservoir dredging and sediment bypassing in dams are considered essential for the sustainability of beaches. After restoring natural coastal sediments, it will be necessary to install sand bypasses in ports along the coast. Beach nourishment projects based on marine and fluvial deposits may contribute to solving local, specific erosion problems in the short-term.

AB The demand for sustainable buildings is an important emerging trend in the building industry. However, the task of delivering these facilities is more difficult than for traditional projects and existing project management techniques struggle to handle the high levels of complexity present. A process-based model, called the continuous value enhancement process (CVEP), was developed to systematically generate and evaluate project alternatives leading to high performance solutions that improve project performance and increase levels of sustainability. Developed specifically to address the challenges facing the Pentagon renovation-which will become the world's largest green office renovation-CVEP is tested to research its ability to support project management decision making in ways that elevate sustainability and project performance. The key contributions of this model include the integration of sustainable objectives into project management practices, and the development of a metric for measuring the quality and focus of project tetra decisions.

TI Strategies for controlling the drug supply: Policy recommendations to
   deal with illicit crops and alternative development programs
SO JOURNAL OF DRUG ISSUES
LA English
DT Article
AB Measuring the success of Alternative Development (AD) programs by the number of illicit crop hectares eradicated puts AD in an undesirable competition with aerial fumigation, which can reduce these areas in a much shorter time. Whereas AD can only obtain results over the long term, the political push to demonstrate immediate successful results has led to an imbalance in United States anti-drug aid, which is strongly weighted towards aerial fumigation. Despite the short-term success of aerial spraying, the key question of the political, social, and economic sustainability of the results obtained through the use of forceful eradication remains open. AD policies have suffered from changes in their focus over time. Today they are fixated on the idea that the sole purpose of illicit crops is to finance terrorist groups. This conception of the policy issue results in the use of force - specifically, aerial fumigations using chemicals - as the foundation for decision making. This single criterion, therefore, affects programs that once recognized the social and economic roots of the problem of illicit crops. This paper seeks to examine and question those aspects of the current strategy and to explore alternative strategies of eradication that take into account who makes decisions in this matter and on whose behalf said alternatives establish oversight for the ongoing advancement in drug policy.

   trees in a tropical forest

AB 1 Light is thought to be the most limiting resource in tropical forests, and thus above-ground competition is commonly accepted as the mechanism that structures these communities. In many tropical forests, trees compete not only with other trees, but also with lianas, which compete aggressively for below-ground resources and thus may limit tree growth and regeneration.
   2 Using a replicated experiment, we tested the relative strengths of above- and below-ground competition from lianas on tree saplings in a disturbed forest in Cote d'Ivoire with a heterogeneous canopy and relatively high light penetration. We planted seedlings of three tree species and subjected them to below-ground competition with lianas (BGC), above- and below-ground competition with lianas (ABGC), or a liana-free control treatment. After 2 years, we harvested the saplings and compared the amount of above-ground biomass and its relative allocation among the three experimental treatments and different tree species.
   3 Lianas competed intensely with saplings in this tropical forest, substantially limiting sapling growth. Saplings grown in the ABGC and BGC treatments had only 18.5% and 16.8% of the above-ground dry biomass of those grown in the liana-free control treatment.
   4 Sapling biomass did not differ significantly among the ABGC and BGC treatments, suggesting that below-ground competition was the driving force behind liana vs. tree competition in this forest. Above-ground competition with lianas, however, did affect the allocation of biomass in saplings, resulting in shorter, thicker stems and a poorly developed crown.
   5 Collectively, our findings suggest that below-ground competition with lianas plays a substantial role in limiting the growth of saplings in disturbed and secondary tropical forests, and above-ground effects may be due to a combination of above-ground competition and mechanical stress.
   6 Disentangling above- and below-ground competition between lianas and trees is critical for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of naturally regenerating tropical forests, as well as formulating successful management plans for sustainable timber harvest.

AB In this paper, we apply the approach of Ramsey and Koopmans to the problem of optimal and sustainable growth. Under plausible assumptions, intertemporal neutrality implies that the optimal growth path is sustainable without the contrivance of a sustainability constraint. The model is extended to cases involving environmental disamenities. The solutions equivalently solve the problem of maximizing net national product adjusted for depreciation in natural capital and environmental effects. Green net national product in this framework is constant over time, thus avoiding the paradox of declining sustainable income. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Bollgard cotton and resistance of tobacco budworm (Lepidoptera :

AB Insecticide susceptibility in tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), was determined for 8 yr (1991-2001) with larvae sampled from cotton in southern Tamaulipas, Mexico. Before 1996, when Bollgard cotton expressing the Cry1A(c) delta-endotoxin was introduced into the region, two important patterns were documented. The first was economically significant increases in resistance to certain insecticide groups. The second was occurrence of virtually complete control failures in the field during 1994 and 1995. The largest resistance changes were recorded for the type U pyrethroids cypermethrin and deltamethrin. These products are the most widely used products in the region. Resistance ratios for these products increased up to >100-fold from 1991 to 1995. After 1996, the resistance levels declined. These findings did not occur with other products of scant use (e.g., permethrin, profenofos, and endosulfan) or low tobacco budworm efficacy coupled to a high use pattern (e.g., methyl parathion). This clear trend toward reversal of resistance to type H pyrethroids can be understood, in part, with respect to two factors: 1) the high adoption rate of transgenic cotton in the region, from 31.2% in the beginning (1996) to approximate to 90% in 1998; this has considerably curbed the use of synthetic insecticides, with the attending loss of selection pressure on this pest; and 2) the potential immigration to the region of susceptible tobacco budworms from cultivated and wild suitable hosts as well as from transgenic cotton might have influenced the pest population as a whole. The influence of transgenic cotton on southern Tamaulipas can be more clearly seen by the drastic reduction of insecticide use to control this important pest. Now tobacco budworms in this region are susceptible to type H pyrethroids. Two effective and fundamentally different pest management tools are now available to cotton growers in southern Tamaulipas: transgenic cotton, coupled with careful use of pyrethroids, offers the possibility of sustainable and profitable cotton production.

AB Causal attributions are important mediators of future behaviour because once a cause is assigned; a commensurate action can be taken. The aims of this research were to find how Iranian farmers attribute the causes of poverty, to provide a typology of attribution of causes of poverty as perceived by Iranian farmers and to compare socio-economic characteristics and contextual conditions of farmers based on their causal attribution of poverty type. Findings revealed that 50% of respondents had structuralistic, almost 30% had individualistic, and about 20% hold fatalistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty. Farmers with individualistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty had higher quality of life, well-being, level of agricultural technology, agricultural production, used insurance more often, they had more land, income, access to agricultural extension services and practiced sustainable agriculture more often. Farmers with fatalistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty had the worst condition with regard to the above variables. However, those who had structuralistic attitudes, stood somewhere between the two previous groups. Based on findings, a number of poverty alleviation recommendations are made. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI Use of layered geotextiles to provide a substrate for biomass
   development in treatment of septic tank effluent prior to ground
   infiltration
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of layered geotextile filters for biological treatment of septic tank effluent prior to ground infiltration was investigated. The goal was to provide secondary treatment and prevent soil clogging by fostering biomass growth in the internal porosity of commercially available geotextiles. The study used primary effluent from a water pollution control facility that serves a combined sewer area. To identify sustainable operating conditions, the hydraulic loading rate (HLR) and other parameters were varied in tests with columns packed with multiple geotextile and granular layers. At continuous high hydraulic loading rate application, over 90% of total suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand was removed, but the three layer filters eventually clogged. When a 365 L/m(25) day (9.0 L/m(2) day) HLR was applied in dose and drain cycles to two filter layers, not only was there little loss in permeability, but ammonia (NH3) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in the effluent were reduced to below 5 and 10 mg/L, respectively. Scanning electron microscope images showed that the biomass morphology was not a continuous biofilm as was expected, but a discontinuous floc trapped within the geotextile pore structure. This provided intimate contact between substrate, oxygen, and biomass to produce the desired effluent quality and limited loss in filter permeability.

AB In any area to achieve the goal of biodiversity conservation, the existing resources must be strengthened, which are helpful to provide the alternate livelihood or income to the local people. However, although various programmes/policies are being set up over the world for conservation of biodiversity, a variety of factors are hurdles to achieve the expected goals. Particularly in developing countries the sustainable livelihood of the local perople is difficult if restrictions are imposed on their traditional usufruct rights over the natural resources. Based on the extensive field work and analysis of satellite imagery in the selected localities of the Indian Himalaya, we found that if the people are having the alternate avenue (profitable options) for earning, their dependencies on the existing resources (only to meet the subsistence needs, not for commercial purpose) will become much lower. Therefore, the biodiversity in these areas is conserved and managed in a healthy way. In this paper, the interactions of biodiversity and economic welfare of local people are discussed in view of understanding that the economic security is more important than pure enforcement of policies for biodiversity conservation.
