AB The Group on Earth Observations System of Systems, GEOSS, is a co-ordinated initiative by many nations to address the needs for earth-system information expressed by the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development. We discuss the role of earth-system modelling and data assimilation in transforming earth-system observations into the predictive and status-assessment products required by GEOSS, across many areas of socio-economic interest. First we review recent gains in the predictive skill of operational global earth-system models, on time-scales of days to several seasons. We then discuss recent work to develop from the global predictions a diverse set of end-user applications which can meet GEOSS requirements for information of socio-economic benefit; examples include forecasts of coastal storm surges, floods in large river basins, seasonal crop yield forecasts and seasonal lead-time alerts for malaria epidemics. We note ongoing efforts to extend operational earth-system modelling and assimilation capabilities to atmospheric composition, in support of improved services for air-quality forecasts and for treaty assessment. We next sketch likely GEOSS observational requirements in the coming decades. In concluding, we reflect on the cost of earth observations relative to the modest cost of transforming the observations into information of socio-economic value.

SO RACE & CLASS
LA English
DT Article
DE Africana studies; black Atlantic; Black Marxism; black radical
   tradition; racial capitalism; terms of order
AB Cedric Robinson's scholarship and radical pedagogy are explored here, within the context of the development of Black studies in the US academy and the challenge that this posed to the 'master narratives' of Eurocentric scholarship. The emergence of Robinson's works and his development of the concept of racial capitalism were integral to the political thrust of Black studies. His Black Marxism, in particular, not only identified and analysed earlier major radical theorists of the Black condition, but also located a hitherto subterranean, yet always existent and insistent, Black radical tradition. The continuing influence of Robinson's historical and philosophical works on subsequent scholarship is outlined, as is the importance of creating a sustainable community of scholars to carry on the radical tradition.

DT Article
DE energy policy; energy efficiency; energy conservation; environment;
   renewable energy; carbon emission; built environment; China
AB Trends in China's energy future will have considerable consequences for both China and the global environment. Though China's carbon emissions are low on a per capita basis, China is already ranked the world's second largest producer of carbon, behind only America. China's buildings sector currently accounts for 23% of China's total energy use and is projected to increase to one-third by 2010. Energy policy plays an important role in China's sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to provide a broad overview of energy efficiency issues in the built environment in China. This paper, firstly briefly, reviews the key national policies related to the built environment and demonstrates the government's environmental concern. Secondly, the authors introduce recent energy policies in the built environment. Energy efficiency and renewable energy in the built environment, which are the key issues of the national energy policy, have been reviewed. Discussion of the implementation of energy policy has been carried out. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a post-disaster mental health training program developed by the International Section of the Department of Psychiatry at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Canada) and delivered in Grenada after Hurricane Ivan struck the country in September 2004. This train-the-trainer program used an integrated community health model to help local health care providers develop the necessary skills for the identification and evidenced-based treatment Of mental disorders occurring after a natural disaster. The approach also provided for ongoing, sustainable mental health care delivered in the community setting, as advocated by the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization. This approach is in contrast to the largely ineffective and costly vertical whole-population psychosocial counseling activities that have often been used in the Caribbean following natural disasters.

AB Ecosystem management assumes that management practices based on natural disturbance patterns are likely to preserve both natural biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Ecosystem management thus combines traditional natural resource management and forestry practices together with classical notions of protection that are focused on sustaining a naturally evolving ecosystem. Increased knowledge and understanding of natural disturbance dynamics in boreal forest ecosystems allow for the creation of a template for sustainable forest management that is based on mimicking disturbances that are thought to contribute to the biodiversity of the ecosystem. The observed trends of natural development are discussed in this paper. Permanent sample-plot data are used to develop a conceptual model of stand succession following natural disturbance. The distinctive characteristics of disturbances that are relevant to forest management planning are identified and modelled.

AB Similar to other industrialized countries, the USA has experienced a significant increase in the number of non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners as well as shifts in the values held by these owners. This study examines the motivations of predominantly new ex-urban forest owners interested in forest management in pursuing collective action through participation in the now out-of-business Sustainable Woods Cooperative (SWC). While common elsewhere, forest landowner cooperatives in the USA are an anomaly. Through a case-study design that depended primarily on semistructured interviews, it was found that SWC members were motivated to join SWC as it was an attractive alternative to (1) the typical timber sale scenario that often places the forest owner at a disadvantage, and (2) the primary government tax incentive program. SWC represents a shift towards owners playing a greater role in shaping forest practices and markets, which is generally absent in the USA. It also suggests that new ex-urban forest owners, who are found in most industrialized countries, will seek to reshape the forest policy arena to meet their values and objectives. As such, this study provides insights for others in understanding the potential changes wrought by the changing characteristics of forest owners.

AB Objectives This prospective cohort study quantified the reduced productivity of workers on full duty after sickness absence from a musculoskeletal disorder and determined the effect of health parameters such as perceived pain, functional disability, and general health on reduced productivity.
   Methods Workers were included who were returning to work from 2- to 6-week sickness absence due to a musculoskeletal disorder. Self-administered questionnaires at baseline, after return to work, and at a 12-month follow-up were used to collect information on productivity and health status. Logistic regression analyses evaluated the determinants of reduced productivity and determined the level of productivity loss shortly after return to work.
   Results Reduced productivity was prevalent for 60% of the workers after they returned to work, and for 40% still at the 12-month follow-up. The initial musculoskeletal disorder caused 75% of the productivity loss shortly after return to work and 60% at the follow-up. Among those with productivity loss, the median loss for an 8-hour workday was 1.6 hours shortly after return to work and also at the follow-up. Worse physical health, more functional disability, and poorer relations with the supervisor were associated with productivity loss shortly after return to work, whereas recurrent sick leave was the greatest predictor of productivity loss at the follow-up.
   Conclusions Reduced productivity was common among workers returning to full duty after sickness absence due to a musculoskeletal disorder. Productivity loss illustrates the importance of the timing of return to work, especially among workers with residual functional disability after return to work. Moreover, the supervisor should be engaged early in the return-to-work process to guarantee an early, sustainable, and productive return to work for the employee.

TI Florida's multifaceted response for increases in syphilis among MSM: The
   Miami-Ft. Lauderdale initiative
SO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED-DISEASES; HIV; RISK
AB After many years of declining rates, it became apparent in 1999 that syphilis cases were on the rise in Florida. Data analysis identified that the outbreak was predominately contained in Miami and Ft. Lauderdale and among men who have sex with men. An in-depth investigation was undertaken to identify the risk factors, the best way to attack the outbreak, and how to build sustainability into implemented strategies. After thorough review of the data and extensive dialogue with local public health and community participants, the Bureau of STD Prevention & Control developed initiatives that focused public awareness through print, radio, and television media resources; expanded access to men's health services; and enhanced education/training for public and private health care providers, STD program field staff, and community representatives. This initiative has resulted in unprecedented community involvement in syphilis control efforts.

AB Parasitic nematodes of the digestive tract remain one of the main constraints to goat production both in temperate and tropical countries. The usual mode of control of these gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) based on the repeated use of anthelmintics is now strongly questioned because of the increasing development of resistance to these molecules. Among the alternative methods to anthelmintics currently available, the manipulation of host nutrition in order to improve the host resistance and/or resilience to parasitic infections seems to represent one of the most promising options to reduce the dependence on conventional chemotherapy and to favour the sustainable control of gastro intestinal nematode infections. This paper will review the available information on the interactions between nutrition and nematode parasitism in dairy or meat goats both in temperate and tropical conditions. It will refer to quantitative aspects of the diet (influence of the protein and/or energy parts) as well as to qualitative components (effects of plant secondary metabolites on worm biology) and will discuss the specificities of goats in regard of theses interactions.

AB The Northeast's hardwood forests provide myriad resources within a matrix of rural and urban communities. In this region, forest uses such as timber and pulp production compete with demands for recreation, landscapes, and pure water. Forest-based economic development is an enticing approach for preserving the rural character of communities. This study highlights the role and relevance of three factors on forest-based economic development: (1) the community, (2) perceptions, and (3) the resources themselves. Each contributes to our ability to better understand the potential for forest-based economic development. Using input from key informants and residents of Bedford County, Pennsylvania, who participated in a survey about community and economic development impacts of forestry in their area, the findings of this research highlight the importance of local attitudes toward forest-based development, as well as the role of local economic conditions in shaping acceptance for such development.

AB Sustainable agriculture requires the formation of new humus from the crops. We utilized C-13 and N-15 signatures of soil organic matter to assess how rapidly wheat/maize cropping contributed to the humus formation in coarse-textured savanna soils of the South African Highveld. Composite samples were taken from the top 20 cm of soils (Plinthustalfs) cropped for lengths of time varying from 0 to 98 years, after conversion from native grassland savanna (C4). We performed natural 13C and 15N abundance measurements on bulk and particle-size fractions. The bulk soil delta C-13 values steadily decreased from -14.6 in (C4 dominated) grassland to -16.5%o after 90 years of arable cropping. This delta C-13 shift was attributable to increasing replacement of savanna-derived C by wheat crop (C3) C which dominated over maize (C4) inputs. After calculating the annual C input from the crop yields and the output from literature data, by using a stepwise C replacement model, we were able to correct the soil delta C-13 data for the irregular maize inputs for a period of about one century. Within 90 years of cropping 41-89% of the remaining soil organic matter was crop-derived in the three studied agroecosystems. The surface soil C stocks after 90 years of the wheat/maize crop rotation could accurately be described with the Rothamsted Carbon Model, but modelled C inputs to the soil were very low. The coarse sand fraction reflected temporal fluctuations in C-13 of the last C-3 or C-4 cropping and the silt fraction evidenced selective erosion loss of old savanna-derived C. Bulk soil N-15 did not change with increasing cropping length. Decreasing delta N-15 values caused by fertilizer N inputs with prolonged arable cropping were only detected for the coarse sand fraction. This indicated that the present N fertilization was not retained in stable soil C pool. Clearly, conventional cropping practices on the South African highlands neither contribute to the preservation of old savanna C and N, nor the effective humus reformation by the crops.

AB Organic farming, which is growing in popularity, has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to conventional farming practices. However, it is not known how organic farming systems affect soil erosion risk and sediment-bound nutrient transport. Our objectives were to compare soil erosion risk and sediment bound nutrient transport potential for grain-based conventional and organic cropping systems by determining selected soil physical properties and distributions of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in soil aggregates of the 0-5 cm depth of a Christiana-Matapeake-Keyport soil association. We measured soil bulk density, aggregate stability, aggregate size distributions, and total C, N, and P associated with five soil aggregate size classes in no-till (NT) and chisel till (CT) systems and in an organic system (ORG). No-till soils had lesser bulk density and greater aggregate stability than did CT and ORG soils. Carbon, N, and P concentrations were greater in large (>2.00 mm) and small macroaggregates (0.21 to 2.00 mm) than in microaggregates (<0.21 mm) regardless of cropping system. When nutrient concentrations were combined with aggregate distribution data, the quantity of aggregate associated nutrients was greatest in microaggregates in ORG and CT soils but greatest in macroaggregates in NT soils. These results indicate an increased risk of sediment associated nutrient transport from ORG and CT soils compared with NT soils, since microaggregates in these soils are preferentially lost through sediment transport. The NT cropping system promoted macroaggregate formation and reduced the risk of particulate nutrient transport in this warm, humid region soil.

AB At the center of Schumpeter's theory of competitive behavior is the assertion that competitive advantage will become increasingly more difficult to sustain in a wide range of industries. More recently, this assertion has resurfaced in the notion of hypercompetition. This research examines two large longitudinal samples of firms to discover which industries, if any, exhibit performance that is consonant with Schumpeterian theory and the assertions of hypercompetition. We find support for the argument that over time competitive advantage has become significantly harder to sustain and, further, that the phenomenon is limited neither to high-technology industries nor to manufacturing industries but is seen across a broad range of industries. We also find evidence that sustained competitive advantage is increasingly a matter not of a single advantage maintained over time but more a matter of concatenating over time a sequence of advantages.

AB Using key insights from the resource-based view of the firm, we develop and test a theory of how firms can successfully deploy and develop their strategic human assets while managing the trade-offs in their service and geographical diversification strategies. In a sample of large law firms we find that, even though firms profit from expert human-capital leveraging strategy and service and geographical diversification strategies individually, pursuing these strategies simultaneously at high levels produces negative interaction effects on firm profitability. In addition, the internally developed, firm-specific associate human capital strategically fits better with high levels of expert human-capital leveraging. While lateral hiring helps firms build new knowledge bases and take advantage of growth opportunities, pursuing high levels of both expert human-capital leveraging and lateral hiring of associates results in lower profitability. To fully capture the economic benefits from strategies of diversification, human-capital leveraging and lateral hiring, firms should understand and manage the complex interdependencies among multiple levels of strategy.

AB The paper examines the conceptual history of 'sustainable development', from the Brundtland Commission's definition in 1987 to the present day. It argues that the superficial consensus that has characterized much of the early debate has given way to a series of parallel but distinct discourses around sustainability. The underlying assumptions behind much of the discussion are assessed, as is the move, after the first Earth Summit (1992), to focus on rights, rather than needs, as the principal line of enquiry. This analytical attention to rights is linked to the neo-liberal economic agendas of the 1990s, and the growth of interest in congruent areas, including human security and the environment, social capital, critical natural capital and intellectual property rights. The paper argues that increasing attention to questions of biology and science studies has strengthened this 'rights-based' approach, as well as interest in the linkages between 'natural' and 'human' systems, including attention to questions of environmental justice. It is clear that issues of global environmental justice are as important as they were when the concept of 'sustainable development' was in its infancy, but the new material realities of science and the environment in the 21st century demand a re-engagement with their social consequences, something which is largely ignored by the (market) liberal consensus.

AB This paper questions the rhetorical workings of 'sustainable development' as an ideological construct in contemporary global society. It suggests that this term actually is increasingly used as a label to place over modes of existence that are neither sustainable nor developmental. Yet, the rhetoric is also now a material culture of being that is created, carried and continued in the everyday practices of design, exchange and production.

AB This paper focuses upon the sustainability of the economy in relation to nature and natural ecosystems. There are two main aspects to this relationship: consumption of natural resources; and generation of pollution and wastes because of economic practices of production, exchange and consumption. The paper addresses the extent to which both consumption of natural resources and production of pollution and wastes can be reduced and the economy and its constituent practices and spaces be made more sustainable, recognizing that sustainability involves cultural, political-economic and social dimensions as well as the impact of human activity on nature. A close and critical reading of the literatures on industrial ecology, industrial metabolism and natural capitalism provides an entry point into these issues. These literatures help identify the 'natural limits' to economic practices but are themselves limited in their approach to issues of sustainability. The paper explores these latter limits and their implications. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB According to a specialized research area within environmental sociology - ecological modernization theory - the shift towards seeking to protect the environment constitutes a broadly emergent sociological phenomenon: the radicalization of modernity. The understanding of the fundamentals of such phenomenon is, therefore, crucial for both the practice and theorization of organization and environment. This is the main reason why this paper seeks to incorporate ideas from the disciplines of both environmental sociology and organization theory. By delving into the main sources of dynamism that 'produced' modernity the paper argues that a sustainable organizational practice depends on the incorporation of a special type of radicalism into ecological modernization. The paper anchors its main arguments in research conducted in the European automobile industry - a socio-technical context undergoing ecological modernization. The main conclusions of the paper relate to the nature of the reforms required for organizational practices to facilitate sustainable industrial development.

ID KNOWLEDGE COMMUNITIES
AB This article discusses two projects that were aimed at enhancing the opportunities for professional development of the participants through collaboration between classroom teachers and teacher educators. The two projects, the Australian Project for Enhancing Effective Learning (PEEL) and the Canadian Learning Strategies Group (LSG), focused on the teaching and learning practices in secondary school classrooms. We examine those features that we contend have resulted in long-term sustainability and the success of these partnerships. An analysis of our own experiences and other empirical data from both projects illustrate our claims that these small-scale projects have: improved the learning environment in classrooms for students and teachers; created models of professional development for school and teacher educators; and provided valid knowledge about learning and teaching issues in classroom settings. The potential of such projects to achieve these aims depends upon: (a) a mutually held understanding of what types of classroom practices nurture good teaching and learning, (b) a setting where teachers have a strong commitment and control over the project and decide on its direction, and (c) a structure that allows teachers and teacher educators to meet regularly in an atmosphere of trust and mutual understanding.

TI Reconstruction of Infrastructure in Iraq: end to a means or means to an
   end?
SO THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Infrastructure reconstruction in Iraq was planned as a project-driven straight-line activity. The USA prepared for it for many months on the back of its planned invasion of Iraq. It was predominantly devised as a top-down operation with an assumption of derived benefits to the economy and the population. The plan appeared to be based on the assumption that peace would quickly be restored. The reality was different-rising insurgency led to a slowed rate of reconstruction, thus leading to increasing ambivalence by the Iraqi populace towards the Coalition Provisional Authority as progress fell far short of its expectations. Sustainable infrastructure was perhaps never a prime objective, but the unexpected level of post-war violent conflict saw rebuilding infrastructure as a prime means for creating short-term employment and visible effect, with the intention of diffusing anti-Coalition momentum. This paper will explore the dilemma of facilitating reconstruction for short-term aims and whether in these circumstances it is possible to maintain a long-term vision. It will also analyse to what extent the Iraqi people have genuinely participated in reconstruction plans and whether the eventual outcomes might have been different if a truly participative approach had been taken.

CY SEP 27-29, 2004
CL Abu Dhabi, U ARAB EMIRATES
DE organizations as living systems; operation in stable vs. turbulent
   periods; coping with paradoxes; emergent leadership interventions; power
   of language for transformation
AB Developing human organizations for sustainable excellence requires important adjustments in the way we understand their nature and study their behaviour. The very concept of sustainability requires a view of a human organization as a living entity, in sharp contrast to that of a 'machine- like' creation designed to achieve specific goals. This reflects a critical shift in the mindset of leaders and managers from that of a 'commander' giving orders or a 'mechanic' fixing problems, to one of a 'gardener' preparing the soil for trees or flowers to grow. In such a living systems framework, today's dominant 'command-and-control' approach, typical for human organizations viewed as 'complex machines', must give way to one of development and continual adaptation. Once we adopt a living systems mindset for human organizations, the achievement of sustainable excellence is nourished by creating the following conditions:
   (1) The acceptance of alternating stability and novelty as inevitable in the way nature unfolds like a dance between order and chaos (lack of order), leading to new systems capable of superior adaptation and performance. Living systems thrive only when pushed away from their comfort zone, the area in which they must reconfigure themselves.
   (2) The need to learn to cope with several paradoxes, i.e. seemingly incompatible conditions, or directions of movement. Human organizations in a business ecology setting need to both cooperate and compete, to rely on stable predictable methods in some periods and on novel ways in other periods of rapid change.
   (3) The need to employ both traditional and emergent leadership. The first is needed to articulate and focus on a compelling vision providing a clear sense of direction and a strong motivation to act, the second is needed to stimulate innovation through enriching and strengthening both the nodes and the links of the complex web of human informal networks.
   (4) The development of a new language to communicate effectively new concepts and methods, when previous ways to describe reality prove inadequate. We need new terms, new images and new metaphors to convey the richness and complexity of human organizations as living systems, such as those of self-organization, emergence, and others, much like the new language (browsers, firewalls, etc) needed for using computers or the Internet.

AB The demand for sustaining excellence is related to a lot of issues. In the past, many activities of companies have primarily been led by programmes. As a result, at the very beginning it has been obvious that a programme has a lifespan - and then the next programme will follow. This is not a good precondition for sustainable success. Therefore, different approaches had to be found to gain sustainability based on a continuous improvement process. But again, there are limits if not all relevant target groups are in the focus. As a consequence, this paper deals with the relevance of a stakeholder orientation in a frame of corporate social responsibility as a precondition for sustainability.

AB Organizations are increasingly finding that implementing a certain method is not enough. In order to achieve excellent results, it is necessary to tackle quality in a structured and long-term way. This means that, to start with, it is necessary to concentrate on a thorough planning of how the business has to be developed with a focus on quality. A strategic plan containing all quality related activities has to be developed. In the plan, different concepts, approaches, and methods are combined in such a way that they will lead to good competitiveness and excellent business results. The aim must be to achieve a sustainable excellence.

AB In the modern world, business is viewed as the opportunity for wealth creation and economic growth for jobs and prosperity. However, market-economics depends on the integrity of the organization to function within the values and norms of the society. For sustained growth and business excellence it is necessary to consider environmental and other social concerns. Leadership should demonstrate their business confidence and stick to their moral position as creators of wealth and raising living standards to build trust between their organization and society at large. Business excellence, regarded as the simultaneous satisfaction of key organizational stakeholders, requires the measurement of organizational performance based on the critical success factors of all the stakeholders. If these factors are satisfactory, it will ensure successful competitive performance for the organization. In this paper, Kanji's Business Excellence Measurement system (KBEMS) will be discussed. Through this model, Kanji has provided a multi-dimensional focus that combines a variety of measurements for internal and external stakeholders for the organization. It is value-based, and has a long-term orientation and is dynamic in nature. KBEMS not only achieves a greater degree of integration between the models, but makes use of Systemic and Holistic views. It also provides mathematical and statistical reasoning, which allows identifying the strengths and areas for improvement, while estimating the impact that each dimension has on other components of the system. Finally, it measures all the dimensions of the stakeholders and the organizational performance in order to provide sustainable growth. It also provides a comparison of KBEMS with other models.

AB In recent years, sustainability has become a 'hot topic' and something all organizations want to be seen as being identified with. The twin disciplines of quality and HRM have joined this bandwagon. In HR terms, this has meant a shift in emphasis away from human management to resource management with the argument that organizations need to allow the needs and aspirations of individuals to be placed at the heart of the workplace (Gollan, 2004). However, this does not fit with our knowledge of the reality of the contemporary workplace where downsizing remains the order of the day and there are now concerns as to the effectiveness of the post-downsizing 'anorexic organization'. This paper looks at the debates and raises a number of issues for academics and managers in organizations.

DE protected area tourism; Sri Lankan tourism; religious tourism
AB Tourism in protected areas in Sri Lanka has the potential to provide economic development as well as sources of the funding for maintaining the environmental values of national parks. However, for this to occur it is important tourism is managed in a sustainable manner. This paper uses a case study approach to examine the characteristics and problems associated with tourism in the most popular National Park in Sri Lanka-Ruhuna (Yala). It is clear there are a number of environmental effects arising from tourism that are degrading the natural values of the protected area resulting in lower amenity value for tourists. The problems associated with tourism are exacerbated by the lack of recognition given to the impacts resulting from religious tourists visiting the area and the lack of controls placed on their behaviour within the Park. Management has introduced various measures aimed at alleviating the problems caused by tourism, such as monthly meetings with tour operators and the provision of educational and interpretative material for local people. In addition, there are plans to construct a new road to reduce congestion currently experienced on the Park roads. However, unless funding is increased and more consideration is given to the religious tourists and their impacts, tourism in the Park will not be sustainable. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The endod (Phytolacca dodecandra) -based schistosomiasis mansoni control project was implemented in Ethiopia between 1994 and 1999. The aim was to develop an effective, cheap and sustainable method of controlling schistosomiasis. First, different formulations of the Ethiopian endod strain 44 (E-44) were compared for potency in the laboratory. Secondly, spray and drip-feeding methods were compared for simplicity and effectiveness in the field. Lastly, the efficacy of endod powder soap was compared with the endod spray method. In Bati stream, endod powder soap was distributed to the residents every weekend at Laundry sites. In Worke stream endod was sprayed along a 1 - km stretch of the stream at 3 -month intervals. No endod was applied in Harbu stream. The immediate and long-term effects of endod application on the snail population and schistosomal infection were determined. Using the spray method, 100% snail mortality could be obtained, and it was simpler and more effective than the drip-feeding method. Snail mortality ranged from 20 to 100% using endod soap. There was a progressive decline in the snail population and infection in Bati stream compared with Worke stream, mainly due to sustained use of endod soap. The advantages and disadvantages of the different endod delivery systems are discussed. (c) 2005 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Major changes in research and development (R&D) for drugs to treat tropical and neglected diseases have occurred in the past five years. Public-private partnerships for product development (PD PPPs) have emerged since rising drug development costs pushed pharmaceutical companies out of R&D for these diseases of the developing world and are now having an impact on the discovery and development of new medicines to treat them. PD PPPs can be an efficient model for bridging the translational research gap between basic research and clinical development by bringing together expertise from academia, the pharmaceutical industry and the public sector. Sustainability of funding is a serious problem. At present, one or two key philanthropic organisations provide a large proportion of the funding. Drug development typically takes 10 years and only 10 per cent of initial projects make it into the clinic. The partnerships need to widen their funding base and ensure that the funders understand the high level of attrition. Public-private partnerships have proved that they can move compounds quickly through the R&D pipeline. The challenge is to ensure that the products are delivered to the people who need them and to ensure that scientists in endemic countries are involved in the whole process.

ID NEGLECTED DISEASES; MORTALITY
AB Traditional pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) strategy has failed to address the desperate need for new antimalarial drugs. The populations affected are too poor to attract commercially-driven R&D. Over the last few years, a new model, the public-private partnership for product development, has radically changed the antimalarial R&D landscape. The partnerships bring together academic and industry expertise with funding from governmental, philanthropic and charitable sources. The Medicines for Malaria Venture, a not-for-profit foundation based in Geneva, aims to develop new antimalarials for developing countries through public-private partnership. It is currently managing a portfolio of around 20 projects at various stages of development. However, as in all drug R&D, some of these projects will fail. The portfolio approach helps to maximize the chances of success, but there are obvious challenges, including financial and managerial ones. Proactive management of the two vital interfaces in the drug supply chain is important for success. Upstream, basic research must be aligned with translational research in order to ensure a continuous supply of leads into the development pipeline. Meanwhile, downstream, drug discovery and development must be aligned with access to ensure optimal health impact. All stages require partnership, sustainable financing and the engagement of disease-endemic countries. The recent G8 report on Africa has tent support to mechanisms aimed at improving health and achieving the Millenium Development Goals.

ID BLOOD DONATIONS; SAFETY
AB Throughout the world blood services aim to provide a life-saving service by ensuring an adequate supply of safe blood. However, across the world blood services are at very different levels of development. Consequently, the actions taken in one country or region would not be appropriate in another. This paper aims to identify how suitable solutions can be developed to match the different prevailing circumstances of an individual country or region. In trying to do this it is important to look at the whole of the supply chain within a blood service and identify the part where a change could make the biggest impact. Four key areas are identified that are integral to this. These are the donor, testing of blood, hemovigilance, and overall management arrangements. Whilst the first two have largely been addressed in highly developed countries, there is still much work that could be done in these areas in developing countries. In particular, a move to voluntary nonremunerated donors worldwide would significantly improve overall safety.
   Hemovigilance systems are identified as a powerful tool to influence policy development, yet these are largely under developed throughout the world.
   In order to make high impact and sustainable changes it is important that those in the blood industry across the world work together to improve education and training, to share experience of best practice, and to move to develop agreed standards in transfusion medicine.
   It is imperative that developed countries recognize the importance of working with developing countries if the safety of the global blood supply is to be maintained and improved.

AB This paper presents guidelines that can be used by managers of healthcare facilities to evaluate and assess the quality of resources and waste management at their facilities and enabling the principles of sustainable development to be addressed. The guidelines include the following key aspects which need to be considered when completing an assessment. They are: (a) general management; (b) social issues; (c) health and safety; (d) energy and water use; (e) purchasing and supply; (f) waste management (responsibility, segregation, storage and packaging); (g) waste transport; (h) recycling and re-use; (i) waste treatment; and (j) final disposal. They identify actions required to achieve a higher level of performance which can readily be applied to any healthcare facility, irrespective of the local level of social, economic and environmental development. The guidelines are presented, and the characteristics of facilities associated with sustainable (level 4) and unsustainable (level 0) healthcare resource and wastes management are outlined. They have been used to assess a trial. or London hospital, and this highlighted a number of deficiencies in current practice, including a lack of control over purchasing and supply, and very low rates of segregation of municipal solid waste from hazardous healthcare waste.

TI Analysis of the water resources status in Kuwait

DE desalination; groundwater; wastewater reuse; water scarcity; water

AB The acute lack of natural water resources in Kuwait is indisputable. The country essentially has one limited natural water resource that is groundwater, while the majority of the country's demands are met by seawater desalination. Notwithstanding this scarcity calls for careful foresighted utilization of the water resources, no clear plans is being followed. Attempting to initiate the planning process, this paper gives an assessment of the current status of water resources availability, production, future demand and expected increases in production, in Kuwait. While the desalination and wastewater reuse are only bounded by economical considerations, considerable efforts have already been made in assessing the baseline of the groundwater resources in Kuwait; nonetheless, no estimation is available of the aquifer system potential for sustainable development or even mining. The total water budget in 2001 is estimated at 655 Million m(3), with desalination, groundwater production, and wastewater reuse constituting 59%, 32% and 9% respectively. The projected water demand for 2010 is 1020 Million m(3). The plans of the Ministry of Electricity and Water and the Ministry of Public Works indicated that groundwater would cover 52% of the planned additional production, while desalination and wastewater reuse would cover 44% and 4% respectively. While the proposed increase in groundwater production would inevitably consume the only natural water resource of the country, only 40% of the generated wastewater is to be utilized. The absence of integrated planning is also manifested in the total planned production that surpasses the projected demands by more than 17%.

TI GIS-based groundwater management model for Western Nile Delta
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE Egypt; GIS; groundwater modeling; groundwater management; groundwater
   assessment; Western Nile Delta
AB The limited availability of renewable fresh water is a major constraint on future agriculture and urban development in Egypt. The main water resource that Egypt has been depending on is the River Nile. Nowadays, the role of groundwater is steadily increasing and will cover 20% of the total water supply in the coming decades especially in the reclaimed areas along the desert fringes of the Nile Delta and Valley. Abstraction from groundwater in Egypt is dynamic in nature as it grows rapidly with the expansion of irrigation activities, industrialization, and urbanization. One of these areas is the Western Nile Delta in which the groundwater is exploited in many localities. To avoid the deterioration of the aquifer system in this area, an efficient integrated and sustainable management plan for groundwater resources is needed. Efficient integrated and sustainable management of water resources relies on a comprehensive database that represents the characteristics of the aquifer system and modeling tools to achieve the impacts of decision alternatives.
   In this paper, a GIS-based model has been developed for the aquifer system of the Western Nile Delta. The GIS provides the utilization of analytical tools and visualization capabilities for pre-and post-processing information involved in groundwater modeling for the study area. The developed model was calibrated for steady state and transient conditions against the historical groundwater heads observed during the last 20 yr. The calibrated model was used to evaluate groundwater potentiality and to test two alternative management scenarios for conserving the aquifer system in Western Nile Delta. In the first scenario, reducing the surface water inflow while increasing the annual abstraction from groundwater by about 450 million m(3) and improving the irrigation system could increase the net aquifer recharge by about 5.7% and reduce the aquifer potentiality by about 91%. Constructing a new canal as a second management scenario could increase the annual aquifer potentiality by about 23%. The GIS-based model has been proven to be an efficient tool for formulating integrated and sustainable management plan.

AB This paper presents the first evidence on the impact of governance on outreach and sustainability of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Central and Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States. The results indicate that performance-based compensation of managers is not associated with better-performing MFIs; lower wages suggested for mission-driven organizations worsen outreach, while managers' experience improves performance. The results also identify tradeoffs between MFI outreach and sustainability depending on stakeholders' representation on the board and provide strong support for independent boards with limited employee participation. In the study region, external governance mechanisms seemed to play a limited role. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The results of a study in Sri Lanka combined with a review of the literature provide evidence that Farmer Field Schools (FFS) can contribute to increasing farmers' skills and lowering insecticide use in rice. However, there are questions about their capacity to reach the majority of farmers and little evidence that skills learned are passed to nonparticipants or that an FFS is a likely basis for sustained group activity. The results draw attention to the problems of relying on simple formulas in agricultural programs and point to inadequacies in the assessment of donor projects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Intermittent and mobile surgical services: Logistics and outcomes
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
AB A program of intermittent surgical services utilized a mobile facility to support multiple primary care sites in Ecuador. The fiscal and clinical outcomes of the program were analyzed. From 1994 to 2003 the mobile program responded to requests from 15 of 22 provinces of Ecuador for surgical care. The sites served could not offer permanent surgical care. Criteria for inclusion and follow-up were set. Medical records were kept in accordance with standards of the Ministry of Health. Standards of care and critical care pathways were instituted. The program had a permanent staff supplemented by volunteers. Cases were recorded and outcomes noted with respect to complications. The cost of the surgical aspect of the program was entirely covered by a foundation through donations and public service contracts. Financial records of the foundation were reviewed and the costs analyzed. A total of 4545 operations were done largely in general surgery specialties. The program made 40 to 50 excursions each year and proved to be a stable element of medical care delivery. There were no deaths, four major complications, and three minor complications. The cost per operation was less than $100. Comparison to U.S. and international volunteer organizations are reported. This program of intermittent mobile surgical services in coordination with fixed primary care constitutes a sustainable, high quality clinical program fully integrated into existing care of a national health ministry. In-country resources may provide greatly enhanced services at low cost and should be considered as an alternative.

AB Habitat selection of the cooperative breeding Taiwan Yuhina (Yuhina brunneiceps) in a fragmented forest habitat. Zoological Studies 44(4): 497-504. We used multilevel analyses (individual habitat selection and population structure) to study edge effects on the Taiwan Yuhina (Yuhina brunneiceps), an endemic subtropical species at Meifeng, central Taiwan. The 95% kernel home range area was used to study habitat preferences, and the source-sink threshold was calculated to determine whether this yuhina population is self-sustainable. Within the study site, woods, open spaces, orchards, buildings, and pond habitats were preferred in that order. Within the home ranges, orchard habitats were preferred to open spaces. Larger breeding groups had larger home ranges with more trees and open spaces. Nest sites were closer to forest edges than random points were. The density of Taiwan cherry trees was significantly higher within home ranges than available areas, especially near edges, suggesting the fruit's potential value to breeding yuhinas. Although the yuhinas suffered high rates of nest failure at Meifeng, this population still seemed to be self-sustaining due to the long breeding season with multiple broods and a cooperative breeding strategy.

DE bioethanol production; stillage; starch; digestibility; ecobalance;
   energy balance
AB The production of bioethanol is vindicated because of its potential to reduce CO2 coming from traffic. If bioethanol is produced from renewable energy resources in large-scale distilleries the output: input ratio only has a slightly positive effect. Another method to produce the ethanol which is much more environmentally friendly is sustainable ethanol production. If the ethanol is produced in this way, it is possible to use the fields permanently for ethanol production, as well as to produce ethanol for almost the same price as industrial ethanol production. Even the SO2-equipollent for this bioethanol process becomes positive when the resulting stillage is used to produce biogas.
   Aufhammer et al. (1996) studied the influence of the protein content on the ethanol yield. They pointed out that there is a reciprocally proportional correlation between the protein content and the ethanol yield. However, the con-elation was not very good because the deviation of ethanol yield/100 kg dry substance between the varieties was up to 6%. Another possibility to get an idea whether a cereal is suitable for producing ethanol or not, is to correlate the starch content (determined by the Ewers method) with the ethanol yield. However, this correlation has the same problem as the correlation between the protein content and the ethanol yield. Neither method allows for the digestibility of the starch. They just show how much starch the cereal contains. A better way to get an idea of the digestibility of the starch and to correlate the "starch" with the ethanol yield is to determine the fermentable substance and to correlate it with the ethanol yield.

AB In order to continue to produce livestock in a sustainable fashion, it is suggested that what was used in the past will continue to form the mainstay of future control. For the foreseeable future, we must conserve what we have, and use it in combination with all the principles of integrated pest management, namely strategic and focussed treatments of animals, environmental control of breeding sites, disease management (including the principles of enzootic stability), and resistant breeds. Whilst new technologies, such as the development of vaccines both against the insect pest in some cases or the disease they transmit in others, and genetic engineering hold out some hope for the future; these are not sufficiently well advanced to permit wholesale application.

AB Drug resistance in veterinary helminths affects a growing number of livestock producers on a global basis. The parasites infecting the major species of livestock are presently showing resistance in varying degrees to the commonly used classes of anthelmintics. The degree and extent of this problem especially with respect to multidrug resistance (MDR) in nematode populations is likely to increase. Finding solutions to the spread of resistance requires knowledge of the drugs' modes of action and mechanisms of resistance. This knowledge can then be applied to detect and monitor the state of resistance. Here we present a brief overview of resistance mechanisms and some of the technologies being used to study them. We also discuss some of the strategies for slowing the spread of resistance. The issue of reversal of drug resistance is analysed under consideration of recent progress in the field of MDR reversal in non-infectious diseases. Finally, we propose an application of currently available technologies that could assist in the detection and monitoring of anthelmintic resistance. Taking into account the significant complexity of the genetic mechanism of anthelmintic resistance in and between the various species, we suggest to undertake a co-ordinated effort to systematically identify anthelmintic-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the most important helminth parasites. Monitoring the state of resistance in field populations could be achieved with a SNP-based protocol for genotyping the many genes known or suspected to contribute to the modes of action or mechanisms of resistance to the various classes of anthelmintics. If significant associations between genotypes and phenotypes exist within a species, then a single test with sufficient SNPs could potentially have universal applicability. These could then be explored for the development of new molecular diagnostic procedures. New classes of anthelmintics are needed, but until they are developed and available to the producers, technology can assist to achieve the goal of better sustainability in anthelmintic usage.

AB Sustaining productivity in short-rotation forest plantations over multiple rotations can be problematic, when nutrient inputs to soil are small compared to exports off-site during harvest. For example, there are concerns about sustained productivity of Eucalyptus globulus plantations growing on ex-pasture land in south-western Australia because nitrogen (N) inputs from fertilisation and leguminous species are low. One way of improving the N balance of the plantation system is through retention of tree residues produced during harvest operations. We used the Generic Decomposition And Yield (G'DAY) model of Carbon (C) and N cycling in plant and soil to investigate the relationship between soil N fertility and stem productivity when E. globulus planted on legume-based pasture land is grown over twenty 8-year rotations under different scenarios of harvest residue and N management. The scenarios included stemwood harvesting with retention of harvest residues, denoted "single slash" (SS), double the amount of harvest residues, denoted "double slash" (DS), no harvest residue (NS), burning of harvest residues and tree litter (B) and addition of fertiliser N equal to N removed in stemwood harvest (F). We parameterised and tested G'DAY using data from a field experiment conducted at two second-rotation E. globulus plantation sites with contrasting productivity. Experimental treatments at these sites included SS, DS, NS and B. With the model we were able to accurately reproduce observed stemwood growth of second-rotation stands for all treatments at both sites (r = 0.99). Model simulations overestimated soil N mineralisation at the more productive site (relative error, E, ranged from -14 to -24), and underestimated it at the less productive site (+5 < E < +25). In the long-term scenario simulations we found that the rate of decline in stemwood productivity is sensitive to rates of N removal in harvested stem and to residue management. Simulations suggest that retention of harvest residues is helpful for maintaining stand productivity, but that applications of fertiliser N will be necessary to maintain current levels of productivity in the long term. We also compare G'DAY with the graphical method for quantifying sustainable forest yield of Dewar and McMurtrie [Dewar, R.C., McMurtrie, R.E., 1996.

AB A dynamic model was developed to simulate nitrogen (N) excretion in growing-finishing cattle simply and intuitively. The principle of the model is that N excretion equals N intake minus N retained in the body. N retained in the body can be easily obtained as the difference of N content between final and initial body weights. If daily N intake is known, the dynamic model can be used to predict N excretion at any time of the growing cycle until harvested; if N intake is unknown, simulated N excretion (SNE) can be predicted on the basis of the initial shrunk body weight and shrunk body weight gain (SWG), using simulated N intake based on the protein requirement of beef cattle. Data obtained from four experiments were used to verify the suitability of the model for the growing-finishing cattle industry. The results showed the validity of the proposed model for different breeds of growing-finishing cattle with different frame sizes and sexes through the utilisation of equivalent empty body weight, with the presupposition that the diet is perfectly balanced or that protein is the first limiting growth factor. To minimise actual N excretion, nutrient requirements of growing-finishing cattle in specific situations need to be studied precisely and SWG need to be controlled in agreement with the predicted average daily gain frequently. The proposed model can be used by policy makers and farmers to organise animal production activities to maintain economic balance and sustainable environmental practices. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI A fuzzy logic approach for evaluating ecosystem sustainability
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
DE fuzzy logic; ecosystems; strong sustainability
AB Conventional approaches for assessing the strong sustainability of ecosystems are based on crisp sets for ecosystem attributes or indicators of sustainability, such as regional income, biodiversity and water quality. Defining strong sustainability in terms of crisp sets for attributes presumes the ecosystem manager can make a sharp, unambiguous distinction between an ecosystem that is strongly sustainable and one that is not by comparing measured attributes to sustainability thresholds for those attributes. Making such fine distinctions is incompatible with the uncertainties inherent in ecosystem assessments, and could give rise to faulty or misleading conclusions. An alternative approach for evaluating strong sustainability is proposed that uses fuzzy sets to develop fuzzy propositions about ecosystem attributes and strong sustainability, and applies fuzzy logic to evaluate those propositions. Two kinds of fuzzy propositions are evaluated; unconditional and qualified, and conditional and qualified. While a fuzzy logic approach overcomes the limitation of basing sustainability assessments on crisp sets for the attributes, its implementation requires more information than conventional approaches. In particular, evaluation of unconditional and qualified propositions requires the ecosystem manager to: (1) specify fuzzy sets for all attributes and probability qualifiers; (2) estimate the frequency distribution for ecosystem attributes; and (3) develop a rule for inferring strong sustainability from fuzzy propositions. Evaluation of conditional and qualified propositions requires the ecosystem manager to: (1) specify the prior probability the ecosystem is strongly sustainable; (2) define fuzzy sets for combinations of attribute values and probability qualifiers; (3) estimate the joint frequency distribution for ecosystem attributes; and (4) develop a rule for inferring strong sustainability from fuzzy propositions. An ecosystem manager needs to weigh the advantages of a fuzzy logic approach in terms of overcoming the limitation of conventional approaches against the disadvantage of greater informational requirements.

TI Sedimentation problems and management strategies of Sanmenxia Reservoir,
   Yellow River, China
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Reservoir sedimentation management is of critical importance for the sustainable development of surface water resources. Sanmenxia Dam, located on the middle reach of the Yellow River, in China, is notorious for its severe sedimentation problems. Because of the alarming rate of loss of reservoir storage capacity and the unacceptable negative impact induced by the rapid upstream extension of sediment deposited in the river's backwater region, the dam has been reconstructed to provide high sediment releasing capacity, and the dam operation has been changed in order to achieve a balance between sediment inflow and outflow. As a result, the dam is still providing the basin with flood control, irrigation, and hydropower generation, even though some benefits are lower than the original design. Complex sedimentation processes in response to the dam reconstruction and changes of dam operation are discussed in this paper. The engineering experiences and management practices of Sanmenxia Dam are valuable assets to the sustainable use of reservoirs built on sediment-laden rivers.

AB Disease resistance strategies are powerful approaches to sustainable agriculture because they reduce chemical input into the environment. Recently, Piriformospora indica, a plant-root-colonizing basidiomycete fungus, has been discovered in the Indian Thar desert and was shown to provide strong growth-promoting activity during its symbiosis with a broad spectrum of plants [Verma, S. et al. (1998) Mycologia 90, 896-903]. Here, we report on the potential of A indica to induce resistance to fungal diseases and tolerance to salt stress in the monocotyleclonous plant barley. The beneficial effect on the defense status is detected in distal leaves, demonstrating a systemic induction of resistance by a root-endophytic fungus. The systemically altered "defense readiness" is associated with an elevated antioxidative capacity due to an activation of the glutathione-ascorbate cycle and results in an overall increase in grain yield. Because P. indica can be easily propagated in the absence of a host plant, we conclude that the fungus could be exploited to increase disease resistance and yield in crop plants.

AB This paper presents an overview of SALTMED, a project whose goal was to increase productivity and sustainability of irrigated cropping of tomato on salt-prone land. The tomato variety Floradade, identified as having good salt tolerance, was grown in Egypt and Syria over 3 years with either drip or furrow irrigation using either blended saline and fresh water or the cyclical application of fresh and then saline water. In Egypt, fruit yield and fruit number were highest with the combination of drip irrigation and blended water. In Syria, tomato yield under drip irrigation was also higher than that under furrow irrigation and tomato yield decreased with increasing salinity of the irrigation water. SALTMED, a mathematical model that incorporated evapotranspiration, plant water uptake and solute transport, crop yield and biomass production was developed. There was good agreement between simulated and observed yield in Syria and Egypt over 3 years, confirming the value of SALTMED as a tool for use by experts in the management of salt-prone irrigation systems.
   The effects of salinity on growth and yield of tomato varieties growing in a greenhouse in Spain were also investigated. Salinity reduced the commercial yield, mainly clue to a decrease in fruit weight and to a lesser extent by a reduction in fruit number and by increasing blossom end rot in fruits. Evaluation of pre-treatment of seedlings with drought or salinity in the laboratory demonstrated that tomato plants 'haloconditioned' at the 3-5-day-old stage produced more shoot and root biomass than non-conditioned control plants. The physiological traits, 'root Na selectivity', 'leaf tissue tolerance', 'leaf-to-leaf tolerance' and the 'K/Na ratio' were evaluated as tools for breeding varieties with enhanced tolerance to salt. Selectivity and K/Na appeared to he the most promising characters for breeding purposes. Heritability of physiological traits was estimated in a set of 135 F-8 recombinant inbred lines from a cross between Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium and L. esculentum, Heritabilities of water use efficiency (WUE) were particularly high, in berth control and saline conditions.

AB In order to asses the effects of management on crop production to obtain a better understanding of irrigation with saline irrigation water (similar to 8 dS/m) and the role of crop tolerance to salinity, many experiments were conducted at Deir AlZoor Station (ACSAD, Syria) in the period (1999-2002), using mixing and alternating (cyclic) irrigation management, traditional furrow and drip irrigation methods, different water qualities, and different tomato varieties. New and improved equipment was used to monitor soil salinity, soil water content, and other soil-plant-water properties. The results showed higher water use efficiency with drip irrigation over the traditional methods, higher yields of salt tolerant tomato varieties, obtained by plant breeding using DNA marker technology, over the local varieties, higher sugar content of tomato fruit grown using saline irrigation water compared with that irrigated with non-saline (similar to 1 dS/m) water. Moreover, the obtained soil and plant parameters were used to validate the SALTMED Model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the Mediterranean climate, rainfed cereal crops are planted in autumn and harvested in late spring, relying on the rains during this period for the conclusion of their cycle; the vagaries of rains, however, often put at risk the final harvest. The present research was aimed at investigating the possibility of applying supplemental irrigation to wheat and barley during their sensitive phenophases of flowering and seed formation using brackish water with salinity levels generally considered too high for its use (EC of 3-9 dS/m). Results showed the possibility of Securing high yield. with mean reductions of only 21% in barley and 25% in wheat compared to the fully, fresh-water irrigated control, through the application of limited amounts of brackish water. The sustainability of the practice is presumably high, due to the limited amounts of added Salts, which can be easily leached out even by a modest precipitation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Increasing the productivity of water and making sate use of poor quality waters in agriculture will play a vital role in easing competition for scarce water resources, prevention of environmental degradation and provision of food security. Driven by the pressure to produce more, even the saline and alkali waters are being increasingly diverted to irrigated agriculture. Development of salinity. sodicity and toxicity problems in soils not only reduces crop productivity and quality but also limit the choice of crops. There are two major approaches to improving and sustaining productivity in a saline environment: modifying the environment to quit the plant and modifying the plant to suit the environment, but the former has been tried more extensively. The available options are mediated through the management of crops/sequences, irrigation water, chemical/amendments and other cultural practices but all must be integrated as per the site specific needs and achieving higher yields on sustainable basis. Some important interventions include appropriate crop/variety selection, blending saline/alkali and fresh water to keep the resultant salinity below threshold, or their cyclic application by scheduling irrigation with salty water at less salt sensitive stages. At the farm/irrigation system level, policy measures like re-allocation of water to higher value crops and those with limited irrigation requirement, spatial re-allocation and transfer of water, adopting policies that favor development of water markets and adequate utilization of groundwater can help in improving water productivity in saline environments. The other viable options include salinity tolerant agro-forestry systems and bio-saline agriculture. Besides technological advances, peoples' participation and favorable water use and allocation policies need to be put in place for sustainable use of saline/alkali waters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Co-evolutionary theories from the biological sciences have been widely adopted by researchers in other fields of research. We take the unusual step of looking beyond the more recent literature of the 1960s to co-evolutionary models from the nineteenth century. We argue that the Darwin-Huxley synthesis was unusual and that obscuring this distinctiveness merely represents conventional ideas about complexity, uncertainty and co-dynamic change in an unfamiliar form. The price we pay for this new interpretation is a degradation of insight and potential applicability in the field of competitive, sustainable development. By advocating a pragmatic distinction of evolutionary from mechanistic dynamics, we make connections between co-evolutionary theory and earlier research on complex dynamics, particularly in respect of socio-natural adaptability. Practical advice is given to help researchers distinguish co-evolutionary dynamics from more general co-dynamic processes, and policy instruments for managing co-evolutionary stress are outlined.

AB To study societal and biophysical constraints on sustainability, we present an extension of the neoclassical growth model with two new concepts: allocation of natural capital and dematerialisation. We consider that anthropogenic environmental impact is correlated with the material throughput of the economy (materialisation) and that, due to composition change and innovation, this throughput can be reduced-the process of dematerialisation. We also consider that the allocation of natural capital to production negatively affects the endogenous dynamics of ecosystems, reducing the total amount of environmental services ecosystems provide. According to our model, it is possible to achieve unbounded economic growth by keeping the natural system in steady state. Balanced growth, however, is only possible for special parameter values.

ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION PATTERNS
AB The use of fossil energy is one of the major environmental problems associated with tourism and travel. Consequently, the need to limit fossil energy use has been highlighted as a precondition for achieving sustainable tourism development. However, tourism is also one of the most important sectors of the world economy, and fears have thus been expressed by the tourist industry and its organisations that increasing energy prices (for example, as a result of eco-taxes) could substantially decrease the economic welfare of countries and destinations. In this article, the interplay of environmental damage and economic gains is thus analysed within the context of tourism. Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions are assessed in relation to the revenues generated, allowing for conclusions about the eco-efficiency of tourism. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The analysis of the linkages between development policies and social and environmental variables is a neglected area within the development literature. This paper focuses on the key interrelations among the economic, social and environmental elements of the sustainable development triangle. A thorough review is undertaken of both social and environmental policies in Chile, underlining important economic growth and reforms. Using the static CGE model ECOGEM-Chile, the economywide impacts of several environmental, social and combined policies are simulated for the Chilean economy. Six different policies are simulated-three environmental policies that impose different taxes on PM10, SO2 and NO2 emissions, respectively; the same tax on PM 10 in a context of high unemployment; one social policy that increases government transfers to households; and a mixed social-environmental policy package where the environmental tax on PM10 and the social transfer policy are simulated simultaneously. The results show that environmental tax policies may have negative social effects, using real disposable income by quintiles as proxy. The impacts depend on the use of the new revenues and the status of employment. Taxing PM 10 emission yields better environmental results than taxing SO2 and NO2. Social policies do not show negative environmental impacts. Combined environmental and social policies improve results. Thus, specific compensating social policies would improve environmental policy acceptance, while also reducing poverty or strong income distribution disparities. The evidence suggests that environmental policies may have social impacts, but not vice versa. The results show that the ECOGEM-Chile model is useful for analyzing systematically and holistically, different economywide policies and their impact on the Chilean economy. Winners and losers may be identified, as well as the potential magnitude of gains and losses. The results obtained are not all straightforward, due to indirect effects.

AB Vanadia photocatalyzes the oxidation of aniline to azobenzene in ethanol. The reaction was studied using natural sunlight and UV irradiation (365 nm) as a function of [aniline], catalyst loading, airflow rate, solvent composition, etc. The photocatalyst exhibits sustainable catalytic activity. The product formation is greater with illumination at 254 nm than at 365 nm. Electron donors such as triphenylphosphine, diphenylamine, and hydroquinone enhance the photocatalysis. The singlet oxygen quencher azide ion fails to inhibit the catalysis. The photocatalysis takes place in both protic and aprotic solvents. The mechanism of photocatalysis is discussed and the product formation analyzed using a kinetic model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Certificate-of-need regulation in outpatient surgery and specialty care:
   Implications for plastic surgeons
SO PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY

   SAFETY; COMPLICATIONS; MORTALITY; QUALITY; VOLUME; HOSPITALS
AB For plastic surgeons, independent development of outpatient surgical centers and specialty facilities is becoming increasingly common. These facilities serve as important avenues not only for increasing access and efficiency but in maintaining a sustainable, competitive specialty advantage. Certificate of Need regulation represents a major hurdle to plastic surgeons who attempt to create autonomy in this fashion. At the state level, Certificate of Need programs were initially established in an effort to reduce health care costs by preventing unnecessary capital outlays for facility expansion (i.e., managing supply of health care resources) in addition to assisting with patient safety and access to care. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of Certificate of Need regulations on health care costs, patient safety, and access to care and to discuss specific implications of these regulations for plastic surgeons. Within Certificate of Need states, these regulations have done little, if anything, to control health care costs or affect patient safety. Presently, Certificate of Need effects coupled with recent provisions in the Medicare Modernization Act banning development of specialty hospitals may restrict patient access to ambulatory surgical and specialty care. For the plastic surgeon, these effects not only act as an economic barrier to entry but can threaten the efficiencies gained from providing surgical care in an ambulatory setting. An appreciation of these effects is critical to maintaining specialty autonomy and access to fiscal policy.

AB In south Asian countries, production fatigue has been observed as yields which have started declining or stagnating under long-term experiments in multiple cropping systems due to continuous cultivation. We examined the potential impact of continuous cultivation of crops in rotation, and fertilizer and manure application on yield trends, soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, soil quality parameters (active fractions of SOC in particular) and sustainable yield index (SYI). Crop rotations included in the study were: rice-wheat-jute, soybean-wheat and sorghum-wheat system at Barrackpore (Typic Eutrochrept), Ranchi (Typic Haplustalf) and Akola (Typic Haplustert), respectively. Field treatments included unfertilized (control), 100% N, 100% NP, 100% NPK and 100% NPK + FYM. The negative yield trend was observed in unbalanced use of inorganic N and NP application at all the three sites. The positive yield trend was observed in the NPK and NPK + FYM treatments at Ranchi and Akola. However, significantly negative-yield trends were observed in these treatments at Barrackpore under rice-based system. Results showed that the SOC in the unfertilized plot (control) decreased by 41.5, 24.5, and 15.5% compared to initial values in Barrackpore, Ranchi and Akola, respectively, wherein the treatment receiving NPK and NPK + FYM either maintained or improved it over initial SOC content in these sites. The estimated annual C input values in NPK + FYM treatments were 4392, 4159 and 3113 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in rice-wheat-jute, sorghum-wheat and soybean-wheat system, respectively. Active fractions of SOC, viz., water-soluble carbon and hydrolysable carbohydrates, soil microbial biomass C and N, dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activity, improved significantly with the application of NPK and NPK + FYM. The content of SOC significantly (p <= 0.05) correlated with SYI and active fractions of SOC, which support better sustainable productivity. Results suggest that current fertilizer recommendations of 100% recommended NPK are adequate for maintaining SOC and its active fractions as well. The causes of yield decline are mostly location specific but depletion of SOC and its active fractions seems to be a general cause. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New Zealand is committed to developing sustainable forest management practices as evidenced through Government involvement in international forestry agreements such as the Montreal Process, and the forestry sector's adoption of forest certification mechanisms. In support of this commitment, it has been identified that there is little quantitative evidence of the interactions of plantation forestry on site quality and long-term site productivity. To address this issue, a nationwide study of site quality was initiated at 35 key sites covering the range of edaphic and environmental conditions representing the productivity envelope for New Zealand plantation forests. At each location, within the productivity envelope, eight short-term site quality plots were planted at a very high stand density (40,000 sterns ha(-1)) to rapidly identify key soil indicators of growth which may be useful for determining site sustainability. In addition, a permanent sample plot was established by planting seedlings at conventional stern densities (500-1100 sterns ha(-1)). At each site, a factorial design was applied with the following three factors: species (Pinus radiata and Cupressus lusitanica), fertiliser (no fertiliser and nutrients Supplied in excess of crop demands) and disturbance (low and high disturbances). After two years of increment, initial analyses are presented which partition treatment and site effects on increment and identify key soil properties that influence increment of the two species. Volume increment over the two-year period was most strongly influenced by site, ranging 50-fold and 15-fold across sites for C. lusitanica and P. radiata, respectively. For the treatments, species accounted for most of the variance in increment, with mean volume increment across all sites of P. radiata significantly exceeding that of C. lusitaltica by 56%. Fertilisation also significantly influenced volume increment inducing mean gains of 30%. Disturbance had a significant, but Comparatively weak effect, reducing mean volume increment by 9%. After correction had been made for environment (temperature and rainfall), soil properties that were most strongly related to Volume increment for both species included CN ratio, total soil nitrogen, total soil phosphorus, organic phosphorus and depth of the A horizon. When soil properties were included in combination, the best predictive models of volume increment formulated for both species included rainfall, temperature, the product of total soil nitrogen and total soil phosphorus and depth of the A horizon.

AB We investigate the effect of subsistence harvesting on the ecological status of the pole-size tree component of the understorey at the Ongoye Forest Reserve (OFR; 2611 ha), Kwa-Zulu-Natal province, South Africa. Using generalised linear modelling (GLM) we examine the ecological and social correlates of species preference and harvest intensity. Data were collected from 22 strip transects (5 in x 300 m; 0.15 ha). Only 11.6% of the available pole-size trees (2 cm < DBH < 15 cm) were harvested, mostly for building materials. No instance of canopy tree logging was recorded. Sixty-eight species were identified; however, only seven species (82% of harvested sterns) were preferred: Englerophytum natalense (33%), Garcinia gerrardii (19%), Drypetes gerrardii (9%), Tabernaemontana ventricosa (9%), Rinorea angtistifolia (4%), Oxyanthus speciostis (4%), and Chrysophyllum viridifolium (4%). Size-class distributions for these seven species were inverse J-shaped, typical of fine-grained species that regenerate over small spatial scales, suggesting that current harvesting intensities may be sustainable. Pole-size stem density was significantly similar among residual stands in harvested areas (2014 +/- 31 stems ha(-1)) suggestive of a stern-density harvest threshold below which further effort was unprofitable. The number of harvested sterns increased with increasing stem availability across species and stem size-classes. Small size-classes (2-5 cut DBH) were harvested most intensely, followed by the intermediate (5-10 cm) and the large (10-15 cm) size-classes, for all species except C. viridifolium. For the latter, the harvesting intensity was greatest for the 10-15 cm size-class. Lastly, harvest intensity was greatest in those areas closest to households near the reserve boundary but was not affected by household density. Although subsistence harvesting at the OFR appears to be sustainable at current levels, we note that similar harvest intensities of pole-sized sterns in studies from smaller forests (<60 ha) led to local extinction of tree species. In addition, because the dominant understorey species at OFR are almost exclusively harvested, the mid- to long-term effects of this harvesting preference on forest dynamics must be assessed to develop sound ecological forest management policies.

AB In this paper we shall show the first data on the level of Cerambyx spp. beetle damage and the subsequent Biscogniauxia mediterranum (De Not) Kunze fungus infection in the Extremadura region (southwestern Spain). Our results indicate a strong correlation between damage, caused by bad cork removal and pruning practices (injuries that cannot heal and permit the attack of insects), and holes made by beetles (r = 0.86). The relationship between holes and subsequent Biscogniaxia infection was r = 0.91. Different regression models have been proposed in order to find mathematical equations applied to forest health monitoring of wide areas. Additionally, we show the evolution in infection after 14 years in the four different areas. The results indicate an increase in damage by Cerambyx and Biscogniauxia infection after this period. Significant differences were found when comparing the four areas suggesting that local factors can be affecting these pests. Finally, we discuss the possible influence of different sociological, economic and agricultural factors on the management and conservation of Quercus suber forests in southwestern Spain and we propose possible solutions to integrate biological conservation and economic benefits of a sustainable cork industry associated with these Mediterranean forests.

AB Water resources of a country constitute one of its vital assets. India receives annual precipitation of about 4000 km(3). The rainfall in India shows very high spatial and temporal variability and paradox of the situation is that Mousinram near Cherrapunji, which receives the highest rainfall in the world, also suffers from a shortage of water during the non-rainy season, almost every year. The total average annual flow per year for the Indian rivers is estimated as 1953 km(3). The total annual replenishable groundwater resources are assessed as 432 km(3). The annual utilizable surface water and groundwater resources of India are estimated as 690 km(3) and 396 km(3) per year, respectively. With rapid growing population and improving living standards the pressure on our water resources is increasing and per capita availability of water resources is reducing day by day. Due to spatial and temporal variability in precipitation the country faces the problem of flood and drought syndrome. Over-exploitation of groundwater is leading to reduction of low flows in the rivers, declining of the groundwater resources, and salt water intrusion in aquifers of the coastal areas. Over canal-irrigation in some of the command areas has resulted in waterlogging and salinity. The quality of surface and groundwater resources is also deteriorating because of increasing pollutant loads from point and non-point sources. The climate change is expected to affect precipitation and water availability. So far, the data collection, processing, storage and dissemination have not received adequate attention. The efforts initiated under the Hydrology Project Phase-I and the development of the Decision Support System proposed under Hydrology Project Phase-II are expected to bridge some of the gaps between the developed advanced technologies of water resources planning, designing and management and their field applications. The paper presents availability and demands of water resources in India as well as describes the various issues and strategies for developing a holistic approach for sustainable development and management of the water resources of the country. It also highlights integration of the blue and green flows and concepts of virtual water transfer for sustainable management of the water resources for meeting the demands of the present, without compromising the needs of future generations.

AB With rapid growth in population, urbanization, industrialization and competition for economic development, groundwater resource has become vulnerable to depletion and degradation. Management of this valuable resource is determined by its accessibility and utilisability in terms of quantity and quality. Due to imbalance between demand and availability, management approaches are facing various ethical dilemmas. For an effective, efficient and sustainable groundwater resources development and management, the planners and decision makers have future challenges to assess the inextricable logical linkages between water policies and ethical consideration. In this context, some key issues on groundwater ethics, which are crucial for its protection have been described.

AB Ambient-cured polyesteramide (APEA) coating resin synthesized from dihydroxy fatty amide obtained from linseed oil, a sustainable resource, and poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride), a bifunctional acid component, was found to exhibit improved physicomechanical and anticorrosive properties. The structural elucidation of APEA resin has been carried out by FTIR, H-1-NMR, and C-13-NMR spectroscopies. The physicomechanical and chemical resistance properties were investigated by standard methods. The corrosion resistance performance was evaluated in acid, alkali, and organic solvent. The thermal behavior was studied by TGA technique. A comparative study of these properties of APEA with reported baked polyesteramide (PEA) coatings was carried out. A remarkable improvement in the drying property of APEA was observed. The APEA coatings also showed improved physicomechanical and anticorrosive properties as compared to the baked PEA coatings.

AB This study re-evaluates 13 out of 48 subjects involved in a trichinellosis outbreak that occurred in Central Italy (Umbria Region) in 1988 resulting from the consumption of raw boar meat harboring Trichinella britovi. During the outbreak, 28 of 48 serologically positive subjects were asymptomatic, whereas 20 subjects presented one or more clinical signs including but not limited to fever, myalgia, periorbital oedema and conjunctivitis. Several patients were hospitalized with severe clinical signs requiring treatment with mebendazole and corticosteroids. Upon re-evaluation of 13 patients, none presented clinical signs; however, three still had increased CPK or LDH serum levels with some signs of electromyographic changes. In this study, enzyme immunoassays (EIA) were used to test the 13 positive sera for reactivity with T britovi antigens using both excretory/ secretory (E/S) antigens and a synthetic antigen composed of P-tyvelose conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Western blots (WB) were also carried out using a commercial kit. Studies using EIA with E/S antigen identified five positive sera; however, using beta-tyvelose as antigen, only one positive sample was identified. Nearly all sera reacted positively with one or more Trichinella antigens when analyzed by WB, in particular to the 45 kDa beta-tyvelose containing glycoprotein. Results indicate that T britovi, though less pathogenic than other Trichinella species, is clearly capable of inducing sustainable sequelae. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research teams from five countries, Brazil, China, Kenya, Peru and Thailand, have initiated a policy-maker survey on vaccine delivery, cost studies for future HIV vaccination programmes, and associated simulation modeling exercises analysing the relative cost-effectiveness of potential HIV vaccination strategies. The survey assesses challenges and opportunities for future country-level HIV vaccination strategies, providing data on the vaccine characteristics (e.g. vaccine efficacies for susceptibility, infectiousness and disease progression) and vaccination programme strategies to be considered in the cost-effectiveness modeling analyses. The study will provide decision-makers with modeling data on vaccination policy considerations that will assist in developing country-level capacities for future HIV vaccine policy adoption and effective delivery systems, and will help delineate the long-term financial requirements for sustainable HIV vaccination programmes. The WHO-UNAIDS HIV Vaccine Initiative and the collaborating researchers welcome comments or questions from policy makers, health professionals and other stakeholders in the public and private sectors about this effort to help advance policy and capacity related to future potential HIV vaccines.

AB Vegetative cover plays an important role for the quality of soil especially in hilly and mountainous areas such as Azad Jammu and Kashmir where erosion is a major threat to the ecosystem and productivity. The study focuses on the impact of land-use types on soil quality by measuring the differences in chemical and physical properties at three sites in adjacently located natural forest land ( forest), fallow grassland ( grass) and arable land ( arable). Soil samples from 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm depth were collected and examined for particle distribution, dry bulk density, organic matter ( OM), pH, macro- and micro-nutrients. Land-use types had a significant effect on primary soil particle distribution. Highest clay content was found in forest and highest sand content in arable. Forest had relatively the highest levels of OM, macro- and micro-nutrients and arable the lowest. Most of the properties of the 0 - 15 cm surface level of grass were similar to those observed in the 15 - 30 cm level in forest. Arable exhibited lowest nutrient status and poorest physical conditions, indicating a degrading effect of arable cultivation practices on soil. Grass and arable showed, compared to forest, a 30 - 60% average increase in bulk density and 26 - 66% average decrease in OM. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation of OM with available phosphorus and potassium while it had negative correlation with dry bulk density and pH. Natural vegetation appeared to be a main contributor of soil quality as it maintained the organic carbon stock, and increased the nutrient status of soil and is therefore important for sustainable development of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and other similar areas. Furthermore, OM was shown to be an important indicator of soil quality.

AB This paper describes the ways in which older people contribute to their communities and families as informal volunteers. It challenges current ways of thinking that assign an economic value to the productive activities undertaken by older people. Using qualitative data from a study of older people resident in Queensland, Australia, the paper explores the ways that older people contribute to their families and to the community and the outcomes associated with these activities. Two specific themes emerged from the data: first, the ways' in which older people contribute to strong inter-generational relations, and second, how they provide essential mutual support that permits many older people to remain living in the community. These contributions, while often small in themselves, are in aggregate critical both to family functioning and to the maintenance of sustainable and healthy communities. Many are reciprocal interactions that add value to the lives of individuals and offer positive social roles in later life, and they may be particularly important for those from minority cultural backgrounds or at risk of social isolation. The findings suggest that older people are integral to community and civil society and, therefore, that social policy should respond to the ageing of Australia's population and recognise the positive contributions of older people, rather than emphasising the costs of demographic change.

AB This paper introduces the special issue, which deals with local rural people's responses to external and internal pressures brought about by global change processes. The contributions are grouped in three categories: (1) Deforestation, land use change and local management systems, including papers on the spread of an alien wattle species in South Africa, large scale forest conservation and rehabilitation in China and consequences of government efforts to reverse deforestation in Indonesia; (2) Subsistence farming and cash crop interaction, addressed by two articles on swidden systems in Malaysia and Indonesia; and (3) Land use change and income diversification, which includes two contributions on changing livelihoods of farmers in Tanzania and Papua New Guinea and one paper developing a method for identifying and mapping the spatial distribution of farming systems in Vietnam. All articles were originally presented at an International Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2003, under the auspices of the Danish University Consortium on Environment and Development-Sustainable Land Use and Natural Resource Management (DUCED SLUSE).

   invasive alien or a natural resource?

AB An investigation into the spread of two alien wattle species (Acacia mearnsii and Acacia dealbata) in rural parts of the Drakensberg region of South Africa and the importance of the trees to the livelihoods of the local communities was carried out. With the aid of aerial photography two plots near the village were selected. Wattle aerial cover increased from 7% and 20% in the two plots, respectively, in 1953, over 21% and 33% in 1975, to 48% and 58% in 2000. In 1995, a government-sponsored national programme, "Working for Water" was established, with the expressed purpose of employing people described as being from the poorest and disadvantaged rural communities to clear areas of invasive alien species from river catchments and water courses. Whilst the programme provides an income to thousands of families in rural areas, it may also be jeopardising the livelihoods of the same communities.
   The wattle is an important resource for village households; virtually all households used it as their primary heat source and for building materials. Other uses included medicine extraction and 20% of the interviewed households gained income from selling firewood.
   From the rural communities' perception, the greatest concern regarding the alien species is its high water consumption (although this did not affect them directly), and the fact that it provides cover to thieves and criminals. Consequently, most villagers wanted either a reduction of the wattle stands (58% and 86% in the 2001 and 2003 study, respectively), or that they remained as at present (42% and 10%, respectively).
   Leaves from woody legumes have demonstrated large potential as green manures and fodder providers in many agroecosystems. The abundance of the wattle in the study area suggested an exploration of alternative beneficial uses in the low input farming systems practiced. The wattle's potential as green manure was evaluated in a decomposition trial. In all treatments, the wattle litter immobilised nitrogen from soil, in spite of a high N content of the litter. Plant available P increased in soil after 4-5 months of incubation.
   We argue that the current practice of externally funded wattle control is not sustainable in the long term. We discuss alternative approaches with a higher level of community participation and ownership, and conclude that the current underutilization of land may, ironically, be one of the largest constraints for a viable solution to the spread of wattle.

ID SHIFTING CULTIVATION; AGRICULTURE
AB A past study in Sarawak, Malaysia (Cramb, R.A., 1993. Shifting cultivation and sustainable agriculture in East Malaysia: a longitudinal case study. Agricultural Systems 42, 209226) found among smallholder farmers a mutual buffer effect between price fluctuations in cash crops (black pepper, Piper nigrum L. and pararubber, Hevea brasiliensis M.-Arg.) and swidden or shifting cultivation of hill rice. The recent rise in international prices for black pepper provides an opportunity to test the generality of Cramb's original findings. For about three years beginning in 1997 and concomitant with the Asian economic crisis, smallholders throughout Southeast Asia responded to the price rises by investing more labour into existing pepper gardens, as well as planting new gardens. Here, we compare the response of Than pepper smallholders to this situation on either side of the international border separating Sarawak, Malaysia and West Kalimantan, Indonesia, with special attention to Cramb's findings. The mutual buffering capacity of hill rice cultivation and pepper/rubber farming described by Cramb is less evident in the study communities. The primary reasons that may account for the lack of fit revolve around the extent of pepper cultivation, availability of credit or subsidy, competition with labour in hill swiddens, and presence of nearby alternatives to earn cash.

ID HOUSEHOLD INCOME DIVERSIFICATION; AFRICA
AB Since the establishment of oil palm land settlement schemes (LSSs) in West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea, the settler population has increased significantly as second-generation settlers marry and raise families on their parents' blocks. We explore how settlers are responding to demographic and socio-economic change in an environment in which opportunities for land-use change are limited. In the context of rising population pressure, LSS smallholders are developing innovative livelihood strategies by pursuing non-farm income sources, increasing food production, acquiring additional land and migration. The type of migration or land accumulation strategy depends on household access to various resources, especially social and kinship networks, and capital. Agricultural extension and rural development policies have not yet responded to this socio-agronomic transformation. We conclude that economic diversification amongst smallholders creates new opportunities for the oil palm industry to formulate more innovative and sustainable policies that strengthen the oil palm industry in PNG while facilitating broad-based rural development.

AB The term food citizenship is defined as the practice of engaging in food-related behaviors that support, rather than threaten, the development of a democratic, socially and economically just, and environmentally sustainable food system. Ways to practice food citizenship are described and a role for universities in fostering food citizenship is suggested. Finally, four barriers to food citizenship are identified and described: the current food system, federal food and agriculture policy, local and institutional policies, and the culture of professional nutrition organizations.

AB In 1973, Jim Hightower and his associates at the Agribusiness Accountability Project dropped a bombshell Hard Tomatoes, Hard Tunes-on the land-grant college and agricultural science establishments. From the early 1970s until roughly 1990, Hightower-style criticism of and activism toward the public agricultural research system focused on a set of closely interrelated themes: the tendencies for the publicly supported research enterprise to be an unwarranted taxpayer subsidy of agribusiness, for agricultural research and extension to favor large farmers and be disadvantageous for family farmers, for public research to stress mechanization while ignoring the concerns and interests of farm workers, and for the research and extension establishment to ignore rural poverty and other rural social problems. By 1990, however, there had been a quite fundamental restructuring of the agricultural technology opposition movement - one that is not often well recognized. Two overarching changes had occurred. First, agricultural-technology activism had shifted from contesting land-grant/public research priorities and practices to contesting private agribusiness technological priorities and practices. Second, the relatively integrated, overarching Hightower-type opposition had undergone bifurcation into two quite distinct social movements: the agricultural sustainability/local food systems movement on one hand, and the anti-GM food/crop and anti-food-system-globalization movement on the other. In this paper I explore the causes and consequences of these restructurings of the agricultural research and technology opposition movement. Chief among the major factors involved was the fact that "Hightowerism" involved an ineffectual representational politics. Hightowerist claims-especially the claim that land-grant research was detrimental to family farmers-generated little support among the groups it claimed to represent (particularly "small" or "family" farmers). The two successor movements, by contrast, have relatively clear and dependable constituents. Further, the progressive molecularization of agricultural research, which proved to be both an antecedent and consequence of corporate involvement in agricultural research in the US, has decisively changed the issues that are contested by technology activists. Since the age of Hightower, the agricultural technology activist movement has shifted its 1970s and early 1980s emphasis from contesting public sector/land-grant research priorities to contesting private sector activities, particularly genetic engineering, GM crops, and globalization of agricultural technologies and regulatory practices. Even the sustainability/localism wing of the new agricultural technology movement configuration has progressively backed away from contesting public research priorities. The efforts of the sustainable agricultural and localism movement have increasingly focused on quasi-private efforts such as community supported agriculture, green/"value-added" labeling and marketing strategies, and community food security. Some implications of this increasingly bifurcated, agricultural technology, activist movement configuration in which there is decreased interest in land-grant/public research priorities are discussed.

DT Article
DE agriculture; civil commons; rural communities; sustainability; values
AB Sustainability has been the subject of prolonged debate within both academic and mainstream literature, rendered all the more heated because many of the disagreements come down to deep differences in values. These "value wars" play out in decisions made about issues ranging from development and investment to livelihoods and agriculture. Using rural communities as the context for discussion, this article proposes new directions for this contested concept, based on the life code of values. These life values ground sustainability in a multi-scalar web of everyday acts of human community. From this life-values perspective, compound terms such as sustainable agriculture and sustainable rural communities gain new meaning and offer the potential for the basis of a rural renaissance.

AB The concept of scale is useful in analyzing both the strengths and limitations of community food security 14 programs that attempt to link issues of ecological sustainability with social justice. One scalar issue that is particularly important but under-theorized is the scale of social reproduction, which is often neglected in production-focused studies of globalization. FoodShare Toronto's good food box (GFB) program, engages people in the politics of their 14 everyday lives, empowering them to make connections between consumption patterns and broader political-economic, cultural, and political-ecological issues. Community food security (CFS) projects such as the GFB are currently 14 limited in their scope and reach and have been criticized for their inability to deliver food to a larger segment of marginalized, hungry people. A central dilemma for CFS projects is how to engage the majority of urban consumers who still eat "inside the box" of the industrial food system. We argue that the concept of scale helps clarify how CFS projects must "scale out" to other localities, as well as "scale up" to address structural concerns like state capacity, industrial agriculture, and unequal distribution of wealth. This requires the state and the third sector to recognize the importance of multi-scaled food politics as well as a long-term pedagogical project promoting 14 ecological sustainability, social responsibility, and the pleasures of eating locally.

AB The mineral balance hypothesis [Phelan, L.P., Norris, K.H., Mason, J.F., 1996. Soil management history and host preference by Ostrinia nubilalis: evidence for plant mineral balance mediating insect-plant interactions. Environ. Entomol. 25, 1329-1336] suggests that the organic matter and microbial activity associated with organically managed soils afford a buffering capability to maintain nutrient balance in plants. An optimal nutrient balance, in turn, results in both good plant growth and resistance to herbivory. Effects of soil amendment practices on Colorado potato beetle populations in potato fields and their interactions with crop rotation and two pest management approaches were investigated in the present study. Beetle densities were generally lower in plots receiving manure soil amendments in combination with reduced amounts of synthetic fertilizers compared to plots receiving full rates of synthetic fertilizers, but no manure. Crop rotation and pest management approaches had little or no effect. Unlike beetle abundance, plant height and canopy cover were comparable between plots receiving manure and synthetic fertilizer. Furthermore, tuber yields were higher in manure-amended plots. In direct accordance with the mineral balance hypothesis, there was a dramatic dissimilarity in mineral composition of potato leaves collected from manure-amended and synthetic fertilizer-treated plots. Overall, there were differences in concentrations of nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, aluminum, boron, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc. Boron concentration was most dramatically affected by the soil amendment. Mineral content of potato leaves explained 40-57% of the variation in the Colorado potato beetle populations observed among the experimental plots. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   STABILITY; CHICORY; COMMUNITIES; INVASION; CONFINEMENT; POPULATION
AB Some producers believe that planting pastures to several forage species benefits sustainability of grazing systems. We conducted a grazing study to determine if forage species diversity in pastures affects herbage productivity and weed invasion. One-hectare pastures were planted to four mixtures in August 2001 and then grazed with lactating dairy cattle during 2002 and 2003. The mixtures were two species [orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.)], three species [orchardgrass, white clover, and chicory (Cichorium intybus L.)], six species [orchardgrass, tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), and chicory], and nine species [the six-species mixture plus white clover, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.)]. When rainfall was plentiful (2003), there were no differences in herbage yield among the mixtures; all averaged 9800 kg ha(-1) dry matter. During 2002, which was dry, the two-species mixture produced less herbage than the other mixtures (4800 vs. 7600 kg ha(-1) dry matter). The proportion of nonsown species in the sward was lower for the six- and nine-species mixtures than the two-and three-species mixtures, indicating less weed invasion for these complex mixtures. Red clover and chicory proportions decreased by 80% after 2 yr, and orchardgrass dominated in all pastures by May 2004. We conclude that planting a mixture of grasses, legumes, and chicory will benefit herbage production during dry years and will reduce weed invasion for a few years after planting under management similar to ours. Producers would have to reestablish the chicory and legume components relatively frequently to maintain these benefits.

AB The small hive beetle, (Aethina tumida Murray, Coleoptera: Nitidulidae, SHB) endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, causes considerable damage to European honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America, parts of Europe and Australia, ultimately destroying infected colonies. Although chemical control has proven to be very effective, a cheaper, more environmentally friendly and sustainable approach is desirable. The pathogenic effect of two fungal species, namely Aspergillus niger van Tieghem (Eurotiaceae) and A. flavus Link:Grey (Eurotiaceae) were tested against SHB. The fungal isolates were tested alone and in combination with diatomaceous earth (an abrasive substance). Small hive beetle pupae mortality did not significantly differ in the A. niger, diatomaceous earth and diatomaceous earth + A. niger treatments when compared to the controls. Aspergillus flavus caused a 38% mortality of SHB pupae which differed significantly to the 3% of the control. The combined treatment of diatomaceous earth + A. flavus increased SHB pupae mortality to 46%, although this did not differ significantly from the A. flavus treatment alone. Aspergillus flavus is a generalist pathogen that infects many insects and some plants and animals and therefore cannot be considered as a potential mycoinsecticide for SHB control. Small hive beetle post-feeding larvae exposed to diatomaceous earth were examined using a scanning electron microscope. Lacerations were observed on SHB cuticles between all abdominal and most thoracic segments, as well as on the mid and hind legs.

   Description and their potential implications for control sustainability
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE

DT Article
AB Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis is one of few potentially eradicable infectious diseases and is the target of control programs in several countries. The larval stage of this zoonotic cestode invades the human brain and is responsible for most cases of adult-onset epilepsy in the world. The pig is the natural intermediate host, harboring the larvae or cysticerci. Our current understanding of the life cycle implicates humans as the only definitive host and tapeworm carrier (developing taeniasis) and thus the sole source of infective eggs that are responsible for cysticercosis in both human and pigs through oral-fecal transmission. Here we show evidence of an alternative pig-to-pig route of transmission, previously not suspected to exist. In a series of four experiments, naive sentinel pigs were exposed to pigs that had been infected orally with tapeworm segments (containing infective eggs) and moved to a clean environment. Consistently in all four experiments, at least one of the sentinel pigs became seropositive or infected with parasite cysts with much lower cyst burdens than did primarily infected animals. Second-hand transmission of Taenia solium eggs could explain the overdispersed pattern of porcine cysticercosis, with few pigs harboring heavy parasite burdens and many more harboring small numbers of parasites. This route of transmission opens new avenues for consideration with respect to control strategies.

AB A study was conducted to determine the effect of level of substitution of Red Swazi A sorghum variety (RSA) for maize on average feed intake (ADFI), average daily body weight gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR), hot carcass mass (HCM), cold dressed mass (CDM), drip loss (DL) and backfat thickness (BF) in Large White (LW), Mukota and F-1 crossbred pigs. Twelve pigs of each breed were randomly assigned to diets that contained 0, 200, 400 and 600 g/kg of RSA, and similar levels of energy and crude protein. The pigs were kept for 14 weeks. There was a linear decrease in ADG in the crossbred pigs as the sorghum level increased (P < 0.05). In the LW pigs, no linear or quadratic relationships existed in ADG. The ADG in the Large White and crossbred pigs was 0.69 and 0.61 kg, respectively. In Mukota pigs, however, there was a linear increase (P < 0.05) in ADG with sorghum inclusion level. The least square mean ADG for Mukota pigs was 0.34. The FCR increased (P < 0.05) in both LW and crossbred pigs as sorghum level increased, but no statistically significant change was observed in the Mukota. The least square mean FCR were 4.2, 3.3 and 3.7 for Mukota, LW and crossbred pigs, respectively. The respective DL values were 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 for the Mukota, LW and crossbred pigs. The BF values were 8.8, 14.5 and 14.0 for Mukota, LW and crossbred pigs, respectively. These findings suggest that Mukota pigs could utilise diets containing high levels of red sorghum better than either the LW or crossbred pigs. Mukota pigs, which are indigenous and adapted to sub-tropical environmental conditions, can therefore be recommended for use in dry areas that are suitable for sorghum production to achieve sustainable pig production.

AB Nowadays, energy needs are mainly covered by fossil energies leading to pollutant emissions mostly responsible for global warming. Among the different possible solutions for greenhouse effect reduction, hydrogen has been proposed for energy transportation. Indeed, H-2 can be seen as a clean and efficient energy carrier. However, beside the difficulties related to hydrogen production, efficient high capacity storage means are still to be developed. Many metals and alloys are able to store large amounts of hydrogen. This latter solution is of interest in terms of safety, global yield and long term storage. However, to be suitable for applications, such compounds must present high capacity, good reversibility, fast reactivity and sustainability. In this paper, we will review the structural and thermodynamic properties of metallic hydrides.

AB The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) repository for the disposal of transuranic waste generated from the U.S. defense program. Humic acids (HA), known to strongly bind to actinides and which may be generated by the degradation of organic materials present in the waste, may influence the performance of the WIPP. This work presents experimental results on the effect of WIPP brines, ERDA-6 and GWB, and of the WIPP engineered barrier, Premier Chemicals magnesium oxide, on the solubility of HA. In the absence of MgO, a portion of HA initially precipitates, but a constant concentration of HA remains in solution: over a 60 day period of time, at least 290 +/- 10 mg/L HA can remain soluble in de-ionized (DI) water, 30 +/- 4 mg/L in 95% ERDA-6, and 31 +/- 4 mg/L in 95% GWB. For solutions initially containing from 0 to 400 mg/L HA, the ratio of the initial HA concentration and the soluble HA concentration is 1.3 in DI water, 13 in 95% ERDA-6, and 11 in 95% GWB. In the presence of MgO, all HA precipitate within 60 days in systems with a high liquid-to-solid ratio (10.0 g/g) or a low ratio (2.4 g/g). This phenomenon is due to HA precipitation and/or sorption on the surface of MgO. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Monitoring soil quality by means of biological indices can be of help for the management and sustainability of soils that received sewage sludge application. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term and continued application of sewage sludge rates on microbial biomass, basal respiration, metabolic quotient and enzymatic activity of a Dark Red Dystroferric Latosol under field conditions in the tropical region. To that effect, four applications of sewage sludge from an industrialized region were performed on a Dark Red Dystroferric Latosol. Sludge was incorporated to the soil at concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 times the recommended rate based on their nitrogen content in four consecutive corn cultivations. The results showed that basal respiration, the C and N microbial biomass, metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and enzymatic activity in the soil increased as sewage sludge was added, and their values were positively correlated with sewage sludge doses. The activities of soil urease and amylase increased as sludge doses increased and were significantly correlated with soil microbial biomass. These results suggest that the amount of sewage sludge applied has to be calculated based on the N crop needs, and annual applications must be avoided to prevent over-applications.

AB The global concerns about environmental sustainability elevate the aspirations for advanced building thermal analysis. Hong Kong, like many other places did in the 1990s, has introduced the performance-based building energy code, in that simulation tools are allowed for analyzing the thermal processes and energy consumptions in buildings. It has been noted that different popular simulation tools adopt different solar models to predict the solar irradiation on external facades. This paper, with a focus on studying the solar radiation on vertical facades in Hong Kong, gives a brief review of the solar distribution models and compares the numerical results from three different simulation programs. It was found that though all three models predict that the one facing south-west will receive the maximum solar radiation annually, the results indicate that there are discrepancies in predicted radiation level received in other directions. The deviation among the three models reaches almost +/- 10%. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of governance has gained momentum in the political arena, both in the academic realm and in the daily management. The concept sees its origin in the North-American political science school and public administration. Europe has imported the concept as a means to develop new strategies for the management of the relationships between public and private affairs as well as between government and society. The concept is complex both in its foundations and instruments and very likely aims to bridge the social protection system with the strong liberalism.
   The introduction of the concept within the science and technology domain has been pushed by the European dynamics. The European policies have driven its integration into the social discourse, essentially through a follower attitude, lacking any analytical reflection and deep analysis of its meaning and consequences.
   In this context, the concept seems to be tightly linked to a systemic and complex vision of the management of science and technology that has to be confronted to the existence of a series of levels. It seems pertinent to delve into the relationship of the concept of governance with other fundamental aspects of the scientific and technological issues as being demanded by the principles inspired in the reflexive modernization idea: risk, precaution, uncertainty, sustainability, innovation linked to the intervention of users and consumers.

DE sustainability; sustainable development; governance; environment
AB The word sustainability is nowadays commonly related to a fuzzy array of concepts, like nature, environment, ecology, preservation or development. The first task of this chapter will be to establish some clear limits to that fuzzy set of ideas, correcting its environmental bias and stressing its moral elements. Once defined, it will be possible to check whether the notion of sustainability could help in achieving good governance, and how. It will be shown that, although sustainability works well as a filter -especially to discard damaging policies-, it has no political content at all. Sustainability could constitute a useful rhetorical resource, but it is absolutely meaningless without being associated to a concrete discourse or proposal.

AB Recognition that polar bears are shared by hunters in Canada and Alaska prompted development of the "Polar Bear Management Agreement for the Southern Beaufort Sea." Under this Agreement, the harvest of polar bears from the southern Beaufort Sea (SBS) is shared between Inupiat hunters of Alaska and Inuvialuit hunters of Canada. Quotas for each jurisdiction are to be reviewed annually in light of the best available scientific information. Ideal implementation of the Agreement has been hampered by the inability to quantify geographic overlap among bears from adjacent populations. We applied new analytical procedures to a more extensive radiotelemetry data set than has previously been available to quantify that overlap and thereby improve the efficacy of the Agreement. We constructed a grid over the eastern Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea and used two-dimensional kernel smoothing to assign probabilities to the distributions of all instrumented bears. A cluster analysis of radio relocation data identified three relatively discrete groups or "populations" of polar bears: the SBS, Chukchi Sea (CS), and northern Beaufort Sea (NBS) populations. With kernel smoothing, we calculated relative probabilities of occurrence for individual members of each population in each cell of our grid. We estimated the uncertainty in probabilities by bootstrapping. Availability of polar bears from each population varied geographically. Near Barrow, Alaska, 50% of harvested bears are from the CS population and 50% from the SBS population. Nearly 99% of the bears taken by Kaktovik hunters are from the SBS. At Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada, 50% are from the SBS and 50% from the NBS population. We displayed the occurrence of bears from each population as probabilities for each cell in our grid and as maps with contour lines delineating changes in relative probability. This new analytical approach will greatly improve the accuracy of allocating harvest quotas among hunting communities and jurisdictions while assuring that harvests remain within the bounds of sustainable yield.

AB Breeding success and adult survival of Redshank Tringa totanus on coastal meadows on Gotland, SE Sweden, was investigated in 1997-2003. Two periods with different breeding success could be detected. In 1997-1999, nest success varied between 43 and 64%. Chick survival was not studied in these years. In 2000-03, nest success was lower and varied between 6 and 20%. Survival of chicks from hatching to fledging was estimated at 18%. Hence, overall productivity in 2000-03 was low and estimated to be only 0.13 fledglings per breeding pair. Nest survival rates were negatively related to incubation initiation date but fledging success was not related to hatching date. Adult survival rate was analysed from capture-resighting data of 164 adult Redshanks and was estimated at 80%. Adult survival did not differ significantly between sexes or between years. The results from this study suggest that reproductive success was lower than needed for a self-sustainable population, at least in the latter period with particularly low nest survival rates. There was no apparent change in management of meadows during the study period. Therefore, the decrease in nest survival rates was more likely to be an effect of changes in predator densities and/or behaviours. Further studies are needed to disentangle the mechanisms behind demographic processes in wader populations on coastal meadows.

TI Benchmarking the living standards of older Australians using budget

AB Objectives: To demonstrate how a budget standards framework can provide valuable information on the income needed by older Australians to attain a specific standard of living in retirement.
   Methods: A budget standard is derived by specifying the items required to achieve a specific standard of living and pricing them to estimate how much is needed to buy them. This paper updates earlier estimates and develops a new comfortably affluent but sustainable (CAS) budget that represents the lifestyles and aspirations of self-funded retirees. Initial updating was in line with movements in the consumer price index, followed by revisions guided by data on actual expenditure patterns and by three sets of focus group interviews with 21 people aged between 61 and 76 years.
   Results: The low cost standard for a 70-year-old women living alone in September 2003 was $253 a week. The modest but adequate standard is $330 a week, while the new CSA standard is $611 a week.
   Conclusions: The paper demonstrates that employing both quantitative and qualitative dimensions is necessary to give credibility to the complex task of estimating the income needed to attain a specific standard of living.

AB Alternative inexpensive complex nitrogen- and phosphate sources from agriculture, green grass juice (GGJ) and silage juice (SJ), were added to cultivation medium in order to investigate their impact on growth of the well-known polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) accumulating strain Wautersia eutropha. The influence of these additives was directly compared with cultivations on defined minimal mineral medium (M) as well as on the same medium supplemented with more expensive complex additives: corn steep liquor (CSL) and casamino acids (CA). It turned out that the supplementation with most complex additives results in shortening of lag-phases of bacterial growth and in higher end-concentrations of residual biomass compared with M-medium. Finally, higher volumetric productivities for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (3-PHB) were achieved. The effect of the inexpensive additive Si on volumetric productivity was similar to the result for the expensive CA (0.653 vs. 0.619 g L-1 h(-1)). The same was found for the biomass concentration (7.00 vs. 7.44 g L-1 respectively). Together with an economic appraisal presented in this study, the results suggest it is possible to make the sustainable process of microbial PHA-production more economically feasible. A survey of the thermal characteristics and molecular mass properties of the isolated polymers completes this work.

AB The stem-galling fly, Eutreta xanthochaeta, was evaluated as a potential agent for biocontrol of the invasive alien plant, Lantana camara, in Africa. Multi-choice trials showed an approximately equal oviposition preference for indigenous Lantana and Lippia species, and the target weed. They were also found to be about equally suitable for fly development. Finally, population sustainability studies indicated that the fly has about as much potential to persist on these indigenous plants as on the target weed. It was concluded that E. xanthochaeta is insufficiently host specific to use for biocontrol of L. camara in Africa.

AB Research on forest management impact focuses mainly on timber stands, and leaves out the unproductive forest environments. These stands are spatially mixed with timber forests. The objective was to evaluate richness and density of birds in timber Nothofagus pumilio forests and their unproductive associated environments, and discuss forest management implications. These stands showed significant differences in their forest structure, which generate a great variety of ecological environments. A total of 1881 individuals belonging to 30 bird species were observed during the sampling, in spring and summer seasons. These species were mainly migratory and insectivores, Passeriforms being the most important group. From 12 to 17 birds/ha were found, which varied with the forest environments and seasons. Timber stands of Nothofagus pumilio support a low number of bird species. Most of them are opportunistic and a few prefer these woods over other forested or afforested areas. Low bird density and richness characterize these austral forests, which share their diversity with a high variety of ecosystems along Patagonia. Timber N. pumilio forests has a marginal value for bird species conservation, considering its richness, density and the percentage of this forest in the total forested landscape of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina).

AB In subtropical rainforest in eastern Australia, changes in the diversity of trees were compared under natural conditions and eight silvicultural regimes over 35 years. In the treated plots basal area remaining after logging ranged from 12 to 58 m(2)/ ha. In three control plots richness differed little over this period. In the eight treated plots richness per plot generally declined after intervention and then gradually increased to greater than original diversity. After logging there was a reduction in richness per plot and an increase in species richness per stem in all but the lightest selective treatments. The change in species diversity was related to the intensity of the logging, however the time taken for species richness to return to pre- logging levels was similar in all silvicultural treatments and was not effected by the intensity of treatment. These results suggest that light selective logging in these forests mainly affects dominant species. The return to high diversity after only a short time under all silvicultural regimes suggests that sustainability and the manipulation of species composition for desired management outcomes is possible.

TI The effectiveness of a squash eyewear promotion strategy

ID SPORTS INJURY SURVEILLANCE; PREVENTION; PLAYERS; EYES
AB Objective: To evaluate the protective eyewear promotion ( PEP) project, which was a comprehensive educational strategy to increase the use of appropriate protective eyewear by squash players.
   Methods: An ecological study design was used. Four squash venues in one playing association were randomly chosen to receive PEP and four in another association maintained usual practice and hence formed a control group. The primary evaluation measurements were surveys of cross sectional samples of players carried out before and after the intervention. The surveys investigated players' knowledge, behaviours, and attitudes associated with the use of protective eyewear. The survey carried out after the intervention also determined players' exposure to PEP. Univariate and multivariate analyses were undertaken to describe differences at PEP venues from pre- to post-intervention and to compare these with the control venues.
   Results: The PEP players had 2.4 times the odds (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 4.2) of wearing appropriate eyewear compared with control group players post-intervention, relative to the groups' preintervention baselines. Components of PEP, such as stickers and posters and the availability and prominent positioning of the project eyewear, were found to contribute to players adopting favourable eyewear behaviours.
   Conclusions: Components of the PEP intervention were shown to be effective. The true success will be the sustainability and dissemination of the project, favourable eyewear behaviours, and evidence of the prevention of eye injuries long into the future.

AB A series of regional conferences to promote sustainable building were held in 2004-05. These events were designed to augment a cycle of international conferences and a prevailing international approach to sustainable building. The intent was to raise awareness, exchange information on region-specific topics, identify research and practical needs, discuss capacity building, and, most importantly, elevate the needs and concerns of a regional approach to the international community.

AB Sustainable development, and by extension sustainable building, is an evolving concept that relies for its implementation on the development of regional and local approaches and solutions. There is, in particular, a split between the definitions, approaches and priorities in developed and developing countries. Subsequently, a process for creating an international agenda for sustainable building is needed to recognize these regional and local differences. Part of this process is the development of regional action plans for sustainable building and construction at a number of regional sustainable building conferences. The key elements of an action plan for Africa, based on a discussion session at the SB04 Africa Conference, are considered and placed within the African context and the larger international issues. The key issue is the establishment of a solid knowledge foundation for Africa that will equip the public, professionals, development agencies and governments with accurate and relevant knowledge generated within the framework of the continent's social needs, its cultures and its biophysical environment to guide their decisions and actions towards establishing a sustainable built environment.

   Central/Eastern Europe
AB The outcomes and implications from the regional Central and Eastern European Conference on Sustainable Building (SB04) are considered in conjunction with the current state of sustainable construction within Central/Eastern European countries. Central/Eastern European countries are coping with shifting and reorganizing economic, political and legal systems within the wider framework set by the European Union, which are now shaping the course of future development. At the same time, the whole region is under intense development for various reasons (e.g. international investors increasingly recognize the attractiveness and opportunities of the region's commercial property markets and a huge backlog demand for new housing facilities leads to intense construction activity within the housing sector). It is argued that, on the one hand, significant opportunities exist for implementing the principles of sustainable development in the property and construction sector. However, on the other hand, needs-driven construction activity might focus on quantitative delivery without taking into account sustainability issues as well as the long-term consequences of construction projects. This can lead to aberrations that are very difficult to remediate. Appropriate actions and future strategies (developed within the scope of SB04) are identified to help promote and foster sustainable development within the Central/Eastern European region. A multifaceted approach to sustainable construction is required for use by policy-makers, practitioners and civil society. The description and assessment of interactions between different aspects of sustainable development in property in construction is the prime research priority (for both, the older Western European countries and the new Central and Eastern European Member States).

   Latin America
AB The outcomes and implications from the regional Latin America and the Caribbean Conference on Sustainable Building (SB04) are considered in conjunction with the current regional context. To understand the development of a Latin American approach to sustainable development in the property and construction sector, it is necessary to include the unique economic, social and natural problems faced by most of its countries. This unique context differentiates it from other regions and includes poverty reduction, maintaining economic growth, enhancing income distribution and coping with the unplanned growth of cities. The importance of a regional approach is highlighted and an overview provided on how sustainability relates to context specificities. Courses of action are suggested for major actors to accelerate progress towards sustainable building and construction implementation, including the development of new regional capabilities and networks, education and training, appropriate financial mechanisms and public policies, the use of appropriate technologies, and the development of appropriate metrics and assessment mechanisms to reflect local and regional needs.

AB Building assessment tools are used as a means to assess and encourage the adoption of sustainability-led thinking and practice in the delivery of buildings. However, the established tools focus primarily on the aspects of green or sustainable building (i.e. building as an end-product), rarely exploring the contributions towards sustainable product delivery (i.e. the building process). However, some principles of sustainable development are best implemented within the process rather than by being embedded in the product. By addressing the issues of equity via participation through stakeholder-oriented sustainability assessment, building assessment tools could be used to enhance significantly the overall sustainability of project delivery in the construction sector. A theoretical justification is advocated for implementing a participatory approach that is underpinning the development of a specification for a building sustainability assessment model currently under development. The barriers to participation in the construction process are considered as well as the need to develop innovative mechanisms to broaden membership of the construction project team. The philosophical approaches and resultant practices drawn from Environmental Assessment and the Process Protocol are presented as examples of potential solutions for incorporating stakeholder participation in a modified building assessment process.

AB The initial intentions and current emphasis of building environmental performance assessment methods are compared and contrasted with their emerging roles. This analysis provides a starting point for anticipating future developments in environmental assessment methods for buildings, how they are likely to evolve and how they will be used. The current varying expectations of assessment methods are examined, including the extent to which they can address complex issues while remaining simple and practical, their role as 'market transformation tools', and their ability to enhance dialogue among a range of stakeholders broader than a design team. More importantly, the increasing framing of environmental issues within the wider context of 'sustainability' raises the question about whether existing methods are capable of being easily reconfigured to fulfil this new agenda.

TI A comparison of diets and water agitation methods for larval culture of
   the edible sea urchin, Tripneustes ventricosus (Echinodermata :
   Echinoidea)
SO BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE

DT Article
ID DIADEMA-ANTILLARUM; MASS MORTALITY; JUVENILE; JAMAICA; LAMARCK
AB Tripneustes ventricosus (Lamarck, 1816) has been harvested for human consumption in the Caribbean for centuries, where harvest rates occasionally exceed sustainability. Historically a backreef and grass-bed urchin, the species has recently been observed on the forereef where it appears to control macroalgal growth in the absence of Diadema antillarum (Philippi, 1845) (Woodley and Gayle, 1999). Large-scale culturing has the potential to produce T. ventricosus in sufficient numbers for remediation of degraded coral reefs, restocking of nearshore habitats, and development of an aquaculture industry for one or more Caribbean islands. We report the first successful culturing of T. ventricosus from fertilization to exotrophic juvenile and the results of experiments to measure the effectiveness of agitation methods and diets applicable to large-scale larval culture. Airlift agitation was not effective in the 3.78-L (1-gal) jars used here. Cultures were successfully reared without mechanical agitation, but paddle agitation, used successfully in many small-scale experimental designs, produced the highest survival rates. Of the five algal diets tested, Rhodomonas sp., and a mixture of Rhodomonas Karsten and Isochrysis Parke, produced the most rapid development (23 d to metamorphosis). Isochrysis aff. galbana (Tahitian strain) supported slower development (36 d to metamorphosis) but produced the highest (48%) survival rate.

AB Schools provide an important setting for promoting health, as they reach over 1 billion children worldwide and, through them, the school staff, families and the community as a whole. Health promotion messages can be reinforced throughout the most influential stages of children's lives, enabling them to develop lifelong sustainable attitudes and skills. Poor oral health can have a detrimental effect on children's quality of life, their performance at school and their success in later life. This paper examines the global need for promoting oral health through schools. The WHO Global School Health Initiative and the potential for setting up oral health programmes in schools using the health-promoting school framework are discussed. The challenges faced in promoting oral health in schools in both developed and developing countries are highlighted. The importance of using. a validated framework and appropriate methodologies for the evaluation of school oral health projects is emphasized.

TI Marathon works - How to thrive in rural practice
SO CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
LA English
DT Article
ID RECRUITMENT; PHYSICIANS; RETENTION; CARE
AB PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED Medical care in rural Canada has long been hampered by insufficient numbers of physicians. How can a rural community's physicians change the local medical culture and create a new approach to sustaining their practice?
   OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM To create a sustainable, collegial family practice group and address one rural community's chronically underserviced health care needs.
   PROGRAM DESCRIPTION Elements important to physicians' well-being were incorporated into the health care group's functioning to enhance retention and recruitment. The intentional development of a consensus-based approach to decision making has created a supportive team of physicians. Ongoing communication is kept up through regular meetings, retreats, and a Web-based discussion board. Individual physicians retain control of their hours worked each year and their schedules. A novel obstetric call system was introduced to help make schedules more predictable. An internal governance agreement on an alternative payment plan supports varied work schedules, recognizes and funds non-clinical medical work, and pays group members for undertaking health-related projects.
   CONCLUSION This approach has helped maintain a stable number of physicians in Marathon, Ont, and has increased the number of health care services delivered to the community.

AB This study extends previous work on international joint ventures (IJVs) by investigating the role of industry conditions vis-a-vis shareholder value creation in these ventures' American parents. More importantly, the study argues that although industry membership influences firms' economic performance, it is at least as useful to also focus on firm-level indicators of such membership. This is because firms, even those within the same industry, differ in terms of resources with a potential for creating sustainable competitive advantage. Indeed, the study submits that both levels of factors must be jointly examined to derive a better understanding of shareholder value creation via IJVs. Using a multi-industry sample of more than 400 equity IJVs, this study demonstrates the interrelatedness between industry structure and resource-based views. The results of moderated hierarchical regression analysis validate the above-mentioned thesis and support two of the study's three hypotheses.

AB Ni-Pt/H-Y zeolite catalysts with different Ni contents were prepared and applied to the disproportionation of toluene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene in the temperature range 250-400 degrees C. The line broadening XRD analysis indicates that the increasing Ni addition decreases the crystallinity of zeolites. ESCA studies show the complete reduction of Ni species up to 0.3 wt.% Ni addition over 0.1 wt.% Pt/H-Y and further addition leads to the occurrence of unreduced nickel species as NiAl2O4. A TEM study shows the formation of bimetallic (Ni-Pt) particles of nanoscale size and the average particle size is found to increase with increasing Ni loading. Acidity measurements by NH3-TPD and pyridine-adsorbed FT-IR spectroscopy show the increasing occupation of acid sites by increasing nickel loading. The catalytic activity of Ni-Pt/H-Y zeolite and Pt/H-Y catalysts was compared and it was found that addition of Ni up to 0.3 wt.% increases conversion of toluene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, disproportionation selectivity and sustainability of the catalysts. Further addition of Ni leads to a decrease in conversion and disproportionation selectivity and increasing dealkylated products, which may be due to the presence of unreduced Ni species and pore blockage by large-sized bimetallic particles formed.

TI Optimal pulse fishing policy in stage-structured models with birth
   pulses
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
LA English
DT Article
ID DISCRETE POPULATION-MODEL; DYNAMIC COMPLEXITIES; MORTALITY
AB In this paper, we propose exploited models with stage structure for the dynamics in a fish population for which periodic birth pulse and pulse fishing occur at different fixed time. Using the stroboscopic map, we obtain an exact cycle of system, and obtain the threshold conditions for its stability. Bifurcation diagrams are constructed with the birth rate (or pulse fishing time or harvesting effort) as the bifurcation parameter, and these are observed to display complex dynamic behaviors, including chaotic bands with period windows, period-doubling, multi-period-halving and incomplete period-doubling bifurcation, pitch-fork and tangent bifurcation, non-unique dynamics (meaning that several attractors or attractor and chaos coexist) and attractor crisis. This suggests that birth pulse and pulse fishing provide a natural period or cyclicity that make the dynamical behaviors more complex. Moreover, we show that the pulse fishing has a strong impact on the persistence of the fish population, on the volume of mature fish stock and on the maximum annual-sustainable yield. An interesting result is obtained that, after the birth pulse, the population can sustain much higher harvesting effort if the mature fish is removed as early as possible. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan - a qualitative study
SO CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE health care seeking; health perceptions; Pakistan; street children
ID HOMELESS CHILDREN; YOUTH; CARE
AB Background This is the first study in Pakistan to elicit street children's perceptions of health and the barriers to service utilization.
   Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out during September and October 2000. The data were collected in twin-cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad through individual, semi-structured street-based interviews; with 40 school age participants; in addition, three focus group discussions were also completed. The sampling was convenience based. This strategy was applied because of the non-existence of a sampling frame for the street-based children owing to the absence of any census or other reports, and also the difficulty of tracking very mobile street children.
   Results Results indicate that these youth were highly susceptible to many adverse health outcomes. The common ailments were injuries, respiratory and skin infections. Along with low self-perceived severity of medical problems, self-medication was preferred and medical pluralism existed. Their perceived constraints to services included long waiting time, monetary, negative attitude of service providers and their inferior status.
   Conclusions In developing user-friendly services, it is important to be sensitive to street children's needs and requirements. Eliminating these barriers and the integration of health services among public and private resources are imperative for the regular and sustainable provision of health care to this vulnerable, under-served group of children.

DE urban-rural relation; rapid urbanization areas; Guangzhou; urban village
AB Many studies have been made concerning the problems, characteristics, formation, transformation measures, etc. of urban village from sociology, urban planning and geography, etc., which have made insightful analysis. However, most of these studies started mainly from the standpoint of the city government, drumming for the landscape-oriented urbanization, namely pulling-down the urban village and constructing the splendid residence or business buildings. The article maintains that the most important thing the city government should do is to pay much attention to the sustainable living of urban villagers, who would lose their main income source, namely, the collective dividend and the family housing rent. The single method of compensation has been proved to be harmful to the villagers' community, in which some young villagers relying on rent were no longer to do anything but stay at home. On the other hand, considering the floating population has become the main stream of renters in urban villages, the emergence of urban villages was inevitable and would continue to exist in a long time under the socio-economic transition in urban China and globalization. Based on the analysis above, the transformation of urban village should take more concerns on the housing demands of floating population besides compensation for local villagers. Meanwhile, it is necessary to avoid the "landscape-oriented urbanization" without the "peasant-to-citizen" transformation.

AB By means of ISM (Interpretative Structural Modeling) and SD (System Dynamics) methods, this paper made a system dynamics model of urbanization and eco-environment coupling in Jiangsu Province according to the implication and PSR (Pressure State Response) framework of urbanization and eco-environment coupling. Moreover, five typical scenarios during 2000-2015 have been simulated and analyzed based on the time serial statistical data during 1990-2003 in Jiangsu, which indicates: firstly, there are significant differences between the results and the scenarios, and the five coupling models all have comparative advantages and drawbacks; secondly, in terms of the characteristics and regional development disparities of Jiangsu and the general rule of world urbanization process, this paper reveals that only when either population urbanization model or social urbanization model to be correspondingly adopted, the sustainable development among population, economy, urbanization and eco-environment can be realized.

AB Urban green spaces have been arisen growing concern responded to the social and environmental costs of urban sprawl. A wide range of planning and policies has been and/or will be designed to protect urban green spaces and optimize their spatial pattern. A better design or planning of urban green space can make a major contribution to quality of environment and urban life, and furthermore can decide whether we can have a sustainable development in the urban area. Information about the status quo of urban green spaces can help planners design more effectively. However, how to quantify and capture such information will be the essential question we face. In this paper, to quantify the urban green space, a new method comprising gradient analysis, landscape metrics and GIS was developed through a case of Jinan City. The results demonstrate: 1) the gradient analysis is a valid and reliable instrument to quantify the urban green space spatial pattern precisely; 2) using moving window, explicit landscape metrics were spatially realized. Compared with quantifying metrics in the entire landscape, it would be better to link pattern with process and establish an important basis for analyzing the ecological and socioeconomic functions of green spaces.

TI Characterization of man-made foreign matter and its presence in multiple
   size fractions from mixed waste composting
SO COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) has for decades been processed into compost. Community collection of residential trash of various degrees of separation followed by some form of presorting tumbling or batch processing along with aerated static or mechanical-turned windrowing are typical in the industry. A significant portion of MSW is plastic or synthetic material including woven polyester and polyethylene materials that may easily reduce into fine fragments. European studies in the 1980's indicated significant contamination as a result of mixing and grinding which caused metals and glass to become reduced and enter the fine compost fraction. The results of these early studies provided impetus towards source separation, nongrinding of initial MSW and later introduction of novel biodegradable plastics and natural polymers to replace plastic content for collection of household organics. The present study was conducted using several mixed waste compost streams from archived lab samples taken recently from across North America. The objective is to determine the extent that laboratory sieving and microscopy techniques may fully characterize compost with regard to foreign, man-made content. Results indicated that foreign matter comprised principally of glass and plastic fibers occupied all size fractions from 25 mm down to 420-micron sieving. Owing to the very small dimensions of certain foreign material, fragments are not easily measured by classical sorting procedures. We employ various separation techniques including dry and wet ultrasonic sieving, optical microscopy and FTIR to separate and classify foreign matter fines. The origin of fine nondegradable materials as observed in the compost was likely building materials, carpets, textiles and diapers. Fragments of PET, polyester, polystyrene and foam were identified by simple and polarized-light microscopy and estimated to occupy up to 5% for all fractions. The study suggests that refined and improved characterization techniques for MSW compost may be important for better understanding of the fate and content of inerts. The study did not evaluate the potential risks of accumulation of nonbiodegradable fragments within sustainable soil systems nor ecological toxicity of components of these fractions. These data support the concept that in order to attain a high degree of cleanliness of finished MSW compost, early sorting and separation steps must be implemented prior to composting.

AB An energy expenditure of 1000 kcal/week in health-related physical exercise is seen as a minimum for the prevention and reduction of health risks. Most experts even recommend 2 000 kcal/week (approximately 3 to 5 training units, 30-60 min. each). These recommendations are high barriers for adults who have been sedentary for a long time. In consequence they either do not start physical activity at all or I often quit at an early stage.
   The health effects of a one-year beginners' program with low energy expenditure level (500-800 kcal/week) were analyzed in relation to the weekly energy expenditure in a three-year field study with one intervention group (n= 50) and two control groups (inactive and regularly active people, n= 16 each). Risk factors (medical examination), physical health resources (motor testing) as well as physical complaints, wellbeing and psychosocial health resources (questionnaire) were assessed.
   For risk factors and physical resources, there are significant effects during the intervention period for subjects with an energy expenditure of at least 1000 kcal/week. Subjects with a lower energy expenditure (500-800 kcal/week) profit only if their starting level was very low. Interestingly enough, the achieved effects on subjective parameters are independent of energy expenditure. These effects are stable over two years as long as the subjects stay active at the same level. Some parameters (flexibility, glucose and blood lipids) show even more improvements. The results show that people regularly attending training programs at a low energy expenditure level will have sustainable health effects.

TI The age of environmental impasse? Globalization and environmental
   transformation of metropolitan cities
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID CHINA
AB Metropolitan cities are undergoing a major spatial and environmental transformation. The proliferation of business districts, corporate headquarters and international hotels is prompting a massive verticalization and densification of land use, which is affecting the urban environment and infrastructure in a number of ways. Nowhere are urban environmental pressures so accentuated as in Third World metropolitan cities. Here the rush to gain a competitive edge in the global economy, in order to attract multinational firms and become a 'global city', is leading to an inconsistent urban policy framework in which development policies frequently clash with environmental policies. This article explores the environmental complexity of Third World metropolitan cities, focusing on the cases of Beijing and Sao Paulo. After a conceptual review of the relationship between globalization, cities and urban environmental problems, it examines how globalization is prompting spatial and environmental transformations in both cities; looks at the dichotomy between development policies and environmental policies by analysing the instruments in place; and investigates the role of globalization vis-a-vis urban sustainability issues.

AB The diversity and distribution of lianas were studied in five Afromontane rain forests of Ethiopia. Quadrats of 20 x 20 m were laid down along transects in the Bonga, Berhane-Kontir, Harenna, Yayu and Maji forests. In all forests, 30,917 liana individuals belonging to 123 species in 87 genera and 40 plant families were recorded. The most species-rich families were Asclepiadaceae (14), Fabaceae (9), Annonaceae (7) and Cucurbitaceae (7). The top 10 dominant families represented 56% of the total number of species. Over 400 other plant species representing different life forms were recorded growing together with lianas. The lianas accounted for over 30% of the total woody plant diversity and over 20% of the total floral diversity in the study areas. The analysis of floristic composition of the forests indicates that the Berhane-Kontir Forest had the highest Fisher's diversity index alpha, and Yayu the lowest. Generally, there were low similarities between the forests in terms of species composition. Although lianas were abundant in almost all forests, there was a considerable variation among the forests in terms of density and spatial distribution. The major dispersal modes of lianas were anemochory (30%), mammaliochory (30%), ornithochory and autochory, and the four mechanisms of climbing of lianas were twining (54%), hooking (24%), rooting and use of tendrils. Altitude and human disturbance were found to be important factors affecting liana distribution. The need for sustainable management and use of lianas in the Afromontane rain forests is emphasized.

ID DRUG MISUSERS; METHADONE TREATMENT
AB As prescribers of opioid pharmacotherapies, general practitioners ( GPs) are pivotal to the sustainability of opioid pharmacotherapy treatment services. The goal of this study was to examine the nature and sustainability of the Australian GP prescriber workforce in order to inform future programmes and policy development in this area. Data were collected from four Australian states: South Australia, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. Key features of the available data were: a heavy client load carried by a small number of prescribers, a high proportion of trained but inactive prescribers, and a high proportion ( one- third to two- thirds) of medical practitioners who undertake training but do not take up prescribing, i. e. a high attrition rate. Available data indicate significant shortfalls in the number of prescribers available in each state to service this patient population. Across all states a relatively small number of prescribers were providing services for the majority of methadone clients. In order to achieve sustainable, high quality prescriber service provision, workforce development strategies are needed which focus on recruitment of new prescribers, and the support and retention of existing and inactive prescribers. Establishment of systematic and detailed data collection systems should also be considered a priority.

AB Triggered by concerns about impacts of long-run climatic change the use of dual-rate discounting to evaluate projects and policies has been suggested. Environmental goods should be discounted at a lower rate than conventional consumption goods. We consider the appropriate use of dual-rate discounting for a class of models where environmental amenity values of a stock of resources are built into the utility function. We argue that dual-rate discounting can only be justified either as a pragmatic device for valuation when future prices for environmental goods are unavailable or when consumption goods and environmental goods are not substitutable and relative prices are not well-defined.

AB The German economy, once the powerhouse in Europe, is stalling. Unemployment has ratcheted upward since 1970, the social security systems can no longer be financed (even if the population were not ageing) and with an average annual GDP growth rate of 1.2 per cent since 1995, the economy almost stagnates. This paper analyses and suggests solutions to Germany's three main challenges. To undo the adverse incentives with respect to unemployment, the institutional design for wage formation should be decentralized, the reservation wage adjusted and the tax on labour reduced. To make the social security systems sustainable, the level of social absorption has to be lowered. And, finally, to achieve a more dynamic economy, new stimuli for growth have to be unleashed, including human capital formation and innovation, which are vital for the knowledge society. The role of government has to be rethought and the German social market economy redefined.

AB To investigate the impact of copper-containing fungicides (copper oxychloride) on earthworms in South African vineyards, field inventories of earthworms in and between vine rows were carried out and compared to directly adjacent grassland. Also copper content, pH, organic matter content, and soil porosity were determined in these soils. This was combined with laboratory experiments to study the impact of vineyard soil characteristics on the burrowing and dispersal behavior of earthworms. Moreover, the direct toxic action of copper oxychloride on different endpoints of the earthworms (survival and growth) was studied. Copper oxychloride had a negative impact on these endpoints (decreased growth and survival related to increased copper body content) as well as on the behavioral aspect (decreased burrowing rate and avoidance of copper-containing soil). Moreover, there was an inverse relation between burrowing activity and soil bulk density that could also be related to the copper content. This may lead to a decrease in sustainable soil quality in vineyards. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ENERGY-SYSTEMS; OPTIONS; DESIGN
AB In view of rising costs, pollution and fears of exhaustion of oil and coal, governments around the world are encouraging to seek energy from renewable/sustainable energy sources such as wind. The utilization of energy from wind (since the oil embargo of the 1970s) is being widely disseminated for displacement of fossil fuel produced energy and to reduce atmospheric degradation. A system that consists of a wind turbine and Diesel genset is called a Wind-Diesel power system. The literature indicates that the commercial/ residential buildings in Saudi Arabia consume an estimated 10-40% of the total electric energy generated. In the present study, the hourly mean wind-speed data of the period 1986-1997 recorded at the solar radiation and meteorological station, Dhahran (26 degrees 32N, 50 degrees 13'E in the Eastern Coastal Region of Saudi Arabia), has been analyzed to investigate the potential of utilizing hybrid (Wind-Diesel) energy conversion systems to meet the load requirements of a hundred typical two bedroom residential buildings (with annual electrical energy demand of 3512 MWh). The long term monthly average wind speeds for Dhahran range from 4.2 to 6.4 m/s. The hybrid systems considered in the present case study consist of different combinations/clusters of 150 kW commercial wind machines supplemented with battery storage and Diesel back-up. The deficit energy generated by the Diesel generator (for different battery capacities) and the number of operational hours of the Diesel system to meet a specific annual electrical energy demand of 3512 MWh have also been presented. The evaluation of the hybrid system shows that with seven 150 kW wind energy conversion system (WECS) and one day of battery storage, the Diesel back-up system has to provide 21.6% of the load demand. Furthermore, with three days of battery storage, the Diesel back-up system has to provide 17.5% of the load demand. However, in the absence of battery storage, about 37% of the load needs to be provided by the Diesel system. The study also places emphasis on the monthly average daily energy generation from different sizes (150 kW, 250 M, 600 kW) of wind machines to identify the optimum wind machine size from the energy production point of view. It has been noted that for a given 6 MW wind farm size (for 50 m hub height), a cluster of forty 150 kW wind machines yields about 48% more energy as compared to a cluster of ten 600 kW wind machines.

AB In this paper, two long-term visions of the Dutch future energy system are composed, analysed and evaluated. Both visions were set tip to meet the requirement to reduce the GHG emissions with 80% in 2050 in comparison to 1990. The two visions start from very different perspectives and contexts. Quantitative analysis shows that when economic growth and energy use follow a business as usual development. emissions of GreenHouse Gases (GHG) can increase up to 250% of 1990 levels. The two, rather opposing, visions show that it is feasible to combine (strong) economic growth with far going reduction of GHG emissions, provided a number of key options are developed and applied. These options were chosen and discussed during several meetings by stakeholders in a dialogue process, Using feedback from scientists, and consist of improvements in energy efficiency in industry, CO2 neutral feedstocks for transportation, renewable energy and highly insulated buildings in the built environment and improvements in the primary production of the agricultural sector. It is clear that drastic changes in many areas in society are required to obtain the desired GHG-emission levels in 2050. The results also show though, that such a development can be realised in different ways. In other Words. there are various ways to implement a low GHG emission economy in the long term.

ID STRESS-FIELD; FRONT
AB In the case of surface breaking cracks, the typical square-root stress singularity is generally not sustainable and a 3D corner singularity in the vicinity of the intersection of crack front and free surface has to be considered. Only the crack front intersection under a special angle gamma(r), ensures a valid square-root stress singularity and the applicability of the classical SIF-concept. In this paper, the theory of the numerical determination of the intersection angle gamma(r) is briefly described and the influence of the 3D corner singularity on fatigue crack growth is experimentally investigated. Therefore, 3D fatigue crack propagation experiments under pure mode-I are performed. Transparent specimens of PMMA are used, in order to be able to observe and to document accurate sequences of real 3D crack front evolution profiles via in situ photographic measurement.

AB Water shortage resulting from both natural conditions and human activities has been proved to be a bottleneck that chokes development in arid and semiarid regions. Systems analysis provides an effective way of clarifying conflicts between water supply and demand. In this study, an arid/semiarid region water management (ASRWM) model is developed for sound planning of a water resources system. The proposed model is founded on interval-fuzzy multiobjective programing (IFMOP) for effectively reflecting complexities of the study system and expediently facilitating solution of the model. Membership functions for modeling objectives and constraints are formulated to reflect uncertainties in different system components and their interrelationships. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed model, a case study for the Luopu County in northwestern China has been undertaken. The modeling outputs generated through scenario analyses are based on in-depth examination of several sensitive issues including farming, horticulture, stockbreeding, spring water allocation, pasture expansion, and land exploitation. The obtained results lead to two alternatives that provide an useful basis for formulating desired policies of sustainable development in the region. Through the case study, the proposed model is proved to have reasonable computational requirements and to be applicable to large-scale practical planning problems.

AB A macrolevel approach for integrating regional economic models with urban metabolism models is developed. Challenges with consistency and aggregation persist in the integration of urban models between socioeconomic and environmental systems, and between the micro and macro scale. Using an econometric model as a foundation offers a flexible structure, with low data requirements, that might potentially be integrated with microlevel process models. Such an econometric model is developed and verified for the economy of the Toronto region. The economic model is integrated with a greenhouse gas emission model that simulates emissions from the residential, transportation, and solid waste sectors. Emissions are simulated to 2010 for optimistic and pessimistic exogenous economic climates. In the absence of technological change, emissions will increase in the order of 30%, largely as a result of population growth (22%-23%), which is relatively insensitive to economic growth. The potential to decrease emissions through changing land-use development and increased recycling of solid waste is examined.

AB The quest for more sustainable urban forms has added renewed vigour to urban planning, with various types of urban infill and intensification becoming increasingly popular with local authorities. These approaches seek to achieve environmental and social objectives but, despite the supposed advantages of a more consolidated urban form, infill housing as a strategy for growth management is not always well received by local residents and it remains a contentious issue. In this paper the authors report on an enquiry into neighbours' interpretations of, and responses to, infill housing in Christchurch, New Zealand.

AB The Venice Lagoon and its drainage basin form a vast system, where historical and recent cities, large and medium-small industrial districts and intensive agricultural activities coexist within a peculiar environment. The drainage basin constituted of an ensemble of tributary sub-basins with contrasting characteristics and freshwater fluxes; the hydraulic pathways are generally complex and not univocally established. With the main objectives to measure the annual freshwater discharge into the Venice Lagoon and to estimate the related load of pollutants, an intense field activity was carried out in the ambit of the DRAIN project. The 12 main tributaries of the drainage basin were monitored for more than 2 years (1998-2000), obtaining a relevant data set of hydrodynamic, physico-chemical and chemical data. Integrative investigations were also developed in a multidisciplinary approach, covering the existing knowledge gaps on the hydrology and behaviour of such a complex system. The paper describes the characteristics of the system, the selected approach to investigate it, and the main project outcomes. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Environmental ethics and capitalism's dialectic of scarcity
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS

ID MARXS THEORY
AB A non-productivist Marxism departing from the analysis of capitalism's "dialectic of scarcity" can make a valuable contribution to the field of environmental ethics. On the one hand, the analysis of capitalism's dialectic of scarcity shows that the ethical yardstick by which capitalism should be measured is immanent in this social system's dynamic tendencies. On the other hand, this analysis exposes capitalism's inability to fulfill the potential for an ecologically sustainable society without unnecessary human suffering that capitalism's technological dynamism generates. This argument can be illustrated by a critical analysis of Bjorn Lomborg's The Skeptical Environmentalist. An exploration of capitalism's dialectic of scarcity can bring to light those weaknesses and internal contradictions of anti-ecological discourses that are likely to escape the attention of non-Marxist ecologists. This analysis shows that to the extent capitalism's dialectic of scarcity encourages the fragmentation of social justice and environmental movements, a critical analysis of this dialectic can contribute to the formation of the alliance of emancipatory movements that the attainment of a just and ecologically sustainable society presupposes.

AB Land-cover . change trajectories are an emergent property of complex human-environment systems such as the land-use system. An understanding of the factors responsible for land change trajectories is fundamental for land-use planning and the development of land-related policies. The aims of this study were to characterize and identify the spatial determinants of agricultural land-cover change trajectories in northern Ghana. Land-cover change trajectories were defined using land-cover maps prepared from Landsat Thematic Mapper dataset acquired in 1984, 1992, and 1999. Binary logistic regression was used to model the probability of observing the trajectories as a function of spatially explicit biophysical and socioeconomic independent variables. Population densities generally increased along the continuum of land-use intensity, whereas distance from market and roads generally decreased along this continuum. Apparently, roads and market serve as incentives for settlement and agricultural land use. An increase in population density is an important spatial determinant only for trajectories where the dominant change process is agricultural extensification. A major response to population growth is an increase in cultivation frequency around the main market. Agricultural intensification is highly sensitive to accessibility by roads. The increase in land-use intensity is also associated with low soil quality. These results suggest the need for policies to restore soil fertility for agricultural sustainability. The models also provide a means for identifying functional relationships for in-depth analyses of land-use change in Ghana.

TI Impediments to integrated urban stormwater management: The need for
   institutional reform
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE integrated urban stormwater management; implementation; institutional
   impediments
AB It is now well established that the traditional practice of urban stormwater management contributes to the degradation of receiving waterways, and this practice was more recently critiqued for facilitating the wastage of a valuable water resource. However, despite significant advances in alternative "integrated urban stormwater management" techniques and processes over the last 20 years, wide-scale implementation has been limited. This problem is indicative of broader institutional impediments that are beyond current concerns of strengthening technological and planning process expertise. Presented here is an analysis of the institutionalization of urban stormwater management across Sydney with the objective of scoping institutional impediments to more sustainable management approaches. The analysis reveals that the inertia with the public administration of urban stormwater inherently privileges and perpetuates traditional stormwater management practices at implementation. This inertia is characterized by historically entrained forms of technocratic institutional power and expertise, values and leadership, and structure and jurisdiction posing significant impediments to change and the realization of integrated urban stormwater management. These insights strongly point to the need for institutional change specifically directed at fostering horizontal integration of the various functions of the existing administrative regime. This would need to be underpinned with capacity-building interventions targeted at enabling a learning culture that values integration and participatory decision making. These insights also provide guideposts for assessing the institutional and capacity development needs for improving urban water management practices in other contexts.

AB Air pollution has significant effects on exacerbation of asthma, allergy and other respiratory diseases. Like many other magacities in the world the ambient air quality of Kolkata is also being deteriorated day by day. Automobile exhausts and certain industrial pollutants produce O-3 by photochemical reactions. The particulate matter, particularly less than 10 mu in size, can pass through the natural protective mechanism of human respiratory system and plays an important role in genesis and augmentation of allergic disorders. Sources of air pollution in the area and the unique problem arising out of the emission from the vehicles, industries, etc. have been described. Ambient air quality was monitored along with micrometeorological data and the results are discussed. The status of air pollution in the area has been evaluated and a questionnaire survey was conducted to estimate the allergic symptoms and exposure to assess the respiratory disorders. The data are analysed to evaluate the critical situation arising out of the emission of air pollutants and the impact on human health due to respirable diseases (RDs) to middle class sub-population (activity-wise) in the area are assessed. A strategic air quality management plan has been proposed. For the mitigation of air pollution problems in the city, the different measures to be adopted to maintain the balance between sustainable development and environmental management have been discussed.

AB The concept of sustainable forest management (SFM) requires forest resource managers to monitor and collect information pertaining to their environmental, economic and social impact. There are increasing expectations from a variety of publics (government, customers, and other stakeholders) that forests be demonstrably well-managed, creating incentives for forest managers to design credible systems for assessing their management performance. It is against this background that local, national and international approaches to regulating forest practices have been evolving. This article reviews the different dimensions of governance as they relate to monitoring and information reporting in the forest sector. Specifically, it discusses the changing role of sovereignty, the effects of globalization and the emergence of civil society stakeholders in forestry-related decision-making. Concepts such as sovereignty and globalization have important implications for monitoring forest practices and for defining SFM. Whether SFM standard creation and enforcement involves a sovereign, shared-sovereignty or civil society approach will affect the level and nature of SFM monitoring. As a result, we need to better consider the concept of monitoring appropriate to the scale and intensity of operations, how monitoring and information reporting standards differ between jurisdictions, and what this means for independently verifying SFM at an inter-jurisdictional level.

TI Aquatic resource conservation - The first Yangtze finless porpoise
   successfully born in captivity

DE animal protection; conservation methods; finless porpoise (Neophocaena
   phocaenoides); species protection; successfully born in captivity;
   Yangtze finless porpoise (N. p. asiaeorientalis)
AB Background. As the sole freshwater subspecies of finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides), the Yangtze finless porpoise (N. p. asiaeorientalis) lives only in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and its appended Poyang and Dongting Lakes. As a result of human activity on the river, including over and illegal fishing, pollution, transportation and dam construction, the population of Yangtze finless porpoises has been steadily and rapidly decreasing during the past several decades, which leads the animal to be endangered.
   Methods. For saving this unique animal from extinction, three corresponding measures, in situ conservation, ex situ conservation, and intensifying breeding research in captivity, were proposed and have been implemented since the 1980s.
   Results. After successfully rearing the animals in captivity for almost nine years, the first Yangtze finless porpoise was successfully born in captivity on July 5, 2005. The calf is male, with a body length of 69 cm. This is the first freshwater cetacean ever born in captivity.
   Conclusion. The successful birth of this calf confirms that it is possible to breed the Yangtze finless porpoise in captivity. Furthermore, this will greatly benefit the conservation efforts, and also greatly bolster our on-going efforts to study the reproductive biology of these animals.
   Recommendation. More studies and efforts are expected to establish a sustainable, captive colony of the Yangtze finless porpoise, which will not only greatly expand our knowledge about the reproduction biology of this animal, but also help to redeem the wild population through a careful yearly 'soft releasing' process.

AB Background. Different types of indicators have been developed to describe the impact of chemicals on society and environment. Due to the high number of substances and their different types of use, most of these indicators are directed to specific areas of interest - regarding workplace safety, environmental health or consumer health. They address a specific subset of chemicals and can be used for monitoring enterprise-specific, national or international management measures.
   Main Features. A survey of existing indicators for chemicals has shown that indicators already exist for a remarkable number of problem fields. As soon as the release and the environmental fate of chemicals are taken into account, the complexity of the approaches increases considerably. The distinction between indicators for drivers, pressures, state, impacts and responses, as proposed by the European Environmental Agency, supports the identification of proper indicators for a specific type of problem.
   Discussion and Conclusions. No single indicator exists which is able to cover the whole range of chemicals and their applications. Several indicator approaches cover at least a subset of the most relevant substances. If they are intended to be used for European monitoring, robust data must be provided by EU Member States. Chemicals in enterprises (ancillary inputs as well as process chemicals) are an important element of in-plant material flow management - in terms of occupational safety and health as well as environmental protection. Existing indicators for hazardous chemicals can be a valuable tool for process and product refinement regarding hazardous chemicals, especially for enterprises.
   Outlook. Indicators for production and impact of chemicals, as well as policy performance indicators, are essential elements in order to monitor the management of chemicals. They have to be established for the national and for the EU level.

ID SUSTAINABLE URBAN; POLLUTION
AB Resource sharing among co-located firms-referenced in the industrial ecology literature as "industrial symbiosis" engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to business and environmental management involving the physical exchanges of materials, energy, water, and byproducts. While industrial symbiosis is seen hypothetically as a win-win situation, there are few analyses of the economic and environmental consequences for the individual participants in multi-faceted exchanges. In this article, the nascent industrial symbiosis network in Guayama, Puerto Rico, is explored from environmental, economic, and regulatory perspectives of the individual participants and the community. A coal-fired power plant, owned and operated by the AES Corporation, draws five million gallons per day of process waterfrom nearby sources thus avoiding freshwater withdrawals and, through steam sales, significantly reduces emissions from a nearby refinery. This article quantifies economic and environmental costs and benefits for the symbiosis participants, concluding that there are substantial benefits to engaging in symbiosis, although these benefits fall unevenly on participating organizations. Policy intervention can be a viable means of motivating more regular occurrences of resource exchanges among groups of firms.

AB An atmospheric chemistry model (CiTTyCAT) is used to quantify the effects of trees on urban air quality in scenarios of high photochemical pollution. The combined effects of both pollutant deposition to and emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) from the urban forest are considered, and the West Midlands, metropolitan area in the UK is used as a case study. While all trees can be beneficial to air quality in terms of the deposition of O-3, NO2, CO, and HNO3, some trees have the potential to contribute to the formation of O-3 due to the reaction of BVOC and NOx. A number of model scenarios are used to develop an urban tree air quality score (UTAQS) that ranks trees in order of their potential to improve air quality. Of the 30 species considered, pine, larch, and silver birch have the greatest potential to improve urban air quality, while oaks, willows, and poplars can worsen downwind air quality if planted in very large numbers. The UTAQS classification is designed with practitioners in mind, to help them achieve sustainable urban air quality. The UTAQS classification is applicable to all urban areas of the UK and other mid-latitude, temperate climate zones that have tree species common to those found in UK urban areas. The modeling approach used here is directly applicable to all areas of the world given the appropriate input data. It provides a tool that can help to achieve future sustainable urban air quality.

AB The skinfold thickness is a much-used measurement for monitoring adiposity in a wide range of medical, health, occupational and sport science disciplines. Misconceptions abound, however, in its use, particularly that of purportedly predicting body 'fat' as opposed to 'adipose tissue'. To obtain data to investigate body composition and the extent to which anthropometry can be justifiably used to predict whole-body adiposity, an extensive dissection study was undertaken on 34 cadavers. In addition, to pre-empt questions on the applicability of cadaver data to living subjects, 40 elderly in vivo subjects of the same age range were compared with the cadaver population. No significant macro-morphological differences were found between males or females in the morbid and in vivo groups. Significant findings affect our previous understanding of the predictability of whole-body 'fat'. Skinfold compressibility was by no means constant; skin thickness varied with location in both sexes, females having thinner skin than males; there were significant sex differences in adipose tissue patterning. An identical thickness of adipose tissue did not necessarily contain the same concentrations of fat. Despite this variability, a relationship was demonstrated between aggregate skinfold measures and subcutaneous adipose tissue mass ( as opposed to subcutaneous fat), this relationship being more evident in men. A strong relationship was found between subcutaneous adiposity and whole-body adiposity, and between direct skinfold depth measures and whole-body adiposity. The amount of visceral adipose tissue was the same in men and women, but in the men this represented a greater proportion of their total body adiposity. Further, the use of waist-to-hip girth ratio (WHR) was identified as an important predictor of health risk. These findings demonstrate that it is not sustainable to introduce a non-quantifiable error by transforming anthropometric values (skinfolds) into predictions of percentage body fat. If subcutaneous adiposity can be predicted, then an excellent indication of overall adiposity could be obtained. Currently, skinfold measurement can yield a reasonable indication of comparative subcutaneous adiposity (better in men than in women). In neither gender is this prediction completely reliable due to both inter- and intra- individual differences in the skinfold measurement procedure.

AB Rural households have become more diverse in terms of the geographic origin of their income and their spatial spending patterns. As a consequence, the economic well being of rural businesses and that of rural residents are less interdependent than in the past. This raises questions about the sustainability of rural economies and their vulnerability to external influences. The structural path approach is used to investigate the role played by different types of household in transmitting economic influence in the Western Isles region of Scotland. Households with children play the most significant role in connecting the local economic system. It is argued that structural path analysis can be used to provide policy relevant information, complementary to that gained from more conventional social accounting matrix multiplier decomposition techniques.

AB We derive necessary and suffcient conditions for the quasistationarity of time-dependent quantum systems and point out the relationship between the degree of quasistationarity, the Fubini-Study metric, and the Aharonov-Anandan phase. As an illustration, we analyze the dynamical localization of an electron in a double quantum well and the sustainability of field-induced orientation of polar molecules.

TI Return and maturity relationships for treasury auctions: Evidence from
   Turkey
SO FISCAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID INTEREST-RATES; DEBT; RISK
AB The relationship between the interest rate and the maturity of newly issued bonds provides information on the debt dynamics of an economy as well as on the sustainability of its debt. Such information is crucial especially for countries that have debt-rollover concerns due to financial stress and/or macroeconomic instability. This study investigates the relationship between treasury auction maturity, which also dictates the debt maturity, and auction interest rates. When the Turkish treasury auction data from 1988 to 2004 are analysed, a reciprocal linkage between auction interest rates and maturities can be observed, especially for the 1995-2000 period, when there were chronic high inflation, high political uncertainty, high public deficits and unsuccessful attempts at stabilisation. This suggests that under an adverse shock, the Treasury decreases the auction maturity in order not to increase interest rates too much. A change in this reciprocal relationship is also reported for the post-2001 era, which is characterised by decreasing inflation, higher political stability, lower public deficits and successful stabilisation attempts.

SO FISHERIES RESEARCH

DE beam trawl; environmental impact reduction; benthic community; benthos
   release panel
ID SOUTHERN NORTH-SEA; DISTURBANCE; FISHERIES
AB Ecosystem-based fishery management requires that both a fishery and the environment associated with that fishery should be sustainable. Beam trawling has widespread effects on the biomass, production and diversity of benthic communities and in some fisheries, the impact is deleterious. Beam trawls impact benthic communities because the ground gear crushes and dislodges animals on the seabed, and because animals are caught in the trawl and subsequently die. Based on a study of the relative performance of seven designs of benthic release panels in commercial beam trawl fisheries, we demonstrate that panel designs consisting of 150 mm x 5 mm circle divide double polyethylene square mesh or 150 mm x 6 turn 0 single polyethylene square mesh, respectively, reduced invertebrate bycatches by 75 and 80%, and that > 90% of the animals released survived. We conclude that the use of benthic release panels may reduce the overall environmental impact (expressed as invertebrate mortality) of beam trawl fisheries by 5-10% without affecting their profitability. Other techniques to reduce the environmental impact of beam trawling are also discussed. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Spiny lobster (Panulirus argus), the most valuable fishery resource in Cuba, is subject to a state property regime and to a limited-access system. Managers need to be advised on the consequences of choosing different methods for managing the fishery. An age-structured bioeconomic model was developed to simulate the population dynamics of the stock allowing short-term and long-term (equilibrium) predictions on catch, biomass, egg production, revenue, cost and profit, due to changes in the fishing effort. The equilibrium version of the model can be used to estimate a number of bioeconomic reference points, such as the fishing effort for the maximum sustainable yield per recruit, or the maximum economic yield per recruit. The stochastic and dynamic version can be used to assess every year the risk of exceeding common benchmarks used in fishery management, taking into account uncertainty in parameters, such as catchability and recruitment. It was found that the recruitment has decreased since 1988 and that the effort should be limited at the level of maximum economic yield. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GEORGIA; LOGGERS
AB A mail survey was conducted to determine the cost and frequency of use for Best Management Practices (BMPs) and BMP-related Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) guidelines on logging sites across the state by Arkansas timber producers. Respondents were asked to report figures based on their records and estimates, including annual tons of wood produced from 1999 through 2001 and cost estimates for BMPs and BMP-related SFI practices used on their job sites. Practices most frequently utilized by timber producers included planning roads and skid trails, "no tree tops in stream channel," and creating waterbars. The results of this study indicate the cost for implementing BMPs and BMP-related SFI practices was over $12 million in 2001 for Arkansas timber producers.

AB The forest sector in Canada makes a significant contribution to the wealth of the nation. Many of our forest ecosystems, like the phoenix, need fire for rebirth and renewal. In contrast, other forests rely on a cool, wet disintegration driven by insects and their commensal fungi feeding on trees to effect this renewal. This disparity has a manifest difference in the character of these forests and how they have developed and evolved over thousands of years. While there are characteristic natural temporal and spatial patterns to these disturbances, recent work has shown that they arc being perturbed by global change. Compounding these perturbations is the emergence of extensive anthropogenic disturbances in these forests. If humans continue trying to manage complex natural systems as though they were machines, problems with unknown consequences will compound. For example, we have only recently begun to understand that changes in disturbance regimes can generate positive feedbacks leading to what could amount to sudden and drastic change for certain forest communities. Systems-based techniques aimed at adapting to these consequences are emerging and win need to be implemented in a timely fashion to minimize the risks and maximize the opportunities associated with sustainable forest management under a changing climate.

AB Soil disturbance guidelines should be based on comparable disturbance categories adapted to specific local soil conditions, validated by monitoring and research. Guidelines, standards, and practices should be continually improved based on an adaptive management process, which is presented in this paper. Core components of this process include: reliable monitoring protocols for assessing and comparing sod disturbance for operations, certification and sustainability protocols; effective methods to predict the vulnerability of specific soils to disturbance and related mitigative measures; and, quantitative research to build a database that documents the practical consequences of soil disturbance for tree growth and soil functions.

TI Making 'dirty' nations look clean? The nation state and the problem of
   selecting and weighting indices as tools for measuring progress towards
   sustainability
SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article

   leaders of tomorrow; environmental sustainability index
AB Pressing global environmental problems highlight the need to develop tools to measure progress towards "sustainability." However, some argue that any such attempt inevitably reflects the views of those creating such tools and only produce highly contested notions of "reality." To explore this tension, we critically assesses the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI), a well-publicized product of the World Economic Forum that is designed to measure 'sustainability' by ranking nations on league tables based on extensive databases of environmental indicators. By recreating this index, and then using statistical tools (principal components analysis) to test relations between various components of the index, we challenge ways in which countries are ranked in the ESI. Based on this analysis, we suggest (1) that the approach taken to aggregate, interpret and present the ESI creates a misleading impression that Western countries are more sustainable than the developing world; (2) that unaccounted methodological biases allowed the authors of the ESI to over-generalize the relative 'sustainability' of different countries; and, (3) that this has resulted in simplistic conclusions on the relation between economic growth and environmental sustainability. This criticism should not be interpreted as a call for the abandonment of efforts to create standardized comparable data. Instead, this paper proposes that indicator selection and data collection should draw on a range of voices, including local stakeholders as well as international experts. We also propose that aggregating data into final league ranking tables is too prone to error and creates the illusion of absolute and categorical interpretations. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper contributes to wider debates on the dominant factors determining the emergence and sustainability of intermediate systems of forest management in developing countries. The theoretical framework and propositions for analysing tree integration in homestead farms are presented, with reference to southeast Nigeria. The paper argues that, first, at the household level, livelihood strategies constitute the main determinant of the decision to integrate trees in homestead farms. Secondly, induced innovation has a wider and more significant role at the community level than at the household level in encouraging the integration of trees in farms. Thirdly, the sustainability of observed patterns of tree integration is influenced by the interaction of environmental, ecological, political, economic and social factors. Based on these propositions, the paper analyses the internal (household) and external (wider community) factors influencing tree integration in homestead farms in southeast Nigeria.

TI Challenges of forest governance in Madagascar

ID CONSERVATION; DEFORESTATION; CULTIVATION; LAND
AB There has been a huge surge in interest in the preservation of Madagascar's forests in the past two decades, but despite the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars, the goal remains elusive. Recent legislation has given the government the authority to enter into contractual arrangements with communities for the management of the country's public forests, so it has become crucial to grapple with the significant challenges involved. This paper explores the enormity of the challenge of forest governance in Madagascar in an era of decentralization. By examining several forests in one part of the country, it reveals a dizzying range of forest types and forms of use and governance within a fairly small portion of the country. These examples make it apparent that the history of forest management in Madagascar constitutes a broad-ranging experiment with forest governance. Simply monitoring the dynamics of the forest canopy is a significant technical challenge. However, this pales in comparison to the difficulties inherent in explaining those dynamics and assessing the sustainability and equity of different management regimes. Of the forests considered in the study, those where the Malagasy state has partnered with international conservation and development organizations seem to stand out, both in terms of stabilized, or even growing, forest cover, as well as a balance of interests among users.

TI Communities in Catchments: Implications for Natural Resource Management

DE rural communities; environmental sustainability; natural resource
   management; Western Australia
AB Economic and social considerations in natural resource management include the need for community participation and a greater appreciation of social and economic processes in understanding environmental problems. It is anticipated that new frameworks will guide these inclusions and redirect planning and management activities to achieve environmental sustainability. This paper examines issues of participation and the nature of 'community' through an analysis of relevant natural resource management policy documents and a case study of a public drinking water supply catchment in Western Australia. The findings indicate that if NRM strategies are to be successful, then a much wider and more inclusive view of community is needed, one that fully captures the different stakeholder groups beyond farmers, such as town residents, indigenous people, and those involved in other land uses. We need strategies that can accommodate differences within and between communities.

ID GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HYDROGRAPHS; SYSTEMS; KOREA
AB Estimation of groundwater recharge is essential for planning sustainable groundwater development. In this study, recharge ratios were estimated using the groundwater hydrographs obtained from monitoring wells located in a small catchment (0.256 km(2)). The catchment area is a triangular alluvial plain bounded by gentle hills and a large stream. For the recharge estimation, the modified water-table fluctuation (WTF) method was used. Although the study area is very small, the groundwater hydrographs were very different depending on the thickness of the unsaturated zone and the distance of the monitoring well from the main stream. Where the unsaturated zone is thick, the groundwater level changes smoothly in response to rainfall and resulting amplitude is small. In addition, the hydrographs closer to the stream showed quicker responses and larger fluctuations. Resultant recharge estimates showed a very wide variation between 2.5 and 20.1%. Compared with 12.7% estimated by other study mainly based on the water budget analyses, the recharge ratios were underestimated in upgradient area (hills) while they were overestimated in downgradient area (stream). Therefore, for representative and appropriate recharge estimation based on the groundwater hydrographs, it appears that the monitoring location is most important.

DE recycled asphalt pavement; beneficial reuse; sustainable construction;
   base course; hydraulic conductivity
AB Tests were conducted to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity of three recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) materials being used as base course aggregate for pavement construction. Comparative tests were also conducted on a compacted crushed rock aggregate (Lodi gravel) that is used for base course in Wisconsin. All four are granular materials. The RAPs have saturated hydraulic conductivities ranging from 2.4 x 10(-5) to 9.0 x 10(-5) m/s when compacted with standard Proctor effort and from 4.5 x 10(-8) to 1.7 x 10(-6) m/s when compacted with modified Proctor effort. The Lodi gravel is less permeable, having saturated hydraulic conductivities of 5.8 x 10(-7) m/s (standard Proctor effort) and 2.4 x 10(-9) m/s (modified Proctor effort). Three conventional methods of predicting the saturated hydraulic conductivity of coarse-grained soils were evaluated in terms of their ability to predict the saturated hydraulic conductivity of RAP: Hazen's equation, Kenney's equation, and the Kozeny-Carmen equation. Each of these equations overpredict the hydraulic conductivity of RAP. Two empirical equations to predict the hydraulic conductivity of RAP were developed from the saturated hydraulic conductivity data. The empirical equations were found to work well for RAP as well as the Lodi gravel. However, the empirical equations are based on a small data set. Updating of the equations is encouraged as more data become available.

TI Transboundary aquifers: A global program to assess, evaluate, and

SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB Transboundary aquifers are as important a component of global water resource systems as are transboundary rivers; yet, their recognition in international water policy and legislation is very limited. Existing international conventions and agreements barely address aquifers and their resources. To rectify this deficiency, the International Association of Hydrogeologists and UNESCO's International Hydrological Programme have established the Internationally Shared (transboundary) Aquifer Resource Management (ISARM) Programme. This multiagency cooperative program has launched a number of global and regional initiatives. These are designed to delineate and analyze transboundary. aquifer systems and to encourage riparian states to work cooperatively toward mutually beneficial and sustainable aquifer development. The agencies participating in ISARM include international and regional organizations (e.g., Organization of American States, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Food and Agriculture Organization, and South African Development Community). Using outputs of case studies, the ISARM Programme is building scientific, legal, environmental, socioeconomic, and institutional guidelines and recommendations to aid sharing nations in the management of their transboundary aquifers. Since its start in 2000, the program has completed inventories of transboundary aquifers in the Americas and Africa, and several ISARM case studies have commenced.

TI A framework for resolving the transboundary water allocation conflict
   conundrum
SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes a methodology for resolving transboundary water disputes that arise when people/states/nations sharing a resource that crosses legal/political jurisdictions disagree about the use of the resource. Laws and treaties written in an attempt to settle disputes are frequently neither enforced nor effective, and disagreements continue. Crises, arising through resource overuse or shortages, worsen the conflict and typically result in further discord, lawsuits, depletion of the resource, and even open-armed hostility. Many water management experts call for either private/market-based or state/command-and-control resource management systems, but these eventually break down during crisis. The crises therefore necessitate the adoption of a more effective institutional arrangement to address and resolve present and future problems. A better alternative to management by private or state entities and the resolution of conflicts by the mere application of law is a cooperative approach. The Rowland-Ostrom Framework, introduced in this paper, incorporates Ostrom's eight design principles for sustainable common pool resource management within the context of crisis that involves an urgent threat to the quantity or quality of a resource such as water, as described by the author. This paper demonstrates that although established 15 years ago, Ostrom's design principles remain applicable today for effective, sustainable transboundary water management, and the Rowland-Ostrom Framework is a model for the equitable use of shared water resources throughout the world.

TI Isotope methods for management of shared aquifers in northern Africa
SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB Access to fresh water is one of the major issues of northern and sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of the fresh water used for drinking and irrigation is obtained from large ground water basins where there is minor contemporary recharge and the aquifers cross national borders. These aquifers include the Nubian Aquifer System shared by Chad, Egypt, Libya, and Sudan; the Iullemeden Aquifer System, extending over Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Benin, and Algeria; and the Northwest Sahara Aquifer System shared by Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia. These resources are subject to increased exploitation and may be severely stressed if not managed properly as witnessed already by declining water levels. In order to make appropriate decisions for the sustainable management of these shared water resources, planners and managers in different countries need an improved knowledge base of hydrological information. Three technical cooperation projects related to aquifer systems will be implemented by the International Atomic Energy Agency, in collaboration with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and United Nations Development Programme/Global Environmental Facility. These projects focus on isotope hydrology studies to better quantify ground water recharge and dynamics. The multiple isotope approach combining commonly used isotopes O-18 and H-2 together with more recently developed techniques (chlorofluorocarbons, Cl-36, noble gases) will be applied to improve the conceptual model to study stratification and ground water flows. Moreover, the isotopes will be an important indicator of changes in the aquifer due to water abstraction, and therefore they will assist in the effort to establish a sustainable ground water management.

TI Tinkering with tenure: the community land trust experiment in Voi, Kenya
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE informal settlements; upgrading; land tenure; Kenya
AB Projects to secure land rights for the urban poor have been implemented in Sub-Saharan Africa for over 30 years. A recurrent issue in such projects is the provision of sustainable land tenure for beneficiaries. Commonly, individual titles with restrictions on resale have been used. Despite these, recipients often sell their land rights to more affluent city dwellers exacerbating the growth of slums (Habitat Int 11 (1987) 173). Policymakers are investigating alternative tenure forms, including community-based institutions, which they hope will make ownership of land more affordable and sustainable for the urban poor.
   The paper presents an analysis of an informal settlement upgrading project in Voi, Kenya in which the Community Land Trust (CLT) model was used to provide tenure security (Land Use Policy 14(3) (1997) 215). The paper reviews why the CLT model was entertained as a tenure alternative and evaluates how the model has performed in a 6-year period of operation in meeting various objectives including providing affordable, sustainable land ownership and preventing absenteeism. The implementation experience of a sister project in Kilifi, Kenya that utilized individual leasehold tenure as an ownership form is presented as a counter example to the Voi experience.
   The paper shows that despite provisions for strong community control, the CLT model has not been able to achieve the above goals. A variety of reasons are given for the model's poor performance, including the legal complexity of the model, a lack of on-going governmental support for the model and the project, and the divisive issue of land allocation for remaining parcels of land within the settlement. The paper concludes that on-going experimentation with the CLT model is not advisable at this time. Rather, the paper recommends that planners involved in informal settlement upgrading need to understand and recognize informal or customary institutions and try to incorporate them into de jure institutions in order to enhance tenure security and better manage urban land (Reforming urban land policies and institutions in developing countries.(c) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective To explore patients' perceptions of health-care built environments, to assess how they perceived health-care built facilities and designs. To develop a set of patient-centred indicators by which to appraise future health-care designs.
   Design Qualitative and quantitative methodologies, including futures group conferencing, autophotographic study, novice-expert exchanges and a questionnaire survey of a representative sample of past patients.
   Setting and participants The research was carried out at Salford Royal Hospitals NHS Trust (SRHT), Greater Manchester, UK, selected for the study because of planned comprehensive redevelopment based on the new NHS vision for hospital care and service delivery for the 21(st) century. Participants included 35 patients who took part in an autophotographic study, eight focus groups engaged in futures conferencing, a sample of past inpatients from the previous 12 months that returned 785 completed postal questionnaires.
   Results The futures group provided suggestions for radical improvements which were categorized into transport issues; accessibility and mobility; ground and landscape designs; social and public spaces; homeliness and assurance; cultural diversity; safety and security; personal space and access to outside. Patients' autophotographic study centred on: the quality of the ward design, human interactions, the state and quality of personal space, and facilities for recreation and leisure. The novices' suggestions were organized into categories of elemental factors representing patient-friendly designs. Experts from the architectural and surveying professions and staff at SRHT in turn considered these categories and respective subsets of factors. They agreed with the novices in terms of the headings but differed in prioritizing the elemental factors. The questionnaire survey of past patients provided opinions about ward designs that varied according to where they stayed, single room, bay ward or long open ward. The main concerns were limitation of private space around the bed area, supportive of privacy and dignity, ward noise and other disturbances.
   Conclusions Patients perceived sustainable health-care environments to be supportive of their health and recovery. The design indicators developed from their perspectives and from their considerations for improvements to the health-care built environment were based on their visions of the role of the health-care facilities. These were homely environments that supported normal lifestyle and family functioning and designs that were supportive of accessibility and travel movements through transitional spaces.

TI Building capacity for health promotion - a case study from China
SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
DE capacity building; health promotion; organizational capacity
AB During the period 1997-2000 a technical assistance project to build capacity for community-based health promotion was implemented in seven cities and one province in China. The technical assistance project formed part of a much larger World Bank supported program to improve disease prevention capabilities in China, commonly known as Health VII. The technical assistance project was funded by the Australian Agency for International Development. It was designed to develop capacity within the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the cities and province in the management of community-based health promotion projects, as well as supporting institutional development and public health policy reform. There are some relatively unique features of this technical assistance which helped shape its implementation and impact. It sought to provide the Chinese MOH and the cities and province with an introduction to comprehensive health promotion strategies, in contrast to the more limited information, education and communication strategies. The project was provided on a continuing basis over 3 years through a single institution, rather than as a series of ad hoc consultancies by individuals. Teaching and learning processes were developmental, leading progressively to a greater degree of local Chinese input and management to ensure sustainability and maintenance of technical support for the project. Based on this experience, this paper presents a model for capacity building projects of this type. It describes the education, training and planning activities that were the key inputs to the project, as well as the limited available evidence on the impact of the project. It describes how the project evolved over time to meet the changing needs of the participants, specifically how the content of the project shifted from a risk-factor orientation to a settings-based focus, and the delivery of the project moved from an expert-led approach to a more participatory, problem based learning approach. In terms of impact, marked differences before and after the implementation of the training activities were identified in key areas for reform, in addition to the self reported positive change in knowledge, and a high level of participant satisfaction. Key lessons are summarized. Technical assistance projects of this kind benefit from continuity and a high level of coordination, the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate teaching, and a clear understanding of the need to match workforce development with organizational/institutional development.

TI Development of a collaborative model to improve school health promotion

AB In recent decades, school health promotion programs have been developing into whole-school health approaches. This has been accompanied by a greater understanding among health promoters of the core-business of schools, namely education, and how health promotion objectives can be integrated into this task. Evidence of the positive impact of school health promotion on health risk behavior of students is increasing. This article focuses on the processes and initial results of developing a collaborative model tailored for whole-school health in the Netherlands, named schoolBeat. The Dutch situation is characterized by fragmentation, a variety of health and welfare groups supporting schools, and a lack of sound integrated youth policies. A literature review, observations, and stakeholder consultation provided a clear picture of the current situation in school health promotion, and factors limiting a comprehensive and needs-based approach to school health. This revealed that a health promotion team within a school is fundamental to an effective approach to tailored school health promotion. A respected member of school staff should chair this team. To strengthen the link with the school care team, the school care coordinator should be a member of both teams. To provide coordinated support to all schools in a region, participating organizations decided to share advisory tasks. These tasks are included in the regular health promotion work of their staff. This means working with one advisor representing all school-health organizations per school, and using a comprehensive overview of possible support and projects promoting health. Empowering schools in needs assessments and comprehensive school health promotion is an important element of the developed approach. This article concludes with an examination of emerging issues in evaluating collaborative school health support during the first 18 months of development, and implementation and future perspectives regarding sustainable collaboration and quality improvement.

AB This article describes the design and theoretical foundations of the Pool Cool Diffusion Trial and reports 1st-year findings. Aims of the study are to evaluate the effects of 2 strategies for diffusion of the Pool Cool sun safety program on implementation, maintenance, and sustainability; improvements in environmental supports for sun safety in swimming pools; and sun protection habits and sunburn among participating children. There was a high rate of program participation (86.6%; n = 375 swimming pools) in the 1st year and somewhat lower study participation (75.8%). Analysis of pool manager surveys revealed a time effect for overall sun safety programs and for sun safety policies, environmental strategies, and programs for pool users. There were few differences in implementation between treatment groups in year one.

DE health care utilisation; New Zealand; primary health care; refugees
ID ASYLUM SEEKERS; MENTAL-HEALTH; IMMIGRANTS; SAFETY
AB The needs of refugees and the struggles on the part of service providers to address this diverse population have received limited attention within the academic literature. This paper profiles Hauora o Puketapapa/Roskill Union and Community Health Centre (HoP), which is a non-profit, community owned and operated health clinic designed to deliver accessible, affordable and appropriate primary health care services to low-income groups in the Mt Roskill area of Auckland, New Zealand. The clinic's locality has undergone considerable demographic change over recent years with the arrival of refugees from diverse backgrounds. This situation has resulted in new sets of health needs and expectations which need to be addressed. The study took place in 2002-2003 and employed qualitative methods. In-depth interviews with community representatives, clinic users and health service staff members revealed that refugees face considerable barriers in accessing and utilising health services. Similarly, we found that health practitioners face the daunting task of endeavouring to meet these needs in an effective and culturally appropriate manner within a limited funding environment. We conclude that, despite these challenges, HoP has successfully established itself as a well-regarded place of primary health care. In so doing, it has strengthened the capacity of the local community to respond to the changing policy environment. However, long-term sustainability issues remain unless resourcing issues are adequately addressed.

SO HOUSING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE low energy housing; science and technology studies; supply and demand
   theory
ID ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY; REGIME SHIFTS; SUSTAINABILITY; SOCIOLOGY
AB Economic theory about supply and demand suggests that if consumer demand for a product increases then producers respond by increasing supply. In the UK housing market there is emerging evidence of consumer demand for low energy housing, yet little has been built to date by private sector housebuilders: existing low energy housing is largely, within the social housing and self-build sectors. Ideas from science and technology studies (STS) are introduced to help further understanding of why the housing market might be slow to respond to changing consumer preferences. Although standard economic concepts concerning costs and price are able in part to explain the situation, greater attention to socio-technical issues highlights some of the reasons why innovation and change are difficult to effect. The housing market is best viewed as a socio-technical system, whereby the social and the technical are interlinked.

AB Several lagoons of the Eastern Tuamotu Atolls (French Polynesia) are characterized by enormous populations of the clam Tridacna maxima, a species considered as endangered in many locations worldwide. This unique resource is virtually intact, until recently being impacted only by local consumption. Increasing exports to Tahiti's market (up to 50 tonnes of wet matter y(-1)), combined with the relatively small size of these lagoons (< 50 km(2)), have raised significant concerns for agencies charged with management of lagoonal resources. In order to evaluate whether the current harvesting pressure threatens long-term sustainability of this resource, it is necessary to estimate the total number of individual clams present and also the fraction of that stock that is currently targeted by fishers, who generally collect clams in very shallow waters (< 1 m), walking on the reef edges. Here, we present results for a pilot study evaluating this resource at Fangatau Atoll. Using a combination of data collected in situ and three remotely sensed images with different spatial resolution (1.5, 5.6, and 30 m), we estimate that the shallowest lagoonal areas (4.05 km(2) at depth < 6 m) harbour five classes of benthic habitat with significantly different clam areal covers and densities. Considering the cover/density values for each habitat class, 23.65 +/- 5.33 million clams (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) inhabit these 4.05 km(2). Assuming that current harvesting techniques will be maintained in the future, the commercially available stock represents 44% of the population located on 1.18 km(2) of the shallow lagoon. A comparison of results from the three remote sensing platforms indicates that high resolution, broadband multispectral sensors (e.g. IKONOS, Quickbird) should provide the best existing platforms to conduct similar assessments elsewhere.

AB This paper describes a simulation study that evaluated the ICES scientific advisory process used to recommend total allowable catches (TACs) for flatfish stocks, Particular emphasis is given to examining the effects on stock biomass. yield and stability of constraining interannual variation in TACs. A "management strategy evaluation" approach is used where an operating model is used to represent the underlying reality, and pseudo data are generated for use within a management procedure. The management procedure comprises a stock assessment that uses data to estimate parameters of interest and a decision rule to derive TAC recommendations for the following year. Bounds oil TAC of between 20% and 40% have little effect on yields or stability, while a 10% bound on TAC can affect the ability to achieve management targets and result in low-frequency cycling in the stock. fit the short term, performance is highly dependent on current stock status but bounds have less effect if the stock is close to equilibrium for a target fishing mortality (F). In addition, it was shown that current ICES biomass and fishing mortality reference points are not always consistent. and several are clearly inappropriate. Importantly. including realistic sources and levels of uncertainty can result in far from optimal management outcomes based on tile current procedures. Results also conflicted with expert opinion, in suggesting that management based on a fixed F regime could result in relatively stable yields despite fluctuations in year-class strength and that the management feedback process itself is implicated in causing fluctuations in the system due to significant time-lags in this process. We therefore emphasize that providing more precise population estimates or developing harvest control rules alone will not necessarily help in achieving management objectives, rather management procedures that are robust to uncertainty and tuned to meet management objectives need to be developed. Operating models in these simulations were constrained to be based on existing ICES methods and perceptions of stock dynamic. but we recommend that, in future, operating models that represent the best available understanding of the actual system dynamics be used to evaluate models and rules considered for application.

ID AGE DATA; DISCARDS
AB Landings statistics can be lower than true catches because many fish are discarded or landed illegally. Since many discards do not survive, treating landings as true catches can lead to biased stock assessments. This paper proposes treating catch as censored by bounding it below by the landings, L, and above by cL (for scalar c > 1), We demonstrate the approach with a simulation study, using a Schaefer surplus production model. Parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework with BUGS software using two sets of priors. Both the traditional true-catch method and a survey-and-effort method (which was landings free) performed worse on average than the censored approach, as measured by the Bayes risk associated with estimates of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and of an index of depletion (X). Recursive partitioning (regression trees) was used to associate simulation parameters to best-performing methods, showing that higher commercial fish catchability favoured the censored method at estimating X. In conclusion, censored methods provide a means of dealing with discarding and misreporting that can outperform some traditional alternatives.

TI Implications of substantially increased development aid: The case of
   Uganda
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Current aid levels in Uganda already undermine economic conditions required for strong private investment and export-led growth. The expansion of aid-financed public expenditure has outstripped absorptive capacity in the public sector and the wider economy Unit costs have been driven up, and many projects have not been aligned to the government's development priorities. Despite debt relief, Uganda's external debt burden has again become unsustainable. Uganda is trying to rationalise public sector structures - a long-term process - and to make use of existing administrative structures. The creation of additional public agencies, which may result from increased aid, is not the path Uganda will take to increasing capacity. Uganda aims gradually to reduce its fiscal deficit by prioritising expenditure on those activities that contribute directly to poverty eradication (focusing on quality rather than quantity of expenditure), mobilising additional domestic resources, and reducing dependence on donor aid. Substantially increasing aid is not the way to achieve these goals in a sustainable manner.

AB Advances in formulating spoken document retrieval for a new National Gallery of the Spoken Word (NGSW) are addressed. NGSW is the first large-scale repository of its kind, consisting of speeches, news broadcasts, and recordings from the 20th century. After presenting an overview of the audio stream content of the NGSW, with sample audio files from U.S. Presidents from 1893 to the present, an overall system diagram is proposed with a discussion of critical tasks associated with effective audio information retrieval. These include advanced audio segmentation, speech recognition model adaptation for acoustic background noise and speaker variability, and information retrieval using natural language processing for text query requests that include document and query expansion. For segmentation, a new evaluation criterion entitled fused error score (FES) is proposed, followed by application of the CompSeg segmentation scheme on DARPA Hub4 Broadcast News (30.5% relative improvement in FES) and NGSW data. Transcript generation is demonstrated for a six-decade portion of the NGSW corpus. Novel model adaptation using structure maximum likelihood eigenspace mapping shows a relative 21.7% improvement. Issues regarding copyright assessment and metadata construction are also addressed for the purposes of a sustainable audio collection of this magnitude. Advanced parameter-embedded watermarking is proposed with evaluations showing robustness to correlated noise attacks. Our experimental online system entitled "SpeechFind" is presented, which allows for audio retrieval from a portion of the NGSW corpus. Finally, a number of research challenges such as language modeling and lexicon for changing time periods, speaker trait and identification tracking, as well as new directions, are discussed in order to address the overall task of robust phrase searching in unrestricted audio corpora.

AB WHAT does the future hold for single-handed practice? Society today is imposing pressures that could make life more difficult for the solo vet in many ways, and some have wondered whether this business format is sustainable. Veterinary surgeons, however, do not lack initiative, and, as Christine Shield suggests, it seems likely that solutions will be found that will ensure the survival of this branch of practice.

AB A field experiment was conducted during 1997-2000 to study direct and residual effect of integrated micronutrient application on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) cropping system. The results show that application of farmyard manure @ 10 tonnes/ha applied in rainy season (kharif) was found superior in total productivity of the system which was further confirmed by the highest Values (0.82) of sustainable yield index. Stability analysis indicated that application of Zn @ 5 kg/ha to soybean (0.99), farmyard manure @ 10 tonnes/ha (0.92) and their integration (1.06) gave stable production over the years, while boron @ 0.5 kg + farmyard manure, Zn @ 5 kg + boron @ 0.5 kg/ha and seed treatment with sodium molybdate @ 4 g/kg seed showed stable performance under favourable environments. The seed treatment with sodium molybdate @ 4 g/kg seed was found most remunerative in soybean-wheat cropping system.

AB Remote sensing technology was used to detect changes in the mangrove habitat around the Mumbai suburban region. For this purpose, cloud free satellite images on the scale of 1 : 50,000. from Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellite IRS-ID and IRS-IC were used. The iotal area of mangroves in Mumbai suburban region has been estimated to be 56.40 km(2) (including mud flats) with dense mangroves contributing 45.4% to the total. During 1990 to 2001, a total mangrove area of 36.54 km(2) was lost, indicating a 39.32% decrease in the area of mangroves. It has been observed that the quantitative degradation of mangrove vegetation is largely due to burgeoning population pressure, construction and development activities, conversion to agricultural land and fish farms besides the effect of industrial effluents. Avicennia marina was found to be the most dominant mangrove species. Measures have been suggested for conservation and management of mangroves of Mumbai on a sustainable basis.

DT Article
DE post-tsunami recovery process; state reforms; conflict and
   peace-sensitive disaster responses; deep federalization
AB This paper examines how the Tsunami of 26 December 2005 re-defined some key dimensions of Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict and peace processes. It first shows how the contending perspectives on the post-tsunami recovery strategies had brought back to the centre of Sri Lanka's political debate issues of power sharing, regional autonomy, and national sovereignty. It demonstrates that the responses to Tsunami disaster and the advancement of the stalled peace process are closely interwoven and that they cannot be de-linked. It then argues that the post-tsunami recovery process has been intensely politicized in a context of the unresolved ethnic conflict and an incomplete, stalled peace process. The paper argues against the approach of 'reconstruction from above.' It also shows that the post-tsunami reconstruction is not about constructing buildings, roads and economic infrastructure, but that it involves rebuilding communities, community lives and livelihoods while enabling nearly a million of people who suddenly found themselves in absolute poverty and destitution. It argues that unless the affected communities are active participants in the exercise of re-building their lives, livelihoods and communities, the rebuilding process will be thoroughly undemocratic. It makes a case for re-building local autonomy in the South as well in the North and East in order link the peace process with the tsunami recovery process. The paper concludes with two arguments. Firstly, Sri Lanka's post-tsunami recovery process necessitates new ways for constructive handling of the ethnic conflict as well as the peace process in a 'conflict and peace sensitive' recovery framework. Secondly, a sustainable recovery process can productively be linked to a programme of state reform conceived in a framework of 'deep federalization.'

TI Livelihoods and informal trade at the Bangladesh border
SO INTER-ASIA CULTURAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Cross-border informal trade is one of the most important issues between India and Bangladesh. It takes place between people who live a short distance apart, but who find themselves separated by an international boundary. The people of international border areas believe that cross-border informal trade is a process to maintain a sustainable livelihood because it provides a livelihood to the unemployed. This research has analysed the nature and impact of informal border trade between India and Bangladesh. It has highlighted the sources of security and insecurity through the process of informal border trade. It also analyses the different socioeconomic conditions of informal border trade in border trade prone areas. This research argues that although informal border trade is considered illegal, it is necessary for the maintenance of the livelihood for the poor in the bordering areas. The state failures in fulfilling the needs of the poor force them to involve themselves in informal border trade.

TI The forest management planning system of Turkey: constructive criticism
   towards the sustainable management of forest ecosystems
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English

   management regulations; management plan procedures
AB The forest management system of any country manifests the philosophy, principles and direction to be followed in the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. The management system of Turkey, essentially initiated in 1960's by the help of European counterparts, focuses primarily on commodity production. With 21 million ha of forested land, the country has several distinct biogeographic regions, each having its own endemic species and natural ecosystems providing major flyways for millions of migratory birds and containing almost three quarters of the total plant species in Europe. As such its management is of crucial importance to the rest of the world. Various forest values such as recreation, water production, soil protection and biodiversity conservation were, however, not integrated into forest management using advanced information technologies. Establishing an effective multiple use forest management system based on participation is a great challenge for the Turkish Forestry sector. This paper presents the current management philosophy, regulations, socio-cultural and organizational structure, and implementation of management activities across the country. The forest management system is criticized based on the sustainable forest management concept. Major pitfalls of the system are documented and some avenues for sound management are presented. The paper concludes that the management system is outdated with a neo-classic European style that focuses on a short-sighted solo area regulation with a single wood production focus and calls for an urgent change in the planning concept towards holistic management with the integration of various forest values based on ecosystem sustainability.

TI Economies of NWFP value addition and microfinance: impact on forest
   dwellers' livelihoods in Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE microfinance; NWFPs; value addition; cost-benefit analysis; forest
   dwellers
AB Non-Wood Forest Products (NWFPs) play a major role in creating livelihoods for forest dwellers (FDs). FDs generally find it difficult to obtain finance to support their livelihoods and have to depend on pre-harvest trading of NWFPs even though it is exploitative and leads to sale without any value addition. Alternately they have to borrow from traders at high interest rates because they do not have access to formal financial institutions. Provisions for creating access to microfinance will enable FDs to undertake NWFPs value additions and save them from exploitation by moneylenders and traders. The path to sustainable economic development of forest dwellers includes innovative approaches to natural resource conservation, management and utilization. This paper studies the economic impact of NWFP value additions such as storage, processing, adoption of appropriate technology, distribution and packaging. In addition, the amount of microfinance required for employing such value addition activities is assessed.

AB Rajasthan presents evidence for the existence of one of the most advanced examples of ancient mining and accompanied deforestation to be found anywhere in the world. Mining continues to be an important economic activity contributing to 2% of the State Domestic Product and providing at least a 1.76 % share to the regular employment pool in Rajasthan. However, economic benefits of mineral extraction also accompany environmental, economic and social costs. Mine waste dumps and mined Out areas viewed simply as the legacies of past may appear overwhelming environmental hazards presenting ugly picture Of Cultural landscape. However, mine wastes can be transformed into an opportunity for learning, adaptation and productivity enhancement for sustainable livelihoods through ecological restoration. Here we propose a strategy for mine spoil restoration aimed at creating a multifunctional ecosystem in mine waste dumps. We suggest that dredging and sediment removal from traditional tanks and ponds can potentially be used to prepare the substratum over the mine wastes for direct seeding. It will also create enhanced decentralized water storage capacity for wildlife and people. Our strategy combines the concomitant revival of traditional water harvesting systems, ground water recharge, enhanced biomass production and an adaptation to random recurrence of droughts in Rajasthan.

AB Intention, Goal, Scope, Background. BASF has developed the eco-efficiency analysis tool to address not only strategic issues but also issues posed by the marketplace, politics and research. The goal was to develop a tool for supporting decision-making processes, which is useful for many of applications in the Chemical and other industries. A part of the eco-efficiency analysis involves the evaluation of the toxicity and the ecotoxicity potential.
   Objectives. Many life cycle analyses do not include an assessment of the toxicity potential nor the ecotoxicity potential. However, in order to arrive at a comprehensive assessment of products and processes, it is often the ecotoxicity potential, which constitutes an important factor with regard to the evaluation of sustainability. The cradle-to-grave approach is also important for this calculation and will be done based on a database that will be discussed also in this paper.
   Methods. The method used for the determination of the ecotoxicity potential follows the basic rules of the European Union Risk Ranking System (EURAM). The other criteria of the ecological fingerprint are combined with the economical results in the eco-efficiency portfolio.
   Results and Discussion. The results of the studies are shown in a simple diagram, the eco-efficiency portfolio. Therefore ecological data are summarized in a special manner as described previously. It has been shown that the weighting factors, which are used in our method, have a negligible impact on the results. In most cases, the input data have the dominant impact on the results of the study. The ecotoxicity assessment will be a part of the ecological calculation. Because of the cradle-to-grave approach, substances of the whole life cycle can be identified that might have a toxic impact to the environment. The results can be used for optimization of the process.
   Conclusions. The new calculation model allows the assessment of eco-toxicological substances in an appropriate and easy way. In most of the cases the data from a European safety data sheet are sufficient for the calculation. The normalized data can be incorporated very easily in the ecological fingerprint and in the drawing of the eco-efficiency portfolio.
   Recommendations and Outlook. LCA in combination with the evaluation of the ecotoxicity potential will for reasons of optimizing for least impact become more important in certain cases. Especially in those systems where water emissions are likely, the use of the evaluation system in the eco-efficiency analysis is recommended. This new methodology allows the calculation of ecotoxicity potentials in a short time with a small set of input information. The analytical eco-efficiency tool helps in implementing more sustainable processes and products in the future.

ID QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; TRANSFORMATION
AB Why do some organizational changes persist, while others decay? The sustainability of change can be defined broadly as the process through which new working methods, performance goals and improvement trajectories are maintained for a period appropriate to a given context. However, sustainability has received limited attention, although the concept reflects Lewin's concern with 'refreezing' (Lewin. K. 1951. Field Theory in Social Science: Selected Theoretical Papers by Kurt Lewin, UK edition published 1952, ed. D. Cartwright, London: Tavistock). In an uncertain environment, working practices that fail to adapt are targets for change, and stability has been regarded not as a condition to be achieved, but as a symptom of inertia, a problem to be solved. This paper reviews the emerging literature, seeking to develop a provisional model of the processes influencing change sustainability and decay, as a platform for further research. This review suggests that sustainability is dependent on multiple factors, at different levels of analysis: substantial, individual, managerial, financial, leadership, organizational, cultural, political, processual, contextual and temporal. The relative significance of those factors cannot be determined a priori, raising questions concerning the properties of the sustainability process with regard to different types of change in different contexts.

   A case study of the district health systems in Kenya
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS

DE evaluation; District Health Management Information System; District
   Health System
AB Introduction: This paper discusses some of the issues and challenges of implementing appropriate and coordinated District Health Management Information System (DHMIS) in environments dependent on external support especially when insufficient attention has been given to the sustainability of systems. It also discusses fundamental issues which affect the usability of DHMIS to support District Health System (DHS), including meeting user needs and user education in the use of information for management; and the need for integration of data from all health-providing and related organizations in the district.
   Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in three DHSs in Kenya. Data was collected through use of questionnaires, focus group discussions and review of relevant literature, reports and operational manuals of the studied DHMISs.
   Results: Key personnel at the DHS Level were not involved in the development and implementation of the established systems. The DHMISs were fragmented to the extent that their information products were bypassing the very levels they were created to serve. None of the DHMISs was computerized. Key resources for DHMIS operation were inadequate. The adequacy of personnel was 47%, working space 40%, storage space 34%, stationery 20%, 73% of DHMIS staff were not trained, management support was 13%. Information produced was 30% accurate, 19% complete, 26% timely, 72% relevant; the level of confidentiality and use of information at the point of collection stood at 32% and 22% respectively and information security at 48%. Basic DHMIS equipment for information processing was not available. This inhibited effective and efficient provision of information services.
   Conclusions: An effective DHMIS is essential for DHS planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation activities. Without accurate, timely, relevant and complete information the existing information systems are not capable of facilitating the DHS managers in their day-today operational management. The existing DHMISs were found not supportive of the DHS managers' strategic and operational management functions. Consequently DHMISs were found to be plagued by numerous designs, operational, resources and managerial problems. There is an urgent need to explore the possibilities of computerizing the existing manual systems to take advantage of the potential uses of microcomputers for DHMIS operations within the DHS. Information system designers must also address issues of cooperative partnership in information activities, systems compatibility and sustainabitity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Emergency situations require more resources than normal operations. If human society does not address environmental problems effectively before they reach the emergency stage, life from then on will be in a sustained (indefinite) state of emergency. Sustainable use of the planet requires optimal use of resources, which can be facilitated by avoiding sustained emergency conditions. Some emergencies beyond human control will always occur, and adequate global resources must be allocated to cope with them. However, a huge number of emergencies are simply the result of failing to take precautionary, preventative action in time.

ID PROTECTED AREAS
AB Conservation is increasingly promoted as a sustainable development instrument in Southern Africa, particularly for remote rural communities. Conservation and development schemes are marketed as community-based projects providing local empowerment through the creation of jobs and cash stemming from protected areas, as well as increased biodiversity protection by local communities whose jobs are dependent on the resource. Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs), mega Peace Parks that cross international borders, are one of the latest conservation and development paradigms in Southern Africa. TFCAs have gained broad support, including government recognition as a development tool. However, there has been minimal research on the impact of TFCAs on local communities. This paper seeks to provide an empirical case study of a South African community bordering the Lubombo TFCA (South Africa, Swaziland, Mozambique). Results are presented that indicate the Mbangweni community in KwaZulu-Natal could experience decreased access to social, natural, and economic resources as a result of the Peace Park.

DE environment; efficiency change; technical change; sustainable
   development
AB A country's macroeconomic policies have two basic objectives: to provide its citizens with a means to make a better living and a preferable environment. For the past decades, accompanying its fantastic economic growth, fast-developing Asia has become one of the major contributors to the increase of global carbon dioxide emissions. This paper analyzes productivity growth of ten Asian countries, namely, China, Japan, the NIEs and the ASEAN-4, by examining their outputs from economic performance and environmental impact standpoints. Productivity growth and its components are calculated using the Malmquist index. There appears to be a widening gap between the productivity growth trends without/with CO2 emissions of the ten Asian economies. This implies that the factor of productivity could be over-emphasized at great cost to the environment. A cross-country comparison analysis, considering CO2 emissions, shows that the productivity of China and ASEAN-4 deteriorated while the productivity growth of Japan and NIEs performed much better.

TI Urban planning and sustainable development under transitional economy: a

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY

ID CHINA; LAND
AB There are always conflicts between the need for conservation and economic growth in the developing countries. Planning plays a primary role in balancing these conflicts. This is particularly obvious in Chinese cities since China adopted its open door policy in 1978. Foreign investment has been a major driving force for rapid growth of the Chinese economy. Planners in China have been facing the dilemma of protecting the natural environment on the one hand while, on the other hand, supporting the overall national goal of attracting foreign investment to maintain continuous economic growth. The planning system in China, which has been largely based on a planned economy, soon found itself handicapped in safeguarding the environment from rapid industrialization and urbanization fostered by market forces. This paper takes Guangzhou as an example to study challenges to the planning system in Chinese cities in the past two decades of rapid economic growth and urbanization. By means of a case study on an industrial development within a protected orchard area in Guangzhou, this study illustrates the conflict between the need for rural conservation and the pressure for economic development in the Chinese cities. In particular, it analyzes the pressures on the present urban planning system in China in terms of the following categories: the emergence of private investors in urban development; the goal of pursuing a high economic growth rate; the implications of a transitional economy for urban planning; and the weakness of the present urban planning system. It concludes that the role of urban planning in China should change from simply providing guidelines on board land-use strategy, to a combination of a strategic plan with specific development control laws at the operational level. Finally, some recommendations are suggested as to how to improve the planning system in China.

ID PLATEAU
AB There is an urgent need to study soil water resources and eco-hydrological characteristics in depth so as to carry forward ecological environmental construction in the Loess Plateau. Soil moisture was measured to a depth of 5 m on 11 sites with different landforms and land uses in a transect of the Zhonglianchuan watershed during 2002. The watershed is located in the northern Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, and is part of a semiarid and loess hilly area. There were different types of soil moisture variations in 2002 on the 11 sites. Soil moisture contents were low on all sites, and the average water contents at 2 to 5-m depth were usually lower than 10% by weight, and the lowest water contents were found in slope land under Medicago sativa and Caragana korshinskii vegetation. The dry soil layer is common in this area, not only under planted vegetation but also under natural vegetation. The soil moisture in a slope segment or area can be increased by collecting and harvesting surface runoff from upslope areas. One effective way to collect runoff is by constructing level terraces, alternating with sloping lands. The proportion of various grasslands, acreage of alfalfa, and sustainable development of the region should be further studied in order to successfully convert cultivated land into grassland.

AB Primary surveys were conducted in 20 villages and an equal number of community managed forests (CMFs) of two districts, Adilabad and Chittoor in the state of Andhra Pradesh in southern India. The interviews conducted with 216 respondents listed a total of 22 and 23 non-timber forest products (NTFP) from Adilabad and Chittoor districts, respectively, of which 15 species were common to both study districts. Eight of these NTFPs, including, Sterculia urens, Thysanolena maxima, Sapindus emerginatus, Dendrocalamus strictus, Pongamia pinnata, Schleichera oleosa, Azadirachta indica and Diospyros melenoxylon were collected for commercial purposes. The vegetation survey was conducted in a total of 240 sample plots in 20 CMFs, and found 15 NTFP species from Adilabad and 18 NTFP species from Chittoor. The density of NTFP trees in Adilabad was 52 trees/ha, as against an overall tree density of 278 trees/ha, while in Chittoor it was only 28 trees/ha as against an overall density of 110 trees/ha. The regeneration density of NTFP species was, however, higher in Chittoor. Some of the NTFP species, prioritized for conservation, included Sterculia urens, Tamarindus indica, Phyllanthus emblica, Strychnos nuxvomica, S. potatorum and Anogeissus latifolia.

AB The World Development Report 2000-2001 recommends action on three complementary and synergistic fronts for poverty alleviation - promoting opportunity, facilitating empowerment and enhancing security. This paper analyses the Tamilnadu Forestry Project, funded by US$100 million from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, for community forestry. The project was launched in 1997-1998 in this southern state of India and has evolved into a comprehensive poverty alleviation programme for the forest abutting villages where the proportion of poor people is largest. It endeavours to explain how the project provides the above three elements at the local level for sustainable poverty alleviation. Regeneration of forests, improvement of basic infrastructure through integration of line departments and promotion of alternate livelihoods provide ample economic opportunities. Establishment of Village Forest Councils, and delegation of sufficient powers to these Councils, has empowered the poorest of the poor. Tree assets, promotion of alternate income generation activities and water harvesting structures have provided security by reducing vulnerability to natural vagaries, particularly drought. In this project, the restoration of biodiversity and people development go hand in hand in a synergistic way that makes the project worth replicating elsewhere in the country and other parts of the world, with suitable modifications.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In Saudi Arabia, the recharge to local and regional aquifers is mostly indirect, very limited and insignificant, especially with low annual precipitation. Most of the stored groundwater in local and regional aquifers is non-renewable fossil water. With rapid socio-economic developments and increasing population coupled with agricultural and industrial growth in the Kingdom, especially after the large increase in oil revenues after 1974, the water demands have increased drastically. By understanding the aquifer features, the country followed a planned approach based on controlling aquifer development and demand management to use its groundwater resources. The socio-economic developments in rural areas have been very pronounced. Corrective demand management measures including reduction in cultivated areas and modification in agricultural support policies in addition to the augmentation of water supplies by the reuse of treated wastewater have reduced the stress on groundwater. The establishment of a special Ministry for water and the adoption of a national water planning approach and the use of an integrated water resources management tool are expected to contribute effectively to the achievement of sustainable groundwater resources and the national interest of the country.

DT Article
AB The Rhine-Neckar Region is a densely populated and highly industrialized region with competing interests and strong pressure on the availability of high-quality groundwater. The increasing pressure on both groundwater quantity and quality is due to the high demand of people and industry for water and to pollution by industrial spills as well as agricultural activities. This led to a systematic investigation of the groundwater management of the multilayered transboundary aquifer and the question of its sustainability. A combination of intensive groundwater model simulations, scenario analyses and stakeholder participation proved to be a promising approach to tackle the complex issues of groundwater management. Long-term consequences, changes in natural processes and ecosystem needs were particularly considered. Specific recommendations for improved groundwater management in this region were formulated. The study also shows the need for a general approach towards the assessment of sustainable groundwater management.

AB A 50-question survey was developed by the land grant universities in the Pacific Northwest to document public awareness, aptitudes, attitudes and actions toward water issues in the states of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington, USA. Demographic data were also collected about the survey respondents. The statistically designed survey was completed by over 50% of the 1800 residents who were solicited for the study. The public consider clean groundwater a high priority issue. Survey respondents currently consider groundwater quality to be good; however, most people are unaware of groundwater quantity issues. In the last 5 years, a majority of survey respondents have taken voluntary actions both to protect groundwater quality and to conserve the use of this resource. People want the government to focus more attention on groundwater issues; however, they are unwilling to pay increased taxes to achieve this end. Based on this survey, the land grant universities need to increase groundwater education programmes for the public using television, radio, newspapers and the Internet rather than by the traditional workshop delivery methods.

TI Performance of farmer-managed irrigation systems for rice production in
   East Java Province, Indonesia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses the importance of an institutional mechanism to allocate and distribute irrigation water properly, to reduce conflicts and to mobilize financial support for sustainable rice production. The study reveals that the contributing factors affecting the performance of farmer-managed irrigation systems for rice production are plot size and the application of seed, fertilizer and pesticides, and the influencing factors are water adequacy during the dry season and a fixed schedule of intermittent flow of water distribution. Water inadequacy and dissatisfaction on the timeliness of water distribution are the potential sources of conflicts, whereas the ability of farmers to pay irrigation fees and the acceptance of a fee system are the major concerns about the financial support for irrigation operation and maintenance. The accountability of a water user's association is the main factor influencing the success of an institutional role in the sustainability of rice production.

TI MARS-OZ: A design for a simulated Mars base in the Australian outback
SO JBIS-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH INTERPLANETARY SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE MARS-OZ; simulated Mars base; analogue; Australian
ID EXPLORATION; MISSION
AB Mars Society Australia has developed the design of a simulated Mars base, MARS-OZ, for deployment in cutback Australia. MARS-OZ will provide a platform for a diverse range of Mars analogue research in Australia. The simulated base consists of two mobile modules whose dimensions and shape approximate those of horizontally landed bent biconic spacecraft described in an earlier paper. The modules are designed to support field engineering, robotics, architectural, geological, biological and human factors research at varying levels of simulation fidelity. Non-Mars related research can also be accommodated, for example general field geology and biology, and engineering research associated with sustainable, low impact Architecture. Crews of up to eight can be accommodated. In addition to its research function, the base also will serve as a centre of space education and outreach activities. The prime site for the MARS-OZ simulated base is located in the northern Flinders Ranges near Arkaroola in South Australia. This region contains many features that provide useful scientific analogues to known or possible past and present conditions on Mars from both a geological and biological perspective. The features will provide a wealth of study opportunities for crews. The very diverse terrain and regolith materials will provide ideal opportunities to field trial a range of equipment, sensors and exploration strategies. If needed, the prime site can be secured from casual visitors, allowing research into human interaction in isolation. Despite its relative isolation, the site is readily accessible by road and air from major Australian centres. This paper provides description of the configuration, design and construction of the proposed facility, its interior layout, equipment and systems fitouts, a detailed cost estimate, and its deployment. We estimate that the deployment of MARS-OZ could occur within nine months of securing funding.

ID PROJECT ASSIST COALITIONS; HEALTH PROMOTION; NORTH-CAROLINA; OUTCOMES;
   ABUSE
AB Purpose: To describe the models created by the 13 communities in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Community Coalition Partnership Program (CCPP), and the relationship between key organizational features of the coalitions and the perception by coalition members of interim and community-wide outcomes.
   Methods: This study relied on three sources of data: interviews conducted on site with a sample of coalition staff, evaluators, and members (n = 364); a written survey administered after the site visit to those interviewed (n = 216) asking about perceived outcomes and changes between the beginning and end of the project; and a coalition member survey mailed to all coalition members at all sites (n = 341) focusing on perceptions of coalition functioning, outcomes, and satisfaction.
   Results: A variety of coalition models were developed. Respondents were positive in their assessments of how their coalitions operated even though few were sustained. The coalitions for which members perceived more positive outcomes were better established at the outset of the grant, led by paid staff, and had an area-wide focus, a steering committee, and a hub that was not a community-based organization. Coalitions composed primarily of neighborhood members were difficult to maintain.
   Conclusions: Despite members' high ratings, by the end of the funding period most coalitions were no longer functioning. It may be that coalitions are useful but not as permanent structures in communities. Grassroots and individual members not affiliated with an agency may require meaningful incentives to sustain participation. Because maturity of the coalition at the start of the project was a good predictor of sustainability, time should be spent verifying the stage of coalition development before funding.

AB Sustainable outdoor pig production requires vegetation that can maintain ground cover, assimilate manure nutrients, and prevent soil erosion. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the suitability of four forages: alfalfa (Medicago sativa), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), white clover (Trifolium repens), and buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) for grazing or ground cover in pastures for pigs. Each forage plot covered 7.5 m(2), with nine replicates in a randomized block design. In Exp. 1, eight pregnant gilts had free access to all forages during a 2-d adjustment period. Immediately thereafter, pairs of gilts were assigned randomly to one of each of four blocks of the four forages during a 2-d measurement period. The percentage of ground cover for each forage was visually estimated at 0, 24, and 48 h of study. Behavioral data, including walking, eating, grazing, rooting, drinking, standing, lying, and time spent in hut were video-monitored continuously for 48 h. Initial percentage of ground cover was 100% for all species. By 48 h, percentage of ground cover decreased (P < 0.001) for white clover (11.3 +/- 0.88%) and alfalfa (36.3 +/- 0.88%), but not for tall fescue (98.0 +/- 0.88%) or buffalograss (98.0 +/- 0.88%). Gilts spent more (P < 0.01) time grazing white clover (16.3 +/- 1.97 min/d) and alfalfa (11.2 +/- 1.97) than tall fescue (0.8 +/- 1.97) or buffalograss (0.3 +/- 1.97), and rooted more (P < 0.04) white clover than other forages. In Exp. 2, six gilts from the initial group were put on six blocks of the four forages. Each gilt was assigned randomly to three replicates of each forage, including alfalfa, tall fescue, or buffalograss (white clover was excluded because of damage by gilts during Exp. 1), and gilts grazed single forages for 2 d. After this grazing period, the percentage of ground cover was less (P < 0.01) for alfalfa than for buffalograss or tall fescue (37.5 +/- 0.38, 96.7 +/- 0.39, 96.3 +/- 0.39%, respectively). With access to a single forage, pregnant gilts spent more (P < 0.01) time grazing alfalfa (15.8 +/- 2.36 min/d) than buffalograss (1.5 +/- 2.36) or tall fescue (0.7 +/- 2.37). These gilts clearly preferred grazing white clover and alfalfa, and rooting and eating white clover compared with buffalograss or tall fescue. Rates of ground cover loss were less (P < 0.01) for tall fescue and buffalograss than for the more preferred forages. Less preferred forages could have potential as pasture for swine when the primary objective is ground cover maintenance rather than nutrient supply.

TI Towards sustainable neighborhood design: A sustainability evaluation
   framework and a case study of the Greenwich Millennium Village Project
SO JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB This research aims to propose a sustainability evaluation framework at a neighborhood level and to draw out any transferable lessons for future development by analyzing a cutting-edge project towards sustainable neighborhood design, the Greenwich Millennium Village (GMV) Project, using that framework. The results of the analysis suggest that the sustainability evaluation framework devised by this research can be used to effectively measure the project level of progress towards sustainabilily, although further research is essential to more extensively apply, test, and modify the framework. The results also suggest that, overall, the GMV project aimed to achieve a significantly higher level of progress towards sustainability in most of the evaluation criteria, compared to conventional practice in the U.K. However this project is moving slowly towards sustainability. In many aspects, the project current practices in phases I and II have failed to meet the sustainability targets indicated in the competition proposal. Therefore, there are considerable doubts as to the project likely success in creating a socially mixed and environmentally friendly sustainable community as envisioned. In addition, the research suggests that there exist perceptual, economic, institutional, and implementation barriers toward sustainability within current planning and design practices, and it highlights the need for setting sustainability targets, indicators, and benchmarks at a very early stage in order to prevent potential conflicts between key actors, which hinder progress towards sustainability.

AB Overgrazing by increasing numbers of livestock in the Horqin Sandy Land of Inner Mongolia, China, has led to extensive degradation of the region's sandy steppes. Degraded grasslands are generally classified into four main types: fixed (least degradation), semi-fixed (light degradation), semi-shifting (moderate degradation) and shifting (severe degradation) sandy lands, representing four stages of degradation development. An experiment was conducted in the Horqin Sandy Land to investigate changes in intensity of wind erosion at different stages of degradation development in sandy grasslands and determine the extent to which surface wind erosion was affected by surface-related soil and vegetation factors through their effects on surface roughness length and wind regimes. Daily wind erosion rate was monitored at four sites of degraded grassland over an erosive period from I April to 10 June in 2001. Soil and vegetation properties for these sites were also measured twice: one in mid-April prior to the establishment of vegetation and again in mid-June after the establishment of vegetation. Relationships between surface roughness length and soil and vegetation variables were examined at each of the two stages of vegetation development. This study shows striking differences in the intensity of surface wind erosion among sites. The daily wind erosion rate in the fixed sandy land was, on average, only about 115 of the rate in the semi-fixed sandy land, 1/14 of the rate in the semi-shifting sandy land and 1/47 of the rate in the shifting sandy land suggesting a much higher resistance of the fixed sandy land to wind erosion compared to other sites. Differences in rate of wind erosion between sites were attributed to between-site differences in soil and vegetation properties that exerted significant effects on wind regimes by altering surface roughness length. At the pre-establishment stage of vegetation, surface roughness length was determined by a combination of litter amount on the ground, soil surface hardness and soil moisture content, with litter amount explaining the greatest proportion of the variation. At the post-establishment stage of vegetation, the development of the surface roughness effects was mainly governed by vegetation characteristics (vegetation cover in particular), while the effects of soil surface hardness and soil moisture on surface roughness length are likely to be masked by vegetation effects. The findings suggest that better management practices of restoring vegetation in degraded grasslands are required to reduce soil erosion losses and achieve a sustainable livestock production in the Horqin Sandy Land, an ecologically fragile sandy land ecosystem.

ID STAKEHOLDER THEORY; STOCKHOLDERS
AB In their role as political Actors and lobbyists, corporations have responsibilities to help determine the existence and content of global regulations of pollutants. The ethical nature of those responsibilities is highly sensitive to the assumed normative framework. This paper compares several frameworks by modeling them as differently weighted versions of utilitarianism. Under a strict neoclassical approach, corporations have a narrow obligation to maximize profits, which generally entails opposing emission regulations. In contrast, a stakeholder approach as well as Marxian and common ethics approaches suggest that firms have an obligation to actively support sustainable emission regulations with the following properties:
   major restrictions would be global rather than local
   global restrictions would apply in all cases of persistent emissions
   global restrictions would apply to non-persistent emissions as well, unless they have been affirmatively shown to be safe using reasonably persuasive scientific evidence
   safety thresholds would be set fairly restrictively, based on administrative models and rules of thumb, in light of existing scientific knowledge but without requiring full scientific justification
   long-run goals would include zero emission of persistent unsafe substances.
   However, the stakeholder approach supports phase-in rules to mitigate short-run compliance costs.

AB Scholars have linked the institutional view with strategic choice to better understand institutional pressures and the associated organizational strategic responses. We empirically evaluate Oliver's [Acad. Manage. Rev. 6 (1991) 145] framework that addresses these relationships using information from the steel industry and the important issue of radioactive contamination of scrap steel. Our findings, partially replicating three earlier studies, provide general support for her framework. In addition, we identified support for this typology in areas where earlier studies provided inconsistent results.
   An important finding was that firms that cooperated with others in their industry favored less active firm strategies and were less inclined to engage in the actively resistant strategies of avoidance and defiance. Finally, our findings question the positioning of the manipulation strategy and suggest that using separate lenses for institutions and organizations may be appropriate. The firms in our study considered the strategy of manipulation similar to acquiescence and compromise. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The effects of limonene, a mixture of limonene + carvone (1:1, v/v), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on diamondback moth (DBM) (Plutella xylostella L.) oviposition, larval feeding, and the behavior of its larval parasitoid Cotesia plutellae (Kurdjumov) with cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. ssp. capitata, cvs. Rinda and Lennox) and broccoli (B. oleracea subsp. Italica cv Lucky) were tested. Limonene showed no deterrent effect on DBM when plants were sprayed with or exposed to limonene, although there was a cultivar difference. A mixture of limonene and carvone released from vermiculite showed a significant repellent effect, reducing the number of eggs laid on the cabbages. MeJA treatment reduced the relative growth rate (RGR) of larvae on cv Lennox leaves. In Y-tube olfactometer tests, C. plutellae preferred the odors of limonene and MeJA to filtered air. In cv Lennox, the parasitoid preferred DBM-damaged plants with limonene to such plants without limonene. C. plutellae females were repelled by the mixture of limonene + carvone. In both cultivars, exogenous MeJA induced the emission of the sesquiterpene (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, the homoterpene (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), and green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate + octanal. The attractive effect of limonene and MeJA predicts that these two compounds can be used in sustainable plant protection strategies in organic farming.

AB Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of a psychoeducational intervention in improving cancer-related fatigue.
   Patients and Methods This randomized controlled trial involved 109 women commencing adjuvant chemotherapy for stage I or II breast cancer in five chemotherapy treatment centers. Intervention group patients received an individualized fatigue education and support program delivered in the clinic and by phone over three 10- to 20-minute sessions 1 week apart. Instruments included a numeric rating scale assessing confidence with managing fatigue; 11-point numeric rating scales measuring fatigue at worst, average, and best; the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue and Piper Fatigue Scales; the Cancer Self-Efficacy Scale; the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30; and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. For each outcome, separate analyses of covariance of change scores between baseline (T1) and the three follow-up time points (T2, T3, and T4) were conducted, controlling for the variable's corresponding baseline value.
   Results Compared with the intervention group, mean difference scores between the baseline (T1) and immediate after the test (T2) assessments increased significantly more for the control group for worst and average fatigue, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue, and Piper fatigue severity and interference measures. These differences were not observed between baseline and T3 and T4 assessments. No significant differences were identified for any pre- or post-test change scores for confidence with managing fatigue, cancer self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, or quality of life.
   Conclusion Preparatory education and support has the potential to assist women to cope with cancer-related fatigue in the short term. However, further research is needed to identify ways to improve the potency and sustainability of psychoeducational interventions for managing cancer-related fatigue.

   RIVER; GROWTH; EUTROPHICATION
AB Algal blooms, often associated with eutrophication, are common in temperate regions in coastal lagoons and estuarine areas as well as in open seas. However, because of recent changes in water flows and sediment and nutrient loads in most rivers, eutrophication phenomena are now occurring in areas previously non affected. One of its most widespread and easily recognized effects in a coastal marine ecosystem is the excessive growths and drifts of macroalgae, to such a degree that the biomass becomes a significant problem.
   The nutrients, notably from anthropogenic origin, constitute a significant factor in the appearance of the blooms in coastal waters. Besides a background originating from natural areas and precipitations, nutrients come from agriculture, sewage, industry, and aquaculture, in very various proportions following the local conditions.
   At first, the development of opportunist and tolerant seaweeds acts as a purifying system. Then, when the seaweed is stranded or the environmental conditions become unfavourable, the plants die and decompose. The degradation of the chemical equilibrium induces the break-down of the biological balance in the ecosystem. At this stage, a large biomass can become troublesome, resulting in an increase in the herbivore population, competition or toxicity towards flora and fauna, alteration of the sediment, recycling of nutrients and pollutants in the ecosystem, nuisance for local residents and reduction of tourism (beaches degradation, chironomids, odors). Sooner or later, the water deteriorates, which may have a toxic effect on fauna including the commercial fish stocks.
   Eutrophication problems have thus become a matter of major concern. Its management is neither a simple nor a cheap task. But, environmental and sustainability concerns may, in a not too distant future, override the lack of financial benefit. At any rate, underlayed action is required because in estuarine and potamologic milieus, potential land disposal arrangements are becoming rarer and costlier.
   Control of eutrophication can only be reached effectively by drastic reduction of the total nutrient load of an overloaded water system. In order to be successful, only an integrated approach, based on a water body's nutrient mass balance and taking into consideration specific geographical, climatological and ecological conditions, can be effective. Moreover, it may take many years before recovery of a eutrophicated ecosystem, because the sediments constitute a complementary source of nutrients for macroalgae. But, prevention will prevent the nutrients from being discharged in the lagoons or in the sea. It will concern the waste treatment, agricultural mode change and treatment of gaseous effluent from polluting human activities.

AB An estimated 40% of the world's population lacks access to sanitation facilities. Approximately 6000 children, most or them in developing countries, die every day of diseases related to inadequate sanitation and a lack of access to safe drinking water. In Europe merely 30% of all water borne sewage functions in a sustainable manner. As a first measure to be taken in order to solve this unsustainable sanitation situation, it is estimated that more than 2.6 billion people will need to gain access to sustainable and effective sanitation within the next 10 years. However, getting people to use, understand and accept sustainable sanitation alternatives has proven to be a big challenge. The intention of this paper is to involve behavioural scientists in the psychosocially related problems of sanitation. There is an urgent need to find clues as to how this issue can be brought to the attention of people in various cultures and gain their acceptance. Some of the clues suggested in this paper take Maslow's hierarchy of needs as their starting point, as this serves as an important indicator of people's desires and needs concerning sanitation. It is also suggested that, in contrast to how the promotion of sanitation is carried out today, marketing and use of a cognitive approach can greatly influence the degree of acceptance of sustainable solutions.

AB The study of how parasites adapt to new hosts is of great importance for understanding the emergence of new diseases. Here, we report a study of the anther smut disease on Gypsophila repens (Caryophyllaceae). In contrast to what is usually found on other host species, infected natural populations of G. repens are extremely rare. Moreover, symptoms of diseased plants are incomplete and highly variable over the time. These results suggest that the fungus infecting G. repens is a case of a parasite not capable of exploiting its host optimally. Molecular analyses of Microbotryum violaceum strains infecting this and other Caryophyllaceae revealed that this sub-optimal behaviour probably resulted from a recent host shift from the morphologically similar plant Petrorhagia saxifraga. With its exceptionally low virulence and prevalence, but apparent self-sustainability, the disease on G. repens may thus represent an interesting case study for investigating the conditions leading to adaptation of parasites on new hosts.

AB This study investigated a small subset of the two community water-disinfection systems-hypochlorinators and tablet feeders-in rural Honduras. Levels of residual chlorine were assessed at three locations within the distribution system: the tank, the proximal house, and the distal house. The levels of residual chlorine were compared with the standard guidelines set by the Pan American Health Organization and the International Rural Water Association for potable water that require a minimum of 1.0 (tank), 0.5 (proximal house), and 0.2 (distal house) ppm for each location. ne levels of residual chlorine were also compared across systems, e.g. hypochlorinators to tablet feeders. At the tank and proximal house, tablet feeders had significantly higher mean values for levels of residual chlorine (measured in ppm) than hypochlorinators (tank: 1.20 vs 0.67; proximal house: 0.44 vs 0.32, p<0.001 for both) with no significant difference at the distal house (0.16 vs 0.16). At the tank and proximal house, tablet feeders were more likely to meet recommended standards than hypochlorinators (90.3% vs 13.3%, p<0.0001 and 41.3% vs 23.7%, p<0.0001) with a smaller difference seen at the distal house (30.6% vs 27.1%, p=0.24). The apparent dichotomy in chlorine levels of tablet feeders (e.g. between tank/proximal house and distal house) is discussed. The results suggest that tablet feeders may be more effective than hypochlorinators in supplying clean water in rural, resource-poor settings and possibly serve as an alternative technology for water disinfection. Further research on techniques for empowering and building capacity within community water boards will help organize and introduce sustainable water systems in developing countries.

AB Cobalt-incorporated MCM-41 samples were synthesized using different concentrations of Cobalt (Si/Co ratios from 20 to 100) and a direct hydrothermal method. To investigate the mechanical stability of Co-MCM-41 samples, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured after compressing the sample under high pressure. X-Ray diffraction patterns of Co-MCM-41 samples obtained after calcination, but before compressing, showed four diffraction peaks irrespective of the cobalt loading; this finding indicates that the mesoporous silica has a highly ordered hexagonal symmetry. After compressing the Co-MCM-41 sample (Si/Co=50) up to 392 MPa, the surface area deceased from 1343 to 782 m(2)/g. However, the mesopore structure of the Co-MCM-41 sample was maintained and the pore size (3.7 nm) was the same as that of the pristine sample. These findings suggest that Co-incorporated mesoporous silica materials are very sustainable to compression at high pressure.

ID COST
AB Eco-efficiency is an instrument for sustainability analysis, indicating an empirical relation in economic activities between environmental cost or value and environmental impact. This empirical relation can be matched against normative considerations as to how much environmental quality or improvement society would like to offer in exchange for economic welfare, or what the trade-off between the economy and the environment should be if society is to realize a certain level of environmental quality. Its relevance lies in the fact that relations between economy and environment are not self-evident, not at a micro level and not at the macro level resulting from micro-level decisions for society as a whole. Clarifying the why and what of eco-efficiency is a first step toward decision support on these two aspects of sustainability. With the main analytic framework established, filling in the actual economic and environmental relations requires further choices in modeling. Also, the integration of different environmental effects into a single score requires a clear definition of approach, because several partly overlapping methods exist. Some scaling problems accompany the specification of numerator and denominator, which need a solution and some standardization before eco-efficiency analysis can become more widely used. With a method established, the final decision is how to embed it in practical decision making. In getting the details of eco-efficiency better specified, its strengths, but also its weaknesses and limitations, need to be indicated more clearly

AB We develop and apply a valuation methodology to calculate the cost of sustainability capital, and, eventually, sustainable value creation of companies. Sustainable development posits that decisions must take into account all forms of capital rather than just economic capital. We develop a methodology that allows calculation of the costs that are associated with the use of different forms of capital. Our methodology borrows the idea from financial economics that the return on capital has to cover the cost of capital. Capital costs are determined as opportunity costs, that is, the forgone returns that would have been created by alternative investments. We apply and extend the logic of opportunity costs to the valuation not only of economic capital but also of other forms of capital. This allows (a) integrated analysis of use of different forms of capital based on a value-based aggregation of different forms of capital, (b) determination of the opportunity cost of a bundle of different forms of capital used in a company, called cost of sustainability capital, (c) calculation of sustainability efficiency of companies, and (d) calculation of sustainable value creation, that is, the value above the cost of sustainability capital. By expanding the well-established logic of the valuation of economic capital in financial markets to cover other forms of capital, we provide a methodology that allows determination of the most efficient allocation of sustainability capital for sustainable value creation in companies. We demonstrate the practicability of the methodology by the valuation of the sustainability performance of British Petroleum (BP).

AB To provide valuable support for successful decision-making, managers need a balanced set of financial and nonfinancial measures that represent different requirements, strategic goals, strategies, resources, and capabilities and the causal relationships between these domains. The balanced scorecard is such a measurement system. As an open system the balanced scorecard facilitates the consideration of sustainability issues. But enhanced balanced scorecards require a new type of data. This is where eco-efficiency analysis comes into play. This article discusses the relationship between so-called sustainability balanced scorecards and eco-efficiency analysis. Eco-efficiency analysis not only provides a data source for sustainability balanced scorecards; in the perspective of environmental information systems it also serves as a link between the balanced scorecard and corporate environmental accounting systems so that eco-efficiency as a component of an environmental information system becomes an adapter with two interfaces, which are characterized in this article. The main focus is on the principle of cause and effect, its different forms, and the implications for the design of appropriate information system components.

AB The concept of eco-efficiency is commonly referred to as a business link to sustainable development. In this article, eco-efficiency is examined at a regional level as an approach to promoting the competitiveness of economic activities in the Finnish Kymenlaakso region and mitigating their harmful impacts on the environment. The aim is to develop appropriate indicators for monitoring changes in the eco-efficiency of the region. A starting point is to produce indicators for the environmental and economic dimensions of regional development and use them for measuring regional eco-efficiency. The environmental impact indicators are based on a life-cycle assessment method, producing different types of environmental impact indicators: pressure indicators (e.g., emissions of CO2), impact category indicators (e.g., CO2 equivalents in the case of climate change), and a total impact indicator (aggregating different impact category indicator results into a single value). Environmental impact indicators based on direct material input, total material input and total material requirement of the Kymenlaakso region are also assessed. The economic indicators used are the gross domestic product, the value added, and the output of the main economic sectors of Kymenlaakso. In the eco-efficiency assessment, the economic and environmental impact indicators are monitored in the same graph. In a few cases eco-efficiency ratios can also be calculated (the economic indicators are divided by the environmental indicators). Output (= value added + intermediate consumption) is used as an economic indicator related to the environmental impact indicators, which also cover the upstream processes of the region's activities. In the article, we also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of using the different environmental impact indicators.

AB Eco-efficiency has been established as a crucial concept for corporate environmental management. Most approaches deal with eco-efficiency on the level of the company or the product. However, given that companies have special budgets earmarked for environmental operations or investments, the question arises as to which operation within which domain is the most eco-efficient. This article presents an approach to supporting these decisions by calculating eco-efficiency on the operational level. The procedure is demonstrated using a case study of the Swiss National Railway Company Investments and operations in the domains of energy production, landscape and nature conservation, noise protection, and contaminated soil remediation are assessed and compared. Decision-makers seeking an eco-efficient corporate investment policy will find, in this concept, a guideline for prioritizing various domains of operation as well as the operations within a domain.

ID REPEATED AUCTIONS; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; RISK
AB To enhance our understanding of collusion in procurement settings, this paper quantitatively evaluates how the buyer's choice of a reserve price influences the sustainability of two previously devised collusive schemes. If the buyer does not select its reserve price strategically, then collusion may be sustainable for a wide range of plausible discount factors. However, even mildly sophisticated reserve price selection can dramatically shrink the set of discount factors for which collusion is sustainable. These findings support existing arguments that buyers are vulnerable to collusion, but they also suggest that buyers possess tools that may profitably induce sellers to act competitively.

AB The effect of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) on acid deposition and soil water chemistry was studied at a site in the Ore Mts., Czech Republic, that has been subjected to decades of elevated acidic deposition. Dry deposition onto the spruce canopy significantly increased acid input to the soil in comparison to the beech canopy. As a result soil waters were more acidic; At, SO42-, and NO3- concentrations were significantly higher; and Ca and K concentrations were lower in the spruce stand than in the beech stand. The concentrations of potentially toxic inorganic aluminium (Al-in) were, on average, three times higher in the spruce stand than in the beech stand. Thus, At played a major role in neutralizing acid inputs to mineral soils in the spruce stand. Despite the higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in spruce organic soil solutions, organic At (Al-org) accounted for only 30% of total At (Al-tot), whereas in beech organic soil solutions Al-org, was 60% of Al-tot, Soil waters in the beech stand exhibited Al-in. concentrations close to solubility with jurbanite (Al(SO4)OH (.) 5H(2)O). The more acidic soil waters in the spruce stand were oversaturated with respect to jurbanite. The Bc/Al-in ratio (Bc = Ca + Mg + K) in O horizon leachate was 4.6 and 70 in spruce and beech stands, respectively. In beech mineral soil solutions, the Bc/Alin ratio declined significantly to about 2. In the spruce stand, mineral soil solutions had Bc/Alin values below the critical value of 1. The observed Bc/Alin value of 0.4 at 30 cm depth in the spruce stand suggests significant stress for spruce rooting systems. A more favourable value of 31 was observed for the same depth in the beech stand. The efficiency of the spruce canopy in capturing acidic aerosols, particulates, and cloud water has resulted in the long-term degradation of underlying soils as a medium for sustainable forest growth.

AB We indicate that financial crisis in social security programs might be endogenous because social security affects fertility and human capital's decisions and thus, the aggregate growth rate of the economy. These effects lead to an endogenous erosion of the financial basis of the PAYG social security program so that, as a consequence, the PAYG system is not sustainable and it requires continuous increases in the social security tax rate.

TI Use of corporate six sigma performance-improvement strategies to reduce
   incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections in a surgical ICU
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
LA English
DT Article
ID CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETERS; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; CARE; RISK;
   PREVENTION; MORTALITY; QUALITY; TIME
AB BACKGROUND: Corporate performance-improvement methodologies can outperform traditional ones in addressing ICU-based adverse events. My colleagues and I used Six Sigma methodology to address our catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) rate, which considerably exceeded the nationally established median over a 9-year period. We hypothesized that use of Six Sigma methodology would result in a substantial and sustainable decrease in our CR-BSI rate.
   STUDY DESIGN: All patients were directly cared for by a geographically localized surgical ICU team in an academic tertiary referral center. CR-BSIs were identified by infection control staff using CDC definitions. Personnel trained in Six Sigma techniques facilitated performance-improvement efforts. Interventions included barrier precaution kits, new policies for catheter changes over guide wires, adoption of a new site-preparation antiseptic, direct attending supervision of catheter insertions, video training for housestaff, and increased frequency of dressing changes. After additional data analysis, chlorhexidine-silver catheters were used selectively in high-risk patients. The impact of interventions was assessed by monitoring the number of catheters placed between CR-BSIs.
   RESULTS: Before the intervention period, 27 catheters were placed, on average, between individual CRBSIs, a CR-BSI rate of 11 per 1,000 catheter days. After all operations were implemented, 175 catheters were placed between line infections, and average CR-BSI rate of 1.7/1,000 catheter days, a 650% improvement (p < 0.0001). Compared with historic controls, adoption of chlorhexidine-silver catheters in high-risk patients had a considerable impact (50% reduction; P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first successful application of Six Sigma corporate performance-improvement method impacting purely clinical outcomes. CR-BSI reduction was highly substantial and sustained after other traditional strategies had failed.

AB OBJECTIVES: To examine key factors that influence sustainability in the diffusion of the Hospital Elder Life Program ( HELP) as an example of an evidence-based, multifaceted, innovative program to improve care for hospitalized older adults.
   DESIGN: Longitudinal, qualitative study between November 2000 and November 2003 based on 102 in-depth interviews every 6 months during HELP implementation.
   SETTING: Thirteen hospitals implementing HELP.
   PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two hospital staff members ( physician, nursing, volunteer, and administrative staff) implementing HELP, conducted 102 interviews.
   MEASUREMENTS: Staff experiences sustaining the program, including challenges and strategies that they viewed as successful in addressing these challenges.
   RESULTS: Of the 13 hospitals studied, 10 were sustaining HELP at the end of the study period; three terminated the program (after 24 months, 12 months, and 6 months). Critical factors were identified as influencing whether the program was sustained: the presence of clinical leadership, the ability and willingness to adapt the original HELP protocols to local hospital circumstances and constraints, and the ability to obtain longer-term resources and funding for HELP.
   CONCLUSION: Recognizing the need for sustained clinical leadership and funding as well as the inevitable modifications required to sustain innovative programs can promote more-realistic goals and expectations for health services researchers, clinicians, and policy makers in their laudable efforts to translate research into practice.

AB The likelihood of substantial increases in average life spans and the potential for profound longevity increases (to 100, 110, or 120 years on average) raises a host of societal issues. These include huge increases in the number of old and very old persons, the likelihood of a massive increase in health expenditures for the population aged 65 and older, the potential for outliving financial resources, challenges to the viability of Social Security and pensions, concerns about quality of life, and possible intergenerational antagonisms. If marked increases occur in average life spans worldwide, several billions could be added to world population at eventual stability, and that could become a sustainability issue.
   To prepare for what is likely to be our demographic future requires a major shift in thinking about this type of complex issue; we must change from a simple linear to a much broader systems approach. Changes in retirement age, strengthening (but then replacing) the Social Security system, retaining older persons in the labor force, mandating retirement savings during working years, and many other actions must be considered in a debate that should start now about life span increase and the future; if we dawdle, we risk the consequences of being unprepared for the dramatic demographic changes that are likely to occur in the coming decades.

AB This study describes forest succession following slash-and-burn agriculture in central Amazonia, based on four chronosequences (22 sites) of 2- to 25-y-old secondary regrowth and mature forest. Biomass accumulated in the form of a saturation curve: 25 y of regrowth restored half of the mature-forest biomass, 75%,) would be restored after an estimated 175 y. Biomass accumulation was accompanied by a rapid decrease in woody plant density and an increase of the positive skew of plant size distribution. Liana biomass share declined from 5.0% in young to 1.9% in old regrowth, and 1.3%) in mature forest, whereas the share of palms was low (0.5%) in young regrowth and high in old regrowth (1.8%) and mature forest (2.2%). 25-y-old regrowth was similar with mature forest in respect to woody plant density and growthform composition, but both the plant size distribution and the number of stems per plant differed strongly from mature forest. A moderate increase in land use had only minor effects on biomass accumulation, but profoundly changed structural characteristics of regrowth, pointing to a high vulnerability to degradation. Thus, the sustainability of slash-and-burn in central Amazonia may be lower than the rapid initial biomass accumulation would make it seem.

AB The Comprehensive Drug Research Center (CDRC) at the University of Miami was established in the early 1970s. Through the decades, investigators from the CDRC have worked with investigators from several countries to establish joint research efforts. Countries often do not have the infrastructure or monetary resources to carry out research on their own. Collaborating with institutions in these countries to build a sustainable capacity for research is a worthwhile and satisfying endeavor, and it presents a method for initiating research and building the necessary research structures. However, working with other countries presents a unique set of challenges and ethical dilemmas. This article presents some of the specific challenges encountered in these research efforts and describes what we have done to resolve the problems and work more effectively and efficiently with foreign investigators.

AB The concept of sustainable development is now valued to be fundamental to most issues concerning human activities for development. As sustainable development requires balancing conflicting requirements, rational decision making is necessary to achieve sustainability. Simulation models to assess and forecast sustainability can aid rational decision making. In the context of human settlements, human-nature interactions need to be considered in an integrated manner to build appropriate simulation models. The integrated model framework proposed here serves as a base for such simulation models. The model framework is based on the premise that a community's attitude and its living environment determine human settlement sustainability. A generic model design comprising fundamental components of the proposed sustainability assessment and forecasting model framework is also presented in this paper. Discussion on relevant implementation issues including a simulation system and key limitations of the framework are also presented. This framework can be adopted for development and implementation of a simulation system for sustainability assessment and forecasting studies.

AB An important indicator of sustainable land use, the ecological footprint measure has proved unsuitable for many planning applications because of the limited availability of impact data at the local level of cities and counties and because of an inability to estimate the ecological footprint of future development scenarios. In light of these limitations, this paper presents a methodology for measuring the ecological footprint of a county-level transportation network in current and future time periods. With the aid of vehicle travel behavior and fleet characteristics obtained from a number of state and federal agencies, we estimate the quantity of land required for constructing county highways and remediating annual greenhouse gas emissions through forest carbon sequestration in the years 2001, 2011, and 2021. The results of our study, which focuses on Houghton County, Michigan, indicate that, despite a projected increase in average vehicle fuel efficiency, the ecological footprint of transportation will increase in future years because of projected increases in total annual vehicle kilometers of travel along the network. On the basis of these results, we argue that the ecological footprint is a viable technique for transportation and land-use planning applications.

TI Between a rock and an incomprehensible place: The United States and the
   second North Korean nuclear crisis
SO KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is concerned with the second North Korean nuclear crisis and the Six-Party Talks. It seeks to explain the collapse of the Agreed Framework resulting from the shift in U.S. policy under the Bush administration and the decision by North Korea to resume nuclear activities. It discusses the origins, the course and the failure of the Six-Party Talks prior to their resumption in July 2005. It shows how the political philosophy of the Bush administration led it to adopt tactics that were unsuitable for the achievement of the objective of disarmament. Likewise, Pyongyang proceeded from assumptions that were erroneous, and Washington proved to be impervious to its threats and brinkmanship. Thus, while North Korea strove to improve its bargaining power, it had no strategy of how to make use of it, having lost the gains achieved under the Agreed Framework. The article elucidates the structural impediments to a successful outcome, which consist in the divergent objectives among the parties to the talks, the problem of dealing with a nuclear program that is claimed not to exist (the HEU program), the disagreement with North Korea about the modalities of disarmament and the unwillingness of Pyongyang to finally renounce all nuclear activities. It is argued that the nuclear crisis is merely a symptom of the fundamental crisis of the lack of sustainability of the North Korean state and that the nuclear issue, while urgent in itself, cannot be dealt with apart from the future of the Korean peninsula as a whole.

AB Large-scale grassland rehabilitation has been carried out on the severely degraded lands of the Tibetan plateau. The grasslands created provide a useful model for evaluating the recovery of ecosystem properties. The purposes of this research were: (1) to examine the relative influence of various rehabilitation practices on carbon and nitrogen in plants and soils in early secondary succession; and (2) to evaluate the degree to which severely degraded grassland altered plant and soil properties relative to the non-disturbed native community. The results showed: (1) The aboveground tissue C and N content in the control were 105-97 g m(-2) and 3.356gm(-2), respectively. The aboveground tissue C content in the mixed seed treatment, the single seed treatment, the natural recovery treatment and the severely degraded treatment was 137 per cent, 98 per cent, 49 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively, of that in the control. The corresponding aboveground tissue N content was 109 per cent, 84 per cent, 60 per cent and 47 per cent, respectively, of that in the control. (2) Root C and N content in 0-20 cm depths of the control had an 2 2 average 1606 gm(-2) and 30-36 gm(-2) respectively. Root C and N content in the rehabilitation treatments were in the range of 26-36 per cent and 35-53 per cent, while those in the severely degraded treatment were only 17 per cent and 26 per cent of that in the control. (3) In the control the average soil C and N content at 0-20 cm was 11307 gm(-2) and 846 gm(-2), respectively. Soil C content in the uppermost 20 cm in the seeded treatments, the natural recovery treatment and the severely degraded treatment was 67 per cent, 73 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively, while soil N content in the uppermost 20cm was 72 per cent, 82 per cent and 79 per cent, respectively, of that in the control. The severely degraded land was a major C source. Restoring the severely degraded lands to perennial vegetation was an alternative approach to sequestering C in former degraded systems. N was a limiting factor in seeding grassland. It is necessary for sustainable utilization of seeding grassland to supply extra N fertilizer to the soil or to add legume species into the seed mix.

AB Loss of soil organic matter under cropping systems is often considered one of the most serious forms of agriculturally induced soil degradation. Therefore, understanding how to improve or maintain soil fertility is of importance for sustainable systems of agriculture. This study deals with the effects of succession fallow and fertilization combined with crop rotation on the chemical properties and microbial biomass of soil in the central Loess Plateau, China. In order to create a more uniform experimental environment and avoid the influence of different crop residues, wheat/potato (W/P) rotation was selected as a fertilization treatment. The results showed that with increasing fallow time organic carbon (Corg) and total nitrogen (TN) slightly increased, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and MBC/Corg gradually decreased, and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) remained unchanged. However, only MBC/Corg among all the microbial parameters measured showed significant differences at various stages of fallow. Although there was a decrease in organic carbon and total nitrogen in the fertilized plots, MBC was not significantly different in the various fallow and fertilized plots except for one-year-old fallows, which had the highest MBC. MBN, MBC/Corg and MBN/TN in fertilized plots were higher than for plots at different stages of fallow. Fertilization can increase organic carbon, total nitrogen, MBC and MBN content (compared to the control). It was concluded that appropriate land management, such as fertilization combined with crop rotation and reducing one-year-old fallow, would be useful ways to improve or maintain soil fertility.

AB Revegetation, or other erosion control treatments of disturbed soil slopes in forested areas and along highways of the Lake Tahoe basin are directed at reduction of sediment loading to waterways reaching the lake. However, following treatment, little vegetation monitoring, or hydrologic evaluation has been conducted either to determine if the various treatments are successful or to assess the duration of erosion control anticipated in the field. Here, we build upon results from use of the portable rainfall simulator (RS) described in the first two papers of this series to evaluate cover and revegetation treatment effects on runoff rates and sediment concentrations and yields from disturbed granitic and volcanic soils in the basin. The effects of slope on rainfall runoff, infiltration and erosion rates were determined at several revegetated road cut and ski run sites. Rainfall simulation (similar to 60 mm h(-1), approximating a 100-year, 15-minute storm) had a mean drop size of similar to 2.1 mm and approximately 70 per cent of 'natural' rainfall kinetic energy. Measurements of: time to runoff; infiltration; runoff amount; sediment yield; and average sediment concentration were obtained. Runoff sediment concentrations and yields from sparsely covered volcanic and bare granitic soils can be correlated to slope. Sediment concentrations and yields from nearly bare volcanic soils exceeded those from granitic soils by an order of magnitude across slopes ranging from 30-70 percent. Revegetation, or application of pine-needle mulch covers to both soil types dramatically decreased sediment concentrations and yields. Incorporation of woodchips or soil rehabilitation that includes tillage, use of amendments (biosol, compost) and mulch covers together with plant seeding resulted in little or no runoff or sediment yield from both soils. Repeated measurements of sediment concentrations and yields in the subsequent two years following woodchip or soil rehabilitation treatments continued to result in little or no runoff. Revegetation treatments involving only use of grasses to cover the soils were largely ineffective due to sparse sustainable coverage ( < 35 percent) and inadequate infiltration rates.

AB Grasslands are increasingly considered not only for their contribution to livestock production but also in their various functions with respect to the environment and the landscape. There is an accumulation of scientific evidence about the environmental functions of grasslands, such as their role in the conservation of biodiversity, in the regulation of physical and chemical fluxes in ecosystems, and the mitigation of pollution. Their role in the maintenance of landscapes of value is also important for reasons of landscape amenity and cultural heritage.
   To introduce the challenges these functions bring for grassland management to both science and practice, a description of the benefits currently expected from grasslands and their role in agn-environmental and landscape public policies is given. The current scientific understanding of grassland dynamics in relation to management is then briefly addressed. An analysis of the changes occurring in grassland management practice and research in reference to the whole farm and the landscape is then provided. The diversity of grasslands and their spatial arrangement within a farm and the landscape appear from this analysis as two emergent factors of major importance in the search for sustainable development of livestock farms and the environment. The practical consequences on both livestock farmer practice and the direction of animal production research are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Grazing lands and their management in livestock systems are a matter of special importance in the search for sustainability. Socio-economic and ecological objectives should be considered jointly in considering livestock production. In addition to the general issues of biodiversity and habitat preservation, the challenges for their management vary according to the regional conditions. In Southern European environments, where the past changes in livestock fanning have led to a general decrease in their use, the questions under study are how to find ways to meet the threats to landscape amenity, biodiversity, the sustainability of local animal feeding resources and the rural population. Grazing lands and their management is also an important target of EU agri-environmental policy. The multifunctional use of this land, which is currently sought, reinforces the need for animal scientists to consider the use and management of gazing lands in reference not only to the techno-economical efficiency of animal feeding systems but also in reference to the long-term (e.g. biodiversity change) and at larger spatial scales (for example the landscape and watershed). An overview of the current challenges attached to grazing lands and their management in livestock farming systems in South European environments, an understanding of the ways to jointly meet production objectives and the realisation of sociological and ecological functions is presented.

AB The 'Sierra de Guara' Natural Park (81,491 ha, Huesca, Spain) is a protected Mediterranean mountain area dominated by shrub and forest pastures. Traditional agriculture, mainly extensive grazing systems, has decreased in the last decades; concurrently, invasion of shrub vegetation, landscape changes and higher risk of forest fires have been observed.
   A study, which started in 2000, was carried out with two broad objectives: at the farm level, to analyse the fanning systems and evaluate management strategies; at the regional level, to give useful information to conservation authorities for better decision-making.
   An integrated approach with different spatial scales and methods of analysis was used. First, a survey covering all farms that utilized the Park was carried out and livestock farming systems were characterized in terms of grazing management, technical and socio-economic factors. Second, six representative areas were selected to evaluate, depending on livestock utilization, grass and shrub vegetation dynamics (biomass, green/dead ratio). Third, vegetation and livestock data were analysed using a Geographic Information System to identify constraining factors and areas of intervention. Key imbalances were identified that can threaten the sustainability of the Park: low continuity of farming families; intensification of the management system; degradation of grazing resources; and concentration of grazing areas. A number of management recommendations are raised. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Integrated oceans management (IOM) is emerging in the international arena as a tool in meeting requirements for sustainable use of ocean space and marine resources. Australia and Canada are at the forefront of these developments and, being without set precedents, each state has adopted quite different strategies to implement IOM-Australia adopting a policy-driven approach delivered through Regional Marine Plans and Canada developing legislation that provided a framework for policy implementation delivered through an Integrated Management Framework. Despite these significant differences, examination of initiatives in both states indicates that there are also significant commonalities and shared experiences, providing important lessons for implementing IOM.

AB Although West African fisheries have been the subject of considerable study, little attention has paid to the role of gender in the development process and, more specifically, the work done by women in the overall management of fisheries. Lack of attention to the gender dimension of fisheries management can result in policy interventions missing their target of creating sustainable livelihoods at the community level. There is little doubt that fishing-dependent communities have a vital role to play in the overall development process of many coastal West African States, but without a complete understanding of the complexity of gender roles, the goal of sustainable livelihoods is unlikely to be achieved. In a bid to improve knowledge about gender roles in fishing communities, and to provide policy makers with some guidance as to where interventions might be most useful, a workshop was held in Cotonou, Benin (West Africa) in December 2003. This paper provides a brief introduction to the theory oil gender and fisheries development and then goes on to report the findings of the workshop. The most significant conclusion is that policy interventions which help strengthen institutional capacity in coastal artisanal communities would have the greatest over all impact. A move toward collecting gender and fisheries disaggregated data would also help expand existing knowledge about what are often marginal and isolated economic sectors. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Unpredictable environmental fluctuations are a major problem in fisheries. To mitigate these uncertainties, reserves are advocated to help ensure population persistence, reduce population and harvest variance, provide a 'hedge' against management failures and increase resilience. Using recent insights from the modelling of marine reserves, we propose a six-step process for establishing and adaptively managing reserves for fishery purposes. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The in situ observations of solidification and melting of an aluminum-silicon alloy (Al-12.6%Si) using an ultrasonic waveguide sensor are presented. The ultrasonic sensor consists of a conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer, a cooling system and a titanium (Ti) rod as an ultrasonic waveguide. The sustainability of the Ti rod in the molten Al alloy is investigated by immersion tests for 1, 4, 8 and 16 h at 800 degrees C. The formation of a layer consisting of globular TiAl3, disperse AlSi2Ti and alpha-Al phases has been observed at the interface between the Ti and the At alloy. Ultrasonic pulse-echo measurements of the Al alloy during solidification and melting have been performed using the ultrasonic sensor in temperature range from 200 to 800 degrees C. The longitudinal wave velocity of the Al alloy shows a rapid and significant change from about 3900 to 5600 m/s around the eutectic point. An attempt to measure a solid/liquid interface of the Al alloy has been made at frequency of 2.25 MHz. The reflected echo from the interface undergoing directional solidification has been observed. The position and growth rate of the interface have also been determined from the reflected echo.

AB Characterising the function of genes is a major challenge in the post-genomic era. Post-genomic tools and technologies have dramatically changed the experimental approaches by which complex biological systems can be characterised.
   Proteomics is an important cornerstone in functional genome characterisation, and like all other functional genomics tools, including transcriptomics and metabolomics, the aim of proteome studies is to translate genome information into useful biological insight, that will allow scientists to build and test better hypotheses, with the ultimate goal to find better solutions to challenges in food production, medicine and environmental management.
   In agricultural sciences as well as in all other life sciences, the implementation of proteomics and the other post-genomic tools is an important step towards achieving better product quality and a more sustainable animal production.
   The aim of this review is to introduce the developing field of proteomics, and to discuss the use of proteomics in meat science projects. The most frequently used technologies for characterising cellular protein expression patterns will be introduced, and some early examples of applying proteomics to meat quality research will be discussed.

AB Despite public promises to the contrary, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia continue to be ruled autocratically even as their civil societies aspire to greater public space. Rather than promoting concrete steps towards democratization including institutionalizing freedom of speech, association, and pluralistic political practices, the three states of the Maghrib are pursuing survivalist strategies leading to a robust authoritarianism that seems unlikely to be overturned anytime soon. Yet failure to transform authoritarian politics dramatically and decisively into a sustainable democracy will not only hamper long-term socioeconomic development but, more ominously, foster an environment within which radical forces will emerge to threaten domestic as well as regional and global stability. Current American efforts to promote democratic reform in the region must evolve more imaginatively if they are to meet the challenge of global terrorism that itself is so deeply embedded within the authoritarian impulse that can only be overcome through the democratic imperative.

ID ALPHA-PARVALBUMIN; CLONED RABBIT; RAT; LOCALIZATION; SEQUENCE; PROTEIN;

AB By using an analysis of existing genomic information it is concluded that in zebrafish nine genes encode parvalbumin (PV). These genes possess introns that differ in size and show nucleotide variability but they contain the same number of exons, and for each corresponding exon, the number of nucleotides therein are identical in all the paralogs. This rule also applies to the multiple PV genes of other species e.g. mammals. Each of these genes displays, however, characteristic 5' and 3' UTRs which appear highly conserved between closely related species (so that orthologs among these species can be readily identified) but which show larger numbers of mutations between species that are more distant in evolution. A tree is presented which suggests that the traditional classification of PVs as alpha or beta (based mainly on charge of the protein molecule) is not sustainable. Numbers 1-9 are assigned to the various isoforms to facilitate their identification in future studies. A bifurcation of isoforms into 1 and 4; 2 and 3; 6 and 7; 8 and 9 appears to have occurred simultaneously in more recent time, i.e. perhaps approximately 60 mys ago when primates and rodents branched.

AB We model an empirically estimated fiscal policy reaction function (FPRF) in a macroeconomic growth model. In general, an FPRF uses information about the path of past and expected future macroeconomic events and fiscal policy to forecast future fiscal policy reactions. We show that an empirically estimated FPRF, consistent with past legislative activity, can return unsustainable fiscal forecasts to sustainability. However, we also demonstrate that modeling other variants of an FPRF, equally consistent with the literature, do not return fiscal forecasts to sustainability. We conclude that additional empirical work is necessary before implementation of an FPRF in macroeconomic models could decisively improve modeling results or their presentation.

AB We evaluate the long-run sustainability of health spending growth. Under the criterion that non-health consumption does not fall, 1 percent excess cost growth appears to be an upper bound for the economy as a whole when the projection horizon extends over the century, although some groups would experience declines in non-health consumption. More generally, the increase in health spending as a share of income may lead to a significant expansion of public sector financing, as has been the case historically. Extrapolation of historical trends also suggests that higher health spending will lead to insurance contracts with lower out-of-pocket payment shares, putting further upward pressure on health care expenditures.

AB This paper explains four methods of "price indexing" initial Social Security retirement benefits, and discusses the effect of each method on the fiscal sustainability of Social Security, benefit levels and replacement rates, redistribution, and sensitivity of system finances to demographic and economic shocks. Of these methods, Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) Factor Indexing would generate the largest cost savings while reducing benefit growth at approximately an equal rate for all income levels. Methods that index the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME), the formula "bend points," or both, would-reduce benefit growth at a slower rate and would have different effects on benefit distribution and system sustainability.

AB Under current projections, payroll tax revenues and accumulated interest in the Social Security trust fund will be insufficient to pay scheduled benefits when workers entering the labor force today reach retirement age. Given this outlook, three policy options for slowing future benefit growth are considered. Each achieves sustainable solvency according to the Flat Fund Ratio criterion. Winners and losers across birth cohorts and income groups are identified under reforms including immediate and permanent benefit cuts, linking benefits to life expectancy and limiting initial benefit growth to price rather than wage inflation. Reforms are considered with and without a minimum benefit.

AB Blooms of toxigenic organisms have increased in spatial and temporal extent due to human activities and natural forces that alter ecologic habitats and pollute the environment. In aquatic environments, harmful algal blooms pose a risk for human health, the viability of organisms, and the sustainability of ecosystems. The estuarine dinoflagellate, Pfiesteria piscicida, was discovered in the late 1980s at North Carolina State University as a contaminant in fish cultures. R piscicida was associated with fish death in laboratory aquaria, and illness among laboratory workers who inhaled the mist above aquaria. Both the fish and humans exhibited signs of toxicity. During the 1990s, large-scale mortality among fish and other aquatic organisms was associated with high concentrations of Pfiesteria sp. in estuaries on the eastern seaboard of North America from New York to Texas. Illness among humans was associated with direct exposure to estuaries and exposures to estuarine aerosols around the time of Pfiesteria-related fish kills. This review of the scientific literature on associations between Pfiesteria and human illness identified some of the possible mechanisms of action by which putative Pfiesteria toxins may have caused morbidity. Particular attention was given to the Pfiesteria-associated, human-illness syndrome known as Possible Estuary Associated Syndrome (PEAS). PEAS was characterized by multiple-system symptoms, deficits in neuropsychological tests of cognitive function, and rapid and severe decrements in visual contrast sensitivity (VCS), an indicator of neurologic function in the visual system. PEAS was diagnosed in acute and chronic illness cases, and was reacquired during re-exposure. Rapid normalization of PEAS signs and symptoms was achieved through the use of cholestyramine therapy. Cholestyramine, a non-absorbable polymer, has been used by humans to lower cholesterol levels since it was approved for that use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1958. When dissolved in water or juice and taken orally, cholestyramine binds with cholesterol, bile acids, and salts in the intestines, causing them to be eliminated rather than reabsorbed with bile during enterohepatic recirculation. Cholestyramine also has been reported to bind and eliminate a variety of toxic substances. The efficacy of cholestyramine therapy in treatment of PEAS supported the hypothesis that PEAS is a biotoxin-associated illness. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Engineering applications are the natural milestones where new technologies have to proof their Potential and their perspectives. For active control of sound and vibration, this applicative justification was given in terms of specialised solutions for specific applications rather than as solution for widespread applications of large production number. This is in contrast to multiple expectations and promises and reflects the persistent disadvantage of unviable implementation efforts. Thus, besides ongoing research progress, further and sustainable development and implementation work of some specialised engineering groups has helped to keep this hardly youthful approach attractive and promising. The paper reflects the applicative state of the art of active sound and vibration control and gives further evidence by three case studies for fully developed and practically applied engineering solutions. These case studies refer to the suppression of two self-excited sound field oscillations, wind-tunnel buffeting and combustion instabilities, and to active sound design, a way of extending the focus of sound field control to arbitrary target sounds in order to provide a flexible tool for in situ sound tests in the original environmental context. From such applications it can be expected that further improvements for all components involved including sensors and actuators will help to extend the applicative basis of active sound and vibration control.

TI Fuel design and core layout for a gas-cooled fast reactor
SO NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE gas-cooled fast reactor; sustainable nuclear power system; integral fuel
   cycle
AB The gas-cooled fast reactor (GCFR) is regarded as the primary candidate for a future sustainable nuclear power system. In this paper a general core layout is presented for a 2400-MW(thermal) GCFR. Two fuel elements are discussed: a TRISO-based coated particle and the innovative hollow sphere concept. Sustainability calls for recycling of all minor actinides (MAs) in the core and a breeding gain close to unity. A fuel cycle is designed allowing operation over a long period, requiring refueling with U-238 only. The evolution of nuclides in the GCFR core is calculated using the SCALE system (one-dimensional and three-dimensional). Calculations were done over multiple irradiation cycles including reprocessing. The result is that it is possible to design a fuel and GCFR core with a breeding gain around unity, with recycling of all MAs from cycle to cycle. The burnup reactivity swing is small, improving safety. After several fuel batches an equilibrium core is reached. MA loading in the core remains limited, and the fuel temperature coefficient is always negative.

TI Implementation of the Child Care and Development Block Grant: A research
   synthesis
SO NURSING OUTLOOK
LA English
DT Article
AB The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) is the largest source of state and federal child care assistance. Between 1996-2004, the number of reports on state implementation of the CCDBG soared. Using the matrix method, this article synthesizes 39 reports from public and private entities on how states differed in the use of CCDBG funds. We found considerable variation among states with regard to populations served, financing of child care through CCDBG and TANF (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families), administration of the CCDBG, and use of its quality set-asides. This issue is of prime importance to nurses who work with low-income families with children, especially because quality, accessibility and affordability of child care affects a child's emotional, social, cognitive, and physical development. The CCDBG reauthorization and annual appropriations are currently on the congressional agenda and warrant nurse's input for ongoing sustainability and support. Recommendations for policy and future research are included.

AB The overfishing of an increasing number of fish populations has put focus on the need for development of robust sustainable harvest strategies that can be easily implemented. This requires estimates and modelling of the deterministic and stochastic components of the population dynamics as well as an evaluation of the contribution of different harvest strategies to future population fluctuations. Here we present an example of such an approach, using the collapse of Norwegian spring-spawning herring stock as a case. We demonstrate that the collapse probably was due to overfishing, and that the large influence of the environmental stochasticity could only influence the timing of the collapse. We suggest that a proportional threshold strategy with a threshold around 14 billion individuals (4 200 000 tons), combined with a harvest of 30-40% of the individuals above this threshold will give a sustainable yield with little annual variation. The choice of harvest strategy should also be strongly influenced by the uncertainty in the assessment of stock size. When the population stock is estimated with uncertainty, the proportional threshold strategy give a mean annual yield close to the optimum for known population size.

AB Two commonly held views about the nature of Nature lead to a systematic misunderstanding and mismeasurment of natural processes. The "economistic " view conceives of the natural environment as a repository of resources, available for human exploitation, and "services " provided by mechanistic ecological processes. The economistic perspective leads to a failare to properly recognize the sharp distinctions between ecological and economic processes, by positing that environmental-sustainability issues can be successfully addressed by "economizing ecology and ecologizing the economy." The deep ecology view conceives of nature in an idealized manner as a harmonious system in eternal balance unless disturbed by humans. This perspective fails to appreciate the material basis of nature and society and views changes in value systems as the key to achieving ecological sustainability. The authors advocate an alternative conception-one developed by Marxist scholars in the natural sciences that eschews both mechanistic and idealized conceptions of nature in favor of a dialectical, historical, and materialist view of natural processes. This approach allows us to better understand natural history and the dynamic processes of human interaction with the environment.

AB The North China Plain (NCP) is the food bowl of the country. To feed the growing population, farmers in the area have been using the land very intensively with high inputs to increase food production. The sustainability of such farming practices has attracted the attention of scholars, planners and decision makers. This study analyses the economic and environmental sustainability of the major cropping systems in the NCP, based on selected site-specific indicators. The information necessary for this study was obtained in 2001 through a survey of 270 farm households from four villages in Ningjin county, soil sample analysis, chemical tests for nitrate concentration in groundwater and crop plants,field observations and discussions with key informants, as well as official reports and publications. The findings of the analysis revealed that all cropping systems in the study area were economically sustainable. However, such achievements have been made at a cost to the environment, degradation of natural resources and risk to human health. If these costs are taken into consideration, all cropping systems in the study area cannot be considered sustainable. The study stresses that farming practices that are economically sustainable should not be promoted at the cost of degrading production resources. There is a need for a policy shift from the promotion of agricultural production to sustainable agricultural production. Several policy measures have been outlined for the promotion of sustainable cropping systems in the NCP.

AB Bangladesh is essentially self-sufficient in rice as a result of the successful adoption of new high-yielding varieties and irrigated summer production over traditional deep-water cultivation practices. The sustainability of the cropping system depends on farmers adopting integrated pest management (IPM) practices in preference to relying solely on insecticides for pest and disease control. Yet insecticide consumption in rice is increasing, in common with other crop-production systems in Bangladesh. It is probably only the poor economic returns from rice cultivation that prevent more widespread use of pesticides. Enlightened agrochemical companies such as Syngenta Bangladesh Limited have recognized that insecticide use in rice should be discouraged, and promote IPM options through their farmer field school (FFS) programme. This paper describes the results of a collaborative project to assist Syngenta to develop and incorporate mass trapping with sex pheromones into their FFS programme as an environmentally benign method of controlling the predominant insect pests of rice, stem borers.

AB Soil was amended with maize mucilage, a major rhizodeposit, to study its role on the number of culturable soil micro-organisms, the structure of the bacterial community, atrazine mineralization and atzC abundance. The maximal percentage of atrazine mineralization was lower for mucilage-amended than for water-amended soil. Total culturable soil bacteria and 16S rDNA copy number, measured by RT-PCR, presented similar values and were not significantly (P < 0.05) different among treatments. Mucilage applied at a rate of 70 mu g C g(-1) dry soil day(-1) over two weeks did not modify the abundance of the total soil microflora. Global structure of soil bacterial communities revealed by RISA analysis was not modified by maize mucilage amendment. Abundance of atzC sequence was only augmented by mucilage addition at the beginning of the experiment. However, this increase was not sustainable in time, as atzC copy number increased in water-amended soil which, in turn, corresponded with the higher percentage of atrazine mineralization observed in this soil. Maize mucilage amendment alone contributed only to minor changes in the atrazine-degrading community in the studied soil. (c) 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB In a comparative study of energy use in three farm systems, organic farming was found to be the most energy efficient because it utilized the least amount of energy. One (1) ton of unmilled rice used only 277 Mcal in organic farming, 501 Mcal in low external input sustainable agriculture (LEISA) and 837 Mcal in conventional farming. The total energy input in the organic rice farms was only 37% (1,045 Mcal ha(-1)) of the total energy input in the conventional farms (2,848 Mcal. ha-1). Total energy input in LEISA was moderate at 1,773 Mcal ha-1. The application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides explains the high energy inputs in conventional farming as they accounted for 80% of the fossil-fuel-based energy inputs (FFEI) and 70% of the total energy inputs (TEI). Energy efficiency (Ee) was 21.53 and 11.95 for FFEI and TEI, respectively, in organic farming while it was 8.91 (Ee (FFEI)) and 6.63 (Ee (TEI)), respectively, for LEISA. In the conventional farms, Ee (FFEI) was only 4.93 and Ee (TEI) was 3.45.
   Non-use of any agrochemical inputs in organic farming made it four times more energy efficient than conventional farming and twice more efficient than LEISA. Organic rice farming was not only energy efficient, it was also found to be equally or slightly more productive. Unmilled rice yield Was 3.81, 3.58, 3.25 ton ha(-1) in organic, LEISA and conventional farms, respectively.

SO PHOTONIRVACHAK-JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
LA English
DT Article
ID VEGETATION; DETECT
AB Human activities have great influence on fragile coastal ecosystem. For sustainable use of coastal resources it is very important to understand land use/land cover changes and its implications on coastal systems. Remote sensing data because of its synoptic, multispectral and multi temporal nature can be a very good source for mapping, monitoring and understanding these changes. IRS LISS III sensor data were used to find out the rate of land use/land cover changes in Hazira area near Surat, Gujarat. Because of major industrial activities it has become a hot spot area which requires regular monitoring. In the present study, land cover information of the period 1970-1972 from the Survey of India topographical maps, and satellite data of the year 1989 and 1999-2002 have been used and visual analysis has been carried out to measure the land use/land cover changes. Erosion and deposition has been observed around the newly constructed jetty. Forest area and agriculture area is found to decreased, whereas built-up area has increased.

AB This study evaluates whether the education, environmental expertise, and nationality of firms' chief executive officers (CEOs) are associated with greater participation and environmental performance in a voluntary environmental program implemented in a developing nation. Specifically, we collected data from the Certification for Sustainable Tourism (CST) program, a voluntary initiative aimed at promoting beyond-compliance environmental performance by hotels operating in Costa Rica. Our findings suggest that CEOs' level of formal education and environmental expertise appear to be significantly associated with higher corporate participation in voluntary programs and also with higher beyond-compliance environmental performance ratings. Contrary to conventional expectations, CEOs from industrialized countries (as opposed to developing countries) do not appear to show a statistically significant association with participation in the CST program and with higher beyond-compliance environmental performance.

AB The relationships between community coalition processes during initial 3-year state seed funding and markers of sustainability post-funding were investigated in 20 Communities That Care (CTC) sites in Pennsylvania. Coalition processes were assessed using interviews with coalition members, ratings from the research team and ratings from state technical consultants. We found members' knowledge of prevention, coalition internal functioning, and fidelity to the CTC model during early coalition functioning predictive of later sustained coalition board activity. Findings suggest domains of early coalition functioning that may be important for understanding and promoting sustainability.

ID GUIDELINES; PROGRAM; TRIAL
AB We present a qualitative case study where we used four principles of ecological theory from community psychology as a template to assess the dynamics about how a preventive community intervention was transacted in eight communities in Victoria, Australia. The principles were cycling of resources, interdependence, adaptation, and succession. Ecological thinking focuses on key resources in communities. That is, the people, events, and settings that are the foundations of thinking about communities as systems. The data set consists of field diaries kept by and serial interviews with nine community development workers over a 2-year period. We found that the analysis highlighted a process-oriented way of representing the intervention, one that sees beyond the intervention's technical components (or packaged elements) to the complexities of the cultural and political change processes occurring beneath. The value of this is the attention focussed on likely project sustainability.

DE developing countries; municipal & public service engineering; water
   supply
AB Inadequate water services to the urban poor remain a serious problem in developing countries. Where services do exist, the chosen engineering solution often proves unsustainable. Engineers relying heavily on technical expertise can fail to understand the contextual factors determining what poor people want and are willing to pay. Although the concept of appropriate technology options is common enough, technology alone cannot provide a sustainable service. Tariffs and management options must also be designed to meet the needs of the poor. PREPP (participation-ranking-experience-perception-partnership), is a consumer consultation process for use by engineers with the support of social scientists and community development workers. These professionals traditionally see service provision from diverse perspectives and in developing countries they rarely work as a team. Through PREPP, engineers are able to understand the problems of service provision in poor urban settings through the eyes of poor consumers and the professionals that more commonly work with them. Likewise, social sciences professionals are better able to understand engineering parameters. The result is a cost-effective and relatively rapid process that helps engineers to design relevant engineering solutions with more chance of sustainability. Experiences in Zambia, India, Kenya and Uganda are illustrated.

ID COGNITIVE THERAPY; PSYCHOTHERAPY
AB By the year 2020, according to WHO prognoses, depression will be the second most frequent illness at the national level. While there is increasing recognition that the treatment of depression is a problem of relevance to society as a whole, relapse rates following all forms of short-term therapy are alarmingly high. With reference to insights gained from the German Psychoanalytic Association's outcome study on long-term psychoanalytic treatment (and from other therapy studies), the author postulates that psychoanalysis and long-term psychoanalytic therapy are indicated as the treatment of choice for chronic, multi-morbid depression. She discusses this view with reference to a detailed case study and to various psychoanalytic concepts of depression. The results of interdisciplinary studies on memory serve to encourage her skepticism about cognitive-behavioral therapy, which today is frequently held up as a "scientifically substantiated" form of treatment for depressive patients. The author doubts whether this kind of therapy can lead to sustainable (i.e. structural) changes in patients with chronic depression.

TI Civic engagement and sustainable cities in the United States
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the last decade, at least 42 U.S. cities have elected to pursue sustainable cities programs to improve their livability. Some programs are broad, involving smart growth efforts, and others are narrowly targeted, including bicycle ridership and pesticide-reduction programs. A recurring theme in these cities is the role of public participation in shaping and implementing these programs. In cities where the sustainable cities idea first emerged in local grassroots organizations, such as Seattle, these programs owe their existence to public involvement. Other cities have taken a top-down approach, treating sustainability as a matter for experts rather than ordinary citizens. Civic engagement is manifest both in the development of the sustainability program and as an explicit goal of the sustainability program. This article examines the role of civic engagement in these programs and defines a research agenda by identifying hypotheses about the importance of public involvement in sustainable cities programs.

AB Objective: To show that current rates of global Population growth, production and consumption of food, and use of living and physical resources, are evidently not Sustainable. To consider ways in which nutrition and allied sciences can respond to this great challenge of the twenty-first century.
   Method: Past, current and future projected trends in production and consumption patterns are examined. These show that overall present and projected patterns cannot be sustained; and also show increasing unacceptable inequity between and within rich and poor regions and Countries.
   Discussion: Nutrition science classically focuses on nutrients in relation to human physiology, metabolism, growth, health and disease. The social and environmental conditions of the modern, interconnected, market-oriented world, and the consequences for food production and consumption, are extending the research and policy agenda with which nutrition science must now urgently engage. Historically, much attention has been paid to eliminating nutritional deficiency states, and this remains an important task. in modern urban populations 'malnutrition' encompasses new forms of dietary imbalance, especially excesses of certain nutrients. These contribute to various non-communicable diseases and, particularly, to overweight/obesity and its attendant metabolic derangements and disease risks. As a inass phenomenon the current surge in obesity has no historical precedent. The escalating impact of humankind on the natural environment, with its ramifications for present and future food production, is also unprecedented.
   Conclusion: The essential challenge for nutrition science is to develop new understanding and strategies to enable a balance between promoting, equitably, the health of humans while sustaining the long-term health of the biosphere. Extension of nutrition science and food policy to meet those goals will be aided by understanding better how dietary conditions shaped the biological evolution of humankind. The fundamental long-term task is to integrate human health with the health of the biosphere.

AB Objective: Agriculture designed to make best use of landscape and to be maximally Sustainable would also provide food of the highest nutritional and gastronomic standards, and would inevitably employ a great many people. Thus it would solve the world's food problems, and its principal social problem, at a stroke. But agriculture in practice is designed for a quite different purpose - to generate wealth, in the cause of,economic growth'. The pressing need is not for more science and technology, but to recognise the true cause of the problems and to re-think priorities.
   Conclusion: We could all be well fed. Indeed, everyone in the world who is ever likely to be born could be fed to the highest standards of gastronomy as well as of nutrition until humanity itself comes to an end. We already have most of the necessary technique - perhaps all that is needed. We could always do with more excellent science but we need not depend, as we are often told from on high, on the next technological fix. The methods that can provide excellent food would also create a beautiful environment, with plenty of scope for other creatures, and agreeable and stable agrarian economies with satisfying jobs for all. In reality, in absolute contrast, we have created a world in which almost a billion are chronically undernourished; another billion are horribly overnourished, so that obesity and diabetes are epidemic, and rising;, a billion live on less than two dollars a day; and a billion live in urban slums - a figure set to increase and probably at least to double over the next half century; while other species are disappearing so fast that biologists speak of mass extinction.

AB Objective: To explain how the philosophy of nutrition is part of the philosophy of health. To show that this link allows practical solutions for equity and sustainability.
   Method: An analysis of the historical philosophies concerned with nutrition and health. A comparison of the definitions in the history of mind from antiquity to the beginning of the twenty-first century.
   Conclusion: We are not individually healthy, but we are so in togetherness, even with animals and plants. Comprehensive nutrition science has physical, social and environmental attributes. It follows that nutrition is good for the enhancement of good company with human beings as well as with the connatural world. We recognise that we owe to others what we are and this constitutes the equity of being.

ID DETERMINANTS
AB Objective: To promote the new field of 'public nutrition' as a means to address, in a more efficient, sustainable and ethical manner, the world-wide epidemic of malnutrition - undernutrition and specific nutrient deficiencies, and also obesity and other nutrition-related chronic diseases.
   Strategy: Grounded in the health promotion model, public nutrition applies the population health strategy to the resolution of nutrition problems. it encompasses 'public health nutrition', 'community nutrition' and 'international nutrition' and extends beyond them. it fits within the conceptual framework of 'the new nutrition science' and is an expression of this reformulated science in practice. its fundamental goal is to fulfil the human right to adequate food and nutrition. It is in the interest of the public, it involves the participation of the public and it calls for partnerships with other relevant sectors beyond health. Public nutrition takes a broader view of nutritional health, addressing the three interrelated determinant categories of food systems and food security; food and health practices; and health systems. it assesses and analyses how these influence the immediate determinants that are dietary intake and health status so as to direct action towards effective progress. To further enhance the relevance and effectiveness of action, public nutrition advocates improved linkages between policies and programmes, research and training. A renewed breed of professionals for dietetics and nutrition, trained along those lines, is suggested.
   Conclusion: There is a critical need to develop new knowledge, approaches and skills to meet the pressing nutrition challenges of our times.

AB Objective: To emphasise the importance of defining a new nutrition science and food policy that includes social and environmental dimensions.
   Design: Nutrition science and food policy is put in the context of sustainable development. Examples are presented to show that a number of factors including exploitation of resources, disrespect for land and food insecurity contribute to the decline of a culture. The fate of cultures that lack implemented sustainable development strategies is discussed.
   Conclusion: Pressure from low-income and economically challenged countries combined with the efforts of not-for-profit private institutions is proposed. The goal is to produce and provide science-based evidence and guidelines to be used as a tool to encourage institutions and organisations to redefine their policies to deal effectively with global issues.

AB Objective: To describe an integrated, holistic conceptual framework and research paradigm for a better understanding of the nutrition transition in middle- and low-income countries.
   Motivation: Current inability effectively to prevent the increasing burden related to changes in food consumption patterns and other health behaviours of populations in transition motivates a new approach for nutrition research and practice. In this proposed approach, broader and integrated dimensions of science and practice may be applied for a better understanding of this complex phenomenon.
   Result: Examples from our own studies are given and quoted to illustrate how results from transdisciplinary studies were used to design an integrated, holistic programme to improve quality of life of people infected with HIV.
   Conclusion: Based on these experiences it is argued that the more holistic and integrated approach should and could lead to more effective and sustainable interventions to prevent the adverse health consequences of the nutrition transition. At the same time such an approach will contribute to efforts to conserve the environment and also human, living and natural resources.

AB Objective: To show that nutrition science is anchored in food systems and is influenced by the social, through the environmental to the cosmological, life's connections and rhythms. To indicate that an integrative approach is now becoming possible with advances in food technology, in the understanding of food choice and of human behaviour, and in a preparedness to recognise nutritional inputs in the full sweep of life-long well-being and health outcomes.
   Method: An analysis of the much broader understanding of nutritionally related diseases from an ecological perspective, with attention to economic development, beginning with poverty alleviation. Recognition that the biological dimension of nutrition science is undergoing a profound reappraisal; that technologies wilt allow us to change the course of nutritionally related diseases for the better; and that nutrition science will find partners in information technology and telecommunications, food technology and energy technology.
   Conclusion: A new generation of nutrition scientists can help build a new economy that Supports development amongst communities, whether close or distant from each other. The opportunities for this kind of development to be realised between Asia, Latin America and Africa are considerable. At all times, however, nutrition scientists must uphold the paramount importance of good governance, conflict resolution and maternal literacy if their work is to achieve its growing potential.

AB Oxybromination reaction of styrene was performed in a two-phase system of water/ionic liquids (ILs). The aim of the work was to make the mild and efficient two-phase system previously developed for the vanadium(V)-catalyzed oxybromination of alkenes, inspired by the activity of haloperoxidase enzymes, even more interesting from a sustainable point of view. As in that case, a brominating intermediate was formed from the metal catalyst, H2O2, and bromide ion in the acid aqueous phase, but chlorinated solvents were replaced with ILs.
   [bmim(+)][PF6-], [bm(2)im(+)][PF6-], [bmim(+)][BF4-] [bmim(+)][CF3SO3-], and [bmim(+)][(CF3SO2)(2)N-] were tested. We report on interesting results in terms of reaction rates and selectivities.

AB Interseeding alfalfa into rangelands has been assessed for decades as a method of range improvement to increase forage production and forage quality for livestock. Research was initiated in 2001 to examine the long term effects of interseeding yellow-flowered alfalfa (Medicago sativa ssp. falcata) on northern mixed-grass rangelands. Forage production and forage quality parameters were assessed on sites interseeded in 1965, 1987, and 1998 and compared to adjacent native rangelands. Live aboveground biomass for the 1965, 1987, and 1998 interseeded sites was 68, 143, and 42% higher, respectively, compared to their native control areas. Alfalfa aboveground biomass accounted for 1489 of the 2 969 kg center dot ha(-1) live biomass harvested from the 1965 interseeded site, 1940 of the 2 744 kg center dot ha(-1) on the 1987 interseeded site, and 796 of the 2 322 kg center dot ha(-1) on the 1998 interseeded site. Increased soil N resulting from N fixation by the alfalfa significantly increased the crude protein (CP) content of several native species, whereas the alfalfa itself provided forage with 16 to 18% CP Alfalfa had higher protein degradability and provided higher concentrations of calcium (Ca), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg) than the native rangeland grasses. This research has shown that the practice of interseeding yellow-flowering alfalfa into rangelands is sustainable over decades and will increase forage production and improve nutritive value of forage in the northern Great Plains.

AB Even in developing countries that are faced with ecological and socio-economic problems, agricultural areas are constrained by land-use laws to be developed in particular ways. This being the case, the major issues in these areas are a better quality of life and sustainable use of the limited resources. This necessitates planning for sustainable development and evaluating various qualitative and quantitative data in a single framework. Multicriteria or multipurpose decision analysis methods are appropriate for this purpose. Using these methods, physical, economical and social data, as well as planning goals, can be combined and evaluated in the context of sustainable development. These multicriteria methods have been documented widely in a variety of problem areas, but two multicriteria methods, namely AHP (analytic hierarchy process) and ELECTRE 11 (elimination and choice translating reality), have not been used extensively in agricultural land-use decisions in developing countries. However, in situations where decision-making criteria are non-commensurable, non-comparable or non-countable, and when it is necessary to evaluate the criteria together, as in agricultural land-use decisions, AHP and ELECTRE 11 methods are warranted. This study reviews these methods briefly and suggests their potential application in the agricultural land-use decision process in a developing country. For this purpose, these methods were sampled in Ziyaret Stream Basin in Adiyaman, which is part of the Goneydogu Anadolu Projesi (GAP) (South-eastern Anatolian Project) in the Republic of Turkey. The area could be characterized by its rural and agricultural features, although it is under the pressure of Adiyaman urban development. This study shows that both AHP and ELECTRE II methods can be applied successfully for the determination of agricultural land-use priorities, which are an essential part of the quality of life and of sustainable land-use studies.

TI Proposal for a more efficient subsidy system for organic farming:
   Potential use of the tax system within the European Union
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS

DE subsidy; windfall profits; performance principle; taxes on profits;
   offsetting of profits between time periods
AB Agricultural enterprises that are run on ecological principles receive, in some countries, higher levels of financial support from the European Union (EU) than other agricultural businesses. The aim is to provide an incentive for businesses to adopt organic farming systems, a change desired by both politicians and society. However, with a fixed system of support payments based on land area, increasing the proportion of farms being run organically leads directly to higher costs of subsidies for the EU and the individual countries. This becomes especially true if enterprises with large land areas, high turnover and high income are converted to organic farming methods. Because financial resources within the member states are in very short supply, a modification of the current system of subsidies would seem to be necessary in the near future. The aim of any new system should be to reduce profit windfalls without making a drastic reduction in the incentive effect of the current system. At the same time, businesses that can run along these lines on a sustainable basis should be especially supported. This requires an increased level of individual assessment of the potential of the subsidized enterprises in relation to their cost-performance ratio for organic agricultural production. In this connection, a partial change to profit-based tax systems can be used as an effective instrument for co-financing. The method used to calculate profits for tax purposes, which varies from state to state, can be used to assess the performance and success of the organic farmer. Tax-free allowances or reductions in tax rates could be used to provide a selective subsidy method. The ability to relate subsidies to performance, thereby reducing windfall profits, is not the only advantage of using the tax system for this purpose. Another advantage is the low transaction costs. Using the example of the offsetting of profits between time periods, it will be shown here that the tax system can be used as an additional instrument for subsidization. The existing methods of subsidy can only be supported in this way, not completely substituted.

These are largely rural, largely uneducated-but not stupid-individuals whom we do not understand and on whom corporations have never seriously tried to focus. The assumption has always been that this is a market-for governments or the not-for-profit sector to worry about, sort of like an international division of labor. However, this base of the pyramid is where the biggest business opportunities lie. As technologists, it is the early market that we should be looking at.

AB Sustainable growth-the creation of shareholder and societal values while reducing environmental impacts along entire value chains-is not a choice but a requirement for successful businesses in the 21st century and for a sustainable future for all of us. Innovation and technology are critical ingredients to moving business increasingly away from the use of fossil fuels, to creating more consumer value in products using less depletable raw materials and energy, and to reaching the huge and growing populations at the middle and base of the economic pyramid. The transformation of DuPont from a volume-driven chemicals company to a value-driven science company over the past decade illustrates the types of transformation that will be needed across all of industry. R&D management must take ownership and provide leadership for the orders-of- magnitude changes that are needed, yet most have not been engaged in the sustainability discussion-sofar.

AB Sustainable development has three broad goals: environmental stewardship, social responsibility and economic prosperity, for both the organization and its stakeholders. In a successful sustainability-focused business strategy, these three goals will be inter-related and supportive of each other. Developing such a strategy requires careful study and analysis to fully understand sustainability-related opportunities and threats. Battelle's consulting work with the cement industry the State of Arizona and others, shows how innovation is a focused business strategy. key element of sustainability. Furthermore such business strategies must be customized to meet an organization's core competencies, financial situation, skills, resources, and the sustainability challenges it faces.

ID PERFORMANCE; COLLECTION; ENGLAND
AB As municipal waste continues to increase, English waste managers face decisions regarding the adoption of effective and sustainable waste strategies. Kerbside recycling is one essential component, for which evaluations of existing systems can provide useful guidance as to which type of scheme should be implemented. This study evaluates the performance of a co-mingled recycling service operating in an outer London Borough, considering the barriers to progress and opportunities for enhancement. Problems were found to relate to contamination, the supply of clear bags for recyclate, residual waste and misperception about the service. For the co-mingled system to improve it is suggested that promotion and education campaigns should aim specifically to reduce contamination, deliver a waste minimisation message, and dispel householders' beliefs that disposal to landfill is the fate of all co-mingled materials. A comparison between separate collection of clear bags and the current system would also enable a more robust evaluation of effectiveness. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Minimisation of municipal solid waste and diversion from landfill are necessary for the UK to manage waste sustainably and achieve legislative compliance. A survey of householder attitudes and experiences of a trial for minimising household food waste from waste collection in the county of West Sussex, UK is described. The minimisation method used the Green Cone food digester, designed for garden installation. A postal questionnaire was distributed to 1000 householders who had bought a cone during the trial and a total of 433 responses were received. The main reason for people buying the Green Cone had been concerns about waste (88%), with 78% and 67% of respondents, respectively, claiming to have participated in recycling and home composting in the last 30 days. The waste material most frequently put in the digester was cooked food (91%), followed by fruit waste, vegetable matter and bones/meat. Some respondents were using it for garden and animal waste from pets. Most users found the Green Cone performed satisfactorily. Approximately, 60% of respondents had seen a reduction of 25-50% in the amount of waste they normally put out for collection, with analysis showing reported levels of reduction to be significant (p < 0.05). Additional weight surveys by householders recorded an average of 2.7 kg/(h week) diverted to the food digester. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Coastal protection remains a global priority. Protection and maintenance of shoreline integrity is often a goal of many coastal protection programs. Typically, shorelines are protected by armoring them with hard, non-native, and nonsustainable materials such as limestone. This study investigated the potential shoreline protection role of created, three-dimensional Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) shell reefs fringing eroding marsh shorelines in Louisiana. Experimental reefs (25 X 1.0 X 0.7 m; intertidal) were created in June 2002 at both high and low wave energy shorelines. Six 25-m study sites (three cultched and three control noncultched) were established at each shoreline in June 2002, for a total of 12 sites. Shoreline retreat was reduced in cultched low-energy shorelines as compared to the control low-energy shorelines (analysis of variance; p < 0.001) but was not significantly different between cultched and noncultched sites in high-energy environments. Spat set increased from 0.5 +/- 0.1 spat/shell in July 2002 to a peak of 9.5 +/- 0.4 spat/shell in October 2002. On average, oyster spat grew at a rate of 0.05 mm/day through the duration of the study. Recruitment and growth rates of oyster spat suggested potential reef sustainability over time. Small fringing reefs may be a useful tool in protecting shorelines in low-energy environments. However, their usefulness may be limited in high-energy environments.

AB In Europe the need for high-quality freshwater has been increasing by a factor of ten since the beginning of the 20(th) century. Due to their geographic position and topographic feature the Alps are a major freshwater collector and hydrological storage system. Thus the Alps provide considerable amounts of various water resources feeding fundamental needs for human and natural life in the alpine region, but evenly in adjacent areas, The reliable availability and high quality of alpine freshwater resources are of growing concern to the European Community.
   Some of these concerns to be mentioned are the production of electricity by hydropower plants, an ever increasing demand of drinking, irrigation and industrial water as well as the use for providing tourist infrastructures, in particular for generating artificial snow. All these activities impose an enormous strain for the irritable ecological systems of the Alps. Thus, water is often regarded as a commodity for agricultural and industrial production or for trade. Social, ecological and vital implications in the different alpine eco-spheres are not considered. Therefore new strategies for a sustainable management of water resources are required in the Alps.
   Additionally a relocation of management and control of access and use of the alpine water resources into external alpine areas has taken place within the last years. The use of hydropower and privatization and liberalization of the European water sector are some examples among others. This leads to a decreasing self-determination of the alpine area, i.e. of its political entities.
   Prerequisites for a responsible utilization of alpine water resources comprise the direct participation of stakeholders as decision takers. Environmentally benign and innovative water management and water marketing solutions offering adequate economic perspectives have to be developed. These solutions may serve as model for water management systems not only in the Alps but also in regions where access to freshwater is not guaranteed and therefore vital.

AB Fine-grained sediment is a natural and essential component of river systems and plays a major role in the hydrological, geomorphological and ecological functioning of rivers. In many areas of the world, the level of anthropogenic activity is such that fine-grained sediment fluxes have been, or are being, modified at a magnitude and rate that cause profound, and sometimes irreversible, changes in the way that river systems function. This paper examines how anthropogenic activity has caused significant changes in the quantity and quality of fine-grained sediment within river systems, using examples of: land use change in New Zealand; the effects of reservoir construction and management in different countries; the interaction between sediment dynamics and fish habitats in British Columbia, Canada; and the management of contaminated sediment in USA rivers. The paper also evaluates present programmes and initiatives for the management of fine sediment in river systems and suggests changes that are needed if management strategies are to be effective and sustainable.

AB Traditional policies for managing river bank erosion are currently being reconsidered as a result of increased awareness regarding the unsustainable nature of some forms of bank protection, and the role played by bank erosion in providing ecosystem services and supporting geomorphological functions. River managers are therefore increasingly seeking to preserve bank erosion within a defined erodible corridor. This paper provides an over-view of the erodible corridor concept, focusing on the provision of guidelines for applying the concept in practice. We argue that a nested approach is required to address management objectives across a range of scales (network scale, reach scale, local scale) and review the different geomorphic tools that are available to help managers define the extent and inner sensitivity of the erodible corridor. These tools include simple rules of thumb such as evaluation of the equilibrium meander amplitude, historical approaches based on overlays of historical channel position, and simulation modelling. The advantages and limitations of each of these tools are discussed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB While over half of the cropland in the United States is rented, interest in land tenancy within sociological circles has been sporadic at best. In light of the prevalence of rented land in agriculture-particularly in the Midwest-it is vital that further research be conducted to investigate the effect that the rental relationship has upon the various aspects of rural life. This paper takes a step in this direction by examining the social dynamics among landlords, tenants, and agricultural agency professionals to better understand how those dynamics affect the adoption of sustainable agricultural methods oil rented land. This paper is theoretically informed by the writings of Pierre Bourdieu, particularly his theory of practice and his concepts of '' habitus '' and '' field.'' Toward this end, I argue that multiple (yet overlapping) social fields make up the social body of production agriculture, leading to contestation and field reconstruction. In developing this argument, a strategy for change is presented in accordance with the conceptual postulates of Bourdieu's theory of practice to promote a more widespread utilization of sustainable agricultural practices on rented land.

TI Addressing ethnic divisions in post-conflict institution-building:
   Lessons from recent cases
SO SECURITY DIALOGUE
LA English
DT Article
DE Nation-building; state-building; peacebuilding; political institutions;
   consociationalism; multiculturalism
AB Where the lines of an armed conflict coincide with ethnic boundaries, the political salience of ethnicity increases. In post-conflict situations that may seem defined by 'ancient hatreds', the political salience and character of ethnic identities remain dynamic. Bringing together contributions from the comparative politics literature on power-sharing and the policy-dominated field of post-conflict peacebuilding, this article examines how ethnic divisions have been addressed in recent cases of institution-building directed by international forces following military intervention - in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. It finds that an 'assumption of intransigence' has often influenced decisions on institutional design, and that the institutionalization of ethnicity has become an important hindrance to peacebuilding. Against this background, the article argues in favor of institutional designs that do not fixate the accentuation on ethnicity in politics: more flexible ways should be sought to assure inclusivity and representativeness for different ethnic groups. There exists a wide range of insfitutional-design options that can be combined, on the basis of in-depth assessments of each individual conflict, to de-ethnicize politics and build sustainable peace.

AB While emerging broadband access technologies such as DSL and cable are making multimedia services feasible and economically attractive for end-users, there still exist several hurdles in terms of service sustainability and reliability. Unfortunately, without the desired quality-of-service (QoS) support, tackling these hurdles with traditional solutions is an insuperably difficult task. Yet, novel designs that are proven to be useful in various scenarios may easily fail when the underlying network experiences severe packet loss or delay. Such circumstances are unavoidable in today's best-effort Internet and will likely prevail in the near future as well. A promising approach in satisfying the stringent requirements of delay-intolerant video applications is to benefit from configurable proxies. In this study, we introduce a versatile proxy-based solution to enhance the performance of such applications running over networks with large delays. We first propose a methodology that accurately identifies lost packets in real time. This methodology is then used by the proxy and end-users to improve the error-control/protection capability of the video applications. By Internet experiments between the US and Europe, we demonstrate the effectiveness and potential benefits of the proposed approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Congestion-distortion optimized video transmission over ad hoc networks
SO SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION

DT Article

   routing
AB The performance of low-latency video streaming with multipath routing over ad hoc networks is studied. As the available transmission rate of individual links in an ad hoc network is typically limited due to power and bandwidth constraints, a single node transmitting multimedia data may impact the overall network congestion and may therefore need to limit its rate while striving for the highest sustainable video quality. For this purpose, optimal routing algorithms which seek to minimize congestion by optimally distributing traffic over multiple paths are attractive. To predict the end-to-end rate-distortion tradeoff, we develop a model which captures both the impact of encoder quantization and of packet loss due to network congestion on the overall video quality. The validity of the model is confirmed by network simulations performed with different routing algorithms, latency requirements and encoding structures. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To promote sustainable forms of community-based resource management, advocates and analysts must examine not only how multiple participants act collectively, but how they respond to change and uncertainty in ways that foster learning and build capacity for management adaptation. In the community-based narwhal management context, a number of issues influence prospects for adaptation and learning. Among the issues examined, the integration of remote communities in Nunavut into the market economy and the subsequent demand for cash to purchase key commodities create new and diverse motivations (collective vs. individual), which increasingly influence natural resource management decisions. Also, the formalized nature of the flu community-based narwhal management framework, despite efforts to transfer more authority to communities, may still create barriers to local Inuit participation in decision making. Finally, resource mobility and complexity makes the clarification of resource rights difficult, thus inhibiting the collective action required to foster learning. This problem is compounded by the challenge of effectively integrating formal science and traditional knowledge to better understand resource complexity.

ID FERTILITY
AB Since upland rice under shifting cultivation is common, the mean paddy yield in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA), especially West Africa, has been stagnated at 1.3-1.7 t ha(-1) during the past 30 years of 1970-2000. There exist numerous small inland valley swamps (IVS), of which 10 million ha is capable of being turned into small scale irrigated rice fields, i.e., sawah* by simple and low cost ecological engineering technology with farmer's self-support efforts. The fertility of lowland soils in West Africa was the lowest, particularly available phosphorous status was extremely poor and low pH as well as low exchangeable bases among the three tropics of Asia, Africa and Latin America. However, because of multi-functional mechanisms of soil and water conservation and replenishment of nutrients, sustainable productivity of 1 ha of lowland sawah system can be equivalent more than 10 ha of upland fields. Geological fertilization, nitrogen fixation, neutralization of pH and increase phosphorous availability are the important functions of the sawah system. Sustainable development of sawah systems in IVSs can contribute to increase food production and to restore the degraded watersheds of SSA. *Sawah: The term sawah refers to leveled rice field surrounded by bund with inlet and outlet connecting irrigation and drainage. The term originates from Malayo-Indonesian. The English term, Paddy or Paddi, also originates from the Malayo-Indonesian term, Padi, which means rice plant. The term, Paddy, refers to rice grain with husk in West Africa of SSA. Most of the paddy fields in the Asian countries correspond to the definition of the term sawah. Paddy field is almost equivalent to sawah for Asian scientists. However, the term paddy fields refers to just a rice field including upland rice field in West Africa of SSA. Therefore in order to avoid confusion between the terms rice plant, paddy, and the improved man-made rice growth environment through ecological engineering, the authors propose to use the term sawah.

AB Sustainability of the local shifting cultivation practice in the mountainous region of Northern Laos was investigated. Due to low fertility of the soils derived from shale and its strongly weathered and acidic nature in the eastern side of the Nam Khan River watershed, shortening of the fallow period to produce enough amount of upland rice for the local population would not be sustainable any more. On the other hand, the eroded materials from limestone range were added to the soils in the western side of watershed which made the soil more fertile. Based on the calculated population capacity by Carneiro's equation, a system with 2- or 3-year fallow for 1-year cultivation can be the,maximum to afford the current population. To make the shifting cultivation system more sustainable, introduction of fallow system with a tree species, paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) could be a good option to be proposed.

AB A long-term experiment was conducted with the objective of selecting the appropriate land management treatments and to identify the key indicators of soil quality for dryland semi-arid tropical Alfisols. The experiment was conducted using a strip split-split plot design on an Alfisol (Typic Haplustalf) in southern India under sorghum (Sorghum vulgare (L))-castor (Ricinus communis (L)) bean rotation. The strip constituted two tillage treatments: conventional tillage (CT) and minimum tillage (MT); main plots were three residues treatments: sorghum stover (SS), gliricidia loppings (GL), 'no' residue (NR) and sub plots were four nitrogen levels: 0 (No), 30 (N-30), 60 (N-60), and 90 kg h(-1) (N-90). Soil samples were collected after the sixth and seventh year of experimentation and were analyzed for physical, chemical and biological parameters. Sustainable yield index (SYI) based on long-term yield data and soil quality index (SQI) using principal component analysis (PCA) and linear scoring functions were calculated. Application of gliricidia loppings proved superior to sorghum stover and no residue treatments in maintaining higher SQI values. Further, increasing N levels also helped in maintaining higher SQI. Among the 24 treatments, the SQI ranged from 0.90 to 1.27. The highest SQI was obtained in CTGLN(90) (1.27) followed by CTGLN(60) (1.19) and MTSSN90 (1.18), while the lowest was under MTNRN30 (0.90) followed by MTNRN0 (0.94), indicating relatively less aggradative effects. The application of 90 kg N ha(-1) under minimum tillage even without applying any residue (MTNRN90) proved quite effective in maintaining soil quality index as high as 1.10. The key indicators, which contributed considerably towards SQI, were available N, K, S, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and hydraulic conductivity (HC). On average, the order of relative contribution of these indicators towards SQI was: available N (32%), MBC (31%), available K (17%), HC (16%), and S (4%). Among the various treatments, CTGLN(90) not only had the highest SQI, but also the most promising from the viewpoint of sustainability, maintaining higher average yield levels under sorghum-castor rotation. From the view point of SYI, CT approach remained superior to MT. To maintain the yield as well as soil quality in Alfisols, primary tillage along with organic residue and nitrogen application are needed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The resource-based view of the firm (RBV) is one of the most important areas of research content to emerge in the field of strategic management in the last decade. The RBV posits that a firm's success is largely driven from resources that posses certain special characteristics. However, the RBV stream tends to be dominated by conceptual discussions. Although the empirical research body is growing rapidly, most studies concentrate on isolating only a few resources-namely intangible resources-within single industry contexts to examine resource effects on firm success. To more adequately test the main prescription of the RBV, new research approaches must be considered. This study explores one such approach. Defining the firm's resource pool to include intangible and tangible assets, a series of hypotheses are posited in order to examine the relative contribution levels of various resources on firm success. The model is tested on a sample of manufacturing and services firms operating in Australia. In the main, the results are supportive of the RBV's main prescription. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

DE alternative fuels; energy chains; ecological footprint; environmentally
   friendly cars; sustainable mobility
AB This article discusses the use of alternative fuels in the development of the environmentally friendly car and the promotion of sustainable mobility. Based on well-to-wheel analyses and ecological footprint assessments, this article confirms that the environmentally friendly car truly exists. There is substantial potential for reducing the ecological footprint within a decade by using both new and conventional technologies and alternative fuels. In the best-case scenario, a 75% reduction of the ecological footprint would be possible. However, promoting sustainable mobility requires more than just a strategy to develop the environmentally friendly car-it also requires a substitution strategy to encourage new means of transportation and a reduction strategy to reduce the growth of transport. Therefore, only a combination of these three strategies is compatible with long-term sustainability requirements. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID INSURANCE; CAMBODIA; DISTRICT; SYSTEMS
AB The study intended to analyse the financial flows in two provinces within the Rwandan health system through the review of all available documentation and through interviews with key informants, to assess the scope for improved resource allocation. In Rwanda, there exists a large deficit of available financial resources in the health sector in general, and more specifically at health centre level. To improve this situation, it is considered to cover a large proportion of the entire population by mutual health insurance schemes. The schemes are able to pool certain risks, and they definitely improve financial access to health services. Nonetheless, they are inaccessible to the 'very poor', and - due to their limited financial base - they are unable to cover a complementary health care package. It is unlikely that they will mobilize substantial additional resources for health. External long-term commitments are required to cover this gap. A reassurance and readjustment system between the various insurance schemes should be established in order to increase financial protection provided. It might link up with insurance schemes in the formal employment sector. The combination of such a support for health insurance with performance-related incentives for health staff has the potential to increase both equity and quality of health services simultaneously and substantially.

ID UNDERGROUND SPACE; ASBESTOS; HISTORY
AB Urban underground space is a finite and non-renewable resource. Sustainable use of valuable shallow subsurface space requires the wide use of utility tunnels. However, traditional trenching has been adopted in many projects arguing utilidors present atmosphere hazards related to any multipurpose confined space. Utility tunnel operational risks might seem discouraging at first, but urban planning for an underground sustainable future needs these efficient facilities. The aim of this work is to characterize utilidor indoor atmosphere hazards to show how these risks could be minimised, in order to guarantee a better standard of safety and health protection.

TI Cities and diversity - Should we want it? Can we plan for it?
SO URBAN AFFAIRS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE just city; urban planning; diversity; capacities
AB Diversity has become the new orthodoxy of city planning. The term has several meanings: a varied physical design, mixes of uses, an expanded public realm, and multiple social groupings exercising their "right to the city." Its impetus lies in the postinodernist/poststructuralist critique of modernism's master narratives and more specifically in reactions to the urban landscape created by segregation, urban renewal, massive housing projects, and highway building programs. Privileging diversity raises significant issues. Can planned environments produce diversity or only a "staged authenticity"? Does emphasizing diversity obscure the economic structure? Is there a connection between diversity and economic innovation? Does social diversity necessarily contribute to equity and a broadly satisfying public realm? Rather than setting diversity as the principal goal of city planning, I argue for the model of the just city, based on Nussbaum's concept of capacities and a recognition of the inevitable trade-offs among equity, diversity, growth, and sustainability.

AB Certification-and-monitoring programs for paratuberculosis are based on repetitive herd testing to establish a herd's health status. The available tests have poor sensitivity. Infected but undetected herds may remain among certified "paratuberculosis-free" herds. The objective was to determine if truly free herds acquire a certified status and keep it over time when infected but undetected herds remain. The Dutch program was used as a basis to construct a mechanistic deterministic model of the evolution over 25 years of the number of herds per health status. Three health states for herds were defined: not detected as infected in the certification process to obtain a free status; not detected as infected by any of the repetitive tests for monitoring the certified free status; detected as infected. Among undetected herds, two types were defined: truly free versus undetected but infected. Transitions between states were due to the purchase of an infected animal, infection via the environment, clearance via culling or sales, detection of an infected animal, and certification. A sensitivity analysis was carried out. We showed that - for a 100% specific test only - most of the truly free herds at the beginning of the program got a certified free status and kept it over time. Most infected herds were either detected as infected or cleared. The number of certified truly free herds increased with a decrease in the animal-level prevalence or in the risk of purchasing an infected cattle, for example by restricting purchases to cattle from herds at the highest level of certification.

AB A floating reed bed was installed on a lowland eutrophic reservoir, replacing ferrous chloride dosing as a method of phosphate reduction. Since the study was undertaken on an active water supply reservoir, this technique was further supported by the use of submerged barley straw applications on the downstream reservoir to limit algal growth. The study examined algal, chlorophyll a, phosphate and nitrate levels in both the source water and the treated through-flow to measure the effectiveness of phosphate reduction and algal control during the maturation phase of the bed. The results show that although not as effective as chemical dosing, total phosphate levels were reduced across the reservoir body and algal numbers were typically restricted to levels suitable for treatment at the receiving water treatment works. It is concluded that although the study did not coincide with ideal climatic conditions for prolific algal growth, the adopted techniques demonstrated significant potential as components of a holistic management approach for eutrophic waters.

AB Sustainable development and the Water Framework Directive demand stakeholder engagement and more specifically, public participation if they are to be successful. Indeed, signatories to the Aarhus Convention adopt a rights-based approach and guarantee rights of access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters. This paper explores the justification and need to involve the public in the decision-making process. It discusses the issues involved, the approach and technologies that can support and facilitate the participation process and the benefits that can flow from such involvement. It draws on practical experience gained from a long-term mapping and consultation project carried out for the Countryside Agency. Key points of interest and learning from the consultation process are discussed and recommendations are given for future public participation exercises.

AB Scale-up of a hollow-fiber-membrane (HFM) bioreactor treating trichloroethylene- (TCE-) contaminated water via co-metabolism with the methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b PP358 was investigated through cost comparisons, bioreactor experiments, and mathematical modeling. Cost comparisons, based on a hypothetical treatment scenario of 568-L/min (150-gpm) flowrate with an influent TCE concentration of 100 mu g/L, resulted in a configuration of treatment trains with two HFM modules in series and an overall annual cost of $0.36/m(3) treated. Biological experiments were conducted with short lumen and shell residence times, 0.16 and 0.40 min, respectively, as a result of the cost comparisons. A new variable, specific transformation, was defined for characterizing the co-metabolic transformation in continuous-flow systems, and values as large as 38.5 mu g TCE/mg total suspended solids were sustainable for TCE treatment. Using mathematical modeling, HFM bioreactor system design was investigated, resulting in a five-step system design strategy to facilitate sizing of the unit processes.

   Environmental Assessment; sustainable development; quality of life;

AB Because of water scarcity, careful planning of water resources in Egypt is a necessity. A number of tools (models, database, GIS, Decision Support Systems [DSS]) already exist in Egypt that provide invaluable support. Yet planning may be greatly improved by an integrated evaluation of water resources plan alternatives. To achieve this goal, a prototype DSS was developed, which is based on a conceptual model of Egypt Water Resources and associated Socio-economic and Environmental dynamic System (EWRSES). The model aims at capturing the complex network of relationships relevant to Egypt development linked with water resources and land-use. Being a dynamic system model, it allows researchers to investigate whether the desired end-of-horizon state can be actually reached or not and how the system will evolve. The model is designed to generate the relevant information for a broad Strategic Environmental Assessment, or, more properly, an Integrated Evaluation, by addressing: i) the physical-technical performance of the system; ii) the quality of life of target groups of people; iii) the strategic decision making problem. The EWRSES model is a complex model where assumptions play a key role; its proper use is to support and enhance the logical thinking that policy makers and decision makers inevitably apply during the planning exercise. The added value of the DSS implementing EWRSES is the systemic approach and the holistic view it provides together with the capability to jump from one level of analysis and evaluation to another by investigating the reasons underlying a given outcome under explicit assumptions. This paper presents the conceptual framework of the DSS and of the EWRSES model, and gives details about the evaluation methodology adopted.

AB The current practice of spray irrigation of dairy parlour wastewaters is laborious and time consuming. Intermittent sand filtration systems may offer an alternative to spray irrigation when designed to remove organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, coliforms and viruses from such wastewaters to allow discharge of the final effluent directly into receiving waters without damage to the environment. In this study two instrumented stratified sand filter columns (0.425 and 0.9m deep, and both 0.3m in diameter) were intermittently loaded for 439 days with synthetic dairy parlour washings at a number of hydraulic and organic loading rates. At a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) loading of 22 gm(-2) d(-1), over 92% of the BOD and suspended solids in the wastewater was removed in the two filters and nitrification was complete. The 0.9m column had a sustained ability to adsorb the influent phosphorus during the study period; however, the phosphorus adsorption capacity of the 0.425 in column began to decrease after approximately 30 days. Biomass, comprising hydrated extracellular polymers (exopolymers) and living and dead cells, accumulated in the 0.9 in column; it was assessed by sodium bromide tracer studies and by variations in the sand volumetric water contents using time domain reflectometry (TDR). The biomass growth increased the retention time of the wastewater in the filter media, and occurred mainly at the top of the first sand layer. Intermittent stratified sand filters appear to offer an effective and sustainable treatment process for the removal of BOD from high-strength wastewaters, and for the complete nitrification of ammonium.

   MODEL
AB 'Natural' treatment systems such as wetlands and reed beds have been proposed as sustainable means of reducing fluxes of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) to recreational and shellfish harvesting waters. This is because FIO fluxes to coastal waters from both point (effluent) and diffuse (catchment) sources can cause non-compliance with microbiological standards for bathing and shellfish harvesting waters. The Water Framework Directive requires competent authorities in the member states to manage both point and diffuse sources of FIOs in an integrated manner to achieve compliance with 'good' water quality as defined in a series of daughter Directives.
   This study was undertaken to investigate the relative sources of FIOs to the popular bathing waters around Clacton, UK. In this predominantly arable (mainly cereal cropping) farming area, the principal land use predictor, explaining 76% of the variance in geometric mean presumptive Escherichia coli concentration at sub-catchment outlets during the bathing season, was the proportion of built-up (i.e. urbanised) land in each sub-catchment. This new finding contrasts with earlier studies in livestock farming regions where the proportion of improved grassland has proven to be the strongest predictor of microbial concentration. Also novel in this investigation, a flood defence wall has been built creating a wetland area which discharges every tidal cycle. The wetland produces over 97% reduction in the flux and concentrations of FIOs to the marine recreational waters. Also, FIO concentrations in water draining through the wetland to the sea were similar to concentrations measured in six UK sewage treatment plant effluents subject to secondary (biological) treatment followed by UV disinfection.

AB Knowledge of the influence of environmental factors on weed populations is important in developing sustainable turfgrass management practices. Studies were conducted to evaluate the relationship of green and false-green kyllinga population densities with elevation and edaphic factors in turfgrass systems. Studies were conducted on five different golf courses in North Carolina, three affected by green kyllinga, and two affected by false-green kyllinga. According to Spearman correlation coefficients, both green and false-green kyllinga were correlated with increasing soil volumetric water content, whereas correlation of other edaphic variables varied among sites and species. Stepwise logistic regression confirmed the correlation of volumetric water with green kyllinga presence, but model components varied among sites for false-green kyllinga. Increasing green kyllinga populations correlated with increasing soil sodium; however, sodium did not reach a level believed to be detrimental to turfgrass growth. No other variables correlated with green or false-green kyllinga across all sites. We hypothesized that the lack of significant correlations was due to the overall influence of relative elevation on edaphic variables. According to principal components analysis (PCA), relative elevation had a profound impact on the measured edaphic variables at all sites. However, results of PCA at one site differed sharply from other sites. Results from that site demonstrate the potentially strong effects of management practices to alter edaphic trends normally observed with topography.

AB A study was conducted near Garden City, KS with irrigated corn to determine how the integration of a terminated winter wheat cover crop with various atrazine rates would affect Palmer amaranth control and corn water use efficiency (WUE). Without atrazine, the presence of a winter wheat cover crop, killed in the boot stage, resulted in a threefold weed biomass reduction in irrigated corn. The highest rate of atrazine completely masked the weed control effect of the cover crop, producing a greater than 15-fold reduction regardless of the presence or absence of the cover crop. A terminated winter wheat cover crop without atrazine elevated corn yield in only two of nine location-yr, and in one instance, depressed yield. However, a terminated wheat cover crop elevated corn yield in six of nine location-yr combinations when used in conjunction with 1.6 kg ha(-1) atrazine. Although increases in WUE associated with reductions in soil water evaporation produced by the cover crop seemed to be responsible for some of the increase in corn grain yield and stored soil water at the end of the summer growing season, end of season Palmer amaranth biomass had a more profound impact.

AB Grassland bird populations are sharply declining in North America. Changes in agricultural practices during the past 50 years have been suggested as one of the major causes of this decline. Field-border conservation practices encouraged by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Conservation Buffer Initiative meet many of the needs of sustainable agriculture and offer excellent opportunities to enhance local grassland bird populations within intensive agricultural production systems. Despite the abundant information on avian use of, and reproductive success in, strip habitats during the breeding season, few studies have examined the potential value of field borders for wintering birds. We planted 89.0 km of field borders (6.1 m wide) along agricultural field edges on one-half of each of three row crop and forage production farms in northeastern Mississippi. We sampled bird communities along these field edges during February-March 2002 and 2003 using line-transect distance sampling and strip transects to estimate density and community structure, respectively. We used Program DISTANCE to estimate densities of Song (Melospiza melodia), Savannah (Passerculus sandwichensis), and other sparrows along bordered and non-bordered transects while controlling for adjacent plant community. Greater densities of several sparrow species were observed along most bordered transects. However, effects of field borders differed by species and adjacent plant community types. Diversity, species richness, and relative conservation value (a weighted index derived by multiplying species-specific abundances by their respective Partners in Flight conservation priority scores) were similar between bordered and non-bordered edges. Field borders are practical conservation tools that can be used to accrue multiple environmental benefits and enhance wintering farmland bird populations. Provision of wintering habitat at southern latitudes may influence population trajectories of short-distance migrants of regional conservation concern.

AB This paper explores local empowerment, income generation opportunities, and environmental sustainability under varying scales of woodlot management in Ethiopia. We find that more devolved woodlot management empowers resource users, providing greater decision-making autonomy regarding harvesting and management. Our economic analysis indicates that there has been limited harvesting of high value products such as poles and fuelwood. Labor inputs declined, tree survival rates increased, and average annual net benefits improved as woodlot management was devolved, indicating improved efficiency with more localized management. Environmental sustainability was associated with less devolved woodlot management. This study highlights the tradeoffs inherent in devolution reforms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Improvements in the ability to model El Nino and other large-scale interannual climate variations have allowed for the development of seasonal climate forecasts, predicting rainfall and temperature anomalies for many places around the world. These forecasts have allowed developing countries to predict shortfalls in grain yields, with benefits for food security. Several countries communicate the forecasts to subsistence farmers, which could allow them to mitigate the effects of drought on their harvests by adapting their cropping decisions accordingly. However, it has not been demonstrated that subsistence farmers benefit from having access to the forecasts. Here we present evidence of subsistence farmers using the forecasts over multiple years to make different decisions and significantly improving their harvests when they do so. in a controlled study, farmers in Zimbabwe who reported adapting their farming methods to seasonal climate forecasts significantly improved their harvests over baseline amounts. Moreover, farmers who had attended a brief workshop and learned more about the forecasts were significantly more likely to use the forecasts than were farmers who learned of the forecasts through nonparticipatory channels.

SO FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
LA English

DE chloride; dioxin; fuel gas; gasification; hydrogen; waste
AB In Europe, most wastes are deposited in landfills, but a European Council directive has called for a 30% reduction of the landfill amount. Though the cement industry commonly bums waste as an alternative fuel together with fossil fuel (so-called waste co-incineration), it is necessary to reconsider this co-incineration from the viewpoints of sustainable development and cement quality. Gasification and smelting processes (GSPs) for waste can convert waste to slag and fuel gas, which can be used by the energy sector and industry, so these processes are desirable in that they provide wide social benefit. Considering its low environmental impact and good economic performance, a GSP that uses a one-process furnace and oxygen multi-blowing was tested on a semi-pilot scale (1.7 tons/day) to convert different wastes (municipal waste, plastic waste and refuse of polyvinyl chloride with a chlorine content of 48%) to slag and hydrogen-rich fuel gas. The results show that the techniques applied in this test increase the quality of the produced fuel gas, strictly control pollutants, and prolong the life of the plant. Furthermore, the tested GSP has the potential to be linked with a hydrogen-based system through its production of hydrogen-rich fuel gas. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The potential of postharvest dip treatments with fludioxonil (FLU) (a synthetic analogue of the bacterial metabolite of pyrrolnitrin), in controlling postharvest decay caused by Penicillium digitatum and Penicillium italicum of citrus fruit was investigated in comparison with the conventional fungicide imazalil (IMZ). The ultrastructural changes of fruit epicuticular wax was investigated as a function of water dip temperature, and the possible role of these changes was related to residue accumulation under FLU treatment. Residues retained by fruit were determined as a function of fungicide concentration, dip temperature, and fruit storage conditions. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that fruit dipping in water at 30 or 40 degrees C did not cause differences in cuticular wax's ultrastructure in comparison to control fruit, while treatments at 50, 55, or 60 degrees C caused the disappearance of wax platelets, resulting in relatively homogeneous skin surface, due to partial "melting" of epicuticular wax. Residues of FLU in fruit treated at 20 or 50 degrees C were significantly correlated with the doses of fungicide applied. When equal amounts of fungicide were employed, the residue concentrations were notably higher (from 2.6- to 4-fold) in fruit treated at 50 degrees C than in fruit treated at 20 degrees C. The dissipation rate of FLU in "Salustiana" and "Tarocco" oranges was lower in fruit subjected to treatment at 50 degrees C. The minimal FLU concentration for almost complete decay control in artificially wounded fruit during 7-d storage at 20 degrees C was 400 mg/L active ingredient (ai) in fruit treated at 20 degrees C and 100 mg/L ai in fruit treated at 50 degrees C. Results on nonwounded Tarocco oranges subjected to 3 weeks of simulated quarantine conditions at 1 degrees C, plus 6 weeks of standard storage at 8 degrees C and an additional two weeks of simulated marketing period (SMP) at 20 degrees C revealed that almost complete decay control with FLU applications of 100 mg/L at 50 degrees C and 400 mg/L at 20 degrees C resulted in ca. 0.8 mg/kg FLU fruit residues, in agreement with results on wounded citrus fruit. When equal concentrations and temperatures were applied, FLU treatments were as effective as IMZ. In vitro trials showed a low sensitivity to FLU against P. digitatum and P. italicum isolates. MIC values for the complete inhibition of mycelium growth were >= 100 mu g/mL, while ED50 values ranged from 0.1 to 1 mu g/mL for P. digitatum and from 1 to > 100 mu g/mL for P. italicum. The latter result suggests that care should be taken to avoid exclusive application of FLU in a sustainable program for management of fruit decay. However, integrating fungicide application and hot water dip may reduce the possibility of selecting fungicide-resistant populations of the pathogen, by increasing the effectiveness of the treatment.

AB Included into the objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC) there are the correct management of the water resources and the involvement of the stakeholders in the decision process.
   Bayesian Networks, mathematical models based on the probability theory, have been used recently to solve environmental problems. This methodology meets the relevant requirements to the effect that it is fully comprehensive and integrated, as it deals with the water resource as a whole and encourages the participation of all those people and groups who are somehow involved in its use or management.
   A Bayesian Network was developed by means of stakeholders participation which is intended to be useful in the decision-making process related to water resource management in the Hydroaeological Unit "Eastern Mancha". The main problem in the region is the risk of overexploitation of the local aquifer, brought about by a considerable increase, over the last 25 years, in the surface area of irrigated arable land.
   The results offered by the tool show that the current situation is non-sustainable concerning the aquifer exploitation. There are several ways to solve this situation. The first one could be decreasing the current volume of ground water for irrigation, but this solution would not be welcome by the farmers due to losses of income. The second one is replacing groundwater for irrigation by surface water, where the main problem would be the considerable expenses in infrastructures. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents the main methodological aspects and results obtained from the activity of the Irrigation Advisory Service for Farmers (SIAR) of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. Castilla-La Mancha is a broad semi-arid region, with a total area of 8 million ha and an irrigable area of more an 475,000 ha. Most of these irrigated areas (at least 60%) present serious problems of water scarcity, and are in need of improvement in the use of irrigation water. SIAR upgrades farmers' capacities and awareness, thus minimizing the negative environmental impacts of irrigation, decreasing the production costs and contributing to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the area. Approximately, 25% of the irrigated area is advised, representing 499 collaborator farmers within an area of ca. 100,000 ha. Water-scarce areas are where the SIAR advice is more closely followed by the farmers and irrigation performance indicators are highest. The total estimated cost for the service is of about 3EURO ha(-1) yr(-1). A team of field technicians forms the core of SIAR. The team is assembled via a cooperation agreement between the University of Castilla-La Mancha and the Regional Government. Among the results and conclusions obtained, the most important is the improvement of water use. However, technical, social and economic limitations are relevant, and constitute a handicap to achieve the objectives of the advisory service. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Vine growing plays an important role in many semiarid farming regions all aver the world, also as a permanent plant cover in terms of preventing erosion, sustainable use of land and water resources, defence against desertification and settling population in rural areas. This paper shows how to build up a Geographic Information System (GIs) on vine growing that could be a useful tool to support decision making processes related to land and water management in Castilla-La Mancha, the region of Spain with the largest area of vineyards, where wine growing and making are becoming competitive, even at the world scale. The System allows relating the environmental, social and economic effects of managing land and water use in this agricultural sector, to test feasible alternatives from a regional perspective and according to different stakeholder's viewpoints. GIs appears as the only tool that can support the large database sets requested for such analysis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Improvement District; fairness; water users association
AB This article examines irrigation management conduct within Japanese Water Users Associations (WUAs), named Land Improvement Districts (LID), which are regarded as a successful case of Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM). The authors conducted field and questionnaire surveys in sample LIDs focusing on the social function of LID and village communities. Among many factors, the authors paid special attention on how fairness contributes to the sustainability of WUAs. The results of the surveys proved that farmers operate the irrigation facilities in a self-serving way and have their own rule of fairness, such as upstream superiority, based on the long-term traditional experiences of irrigation systems management. The result of questionnaire survey proved that farmers do place high priority in fairness in various ways. The application of fairness to irrigation management is quite new and it is worthwhile to try this approach in other country's case studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A field experiment was conducted in an olive orchard of impoverished sandy soil to evaluate the efficacy of different management systems involving the use of plant covers, with respect to the tillage systems generally used in semiarid, continental environments. The results obtained were used to establish the most appropriate herbaceous cover in terms of reduced competition for water and erosion control, and to assess the efficacy of different strategies aimed at increasing soil N and OM contents.
   Experimental plots were subjected to the following treatments: (1) non-tillage plus a natural vegetation cover; (2) non-tillage plus a subterranean clover (and natural vegetation) cover; (3) tillage plus a vetch cover; (4) non-tillage and weeds control by herbicides; and (5) tillage, leaving the soil free of weeds all year-round.
   Water contents were determined for soil samples collected at depths of 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm in the plots subjected to the different management systems to identify the effects of rainfall and management on soil water balance in periods of normal, high or low rainfall. The impact of the different management systems on chemical (OM, N, K, P2O5, anions) and biochemical (ATP, CO2/ATP, urease, phosphatase) fertility was also examined.
   During years of normal or high rainfall, these covers showed no significant, or scarce, competition with the tree. The management strategy used favored the presence and abundance of spontaneous legumes in the covers including natural vegetation. Soil C and N contents were higher in the plant cover systems. Effects on biochemical soil fertility are starting to emerge, with clear indications of microbial regeneration. This was of greatest intensity in plots with substantial proportions of legumes in the covers. The control of soil erosion achieved by covers comprised of herbaceous species was especially satisfactory. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INCOME DIVERSIFICATION
AB This study contributes to the literature on the role of livelihood strategies in rural growth and poverty reduction. It distinguishes between livelihood diversity strategies that contribute to sustainable growth in household incomes, and those that mainly have a 'coping' function. It suggests that typically, the contribution of livelihood diversity to growing household income is through relaxing dependence on credit for access to capital. In this scenario, livelihood diversity would lead to higher technical efficiency in agriculture via investment and thereby to higher household incomes. Survey data from Georgia are introduced and used to test these hypotheses using a Bayesian stochastic frontier approach. The findings are relevant to de. ning more clearly the scope and aims of policies to stimulate the rural non-farm economy in developing and transition countries.

DE fuel processing; reforming; auxiliary power unit
AB Due to the increasing demand for electrical power in today's passenger vehicles, and with the requirements regarding fuel consumption and environmental sustainability tightening, a fuel cell-based auxiliary power unit (APU) becomes a promising alternative to the conventional generation of electrical energy via internal combustion engine, generator and battery. It is obvious that the on-board stored fuel has to be used for the fuel cell system, thus, gasoline or diesel has to be reformed on board. This makes the auxiliary power unit a complex integrated system of stack, air supply, fuel processor, electrics as well as heat and water management. Aside from proving the technical feasibility of such a system, the development has to address three major barriers: start-up time, costs, and size/weight of the systems. In this paper a packaging concept for an auxiliary power unit is presented. The main emphasis is placed on the fuel processor, as good packaging of this large subsystem has the strongest impact on overall size.
   The fuel processor system consists of an autothermal reformer in combination with water-gas shift and selective oxidation stages, based on adiabatic reactors with inter-cooling. The configuration was realized in a laboratory set-up and experimentally investigated. The results gained from this confirm a general suitability for mobile applications. A start-up time of 30 min was measured, while a potential reduction to 10 min seems feasible. An overall fuel processor efficiency of about 77% was measured. On the basis of the know-how gained by the experimental investigation of the laboratory set-up a packaging concept was developed. Using state-of-the-art catalyst and heat exchanger technology, the volumes of these components are fixed. However, the overall volume is higher mainly due to mixing zones and flow ducts, which do not contribute to the chemical or thermal function of the system. Thus, the concept developed mainly focuses on minimization of those component volumes. Therefore, the packaging utilizes rectangular catalyst bricks and integrates flow ducts into the heat exchangers. A concept is presented with a 251 fuel processor volume including thermal isolation for a 3 kW,l auxiliary power unit. The overall size of the system, i.e. including stack, air supply and auxiliaries can be estimated to 441. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Kin form important political groups, which change in size and relative inequality with demographic shifts. Increases in the rate of population growth increase the size of kin groups but decrease their inequality and vice versa. The optimal size of kin groups may be evaluated from the marginal political product (MPP) of their members. Culture and institutions affect levels and shapes of MPP. Different optimal group sizes, from different perspectives, can be suggested for any MPP schedule. The relative dominance of competing groups is determined by their MPP schedules. Groups driven to extremes of sustainability may react in Malthusian fashion, including fission and fusion, or in Boserupian fashion, altering social technology to accommodate changes in size. The spectrum of alternatives for actors and groups, shaped by existing institutions and natural and cultural selection, is very broad. Nevertheless, selection may result in survival of particular kinds of political structures.

AB Rain-fed agriculture with supplementary irrigation, usually referred to as 'water harvesting on terraced fields' is the traditional irrigation technique in the Ta' izz area, located in the southern uplands of the Yemen Mountain Massif. The non-traditional method of groundwater irrigation has recently led to overuse and depletion of aquifers. A new orientation towards the traditional agricultural irrigation techniques is necessary for the purpose of sustainability. This requires a better scientific understanding of these irrigation systems. In order to understand the design and management of water harvesting schemes, rainfall analysis and the identification of prevailing rainfall patterns is required. A statistical rainfall analysis was conducted to detect the probability of rainfall exceedance during the vegetation period from May until October. Rainfall supply was then measured against water requirements of the prevailing crop Sorghum bicolore. To explore the beneficial effect of the local runoff irrigation schemes, also referred to as water harvesting schemes, water-harvesting factors were introduced. The rainfall is supplemented by a water-harvesting factor to show the amplifying effect of those water-harvesting measures.
   Analysis results show that a lack of rainfall during the end of the first rainy season and an intermediate dry period under pure rain-fed conditions can be mitigated by the local runoff irrigation schemes. A fairly reliable and sufficient rainfall characterizes the second rainy season. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The availability of freshwater is a particularly important issue in Africa where large portions of the continent are and or semiarid and climate is highly variable. Sustainable water resource management requires the assessment of hydrological variability in response to nature climate fluctuation. In this study, a land surface model, the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS), and a hydrological routing model, the Hydrological Routing Algorithm (HYDRA), are used to investigate the hydrological variability in two large basins, the Lake Chad basin (LCB) and the Niger River basin (NRB), located in West Africa, over the period from 1950 to 1995. The IBIS land surface hydrological module was calibrated and validated for and and semiarid Africa, and major enhancements were made to the module, including the development of a dynamic root water-extraction formulation, the incorporation of a Green-Ampt infiltration parameterization, and modification to the prescribed root distribution, the runoff module, and weather generator. The results show that the hydrology in this area is highly variable over time and space. The coefficient of variance (CV) of annual rainfall ranges from 10%-15% in the southern portions of the basins to 30%-40% in the northern portions. The annual evapotranspiration (ET) varies with a slightly lower CV compared to the rainfall, but the runoff is extremely sensitive to the rainfall fluctuation, particularly in the central portions of the basins (8 degrees-13 degrees N in LCB and 12 degrees-16 degrees N in NRB) where the CVs in runoff are as high as 100%-200%. The annual river discharge varies largely in concert with the rainfall fluctuation, with the CV being 37% in LCB and 23%-63% in NRB. In terms of the whole basin, the relative hydrologic variability (rainfall, evapotranspiration, runoff, and river discharge) is significantly higher in the dry period than in the wet period, and the interannual variability in runoff is more than twice as high as compared to rainfall or ET.

AB As the urban population increases, so do diverse urban problems and concerns including issues of servicing large numbers of people within existing infrastructures, as a result of over-development and over-concentration. Environmental problems, particularly air and water pollution, have become more evident and are now considered central issues for urban planners and decision-makers. To address these environmental problems, practical approaches which incorporate the concept of carrying capacity into managing urban development are needed.
   This research aims at developing an integrated framework for assessing urban carrying capacity which can determine development density based on current infrastructures and land use. First, seven determining factors were identified for urban carrying capacity including energy, green areas, roads, subway systems, water supply, sewage treatment, and waste treatment, and the assessment framework was developed by integrating such factors. Secondly, the Urban Carrying Capacity Assessment System, a GIS-based carrying capacity assessment system, was developed based upon the framework. Finally, through a case study for determining the carrying capacity for an area in Seoul, South Korea, it was revealed that decision support with UCCAS demonstrated in this research can play a pivotal role in planning and managing urban development more effectively.

AB A polyglycolised glyceride carrier, Gelucire 50/13, was incorporated with paracetamol as a model drug, filled into hard gelatin capsules and stored at three different temperatures for various lengths of time. The resultant solidified matrix within the capsule was subjected to thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to ascertain its supramolecular structure. Polymorphic transformations towards more stable gelucire forms were observed upon aging the matrices, with samples stored at a temperature near the melting range of the lower temperature gelucire melting fraction showing the most profound changes. The increase in the rate of drug release from aged samples could be correlated to the alterations to the supramolecular structure of the gelucire. Accelerated drug release from aged samples could also be seen from in vivo studies using healthy human volunteers, although the extent of absorption was not affected. Therefore, even though the sustainability of release may be compromised by aging the gelucire matrices, the bioavailability of the incorporated drug is unlikely to be affected. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Definition of both quality and quantity of energy consumption of crops by recently developed remote sensing methods has been an important factor in the control of sustainable bioenergy production in terms of food security. This study was conducted to find the critical physiological stages of orange trees from their energy supply and energy balances using remote sensing methods. The relationships between absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and chlorophyll content (chl) of the leaves at different growth stages were investigated. Canopy reflectance by hand-held spectroradiometer and total chl analysis at the laboratory were measured simultaneously from the random samples taken from four different parts of orange trees in orchards, each orchard being at a different age group. Reflectance measurements were conducted between 450nm and 900nm wavelength at four different bands (three visible bands and one near-infrared band) at the four basic physiological periods of orange trees. Reflectance values measured in the field were converted to APAR (WM-2) and the chi values were determined in mg ml(-1). According to the statistical analysis, there was a strong relationship between APAR at the bands of 450-520 nm (blue) and 630-690 nm (red) and the chlorophyll content (p <= 0. 0 1; R-2 = 0.750 at blue wavelength and R-2 = 0.770 at red wavelength) in June (fruit setting stage). These results showed that the relationships between chi and APAR values were very strong despite low levels of APAR at this stage, in comparison to the other ones. Amongst all the stages, APAR values were the highest in November. Another important result was that Washington navel trees unexpectedly had the highest APAR during the dormancy stage. These results suggested that the relationships between PAR utilization and chlorophyll content were important for tree health and indirect yield of per annum plants such as citrus. The values obtained from the leaves of orange trees at different physiological periods were more important than those relationships for the trees of different ages.

AB There is a need for the development of alternative therapeutic treatments for amoebic gill disease (AGD) in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. to maintain the sustainability of the Tasmanian Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry. This study aimed to assess the effects of the mucolytic drug L-cysteine ethyl ester (LCEE) on marine Atlantic salmon mucus and whether or not it may have a therapeutic advantage for the alleviation of AGD when administered orally. We also aimed to document any physiological consequences of LCEE. Results showed that LCEE significantly decreased the viscosity of marine Atlantic salmon mucus both in vitro, where LCEE concentration showed a negative relationship to mucus viscosity (R-2 = 0.95 at 11.5 s(-1)), and in vivo. Oral administration of LCEE at 52.7 mg LCEE kg(-1) fish d(-1) over 2 wk significantly delayed the progression of AGD-associated pathology during an aggressive, cohabitation induced, laboratory infection. Medicated fish had approximately 50 % less gill filaments affected by AGD than control fed fish at 3 d post-infection when assessed using histology. Palatability of medicated feed was shown to be approximately 65 % of control feed. No osmoregulatory disturbance was seen in medicated fish, although blood and whole body flux data indicated a slight acidosis coinciding with an increased plasma total ammonia concentration. However, both variables were within a tolerable physiological range and returned to control levels 3 d post-cessation of medicated feed. LCEE holds potential as an in-feed additive when administered over 2 wk prior to infection to delay the progression of AGD associated pathology. From the parameters measured, LCEE seems to have minimal physiological consequences after 2 wk of administration.

AB We explore here the evolution of skiing locomotion in the last few thousand years by investigating how humans adapted to move effectively in lands where a cover of snow, for several months every year, prevented them from travelling as on dry ground. Following historical research, we identified the sets of skis corresponding to the 'milestones' of skiing evolution in terms of ingenuity and technology, built replicas of them and measured the metabolic energy associated to their use in a climate-controlled ski tunnel.
   Six sets of skis were tested, covering a span from 542 AD to date. Our results show that: (i) the history of skiing is associated with a progressive decrease in the metabolic cost of transport, (ii) it is possible today to travel at twice the speed of ancient times using the same amount of metabolic power and (iii) the cost of transport is speed-independent for each ski model, as during running. By combining this finding with the relationship between time of exhaustion and the sustainable fraction of metabolic power, a prediction of the maximum skiing speed according to the distance travelled is provided for all past epochs, including two legendary historical journeys (1206 and 1520 AD) on snow. Our research shows that the performances in races originating from them (Birkebeiner and Vasaloppet) and those of other modern competitions (skating versus classical techniques) are well predicted by the evolution of skiing economy. Mechanical determinants of the measured progression in economy are also discussed in the paper.

AB Forests canopies are dynamic, continuously varying, three-dimensional structures that display substantial heterogeneity in their spatial arrangement at many scales. At the stand-level, fine-scale spatial heterogeneity influences key canopy processes and contributes to the diversity of niche space and maintenance of forest biodiversity. We present a quantitative method that we developed based on a novel application of two well-established statistical techniques - lacunarity analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) - to determine the fine-scale (0.5-33 m) spatial heterogeneity found in the outer surface of a forest canopy. This method was specifically designed for the analysis of continuous canopy height data generated by airborne LiDAR systems or digital photogrammetry; however, in this study we demonstrate our method using a large, well-documented dataset composed of simulated canopy surfaces only. We found that the magnitude of the lacunarity statistic was strongly associated with canopy cover (R-2 = 0.85) and gap volume (R-2 = 0.84), while the pattern of decline in lacunarity across discrete measurement scales was related to many size- and density-related attributes of stand and canopy structure (0.27 <= R-2 <= 0.58) and their diverse vertical and horizontal spatial distributions. PCA uncovered two major gradients of spatial heterogeneity from the 10 dimensions of our original lacunarity dataset. The stronger of these two gradients reflected the continuous variation in canopy cover and gap volume, while a second, more subtle gradient was associated with the array of possible vertical and horizontal spatial configurations that might define any one measure of canopy cover. We expect that this quantitative method can be used to support a broad range of practical applications in sustainable forest management, long-term ecological monitoring, and forest science. Further research is required to understand how these statistical estimates and gradients of measured spatial heterogeneity relate to other ecologically relevant patterns of forest composition, structure, and function.

AB Levels of commercialization, size class profile and fruit production of Sclerocatya birrea (marula) trees were studied in the Bushbuckridge region of South Africa. A stage-based population matrix model was used to estimate the sustainable yield for S. birrea fruit. The trees begin to bear fruit at an average size of 42.8 cm in circumference and this relates to an approximate age of 19 years. For a stable size class profile, the population growth rate, lambda, was 1.1828758. The observed size class profile did not conform to the stable stage size class profile, obtained from the model. Thus, it was not possible to predict the state of the observed population.
   Using the model, it was estimated that 92% of fruit could be removed without impacting the current population profile. The management of other more destructive forms of S. birrea resource use (such as bark or firewood harvesting), however, do need to be monitored to limit negative impacts on the population that may reduce fruit availability for regeneration or cropping.

AB Forests and forestry in Sweden are dominated by conifers. Silviculture using mixed or broadleaved stands is often recommended, but the degree to which broadleaves regenerate naturally needs to be clarified. The Swedish National Forest Inventory is here used for a region-wide study of broadleaved saplings (1.3 m tall to 4.9 cm dbh) regenerated naturally. For 12 species (taxa) in young forests (< 7 m tall) and high forests (> 7 m), sapling densities were related to seven forest types and three productivity classes. Birch had highest densities in all but two broadleaved forest types. Birch, oak, rowan and sallow had 70-85% of their total sapling populations in conifer-dominated forest types, indicating good potential for mixed stands. Beech, lime, hornbeam, ash and elm were mostly restricted to 'noble' (hardwood) forests. The regeneration success (saplings per mature tree) for birch, rowan and oak was highest in conifer-dominated forest; beech was about equally successful in conifer-dominated and broadleaved forests, and ash was very successful in broadleaved forest. Oak regeneration may be problematical in broadleaved forests, but we suggest this is not the case in conifer-dominated forests (where oaks have rarely been studied). Sapling densities of the species in the forest types were not consistently correlated with productivity, but birch and aspen generally regenerated strongest at intermediate and at high productivity, respectively. In noble forests, oak, ash and elm regenerated strongest at low productivity. The role of asexual regeneration (sprouting) remains to clarify. Our results suggest that lime, elm, ash and some other trees currently are limited mainly by poor dispersal, rather than habitat availability. The results are promising for various forms of mixed-species forestry that does not require planting (or little planting) and that would be beneficial for nature conservation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Conversion management in ageing temperate Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in West and Central Europe mainly focuses on changing species composition, without paying attention to quantitative stand structural features such as development of spatial point pattern, (relative) mingling and size differentiation. The consideration of such detailed stand structural features in management decision making may in some cases help to achieve one or more goals of sustainable forestry, such as the maintenance and enhancement of biodiversity. The main purpose of this paper is to quantify and interpret stand structure and its spontaneous development in unmanaged ageing Scots pine stands, based on the structural classes and the development pathways published by Kint et al. (2004a). Stand structure is quantified with the SIAFOR software, designed for the calculation of structural indices in completely stem-mapped monitoring plots.
   Spontaneous structural development at the stand level in ageing Scots pine stands is characterised, in the absence of major disturbances, by a tendency towards random spatial point pattern and random relative mingling, as well as increasing mingling and increasing tree size differentiation. Also clear development trends at the species level can be distinguished. As pine density in ageing Scots pine stands decreases, the spatial point pattern of pines tends to change from regular towards random. Birch regenerates in canopy gaps of pine. Regeneration of oak establishes prior to gap formation under a canopy of pine, and gradually grows up as more light becomes available in the gaps. Both birch and oak tend from clustered spatial point pattern and segregation towards random spatial point pattern and random mingling. Massive regeneration of pine on open areas after major disturbance is initially clustered. As a result of self-thinning, pine develops towards a regular spatial point pattern. Tree size differentiation of species may increase or decrease depending on the type and intensity of competition processes. The application of the results as a reference for forest management issues where stand structure is of relevance is discussed, with special attention to biodiversity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Forest structural features at the stand scale (e.g., snags, stern density, species composition) and habitat attributes at larger spatial scales (e.g., landscape pattern, road density) can influence biological diversity and have been proposed as indicators in sustainable forestry programs. This study investigated relationships between such factors and total richness of breeding birds based on data from four studies within highly forested landscapes in the southeastern United States (Arkansas, South Carolina, and West Virginia) that were managed for commercial forest products. Habitat attributes were developed from forest inventory data and other information at the stand level and in circular buffers with radii of 250, 500 m, and I km around each sample point. Species accumulation curves for all study sites indicated greater richness in the youngest stands, with greater landscape age heterogeneity, and with proximity of sample points to roads. However, bird richness was not related to distance to nearest water or stream density at any scale. Pine forests had the most species at two of three sites where pine forests occurred. Stand biomass and basal area were generally not predictive of avian richness. Watersheds within the Arkansas site under more intensive management showed greater bird diversity. Overall, forest management appeared to have a positive effect on total bird richness. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID REGENERATION
AB Data from a total of 117 ha of small (0.25-4 ha) permanent plots in four ecoregions of Bolivia, along with information on harvest data, were used in a simulation model to determine the sustainability of timber harvesting in Bolivian tropical forests. Growth increments of future crop trees (averaging from 0.22 to 0.41 cm/year) in the principal forest ecoregions of Bolivia are currently not high enough to allow for similar wood volumes to be cut in the second next harvest using current cutting cycles and minimum cutting diameters, assuming that forest managers are cutting the volumes of wood that are stated in their management plans. Estimated recoverable volumes in the second harvest for regions varied from approximately 4 to 28% of the potentially harvestable volume in the first cycle considering all commercially marketable stems. It may be unrealistic to expect future yields equal to that of what is essentially primary tropical forest; however, forest managers should consider options that will allow for harvesting to move closer to sustainable wood production. These options include the implementation of silvicultural treatments to increase tree growth, focusing on fast-growing species with good regeneration, using fallow cycle rotations or a combination of these methods.

AB The emulation of natural disturbances is seen by many as an important management paradigm for achieving sustainable ecosystem management. To successfully emulate natural disturbances, managers must first have an understanding of the complex interactions that occur to the biophysical and chemical attributes of an ecosystem for both the natural and the "emulating" disturbance. The management of riparian ecosystems is an important issue faced by managers since the type of harvesting treatment can have a significant influence on the aquatic component. The removal or retention of riparian forests can have a direct influence on water quality and quantity, particularly on the smaller systems that are found at the headwaters of catchments, but do these treatments invoke a similar response as wildfire? To determine if emulation occurs, the affects of forest harvesting treatments and wildfire on temperature, water chemistry, summer stream flow, and sedimentation in headwater systems were compared using a meta-analysis. A statistically significant difference was found for temperature response between partial/selective harvesting and wildfire, but not after clear-cut harvesting. Water chemistry showed statistically significant differences for I I out of 14 tested attributes, with dissolved organic carbon exhibiting the most marked difference. A significant difference was identified between clear-cut harvesting and wildfire for summer stream flow but not between wildfire and partial/ selective harvest systems. Forest harvesting operations were found to emulate sedimentation through forest roads but not harvest treatment. Partial/selective harvest systems may offer the greatest emulation congruency versus clear-cut harvest systems in terms of overall headwater response and recovery. Partial/selective harvest systems combined with prescribed burning may provide managers with the best solution when attempting to emulate wildfire in headwater systems and reduce the detrimental impact of perturbation on these systems.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Reducing the energy derived from fossil fuels within agricultural systems has important implications for decreasing atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases, thus assisting the arrest of global warming. The identification of crop production methods that maximise energy efficiency and minimise greenhouse gas emissions is vital. Sugar beet is grown in a variety of locations and under a variety of agronomic conditions within the UK. This study identified thirteen production scenarios, representative of over 90% of the UK beet crop, which included five soil types, nine fertiliser regimes and nine crop protection strategies. The fossil energy input, the overall energy efficiency and the global warming potential (GIAT) of each production scenario was assessed. This study did not consider the processing of the beet to extract sugar.
   The overall energy input of the UK beet crop ranges between 15.72 and 25.94 GJ/ha. It produces between 7.3 and 15.0 times as much energy in dry matter at the sugar factory gate as consumed in its production, with an average ratio of 9.7. It has an average GWP of 0.024 eq. t CO2 per tonne of clean beet harvested, equivalent to 0.0062 eq. t CO2 per GJ output. The energy input into each scenario was dictated largely by the energy associated with crop nutrition. The smallest energy inputs per hectare were to crops grown under organic conditions or conventional crops grown on fertile soils (clay loam, silt or peat) or sand soil with broiler manure applied. Those crops with the greatest energy input were grown on sand soil that was irrigated and had mineral fertiliser applied. Although the organic scenario grown on sandy loam soil had one of the smallest energy inputs per hectare, the low yield meant that the energy input was similar per tonne of beet harvested to the conventional crops grown on sandy loam soil. The extra distance travelled by organic beet from the farm to the factory increased the energy input per tonne above that of the conventional scenarios. The GWP was smallest for the conventional crops on the fertile peat and silt soils and greatest on the irrigated sand soils and the sandy loam soils. The organic scenario had a similar GWP to the conventional scenarios on sandy loam to the farm gate, although the greater diesel requirement for transport increased the GWP overall. The GWP per GJ of output for sugar beet in England is similar to published values for wheat. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil nutrient depletion in Uganda is one of the leading environmental degradation problems threatening the livelihoods of most fanners in the region. In order to identify policy options that may be used to address the problem, this study was conducted with an objective of analyzing the determinants of flow and balances of nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in Uganda. Data for this study were collected from 58 randomly selected farmers who participated in on-farm fertilizer trials and household surveys conducted in 2000 to 2001. Econometric models were used to analyze the determinants of soil nutrient flows and balances. Only 5% of the sample households had positive total NPK balances implying 95% of the farmers likely used unsustainable land management practices in the 2000/2001 season. If inorganic fertilizer were used to restore the mined nutrients, it would cost an equivalent of a fifth of the farm income. The results confirm the heavy reliance of smallholder farmers to soil fertility mining for their livelihoods. Agricultural potential, size of livestock herd, crop diversity, education, and having non-farm activities improve soil nutrient balances. This implies farmers need to be encouraged to grow crops and keep livestock in order to utilize the crop-livestock synergies. Education and non-farm activities in rural areas also need to be promoted as they contribute to more sustainable land management practices. Contact with extension agents initially accelerates soil nutrient depletion probably due to tendency of farmers to first adopt improved crop varieties without using fertilizer. Hence there is need for extension messages to emphasize adoption of both soil fertility and seed technologies. Farmers in high market access appear to deplete their soils more rapidly, pointing to the need to design policy mechanisms that would reduce soil nutrient depletion in high market access areas.

AB Depletion of soil organic matter (SOM) is a major component of soil degradation that threatens the sustainability of smallholder farming systems in Ethiopia. In this study, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) dynamics following deforestation and subsequent cultivation were evaluated using natural abundance of C-13 and N-15 along a farm field chronosequence cleared from tropical dry Afromontane forest in south central Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected from five closely located farm fields cultivated for 7, 10, 26, 34 and 53 years after clearance and from an adjacent natural forest soil. All the soils in the study were Mollic Andosols/Humic Haplustands. The delta C-13 values of the SOC of the farm fields in the 0-10 and 10-20 cm layers were significantly elevated compared to the natural forest soil. In the 0-10 cm layer, the lowest delta C-13 value of -23.17 parts per thousand +/- 0.36 was recorded from the natural forest soil and the highest value of -15.7 parts per thousand +/- 1.50 from the 53-year-old farm field. Fractionation of the SOC of the bulk soil based on the delta C-13 values showed that in the 0-10 cm layer the SOC of the forest origin declined by 74.6%, which is equivalent to 54.1 Mg C ha(-1) or 740 kg ha(-1) year(-1), where as SOC input from the agricultural crops was low (240 kg ha(-1) year 1). However, part of the SOC of the forest origin lost from the surface 0-10 cm soil layer was translocated to the 10-20 cm layer. The SOC derived natural forest approached steady state around 30 years after cultivation while the SOC derived from agricultural crops reached steady state already after 10 years. The results show that the remaining forest derived SOC is recalcitrant while the SOC derived from agricultural crops has a relatively short mean residence time. The soils of the farm fields also showed increasing delta N-15 values indicating a loss of N from the system. The increasing delta N-15 values were consistent with the loss of total N along the chronosequence. A continued loss of N combined with insufficient input of fertilizer will result in a decreased productivity of the studied farming systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The poor efficiency with which nitrogen (N) is often used on grassland farms is well documented, as are the potential consequences of undesirable emissions of nitrogen. As fertiliser represents a major input of nitrogen to such systems, its improved management has good potential for increasing the efficiency of nitrogen use and enhancing environmental and economic performance. This paper describes the development, structure and potential application of a new decision support system for fertiliser management for British grassland. The underlying empirically-based model simulates monthly nitrogen flows within and between the main components of the livestock production system according to user inputs describing site conditions and farm management characteristics. The user-friendly decision support system (`NGAUGE') has a user interface that was produced in collaboration with livestock farmers to ensure availability of all required inputs. NGAUGE is an improvement on existing nitrogen fertiliser recommendation systems in that it relates production to environmental impact and is therefore potentially valuable to policy makers and researchers for identifying pollution mitigation strategies and blueprints for novel, more sustainable systems of livestock production. One possible application is the simulation of the phenomenon of pollution swapping, whereby, for example, the adoption of strategies for the reduction of nitrate leaching may exacerbate emissions of ammonia and nitrous oxide. Outputs of the decision support system include a field- and target-specific N fertiliser recommendation together with farm- and field-based N budgets, comprising amounts of N in both production and loss components of the system. Recommendations may be updated on a monthly basis to take account of deviations of weather conditions from the 30-year mean. The optimisation procedure within NGAUGE enables user-specified targets of herbage production, N loss or fertiliser use to be achieved while maximising efficiency of N use. Examples of model output for a typical grassland management scenario demonstrate the effect on model predictions of site and management properties such as soil texture, weather zone, grazing and manure applications. Depending on existing management and site characteristics, simulations with NGAUGE suggest that it is possible to reduce nitrate leaching by up to 46% (compared with a fertiliser distribution from existing fertiliser recommendations), and fertiliser by 33%, without sacrificing herbage yield. The greatest improvements in efficiency are possible on sandy-textured soils, with moderate N inputs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article argues that community-building efforts across borders are motivated by traditional realist concerns about security rather than idealistic beliefs in universal principles. The creation of sustainable, cross-border institutions will come about because governments recognize that they are unable to meet basic challenges without increased cooperation. The emergence of common norms comes about through cooperation in coping with global challenges. not via the imposition of political systems or the exercise of hegemonic power.

AB Today the world has become too small to remain too different-liberal-democratic and authoritarian-totalitarian, rich and poor, healthy and mired in epidemics. Such variations also constitute a fertile ground for terrorism. The concepts of East and West, South and North have all emerged as Homo sapiens, starting from an African village, spread throughout the world. Today we are creating the global village of planet Earth. In this village. differences acquired during the millennia of separation and isolation not only enrich humankind but some also can serve as a cause. a catalyst, or a pretext for conflicts, including terrorism. Having dissimilated for millennia, humankind is slowly and often reluctantly assimilating. However, sustainable integration, whether economic or political, is not possible without some kind of assimilation taking place (i.e., integrating entities becoming in some respect similar to each other).

AB The Medicine and Public Health Initiative (MPHI) was created jointly 10 years ago by the American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association to bridge the nearly century-wide gulf between the respective disciplines. We review the history of MPHI and its growing significance in light of recent terrorism events. We report on current MPHI activities by examining three bellwether states-California, Florida, and Texas-as well as international sites. Upon its inception, MPHI was rapidly embraced and nationally disseminated. Sustainability 10 years later in the post-911 world requires renewed commitment by all collaborators. In order to meet the numerous health challenges facing our nation, from terrorism to chronic disease, and for MPHI to be successful, medicine and public health must work in tandem.

TI The general surgery model: A more appealing and sustainable alternative

ID SERVICE; FUTURE
AB The contemporary model of trauma care where dedicated trauma/critical care surgeons exclusively manage trauma patients has become progressively unsustainable. Little objective data, however, is available documenting that a better model exists. From September 2002 through August 2003, the trauma model at a 735-bed level I trauma teaching hospital was changed from the contemporary model to a new one where selected general surgeons with Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) certification covered in-house trauma and emergency surgery call on a rotational basis. As well, each pursued elective practices, admitting all inpatients (trauma, emergent, elective) to a single teaching service (formerly the trauma service). Critical care was managed by a separate group of intensivists. The purpose of this study was to objectively compare the two models. Quantitative, financial, and qualitative data were derived from August 2001 to January 2002 (trauma/critical care model) and compared to August 2003 to January 2004 (general surgery model). During the two periods (trauma/critical care vs general surgery), the mean Revised Trauma Score (7.1 vs 7.2; P = 0.029), the mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) (10.9 vs 10.8; P = 0.84), and the percentage of penetrating trauma (12.5% vs 13.2%; P = 0.79) were similar. Differences (trauma/critical care vs general surgery, % increase/P value) included average daily census (24 vs 54,225%), cases/attending (262 vs 543, 207%), cases/resident (54 vs 262, 485%), charges/attending ($353,811 vs $471,725,133%), collections/attending ($106,143 vs $165,103, 156%), number of trauma patients (643 vs 748,116%), trauma mortality (7.3% vs 4.0%; P = 0.007), trauma mortality with ISS > 15 (21.7% vs 12.0%; P = 0.035), trauma complications (33.1% vs 17%; P < 0.001), and ICU morbidity (66.8% vs 43.9%; P < .001). The new general surgery model produced superior financial results and better quantitative surgical experience while exceeding trauma and ICU quality outcomes compared to the former trauma/critical care model. These data objectively support a model such as ours-one that is financially sustainable and more professionally attractive.

AB Current patterns of meat consumption are considered to be unsustainable. Sustainable development may require that consumers choose to eat smaller quantities of meat as well as meat that is produced in a more sensible way. A policy tool directed at consumer behaviour is that of enhancing consumer-oriented transparency of the production chain. Transparency is expected to allow people to make more mindful consumption choices, in line with their personal values. As most dietary habits are deeply rooted in the past, an assessment of the effect of transparency on food choices requires a historical perspective to food culture. Such a perspective provides us with at least two trends of relevance to meat consumption: increased concern for animal welfare and an ongoing dissociation of meat front its animal origin. Combined, these two trends may interact to allow people to consume in ways that actually conflict with their personal values: their concern for animal welfare does not translate into corresponding food choices, as the product meat does not remind them of its animal origin. An experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that people sensitive to animal welfare will respond to increased salience of animal origin and of animal welfare, and that they will show this by either avoiding to buy meat or by favouring free range and organic meat. Results confirmed the expected effect. The effect was observed mainly among those with Universalistic values, which limits the ultimate prospects of transparency as a policy tool.

AB Process algebras are indispensable tools in modeling concurrent processes in theoretical computer science. We propose a novel use of process algebra as a back-bone in designing and maintaining complex open distributed information systems. Our pi-calculus approach allows us to create and maintain service based mission oriented tasks with intended behaviors and with support for observing and maintaining mission critical systemic criteria.

AB Age structure, educational level and economic situation of farmers living in Shennongjia National Nature Reserve, Central China, were analyzed. Results showed that the population will increase steadily in the future and that the educational level is very low on the whole. Among people above the school entrance age (seven years old), only 36% had the opportunity to receive highschool education and those who received college education occupied just about 1%. The income of the local farmers was far below the national average number, which was only 1044.4 RMB (RMB: Chinese Currency, 8.3 RMB=1 US$) per capita in 2001, which is only 44.1% of farmers' or 15.1% of citizens' nationwide. Some measures, such as developing featured economies and popularizing effective energy utilization methods, have been proved as successful ways for income growth and environment protection. To cope with the conflicts between community economy development and biodiversity conservation, effective mechanisms, such as Public Compensation, and Community Co-management should be introduced. Sharing favorable policies and reasonably taking advantage of natural resources, the goal of sustainable development of local community economy can be achieved along with the biodiversity conservation.

AB In the life and natural sciences, the concept of thresholds or points or zones of change from one state to another has been investigated since the late 18th century. Over the past three decades, ecologists and economists around the world have been examining the existence and use of 'ecological thresholds' in natural and modified systems, primarily as a conceptual basis for the development of tools to conserve and sustainably manage natural resources. In Australia, there has been a recent renewed interest in the definition and application of ecological thresholds in the conservation of threatened fauna and flora, modelling the impact of habitat loss, modification and fragmentation on terrestrial biota, management of pest plant and animal species, and development of natural resource management policies and plans. This paper reviews the threshold concept from an ecological perspective. It considers the definition, types and behaviour of this phenomenon. The theoretical and empirical evidence for their purported existence is reviewed and their potential utility in biodiversity conservation and natural resource management is discussed, along with key issues relating to their use.

AB Himalayan medicinal plants are threatened by large scale exploitation for trade. Research applicable to their sustainable use is largely lacking. We analyze the effects of different harvesting patterns on the population ecology of two highly threatened Himalayan medicinal plants, Nardostachys grandiflora (Valerianaceae) and Neopicrorhiza scrophulariiflora (Scrophulariaceae), in Shey-Phoksundo National Park and in its buffer zone in northwestern Nepal. We first documented local harvesting approaches of two major user groups, amchi (traditional doctors trained in Tibetan medicine), who harvest plants in a selective manner for local health care purposes, and commercial collectors, who harvest unselectively and at much higher intensity for trade. We then applied the selective harvesting approach of amchi in an experiment to test the effects of different harvesting levels on the population ecology of these two species. These experiments revealed a positive effect of low harvesting levels on plant density, but recruitment and survival rates decreased with increasing harvesting levels. We also analyzed the effect of high harvesting pressure for trade on the population ecology of N. grandiflora. Recruitment and survival rates were higher in N. scrophulariiflora than in N. grandiflora; the latter species is more vulnerable to harvesting than the former. The difference between them in sustainability of harvest is related to differences in their strategies of vegetative reproduction and in harvesting practices associated with these strategies. Management of Himalayan medicinal plants can be improved by taking harvesting patterns, plant life forms and growth patterns into consideration. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainability index was calculated to assess soil quality under the influence of different fertilizer management practices. It is based on the area of the triangle in which nutrient index, microbial index and crop index of soil represented the three vertices of a triangle. Nutrient index reflected the nutrient status of soil and was calculated from the measurements of various soil chemical parameters. Microbial index was calculated by determining various soil microbial and biochemical activities and crop index by measuring of crop yield parameters. Eighteen soil indicators were determined to assess nutrient index, microbial index and crop index in order to compare the effect of different sources of nutrients such as green manure, farmyard manure and chemical fertilizer in a rice/corn-wheat rotation. The indices were applied to assess the sustainability of five field experiments with respect to the different fertilizer treatments. The long-term application of organic manures in rice/corn-wheat cropping system increased the index value because it increased the nutrient index, microbial index and crop index of soils. The use of only chemical fertilizers in the rice-wheat cropping system resulted in poor soil microbial index and crop index. In corn-wheat system, additional application of FYM at 10 t ha(-1) before sowing corn made the system more sustainable than application of 100%NPK; the sustainability index values were 2.43 (the highest for this system) and 0.93, respectively.

AB The main research objective was establishing a simple but reliable methodology for the building design stage that would yield environmentally optimal buildings. A three-step methodology is proposed: (1) design variable grouping-four distinct groups were recognized according to their stage of major influence (production and construction, operational energy, maintenance to demolition, and an Integrated Group relevant to several life cycle stages), (2) generating the within group optimization methodology, and (3) integration.
   This paper presents the methodology developed for the grouping procedure, and its testing and application on a simple generic office module. Sensitivity analysis highlights the significance of electricity production fuel. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Survey of recent developments
SO BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The new government of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) has been performing well relative to the standards of recent governments. The confidence of the business community in Indonesia's near-term future continues to improve, resulting in rapid growth of investment activity, steady gains on the stock market, and a return of private capital inflow. City skylines are again decorated with cranes for the construction of apartment buildings, shopping malls and the like, while expenditure on cars and motorcycles, cell phones and air travel is growing rapidly. The rate of economic growth is now not far below that typically achieved in the Soeharto era.
   Macroeconomic management is broadly on the right track. The budget deficit is small enough not to pose a problem of fiscal sustainability and, although the monetary authority continues to make things difficult for itself by pursuing conflicting targets, prices remain reasonably stable. At the microeconomic level, however, there are still plenty of causes for concern, the most serious of which, perhaps, is the dissipation of Indonesia's current oil price windfall in wasteful and extraordinarily costly subsidies to domestic consumption, notwithstanding the recent increase in domestic fuel prices.
   Little has been achieved in relation to privatisation, and the government has scant enthusiasm for it. Paradoxically, it is encouraging heavy private sector involvement in infrastructure, which would otherwise be provided by state enterprises. Such involvement will be difficult to achieve, partly for the same reasons that privatisation has been hindered, but not least because the government has yet to come to grips with the implications for pricing of infrastructure services if such activities are to be made profitable-a prerequisite for private sector involvement. Problems with infrastructure as they manifest themselves at lower levels of government are illustrated and analysed in this Survey by a short case study of West Java province and its capital city, Bandung.
   There has been a great deal of anti-corruption activity, resulting in several high profile arrests. But this falls far short of what is required to achieve significant improvement in the performance of the public sector, broadly defined, on which healthy and sustained growth of the economy depends heavily. The government has been slow to appoint new people to the top levels of the bureaucracy, and reformist ministers have also been frustrated by civil service rules and regulations that make it exceedingly difficult to appoint the best available individuals to these and other important positions.

AB Registration of births, recording deaths by age, sex and cause, and calculating mortality levels and differentials are fundamental to evidence-based health policy, monitoring and evaluation. Yet few of the countries with the greatest need for these data have functioning systems to produce them despite legislation providing for the establishment and maintenance of vital registration. Sample vital registration (SVR), when applied in conjunction with validated verbal autopsy, procedures and implemented in a nationally representative sample of population clusters represents an affordable, cost-effective, and sustainable short- and medium-term solution to this problem. SVR complements other information sources by producing age-, sex-, and cause-specific mortality data that are more complete and continuous than those currently available. The tools and methods employed in an SVR system, however, are imperfect and require rigorous validation and continuous quality assurance; sampling strategies for SVR are also still evolving. Nonetheless, interest in establishing SVR is rapidly growing in Africa and Asia. Better systems for reporting and recording data on vital events will be sustainable only if developed hand-in-hand with existing health information strategies at the national and district levels; governance structures; and agendas for social research and development monitoring. If the global community wishes to have mortality measurements 5 or 10 years hence, the foundation stones of SVR must be laid today.

ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; CATALYTIC COMBUSTION; OPERATION
AB The idea of using Reverse Flow Reactors (RFR) for methane reduction in exhausts has been well elucidated in the past. However, there are intricacies in such operations to maintain the ignited state of the reactor along with maintaining low:outlet concentrations of methane. This is especially true under rich feed conditions where combustion reactions liberate more heat leading to possible catalyst deactivation. Under favourable conditions, it is possible to continuously extract heat from the RFR system-this is a viable way of maintaining acceptable thermal conditions in the reactor and consequently retaining catalyst activity. This paper elaborate's upon the optimal amount-of heat that can be removed from the system without losing the sustainability while preventing overheating of the catalyst bed. A simple event based control strategy is implemented for switching the inlet and outlet ports (flow reversal). Issues relating to the operation of reverse flow reactors with side feeding and the possibility of extraction of useful heat from such systems are also discussed. Methane combustion reaction and a continuous two dimensional heterogeneous model of the reactor have been employed in this study.

DE water resources planning; urban water management; input-output modeling
AB To support more sustainable development of a region, decision support tools must consider local and global systems level impacts on the economy, environment, and society. Through the development and application of "economic input-output water resources" models for Beijing, China for the years 1985, 1990, and 1992, historical trends related to the economy structure and its water use are investigated. The study finds that the economy of Beijing and water use are highly concentrated in agriculture and heavy industry, but this intensive water use is indirectly reflected in the production of most other goods and services throughout the economy because of the interrelationships among various sectors of the economy. In spite of progress during the time period observed (e.g., between 1985 and 1990 the output of the economy doubled, but water consumption increased only 12% partly because of a significant increase in the price of water in 1988) and given the seriousness of water resources issues in the region, it is critical that future regional development make progress toward a more water-efficient economic system.

TI The sustainable forestry initiative's impact on stumpage markets in the

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH

ID SUPPLY-AND-DEMAND
AB Using survey data and an equilibrium displacement model, we estimate the market and economic impacts of the American Forest and Paper Association's Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) on stumpage markets in the US South. We examine four timber product markets: softwood pulpwood, softwood sawtimber, hardwood pulpwood, and hardwood sawtimber. In each market we calculate changes in producer and consumer welfare using the equilibrium displacement model that accounts for reductions in timber inventories caused by SFI compliance. We find that SFI compliance costs the US South's economy about $36 million annually. SFI-compliant stumpage producers lose more than $33 million each year in producer surplus as a result of SFI compliance, and consumers lose about $12 million annually in consumer surplus due to higher product prices. These costs are offset partially by benefits to nonindustrial private forest producers, non-SFI-compliant industry producers, and public forest producers, who collectively gain about $10 million in producer surplus annually as a result of higher stumpage prices.

AB Retaining organic matter and preventing soil compaction are important factors affecting the sustainability of managed forests. To assess how these factors affect short-term ecosystem dynamics, pre-treatment and 1 year and 5 year post-treatment soil properties and post-treatment tree growth responses were examined in a boreal trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) dominated ecosystem in northeastern British Columbia, Canada. The experiment used a completely randomized design with three levels of organic matter removal (tree stems only; stems and slash; stems, slash, and forest floor) and three levels of soil compaction (none, intermediate (2-cm impression), heavy (5-cm impression)). Removal of the forest floor initially stimulated aspen regeneration and significantly reduced height growth of aspen and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). The compaction treatments had no effect on aspen regeneration density. At year 5, heights of both aspen and white spruce were negatively correlated (r(2) > 0.31, p < 0.0001) with upper mineral soil bulk density and were lowest on forest floor removal treatments, where minimal recovery from compaction was observed. There was some evidence for recovery of soil properties to preharvest conditions where expansion of herbaceous vegetation increased soil organic matter.

AB This paper analyzes a model depicting the trend of Chinese urbanization and explores relationships between urbanization and the supply and demand of major energy and mineral resources and between the gross domestic product (GDP) and the urbanization of China. Then it predicts China's supply and demand trends from 2005 to 2050. It is predicted that until 2010 China's GDP and urbanization will grow at high speed, slowing slightly yet still growing strongly on to 2050. It also argues that the supply of cement, steel, aluminum and coal and the demand of timber, cement and steel have significant effects on urbanization. The paper concludes that China will inevitably face a long shortage of resources if future urbanization is faster than predicted, i.e., China cannot meet the targets of the current urbanization strategy while continuing current energy and resource consumption for its industrialization and modernization.

AB Rapid economic globalization presents major challenges to the sustainable development of 'development zones' in many countries. Development zones in China evolved from the concept of Export Processing Zones (EPZs) in the western world. After China's accession to the World Trade Organisation, however, they have lost their special preferential status to the overseas investors in terms of promotion of industrialization and inward investment. With the changing global and national circumstances, spatial, economic and social transformations are taking place in these development zones. Given the vast number of development zones in China, the successful integration of these development zones into the regional and urban contexts will have great implications on the economic and social development of China. Based upon a case study of Guangzhou Development District (GDD) which is one of the earliest development zones of China, this paper examines the evolution of development zones in the mainland with particular reference to the development problems associated with their urbanisation in recent years. Although this paper primarily focuses on GDD, the findings and discussion will provide insights for other development zones of China in reviewing their development strategies as most of them are sharing similar development problems.

ID POPULATION
AB Management tools are needed to help regulate the international trade in seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora. Given the limited understanding of seahorse population dynamics and fishing mortality, a single minimum size limit for all seahorse species appears to be a useful initial step toward adaptive management, both biologically and socially. We collected data on maximum height and size at first maturity for 32 seahorse species and cross-validated the data with results from an analysis across marine teleosts. A minimum height restriction of 10 cm would permit, based on calculated data, reproduction in 15 species before they recruited to the fishery. Of the remaining 17 species, 16 were essentially not in international trade, were safeguarded under domestic legislation, or were partly protected by this size limit. Only one species, H. kelloggi, was not well served by the 10-cm minimum size limit. The CITES technical committee on animals has now decided to propose this single size limit to all 167 signatory nations as one option toward sustainable trade. Complementary management measures for seahorses are also required, particularly for populations primarily exploited in bycatch.

AB Evaluating logging systems to determine which are most compatible with the maintenance of biodiversity is of prime importance if tropical forests are to be managed in a sustainable way. Bats are model taxa for this purpose. Two different logging systems are used in the natural forest of the Victoria-Mayaro Forest Reserve in Trinidad: open range and periodic block. Open range is a continuous harvesting system and, in common with most methods used to log tropical forests worldwide, has few harvest controls other than girth limits for selected species. Periodic block is a polycyclic system, with felling based on ecological criteria assumed to be compatible with the maintenance of biodiversity. To compare the effects of periodic block and open-range systems on biodiversity, we determined bat species richness and abundance in each system and in primary forest. We caught bats in mist nets set at ground level and in the canopy and in harp traps. In total 1959 individuals representing 38 species were captured Species richness was similar among primary forest and logged forest habitats, although bat diversity was lower in logged forest. The distributions of bat species abundance did not differ significantly between logged forest and primary forest. We found, however, that both logging systems lead to a decrease in gleaning animalivores and an increase in frugivores. The increase in frugivores was likely the result of an increase in the abundance of bat-dispersed pioneer fruiting plants in logged forest. Bats of periodic-block-managed forest were more similar to those of primary forest than those of forest logged using the open-range system, indicating that the periodic-block system is more compatible with the maintenance of bat diversity. Our results support the suggestion that the measured use of tropical forests can largely be compatible with biodiversity conservation.

AB This paper examines the experiences of a community that has successfully sustained its crime prevention through social development activities for over a decade. It explores how a broad philosophical approach to sustainability can be applied to community-based initiatives such as crime prevention. In this regard, traditional situational crime prevention strategies are compared with crime prevention through social development. The evidence from the case study community illustrates the importance for sustainability of such factors as bottom-up decisionmaking, flexibility, inclusion and integration. The findings suggest that crime prevention through social development provides a framework for developing sustainable community-based crime prevention activities. The implications of these findings are considered with respect to the sustainability of other community-based initiatives.

   AGGREGATION
AB In 1992, the Okanagan-Kootenay Sterile Insect Release (SIR) Program was initiated in British Columbia, Canada, to eradicate codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) from its montane, fruit-growing valleys. Widespread damage in 1994, and failure to maintain sterile:wild (S:W) overflooding moth ratios at the 40:1 target in spring, led to intensive use of supplemental insecticides to control spring populations post-1994. During 1995-1999 population control with this modified SIR Program was compared with an alternative strategy to supplement SIR with pheromone-based mating disruption + tree banding in organic orchards. Weekly catches in pheromone traps indicated mean S:W moth ratios in both insecticide- and pheromone-supplemented orchards were near identical in spring, and confirmed ratios were more often suboptimal (< 40:1) in May-June compared with July August. By 1997 no damaged fruit were found in any orchard, and by 1999 no wild moths, nor overwintering larvae were captured in any pheromone-supplemented orchard. However, wild moths and overwintering larvae were still detectable in 15-20% of insecticide-supplemented orchards in 1999. Catches of wild moths and over-wintering larvae declined fastest in SIR orchards supplemented with pheromone and banding. Given sterile moths compete poorly with wild moths in spring when S:W ratios rarely reach target levels, a pheromone + banding program applied in spring, combined with release of sterile moths in summer only, is recommended, especially for organic orchards. A multi-tactic SIR program should reduce codling moth populations at least as effectively as SIR supplemented with insecticides. This approach should ensure sustainable management of codling moth with potential to eliminate wild populations sooner than using sterile moths alone, and possibly their use in combination with neurotoxic insecticides.

AB There is a considerable number of methods available for the development maintenance and surveillance of specific-pathogen-free herds. The selection of a method for a specific remediation project is primarily dependent on the goal, the epidemiology of the agent to be eradicated, the feasibility and the available resources. At the beginning of the remediation programme, methods are required for the classification of the herd status. Clinical and analytical diagnostic tests may be used for individual herds or in an entire area. The interpretation of test results applied within a population deserves special attention. A series of techniques are available - alone or in combination - to remediate a herd that was classified as being infected: systematic treatment, vaccination, elimination of infected individual animals ("test and remove"), partial depopulation or total population (stamping out). These strategies are typically accompanied by cleaning and disinfection. After the remediation, the status of the herd needs to be certified and maintained. For the documentation of the status, monitoring and surveillance strategies such as clinical follow-up visits, notification systems and random sampling can be applied. When planning random surveys, statistical and epidemiological considerations are relevant. For the sustainable maintenance of the pathogen-free status, biosecurity measures at the individual farm level, but also broader approaches such as import restrictions, early warning systems and surveillance programmes are needed. General awareness regarding unusual clinical signs needs to be promoted among farmers and veterinarians. The longer a disease or an agent is absent from a herd or region, the lower becomes the risk awareness. In such a situation, mistakes can occur leading to an increased risk of re-infection.

TI Record selection for nonlinear seismic analysis of structures
SO EARTHQUAKE SPECTRA
LA English
DT Article
AB This study addresses the question of selection and amplitude scaling of accelerograms for predicting the nonlinear seismic response of structures. Despite the current practices of record selection according to a specific magnitude-distance scenario and scaling to a common level, neither aspect of this process has received significant research attention to ascertain the benefits or effects of these practices on the conclusions. This paper hypothesizes that neither these usual principal seismological characteristics nor scaling of records matters to the nonlinear response of structures. It then investigates under what conditions this hypothesis may not be sustainable. Two classes of records sets are compared in several case studies: one class is carefully chosen to represent a specific magnitude and distance scenario, the other is chosen randomly from a large catalog. Results of time-history analyses are formally compared by a simple statistical hypothesis test to assess the difference, if any, between nonlinear demands of the two classes of records. The effect of the degree of scaling (by first-mode spectral acceleration level) is investigated in the same way. Results here show (1) little evidence to support the need for a careful site-specific process of record selection by magnitude and distance, and (2) that concern over scenario-to-scenario record scaling, at least within the limits tested, may not be justified.

AB The effect of habitat destruction on the likelihood of species survival is often estimated based on the assumption that colonization and extinctions are in balance. This assumption is not sustainable in species where the dynamics of colonization and extinctions is slow in relation to landscape changes, such as in most plants.
   Here we use an alternative approach, a realistic, dynamic landscape-level model that does not rely on this assumption. It enables estimation of the effect of habitat destruction using field data on the biology of a species and on real landscape structure. Because our approach relies on direct comparisons of changes in population size and survival probability due to habitat changes, it can be easily extended to other conservation questions, such as assessing the effects of events causing the extinction of populations but allowing for recolonization, or identifying optimal reintroduction strategies.
   We applied this method to a perennial herb, Succisa pratensis, that is a typical grassland species. We combined detailed demographic data with information on the spatial distribution of suitable habitats to model species dynamics in the landscape under different scenarios. The results show that habitat destruction alone has little effect on regional survival. However, the effect of habitat destruction increases when combined with factors causing extinctions of, the existing populations that are expected to play a significant role in the study system. Our results further show that an optimal reintroduction strategy at the landscape level depends on the number of available seeds.
   The approach presented here was designed for studying systems where species colonization-extinction dynamics is slow compared with landscape changes. Such time lags and nonequilibrium dynamics have been suggested to be important features of many ecosystems and life forms, and this approach is thus likely to be useful for a wide range of future studies. The approach also allows the estimation of short-term effects of habitat destruction, i.e., situations that are nonequilibrium by definition. This is never possible with equilibrium models, giving the model a wide applicability for all types of organisms.

AB The paper aims to substantiate the importance of endogenous innovations when evaluating the compatibility of natural resource use and economic development. It explains that technological change has the potential to compensate for natural resource scarcity, diminishing returns to capital, poor input substitution, and material balance restrictions, but is limited by various restrictions like fading returns to innovative investments and rising research costs. It also shows bow innovative activities are fostered by accurate price signals and research-favouring sectoral change. The simultaneous effects of increasing technical knowledge, decreasing resource inputs, and increasing world population largely determine the chances of long-run sustainable development. Consequently, future research has to be directed at a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms driving innovations in the presence of natural resource scarcity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Interactions between climate and the socioeconomic system are investigated with a Multi-Actor Dynamic Integrated Assessment Model (MADIAM) obtained by coupling a nonlinear impulse response model of the climate sub-system (NICCS) to a multi-actor dynamic economic model (MADEM). The core of MADEM describes an economy driven by the opposing forces of business, striving to increase profits by investments in human and physical capital, and the erosion of profits through business competition, enhanced by labour wage pressure. The principal driver of economic growth is the increase in labour productivity (or human capital) generated by endogeneous technological change. In the presence of climate change, these basic interactions are modified by government taxes on CO2 emissions, which are recycled into the economy as various subsidies, by climate-related changes in consumer preferences, and by modified business investment decisions in response to these actions. The combined effect of the climate-response strategies of the different actors determines the form of the induced technological change that ultimately governs the evolution of the coupled climate-socioeconomic system. To clarify the individual roles of the actors, the model is set up in a systems-analytical way, with prescribed control algorithms for the different actors, rather than in the traditional single-actor cost/benefit optimization mode.
   In the reference 'moderate mitigation' scenario, business investments in energy and carbon efficiency, induced by government CO2 taxes, yield the largest contribution to emissions reduction. Direct government mitigation actions through carbon taxes are more effective with regard to both emission reductions and economic growth if a significant fraction of carbon taxes are recycled into investments in energy and carbon efficiency, i.e. into induced technological change. The influence of consumer preferences, often neglected in integrated assessment analyses, can also be effective in guiding business investments. The chosen examples are intended as illustrations rather than to provide quantitative predictions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We ask whether communication can directly substitute for memory in dynastic repeated games in which short lived individuals care about the utility of their offspring who replace them in an infinitely repeated game. Each individual is unable to observe what happens before his entry in the game. Past information is therefore conveyed from one cohort to the next by means of communication.
   When communication is costless and messages are sent simultaneously, communication mechanisms or protocols exist that sustain the same set of equilibrium payoffs as in the standard repeated game. When communication is costless but sequential, the incentives to "whitewash" the unobservable past history of play become pervasive. These incentives to whitewash can only be countered if some player serves as a "neutral historian" who verifies the truthfulness of others' reports while remaining indifferent in the process. By contrast, when communication is sequential and (lexicographically) costly, all protocols admit only equilibria that sustain stage Nash equilibrium payoffs.
   We also analyze a centralized communication protocol in which history leaves a "footprint" that can only hidden by the current cohort by a unanimous "coverup." We show that in this case the set of payoffs that are sustainable in equilibrium coincides with the weakly renegotiation proof payoffs of the standard repeated game.

AB An analytical model is proposed to account for carbon emission behaviour during replacement of power source from fossil fuel to renewable energy in which sustainability of energy supply is stressed. Logistic function of time is assumed for producing renewable power sources. Analyses show that energy payback time (EPT) should be much shorter than the doubling time of manufacturing cycle to secure adequate available energy during, as well as after, the replacement. A nuclear plant, small hydropower plant, wind power plant and photovoltaic cell are taken as representative candidates and investigated as options to replace fossil power until toward the end of this century. Nuclear or small hydropower plants are promising candidates but the photovoltaic cell needs further development efforts to reduce EPT and avoid energy expense after the replacement.

AB From the perspective of energy security and environmental sustainability, the use of currently underutilized residual heavy oil can increase the value and applicability of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power generation systems. In order to utilize such fuel in IGCC applications reliably and effectively, it is essential to understand the phenomena within the gasifier. Therefore, the gasification characteristics of Orimulsion (TM) (registered trademark of BITOR Ltd) were studied using a 2.4 t/d research. The gasifier has many unique measurement devices, such as heat flux probes, sampling devices for hot gas and partially reacted solids, an optical gas analyzer (laser Raman), etc. The gasifier provides a range of performance indicators, such as calorific value of the product gas, cold gas efficiency, carbon conversion efficiency, and the vertical distribution of those results. Gasification reaction mechanisms and the vertical distribution of heat flux, which are required for effective modeling of gasification phenomena, were also studied under various operating conditions. These results are of the form that can be used in the design and operation of actual gasifiers for use with feedstocks like Orimulsion (TM). (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Natural ventilation is of increasing interest in building industry because of recent focus on environmental concern, considered with both comfort and economical criteria. The aim of this study is to investigate how wind may induce natural ventilation, with focus on wind incidence and large scale environment density influences. These parameters modify flows inside and outside buildings. Numerical dynamic simulations are achieved for a standard office building using pressure coefficients obtained from a parametrical model. Simulations allow to describe inside building air flow for three incidences: 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees and three theoretical environments: open, suburban and urban. Originality of this study is to work with both vertical and horizontal pressure coefficient gradients. Results show how important horizontal gradients are in air flow comprehension. Urban wind driven ventilation potential is also discussed. Some words are said on existing tools limitations. The need for further studies is illustrated in order to obtain handy pressure coefficients prediction tools and to optimize openings mechanical regulation. The all study falls under the step of sustainable architecture. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A transport simulation and forecast model is presented, which is designed for the assessment of policy options aiming to achieve sustainability in transportation. Starting from a simulation of the economic behaviour of consumers and producers within a microeconomic optimisation framework and the resulting calculation of the modal split, the allocation of the vehicle stock into vintages and technological groups is modelled. In a third step, a technology-oriented algorithm, which incorporates the relevant state-of-the-art knowledge in Europe, calculates emissions of air Pollutants and greenhouse gases as well as appropriate indicators for traffic congestion, noise and road accidents. The paper outlines the methodology and the basic data sources used in connection with work done so far in Europe, presents the Outlook according to a 'reference case' run for the 15 current European Union Member States Lip to 2030, displays aggregate results from a number of alternative scenarios and outlines elements of future work.

AB The aim of this paper is to offer Suggestions when it comes to near-term technology policies for long-term climate targets based on some insights into the nature of technical change. We make a distinction between economy wide e and technology specific policy instruments and put forward two key hypotheses: (i) Near-term carbon targets such as the Kyoto protocol can be met by economy wide price instruments (carbon taxes, or a cap-and-trade system) changing the technologies we pick from the shelf (higher energy efficiency in cars. buildings and industry, wind, biomass for heat and electricity, natural gas instead of coal, solar thermal, etc.). (ii) Technology specific policies are needed to bring new technologies to the shelf. Without these new technologies, stricter emission reduction targets may be considered impossible to meet by the government, industry and the general public, and therefore not adopted. The policies required to bring these more advanced technologies to the shelf are more complex and include increased public research and development, demonstration, niche market creation, support for networks within the new industries, standard settings and infrastructure policies (e.g., when it comes to hydrogen distribution). There is a risk that the society in its quest for cost-efficiency in meeting near-term emissions targets, becomes blindfolded when it comes to the more difficult, but equally important issue of bringing more advanced technologies to the shelf. The paper presents mechanisms that cause technology look in, how these very mechanisms can be used to get out of the current "carbon lock-in" and the risk with premature lock-ins into new technologies that do not deliver what they currently promise. We then review certain climate policy proposals with regards to their expected technology impact, and finally we present a let-a-hundred-bloom strategy for the next couple of decades.

TI Indigenous forest management in 21st-century New Zealand: towards
   a'postproductivist' indigenous forest-farmland interface?
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
LA English
DT Article
ID POST-PRODUCTIVISM; PRIVATE LAND; LANDSCAPES; AUSTRALIA
AB The critique of indigenous forest management in New Zealand in this paper contextualises the discussion in light of recent Eurocentric debates on the transition towards 'postproductivist' and,'multifunctional' agricultural and forestry regimes. The research findings confirm recent criticisms of Australian writers with regard to the direct transferability of the notion of a transition towards postproductivism developed by European researchers and also lend support to Holmes's (2002) notion of productivist and postproductivist occupance. Long-standing productivist demands continue to be made on New Zealand's indigenous forests, especially from economically marginalised stakeholder groups who depend on the continuation of logging for economic survival. We argue that the tension between the recent adoption of a 'postproductivist' conservation policy at government level and the continuing 'productivist' attitudes among some stakeholder groups explains why the protection of remaining indigenous forests continues to be contested. The New Zealand findings also provide further evidence for those persons criticising the implied linearity and dualism inherent in the Eurocentric postproductivist transition model. We argue that processes at the New Zealand forest - farmland interface support Wilson's (2001) notion of a territorialisation of productivist and postproductivist territories into a, 'multifunctional' territory. From a social constructionist perspective, the results highlight the fact that a clear separation into productivist and postproductivist occupance may not be easy to conceptualise as our view of agricultural land as 'productivist' territory and unlogged or sustainably managed indigenous forest as 'postproductivist' territory is largely based on a Euro-American 'deep green' view of unaltered 'nonhuman' nature. This supports Mather's (2001) suggestion that postproductivism should be cast as part of a shifting mode of social regulation of forestry with particular stakeholder groups constructing images of nature according to their interests, and where western ideas of nature as a (postproductivist) wilderness embody cultural politics which arguably serve to marginalise the interests of indigenous communities.

TI The challenge of governance in regional waste planning
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Over the last 15 years profound changes have taken place within the policy and institutional context of strategic planning for waste management in the United Kingdom. In addition to the significant influence of the sustainability discourse on policy innovation and the reconfiguration of institutional arrangements and policy networks, there have been growing political and public interest, and tensions, in the regionalisation of waste management, as represented by the establishment of the Regional Technical Advisory Bodies (RTABs) for waste. Drawing on concepts developed within urban-regime theory and debates on institutional capacity building, the authors argue that if RTABs are to be seen as a new form of governance for waste planning, the development of their capacity to meet the challenge of 'collective action' depends on the quality of their governance relations and, in particular, on the existence and amplification of four forms of capital: intellectual, social, material, and political. The first stage of the research which, by the time of writing (April 2004), included around sixty semistructured interviews with RTAB members throughout the English regions, has identified a number of potential barriers and enablers that affect the ability of RTABs to develop such a capacity. In conclusion, the authors provide an overall assessment of RTABs and draw a tentative picture of their possible future.

AB Urban development is a high priority in Egypt. New Minia City, located on the eastern bank of the Nile River, approximately 250 km south of Cairo, is one of 16 new development communities. Urban development in New Minia City may encounter several geo-environmental problems. Karst conditions and structural features in the local heterogeneous bedrock limit its suitability for constructional purposes. In this research, suitability of the area for urban development was assessed using a geographic information systems (GIS)-based approach. A weighted GIS model that incorporated land use/cover, types of soil, karst feature distribution, fracture densities, slopes, distances to major faults and streams, road network, and city boundaries was established to create a map of site suitability for the city. Model weights were developed using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach. Current urban land use within New Minia City falls into four classes of suitability. Approximately 7 percent of the area built by 2002 is in the low suitability class, which suggests that the map of site suitability can serve as a reliable base for planning sustainable development in New Minia City. The developed map of site suitability is effective for assessing and revealing ratings of suitability for urban development. Furthermore, the map of suitability provides the foundation for informed decision making in the development of New Minia City.

AB Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is the most important insect defoliator of potatoes worldwide. In this study, we conducted a series of no-choice assays comparing Colorado potato beetle reproduction and development on potato plants grown in manure-amended and synthetically fertilized soils. Manure-amended soil received annual applications of raw cow manure since 1991 and additional applications of cull potato compost and green manure between 1991 and 1998. Plants grown in manure-amended soil were inferior Colorado potato beetle hosts compared with plants grown in synthetically fertilized soil. The observed negative effects were broad in scope. Female fecundity was lower in field cages set up on manure-amended plots early in the season, although it later became comparable between the treatments. Fewer larvae survived past the first instar, and development of immature stages was slowed down on manure-amended plots. In the laboratory, first instars consumed less foliage from plants grown in manure-amended soils. These results show that organic Soil management is associated with plant characteristics unfavorable for beetle reproduction and development, which should be taken into consideration when designing fully integrated crop management systems.

AB The sound development of city-regions presents a major planning challenge, as these regions are and will be the living spaces for the majority of the population. Therefore, a key question is how cityregions can be managed so that they develop in a sustainable way. Although Environmental Impact Assessment, Integrated Assessment, and other currently used approaches provide significant inputs for managing transition-processes towards sustainability, they must be extended to respond to three major deficiencies, which are (i) using lists of isolated indicators, (ii) not performing a consistency analysis of the targets to be achieved, and (iii) not utilizing the potential of transdisciplinary approaches. The authors present an approach to constructing Sustatinability Solution Spaces for Decision-Making (SSP). This approach fulfils the systemic, normative, and procedural requirements of an appropriate sustainability assessment as elaborated in the technical literature. It provides a consistent set of targets considering the systemic relations among the indicators representing the city-region. This gives the decision-makers a concise guideline for sustainable decisions and makes them aware of the synergistic and contradictory effects of their decisions. The modular tool is first depicted as a general procedure and later differentiated into two transdisciplinary approaches, a participatory and an expert approach. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW

DT Article
DE environmental assessment follow-up; citizen participation; citizen-based
   monitoring; local knowledge; integrated approaches
AB In Canada, many project proponents and planners in the public and private sectors are required to forecast and minimize the adverse environmental effects of their undertakings. However, environmental assessments have traditionally been weak in the areas of planning and conducting effective monitoring, encouraging public participation, integrating social and ecological considerations, encouraging environmental rehabilitation and enhancement, and examining cumulative effects of multiple projects. This paper attempts to address these deficiencies together by drawing from theory and practice in citizen-based monitoring, in the interests of sustainable livelihoods, using local knowledge. Informed by case study research in several regions of Canada, the discussion focuses on opportunities for using citizen-based approaches to broad and continuing regional monitoring as a foundation for the project-centred work that is the usual concern of environmental assessment follow-up. Such approaches have advantages beyond the usual expectations of project-centred monitoring and beyond the conventional arguments for increasing local involvement in environmental assessments. However, there are also challenges including those of integrating local and conventional (or scientific) knowledge systems, addressing concerns about the credibility and biases of citizens and project proponents, ensuring attention to broader sustainability goals such as increased stewardship and civility, and developing practical ways of coordinating and funding integrated and participatory monitoring programs. The concluding recommendations call for a dramatically different approach to follow-up activities on the part of private and public project proponents, as well as novel thinking for environmental assessment practitioners.

AB Aid agencies, like commercial businesses, are increasingly concerned with incorporating sound environmental management into their operations. Different approaches are being used to integrate sustainability into development assistance to ensure that environmental impacts are assessed and managed. One approach being used by AusAID, the Australian aid agency, is to implement an environmental management system (EMS) across program and project areas. This paper examines how AusAID has adapted the EMS approach to suit aid agency operations, and some of the lessons from the Australian experience. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW

DE sustainability indices; urban managers; Chinese cities
AB This research in four medium-sized Chinese cities aims at measuring urban sustainability in China and focuses on three issues. First, the situation in these four cities with regard to urban sustainability is evaluated. Secondly, a number of relations between different aspects of urban sustainability is explored. Finally, it is indicated how urban managers can improve with sustainability indices as tools currently ineffective urban management practices. Although all four cities are moving towards sustainable development, the current situation shows still weak sustainability in three, and even non-sustainability in one city. The social and, in particular, the economic dimensions of urban sustainability make significant positive contributions to overall urban sustainability. However, the decline of natural resources and environmental degradation are influencing it negatively It is therefore suggested that more priority should be assigned to urban environmental protection and management in China. The fundamental reason for environmental degradation is believed to be inefficient urban management. To implement effective urban management in China, there is an urgent need to redefine the role of local government, reform local organizational structure, enhance local participatory institutional capacity, properly distribute the urban welfare, and thus integrate economic, social and environmental objectives local strategic and action plans.

AB Land resource sustainability for urban development characterizes the problem of decision-making with multiplicity and uncertainty. A decision support system prototype aids in the assessment of incremental land development plan proposals put forth within the long-term community priority of a sustainable growth. Facilitating this assessment is the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a multicriteria evaluation and decision support system. The decision support system incorporates multiple sustainability criteria, weighted strategically responsive to local public policy priorities and community-specific situations and values, while gauging and directing desirable future courses of development. Furthermore, the decision support system uses a GIS, which facilitates an assessment of urban form with multiple indicators of sustainability as spatial criteria thematically. The resultant land-use sustainability scores indicate, on the ratio-scale of AHP, whether or not a desirable urban form is likely in the long run, and if so, to what degree. The two alternative modes of synthesis in AHP-ideal and distributive-provide assessments of a land development plan incrementally (short-term) and city-wide pattern comprehensively (long-term), respectively. Thus, the spatial decision support system facilitates proactive and collective public policy determination of land resource for future sustainable urban development.

AB The Montreal Process was formed in 1994 to develop an internationally agreed upon set of criteria and indicators for the conservation and sustainable management of temperate and boreal forests. In response to this initiative, the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) and Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) programs of the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service have implemented soil measurements as part of a national monitoring program to address specific questions related to the conservation of soil and water resources. Integration of soil assessments into the national FIA program provides for systematic monitoring of soil properties across all forested regions of the U.S. using standardized collection, laboratory, and statistical procedures that are compatible with existing forest inventory data. The resulting information will provide quantitative benchmarks for regional, national, and international reporting on sustainable forest management and enhance our understanding of management effects on soil quality. This paper presents an overview of the FIA soil monitoring program, outlines the field and laboratory protocols as currently implemented, and provides examples of how these data may be used to assess indicators of sustainable management as defined by the Montreal Process.

ID POLICY INSTRUMENTS
AB This article assesses the possibility of implementing biodiversity policies using voluntary, informative policy instruments. The case is the Swedish forest sector, a policy area where vital national economic interests as well as important ecological values are at stake. The results show that informative policy instruments affect the behaviour of forest owners by providing advice and raising awareness but do not change underlying values and preferences. Sustainability through good advice is an important practice with limited effects, at least in the short run. Private regulations (certifications) have a relatively powerful influence on forest owners and complement the public informative policy instruments, implying that the forest sector can be depicted as private governance with government.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY

ID ISOSTERIC HEAT; GAS
AB Determination of the adsorption properties of novel activated carbons is important to develop new air quality control technologies that can solve air quality problems in a more environmentally sustainable manner. Equilibrium adsorption capacities and heats of adsorption are important parameters for process analysis and design. Experimental adsorption isotherms were thus obtained for relevant organic vapors with activated carbon fiber cloth (ACFC) and coal-derived activated carbon adsorbents (CDAC). The Dubinin-Astakhov (DA) equation was used to describe the adsorption isotherms. The DA parameters were analytically and experimentally shown to be temperature independent. The resulting DA equations were used with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to analytically determine the isosteric heat of adsorption (Delta H-s) of the adsorbate-adsorbent systems studied here. ACFCshowed higher adsorption capacities for organic vapors than CDAC. Delta H-s values for the adsorbates were independent of the temperature for the conditions evaluated. Delta H-s values for acetone and benzene obtained in this study are comparable with values reported in the literature. This is the first time that AHs values for organic vapors and these adsorbents are evaluated with an expression based on the Polanyi adsorption potential and the ClausiusClapeyron equation.

AB The shoot fly, Atherigona soccata is an important pest of sorghum, and host plant resistance is one of the most effective components for managing this pest. Most of the hybrids grown in India based on milo cytoplasm (A(1) cytoplasm) are highly susceptible to shoot fly. Therefore, the present studies were undertaken to evaluate different male-sterile cytoplasms (CMS) for their relative susceptibility to sorghum shoot fly. Oviposition and deadheart formation were significantly lower on the maintainer lines as compared to the corresponding male-sterile lines. Among the cytoplasms tested, A(4)M cytoplasm showed antixenosis for oviposition and suffered lower deadheart formation than the other cytoplasms tested. The A(4)G(1) and A(4)M cytoplasms suffered lower deadhearts in tillers than the other cytoplasms. Recovery following shoot fly damage in A(4)M, A(3), and A(2) cytoplasms was better than in the other cytoplasms tested. The larval and pupal periods were longer and male and female pupal weights lower in A(4)M and A(4)VzM CMS backgrounds compared to the other CMS systems. Fecundity and antibiosis indices on CMS lines were lower than on the B-lines. The A(4)M cytoplasm was found to be relatively resistant to sorghum shoot fly, and can be exploited for developing shoot fly-resistant hybrids for sustainable crop production in future.

AB A detailed analysis of the major results of investigations into the main directions of soil science performed in 2000-2004 is given. It is shown that soil science as a multiple-discipline natural science plays the key role in the system of ecological sciences of the 21st century. The need for further advance and practical use of the methods of landscape-adaptive agriculture and sustainable land management is emphasized. The major challenges and priority tasks of further investigations are outlined. It is argued that the existing system of land management and assessment of soil resources at the federal, regional, and local levels should be improved.

AB The soils on different elements of the artificial relief (small ridges and ditches) were studied. These elements appeared from the demarcation of land plots in the area of the town of Kitei long ago. High tanning standards ensuring the sustainable use of the soil resources were established in the Kitei region at that time. Strip cropping was practiced on the decapitated (without their upper layers) chernozems between the ridges. The natural potential of the soil formation was directed towards an increase in the thickness of the humus horizons of these soils. This process was synchronous with the agricultural development of the region.

AB The efficiency of the respiratory system presents significant limitations on the body's ability to perform exercise due to the effects of the increased work of breathing, respiratory muscle fatigue, and dyspnoea. Respiratory muscle training is an intervention that may be able to address these limitations, but the impact of respiratory muscle training on exercise performance remains controversial. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the effects of a 12-week (10 sessions week(-1)) concurrent inspiratory and expiratory muscle training (CRMT) program in 34 adolescent competitive swimmers. The CRMT program consisted of 6 weeks during which the experimental group (E, n=17) performed CRMT and the sham group ( S, n=17) performed sham CRMT, followed by 6 weeks when the E and S groups performed CRMT of differing intensities. CRMT training resulted in a significant improvement in forced inspiratory volume in 1 s (FIV1.0) (P = 0.050) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( FEV1.0) (P=0.045) in the E group, which exceeded the S group's results. Significant improvements in pulmonary function, breathing power, and chemoreflex ventilation threshold were observed in both groups, and there was a trend toward an improvement in swimming critical speed after 12 weeks of training (P=0.08). We concluded that although swim training results in attenuation of the ventilatory response to hypercapnia and in improvements in pulmonary function and sustainable breathing power, supplemental respiratory muscle training has no additional effect except on dynamic pulmonary function variables.

TI Policy needs to improve marine capture fisheries management and to
   define a role for marine protected areas in Indonesia
SO FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE fisheries management; Indonesia; Maximum Sustainable Yield;
   overexploitation; policy
AB Management of Indonesia's marine capture fisheries faces a huge dilemma: evidence suggests that most, if not all, of Indonesia's capture fisheries are fully or overexploited, but the fishery sector is still expected to contribute to the increase of Indonesia's gross national product (GNP) through an increase in total catches. Furthermore, the current practice of using catch-effort data and Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) models to inform Indonesia's fisheries policies is flawed, putting sustainability and long-term profitability of Indonesia's fisheries at risk. It is argued that the following shift in capture fisheries management policy must be achieved to ensure the survival of Indonesia's fish stocks and fisheries:
   1 a shift in fisheries policy from development-oriented management towards management for sustainability;
   2 acceptance by fisheries managers that 'untapped resources' may not exist or cannot be exploited profitably;
   3 acceptance by fisheries managers that any transfer of fishing effort between fishing grounds may contribute to collapse of local fisheries;
   4 a shift in fisheries management from MSY models to eco-system based management, wherein Marine Protected Areas should play an important role.

TI The Patagonian toothfish fishery in Falkland islands' waters
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Patagonian toothfish; fishery stock; Falkland Islands
ID CONSERVATION; OCEAN
AB This paper examines and provides updated information on the status of toothfish stocks within Falkland Islands conservation zones and also provides a historical perspective of the fishery. The Patagonian toothfish has been taken as a bycatch since the trawl fishery was established in the Falkland Islands. However, specialised exploitation of the Patagonian toothfish started with the opening of the Falkland Islands Outer Conservation Zone (FOCZ) in 1994 when demersal longliners started to target this species at depths of greater than 600 in. When compared to trawlers, analysis showed that longline catches were higher in weight but not numbers. Generally longline catches comprised fish of greater than their length at 50% maturity whereas this situation is rare in catches taken by trawlers. Longliner CPUE peaked in the first year of the fishery and gradually declined until 2000-2001 after which it remained relatively stable with a small increase in 2003-2004. The latter is attributed to a strong year class born in 1994. Toothfish recruitment in the Falkland Islands was found to be very variable. Strong year classes seem to occur every 4-5 years. The mean size of toothfish has decreased since the onset of the longline fishery. This decrease mainly occurred between 1994 and 1999, since then the size of toothfish in catches has remained relatively stable. Fox and Schaefer production models show a strong decline in biomass with the current stock size at about 50% of its unexploited state. It is concluded that the fishery is still just within its limits of sustainable use. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A field study of age, growth and mortality of the "boga" Leporinus obtusidens (Valencietines, 1847) was carried out in the Yacyreta Reservoir, High Parana River, Argentina. We compared age-structure, length-weight relationships and condition factor coefficients in phases previous (1990-1994) and subsequent (1995-1998) to the reservoir filling. In addition, we estimated total and natural mortality, as well as the growth and yield parameters for the whole study period. Comparisons were carried out in four sampling points within the river main channel. Fish were sampled monthly with nine gillnets ranging from 40 to 160 mm of total mesh opening (opposed knots). A scale study showed an age range comprised between 1 and 13 years, with ages 4 and 5 the most abundant before reservoir filling, whereas ages 2 and 3 were more frequent afterward. The weight-standard length relationship showed a higher growth during the second phase of reservoir filling. Maximum condition factor was registered before the spawning period (August and September), being higher after the impoundment, and particularly in the sampling site located within the reservoir. The von Bertalanffy growth coefficient. K. reached 0.12 in both sexes, while the asymptotic length, L-infinity, was 578 and 547 mm. in females and males, respectively. Natural mortality according to Pauly's equation reached 0.178 year(-1), and the total mortality was 0.36 year(-1). The Beverton and Holt yield per recruitment (Y/R) was estimated as 246.54 g, with a maximum sustainable yield of 249.00 g. This result Suggests that the species, had higher condition after impoundment and is fished near its maximum capacity in the reservoir. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SURPLUS PRODUCTION
AB This study develops a state-space modeling and Bayesian approach to a biomass dynamic model of green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) in British Columbia, Canada. The objective is to determine limit and target reference points for harvest quota options for this fishery, and to assess the degree of risk associated with these target reference points (in which risk is defined as the probability that the target reference point will include the limit reference point when all uncertainties are considered). These uncertainties include random variability both in catch per unit effort and in annual biomass dynamics, and uncertainties in catch and effort data in the developing years of this fishery. In addition, the approach uses fishery-independent survey data as auxiliary information to index green urchin population abundance. Compared with the traditional methods of fitting the biomass dynamic model, this new approach incorporates more realistic error structures. The resulting probability distribution for the limit reference point (maximum sustainable yield, MSY) is likely to reflect the true uncertainties about MSY more closely, and can be used to measure the risk of exceeding MSY for setting fishing quotas for this green urchin stock. It is concluded that the current practice of selecting target reference points for this population at 25-50% of MSY has a probability of including the limit reference point (MSY) of <2.5%.

AB There is evidence that the challenges of complying with stricter food safety and quality standards are acting to exclude small-scale producers from export supply chains for high-value agricultural products. The case of Hortico Agrisystems illustrates the considerable challenges and costs faced by supermarket suppliers in sourcing from a broad base of small-scale producers in the context of evolving food safety and quality standards. While small-scale producers are able to achieve levels of compliance at least equal to those of large-scale producers, multi-tiered and dynamic systems of control are required to maintain control. These need to include measures that facilitate compliance, incentives to reward good performance and penalties to punish non-compliance. In establishing a sustainable supply system in this context, both exporters and small-scale producers face a steep learning curve in adjusting to new requirements, further emphasising the need for supply chains to be responsive to change.

AB We developed a methodology to analyze the effects of management practices on landscape structure and function to be used in the assessment of sustainability in intensively managed forest landscapes. It is based on modeling and simulation of landscape and stand structure as well as biological and physical processes. The methodology includes a landscape structure model and several forest stand-level models to simulate the dynamics of landscapes and stands as a function of management rules. It also includes habitat models to evaluate landscape quality and spatial characteristics of vertebrate habitat, and a hydrologic model to simulate water and sediment yield at the subarea and watershed levels. The application of this methodology to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) program in eastern Texas indicated that this is an effective way to evaluate effects of sustainable forestry programs on landscape structure and processes. During simulation years, the habitat of pine warbler, the species used, as an example to illustrate the methodology, became apparently fragmented under the SFI scenario. This fragmentation was caused mainly by narrow, forested streamside management zones dissecting pine stands and should have little negative influence on the pine warbler habitat. Sediment yield at the landscape level decreased by the implementation of SFI measures, particularly by the reduction of channel degradation.

DT Article
ID ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN; ECOLOGICAL PARADIGM; BEHAVIOR; ATTITUDES;

AB This paper examines green consumption in the context of an increasing focus on sustainable lifestyles. The authors argue that green buying must be seen in the context of wider debates surrounding the development of sustainable ways of living that incorporate other environmental actions in an holistic conceptualisation of sustainable lifestyles. This framework is operationalised in a study of environmental action in and around the home, in which 1600 households in Devon were asked questions concerning their everyday environmental actions. These results were manipulated so as to investigate how the different behaviours related to each other and also whether different groups of individuals could be identified, conforming to different lifestyles. The results suggest that conventional forms of green consumption can indeed be related to other forms of environmental action and that at least four different types of environmentalist can be identified. The implications of these results for policy makers are discussed at the end of the paper. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID MANAGEMENT IMPACTS; ORCHARD; SUSCEPTIBILITY
AB To decrease the unfavorable effects of herbicides on human health and on the environment, new sustainable mulching methods have been developed. These methods aim to impede weed growth and also result in good yield and high fruit quality. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of the replacement of conventional methods (chemical treatments or mechanical) with different groundcover material systems (GCMSs) that use aluminum, bark and black polypropylene on 'Aroma' apple (Malus domestica) fruit maturity and quality, and fruit resistance to bruising and decay. The experiment was carried out from 1995 to 2001. Compared with conventional mulching methods, aluminum mulching was found to control annual weeds more effectively, to increase soil temperature, light reflection, yield, and fruit weight, to decrease bruise occurrence, to intensify and saturate the red coloration of apples, and to increase firmness and acid and sugar contents, resistance to storage disorders and decay after storage and shelf life. The other two used GCMSs, bark and black polypropylene also influenced many yield and quality parameters. However, less positive influences on the different parameters were found for bark compared with aluminum, and the use of black propylene was not favorable compared with the conventional mulching methods. Generally, decreased starch content at early picking dates was found for apples grown with GCMSs, indicating an earlier ripening for these apples compared with apples grown with a conventional mulching system. In summary, aluminum mulching was found to be the best alternative mulching method for production of 'Aroma' apples.

SO HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL

ID SAFE YIELD; RESOURCES
AB Sustainability and sustainable pumping are two different concepts that are often used interchangeably. The latter term refers to a pumping rate that can be maintained indefinitely without mining an aquifer, whereas the former term is broader and concerns such issues as ecology and water quality, among others, in addition to sustainable pumping. Another important difference between the two concepts is that recharge can be very important to consider when assessing sustainability, but is not necessary to estimate sustainable pumping rates. Confusion over this distinction is made worse by the Water Budget Myth, which comprises the mistaken yet persistent ideas that (1) sustainable pumping rates cannot exceed virgin recharge rates in aquifers, and (2) that virgin recharge rates must therefore be known to estimate sustainable pumping rates. Analysis of the water balance equation shows the special circumstances that must apply for the Water Budget Myth to be true. However, due to the effects recharge is likely to have on water quality, ecology, socioeconomic factors, and, under certain circumstances, its requirement for numerical modeling, it remains important in assessments of sustainability.

TI A reactive flow model of the geothermal reservoir Waiwera, New Zealand

DE coastal aquifer; conceptual models; numerical modeling; salt-water;
   fresh-water relations; thermal conditions
AB A numerical model of the complex interaction between fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical reactions of the shallow, coastal, hydrothermal system of Waiwera (New Zealand) is used to test the proposed conceptual model of the field.
   Due to declining water levels, resulting from over-exploitation during the 1970s, the objective here was to set up a coupled fluid flow and heat transfer model to help in enabling a predictive and sustainable use of the resource. The presented conceptual model of the area is based on hydraulic, thermal, and chemical field observations, which date back as far as 1863. The numerical simulations were carried out with the reactive transport code SHEMAT.
   The inflow of geothermal water at the bottom of the reservoir prevents seawater from entering the aquifer. If seawater intrusion occurs, it is due to over-exploitation and happens in the upper parts of the aquifer. This is in contrast to common seawater-freshwater interfaces where seawater intrudes at the bottom. The numerical investigations emphasize that, after modifications of the production regime in the late 1980s, the system is recovering again.
   Additionally, geochemical calculations have been conducted to answer the question if dissolution or precipitation reactions might change the hydraulic properties of the geothermal aquifer. Mixing of fresh, geothermal, and seawater, although each of them in thermodynamic equilibrium with calcite, lead to calcite precipitation or dissolution. Nevertheless, the simulations show that the hydraulic properties of the aquifer are not significantly affected by dissolution or precipitation.

AB A field experiment was conducted during 1998-2002 at the Central Sericultural Research and Training Institute, Berhampore (West Bengal), under tainted, Gangetic alluvial soil conditions, to study the effect of integrated nutrient packages on growth characters, leaf yield, leaf quality, N, P and K uptake by leaves in mulberry (Mortis alba L.) utilizing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculated 'S1' mulberry saplings, Azotobacter chroococcum, Eichhornia compost, green manuring with Sesbania rostrata and Crotalaria juncea L., leguminous cover crop with cowpea [ Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and rice bean [Vigna umbellata (Thunb.) Ohwi & H. Ohasi] and 2 levels of nitrogen and potassium and I level of phosphorus. Significant differences were observed among the treatments for plant height, branches/plant, leaves/plant, leaf area, leaf yield, leaf moisture, total soluble sugar, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium uptake in leaf except total soluble protein. Season x treatment and year x treatment interactions were also found significant except for total soluble protein and total soluble sugar content in leaves. However, branches/plant, leaves/plant, leaf yield, leaf area, leaf moisture, total phosphorus and potassium uptake by leaves were found moderate owing to application of recommended dose of N, P and K. The leaf quality did not exhibit much variation among the treatments and controls. However, some of the important quality parameters recorded maximum values in different treatments in comparison with the controls. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculated 'S1' mulberry saplings planted at 90 cm x 90 cm spacing with 45 cm and 60 cm pruning height in alternate crop along with green manuring with Crotalaria juncea during rainy season, leguminous cover crop with Vigna umbellata during the winter season and application of 50% of recommended doses of N and P and full dose of K significantly increased plant height (124.41 cm), branches/plant (7.49), leaf yield (9.71 tonnes/ha/year), total soluble sugar (43.14 mg/g fresh weight) and total soluble protein (20.54 mg/g fresh weight) content in the leaf and N (52.35 kg/ha/year), P (7.56 kg/ ha/year) and K (29.89 kg/ha/year) uptake by leaves. In addition, the leaf yield increased by 13.57% and the expenditure of mulberry cultivation was reduced by 31.89%.

ID HEALTH-SERVICES; CARE
AB Introduction. The logic of paying more for high-quality care and less for low-quality resonates. Increasingly health system leaders worldwide acknowledge that payment reforms are needed to do just that, prompted no doubt by the growing body of evidence indicating that quality is not what it should be.
   Purpose. This review was undertaken to explore contexts in which quality-based payment appears feasible. The ultimate intent is to provoke thoughtful debate about whether and how quality-based payment might fit within a particular developing country's framework of policies to ensure and promote quality of care.
   Methods. With guidance from key informants with first-hand knowledge of international quality- based payment schemes, a purposive sample of six quality- based payment schemes was assembled. Schemes were examined to identify environmental contexts and design features.
   Results. Examples illustrate a variety of approaches and a breadth of contexts in which quality- based payment has been implemented. Contrary to what might be expected, implementation does not appear to be constrained to private-sector purchasers, private-sector providers, hospital settings, nor to any particular type of underlying payment system. Further, quality- based payment pioneers are using a variety of incentive structures, and are tapping a rich mix of structural, process, and outcome standards to benchmark quality.
   Conclusion. Despite significant operational challenges, quality- based payment has been implemented in developing as well as developed countries, albeit not frequently in either instance. What we do not know - what the literature is nearly silent on relates to the sustainability and ultimate impact of alternative incentive schemes.

AB BACKGROUND: Efforts to intensify global tuberculosis (TB) control are limited by difficulties in coordinating with private doctors. More than half of Indian TB patients may initially consult a private provider, but many are neither diagnosed accurately nor treated effectively. We established and evaluated a public-private partnership based on surveillance of TB detected in private laboratories and use of standardised directly observed treatment regimens.
   METHODS: in one district, the governmental TB control programme offered training in microscopy to all large private sector laboratories, and educated private physicians on the importance of microscopy for TB diagnosis. We reviewed records from participating private laboratories and all publicly diagnosed patients.
   RESULTS: Of 2328 pulmonary TB patients registered from July 2001 to December 2002, 404 (17%) were detected in the private sector. The annual new AFB-positive case notification rate increased by 21%, from 27.8/ 100 000 in 2000 to 33.5/100000 in 2002. Surveillance at private laboratories found an additional 260 nonregistered AFB-positive patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: This public-private partnership substantially increased TB case detection and established a sustainable framework for private sector involvement in TB control. In the setting of a strong public sector programme, the combination of active surveillance of private laboratories along with physician sensitisation is a promising approach to improve TB case detection.

AB Governments across the globe are increasingly utilizing credit guarantee schemes to support SMEs. This article fills a gap in the academic literature for developing countries by reviewing the effectiveness of the New Principal Guarantee Scheme (NPGS) offered by the Credit Guarantee Corporation (CGC) in Malaysia. Using a variety of research methods, the authors investigate whether the CGC has achieved its objectives of generating finance and economic additionality without placing its financial resources under undue strain or jeopardizing its relationships with participating financial institutions. It is almost impossible to establish 'definitive' measures of additionality yet our findings provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the CGC is not meeting all of its objectives. The authors put forward an integrated package of measures designed to enhance the effectiveness of the NPGS.

DE co-responsibility; precaution; public policy; sustainable development
ID PRINCIPLE; SCIENCE; UNCERTAINTY
AB In regulatory practice, the principle of precaution is hardly linked to the ideal of sustainable development. In this article, we argue that it should be. We argue that sustainable development is the sense of an ethics of co-responsibility, while precaution is the attitude needed to realize this sense. From this perspective, we comment on some regulatory practices within the European context regarding authorization requests for deliberate releases of genetically modified crops and show some problems that are popping up there, for example, the difficulties in interpreting the meaning of harm" (and of benefit"), the symptomatic gap between regulatory rule and political practice. Finally, we suggest that, in order to respond to such problems, precaution should find an appropriate translation in the fields of both research and innovation policy, of authorization policy and of economic policy.

SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE

DT Article
AB The UK rural economy is increasingly driven by consumption-based demands rather than by productive land use. Such demands have been an influence on rural land use for many hundreds of years, but a range of factors, including greater wealth and mobility, have reinforced a long-standing trend for the rural economy to be consumption driven. A number of recent economic analyses and more anecdotal sources are used to furnish evidence of the importance of new consumption demands. It is argued that such demands may impact directly on land markets through land purchase for amenity, etc. and indirectly through bringing affluent people into closer proximity to diversified business opportunities. It is argued that these new economic realities are the dominant drivers of economic change and that their recognition might suggest new approaches to the support of strategies to deliver more sustainable rural development.

AB 1. Marine protected areas are increasingly being recommended as an essential component of the management of exploited marine species, but virtually no attention has been given to the influence of parasites. This may be substantial, as a primary effect of marine reserves is to increase the density of an exploited population within the reserve relative to outside the reserve, which may facilitate parasite transmission.
   2. We used a simple deterministic model of microparasitic infection in a fishery with a reserve to investigate equilibrium yield and parasite prevalence inside and outside the reserve as a function of three control variables: the proportion of habitat inside the reserve, fishing mortality and the rate of interchange between the stock and the reserve.
   3. While our model is generic, we parameterized it with values that may be appropriate to the interaction between abalone and Rickettsia.
   4. The presence of a pathogen does not necessarily decrease yield when a reserve is present, particularly if the rate of movement of adult hosts between stock and reserve is low.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Pathogens have important implications for the design of marine reserves. Our modelling identifies two key considerations. First, 'fishing out' a pathogen by reducing the host population density to a level below the threshold for disease maintenance is a potential management strategy that is made more difficult by establishing a reserve. Secondly, the effect of a highly transmissible pathogen without a reserve is to cause a rapid decline in equilibrium yield for efforts beyond those that produce maximum sustainable yield, making the fishery prone to collapse. Introducing a reserve decreases yield in this case, but makes the fishery much more resistant to collapse.

AB 1. Extensive clearing of native vegetation in Australia has contributed to major environmental problems, including land degradation, dryland salinity, soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. Re-establishing cover with deep-rooted perennial species is a major focus for conservation and sustainable land management, particularly with regard to hydrological control of recharge and saline discharge areas. However, considerable expense is involved in large-scale revegetation programmes and cost effectiveness is a real concern.
   2. Low-cost revegetation approaches are needed that require little maintenance yet can substantially enhance reliable establishment and growth of native trees and shrubs. We evaluated results from direct-seeding field trials that examined the benefits of using native Australian Acacia species inoculated with effective strains of nitrogen-fixing root-nodule bacteria to revegetate degraded landscapes.
   3. On average, inoculation led to a 118% increase in establishment of acacia seedlings, indicating that the use of elite strains of native bacteria can substantially reduce seed requirements. This is a major benefit given the expense of collecting sufficient native seed and the impacts of this activity on remnant population viability.
   4. Particularly at sites experiencing harsher climatic conditions, subsequent survival of inoculated seedlings was significantly greater than for uninoculated controls. Moreover, inoculated acacias grew 10-58% faster than uninoculated controls during the critical early phase of establishment, although this varied among species and sites.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Inoculation of Acacia species or other native leguminous shrubs and trees with elite strains of native rhizobia as part of direct-seeding techniques has the potential to increase the scope, rate and success of land restoration world-wide. Re-establishment of important plant-soil interactions in degraded soils can contribute significantly to the development of biodiverse self-regenerating native ecosystems in agricultural landscapes.

AB The diets of prairie dog (Cynomys mexicanus) and cattle (Charolais cows) in desert grassland of northern Mexico were examined in 1-year study using microhistological analysis of feces. Cattle utilized more (P < 0.01) grasses than prairie dogs (86% vs. 68% across seasons). One key forage species in cattle diets was Bouteloua curtipendula, which was eaten in greater (P < 0.05) amounts by cattle than prairie dogs in summer and winter. Bouteloua gracilis, consistently appeared in cattle feces in all seasons. With the exception of spring, this grass was two-fold higher (P < 0.01) in cattle than prairie dog diets. Prairie dogs consumed 31% forbs compared to 16% for cattle (data across seasons; P < 0.05). Due to the low woody plant availability in the pasture, shrub was a negligible dietary constituent of both herbivores. In general, prairie dogs had a greater preference than cattle for forbs. Overall dietary overlap between prairie dog and cattle was 68%, which indicates that large forage competition occurs between prairie dog and cattle in all season. However, the long-term profitability of the ranch where these prairie dogs live, and the steady expansion of prairie dog colonies in this area indicates that controlled livestock grazing can be biologically sustainable, compatible with prairie dogs and economically cost effective.

DE sustainable development; scientific-economic paradigm; philosophy;

AB The term Sustainable Development has been used in many different contexts and consequently has come to represent many different ideas. The purpose of this paper was to explore the underlying meaning of the term Sustainable Development, and to assess the dominant ethic behind such meaning. Through this exploration, we uncovered a change in the semantic meaning of the term, and described what that meaning entails. The term Sustainable Development had the potential, we argue, to stimulate discursive engagement with respect to the future development of society within an ethical framework based around the values of inclusivity, diversity, and integration. The importance of philosophical context within which the term is used influences the definitional process of meaning, and has been simulated into the language of the dominant scientific-economic paradigm. We go on to explore how this meaning change has come about. In doing so we looked to the Enlightenment period and the resulting philosophies to explore the foundations of meaning, and then to the work of Jurgen Habermas to explain how the scientific-economic paradigm came to dominate the meaning of Sustainable Development.

TI Economic and environmental feasibility of a perennial cow dairy farm
SO JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE extended lactation; farm simulation; economics; environment
ID LACTATION; HERD; MODEL
AB More efficient and economical production systems are needed to improve the sustainability of dairy farms. One concept to consider is using perennial cows. Perennial cows are those that maintain a relatively high milk production for >= 2 yr without going through the typical dry period followed by calving. Farm records show that some cows have produced over 20 kg/d after 4 yr of continuous lactation. A farm simulation model was used to evaluate the long-term performance, environmental impact, and economics of a conceptual perennial cow production system on a typical dairy farm in Pennsylvania. Compared with a traditional 100-cow farm with replacement heifers produced on the farm, a perennial herd of 100 cows and purchased replacements provided environmental benefit but sustained a substantial economic loss. However, increasing the perennial herd to 128 cows better utilized the feed produced on the farm. Compared with the traditional 100-cow farm, use of the perennial 128-cow herd reduced supplemental protein and mineral feed purchases by 38%, increased annual milk sales by 21%, reduced nitrogen losses by 17%, maintained a phosphorus balance, and increased annual net return to farm management by $3200. A traditional 120-cow dairy farm with purchased replacements also used a similar amount of farm-produced feed. Compared with this option, the farm with 128 perennial cows reduced protein and mineral feed purchases by 36%, maintained similar annual milk sales, increased manure production by 7%, reduced N losses by 10%, and increased annual net return by $12,700. The economic feasibility of the perennial-cow dairy farm was very sensitive to the milk production maintained by the perennial herd and market prices for milk and perennial replacement animals. The analysis was relatively insensitive to the assumed useful life of perennial cows as long as they could be maintained in the herd for at least 3 yr. Thus, a perennial cow production system can improve the economic and environmental sustainability of a traditional dairy farm if a similar level in annual milk production per cow can be maintained.

AB The development of pest resistance to transgenic crop plants producing insecticidal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) poses a major threat to their sustainable use in agriculture. "Pyramiding" two toxins with different modes of actions in the same plant is now being used to delay the evolution of resistance in the insects, but this strategy could fail if a single gene in a pest confers resistance to both toxins. The CP73 strain of the cotton pest Heliothis virescens (F.) is resistant to both Cry1Ac and Cry2Aa toxins from Bt. We explored the genetic basis of resistance in this strain with a backcross, split-family design. The gene with the largest effect on Cry1Ac resistance in CP73 (BtR-5) maps to linkage group 10 of H. virescens and thus differs from the previously described linkage group 9 BtR-4 resistance found in the YHD2 strain, involving mutation of the gene encoding a 12-domain cadherin-like binding target of the Cry1A toxins. Neither BtR-4 nor BtR-5 seems to confer significant resistance to Cry2Aa. A majority of the linkage groups studied in one backcross family made a small positive contribution to resistance for both toxins. Thus, the Cry2Aa resistance in CP73 is not caused by either of the two major Cry1Ac resistance-conferring genes but instead probably has a quantitative genetic basis.

AB Partnerships and co-operative environmental management are increasing worldwide as is the call for scientific input in the public process of ecosystem management. In Hawaii, private landowners, non-governmental organizations, and state and federal agencies have formed watershed partnerships to conserve and better manage upland forested watersheds. In this paper, findings of an international workshop convened in Hawaii to explore the strengths of approaches used to assess stakeholder values of environmental resources and foster consensus in the public process of ecosystem management are presented. Authors draw upon field experience in projects throughout Hawaii, Southeast Asia, Africa and the US mainland to derive a set of lessons learned that can be applied to Hawaiian and other watershed partnerships in an effort to promote consensus and sustainable ecosystem management.
   Interdisciplinary science-based models can serve as effective tools to identify areas of potential consensus in the process of ecosystem management. Effective integration of scientific input in co-operative ecosystem management depends on the role of science, the stakeholders and decision-makers involved, and the common language utilized to compare tradeoffs. Trust is essential to consensus building and the integration of scientific input must be transparent and inclusive of public feedback. Consideration of all relevant stakeholders and the actual benefits and costs of management activities to each stakeholder is essential. Perceptions and intuitive responses of people can be as influential as analytical processes in decision-making and must be addressed. Deliberative, dynamic and iterative decision-making processes all influence the level of stakeholder achievement of consensus. In Hawaii, application of lessons learned can promote more informed and democratic decision processes, quality scientific analysis that is relevant, and legitimacy and public acceptance of ecosystem management.

AB In this paper, we analyze the insect resistance management (IRM) plan put in place by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to delay the evolution of resistance to Bt corn in natural populations of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner. This IRM plan is the most impressive mandatory IRM system ever developed. It forms a coherent whole and includes mandatory refuges. actions to increase growers' compliance and a program for monitoring the evolution of resistance. However, our analysis suggests that two components of this IRM plan are not entirely satisfactory: growers' compliance and monitoring of the evolution of resistance. Moreover, the implementation of these two components of IRM has been required of the registrants, whose incentives for IRM are probably lower than the social optimum. Our analysis suggests that alternatives to the IRM plan currently in place Could improve these two components. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The European Social Model: an exercise in deconstruction
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN SOCIAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE deconstruction; EU legitimacy; European Social Model
AB One of the fastest growing European catchwords at the present time - the 'European Social Model' (ESM) - is used to describe the European experience of simultaneously promoting sustainable economic growth and social cohesion. The use of the concept of ESM in academic and political debate is characterized by two main and interconnected features: on the one hand, the usually taken-for-granted assumption of the reality of the concept (the reality called 'Europe' becomes a naturally occurring phenomenon); on the other hand, the highly ambiguous and polysemic nature of this concept. A clear definition of what constitutes its essence seems to be lacking in most documents on the subject, while a review of some of the most important of these documents reveals that, insofar as definitions are to be found, they do not necessarily converge. This article aims to discuss the concept of the ESM. It analyses and deconstructs the concept in order to identify the main understandings and the various dimensions of the model. It classifies and discusses the ways in which the ESM is most frequently construed and proposes a new approach to understanding this polysemy. We argue that the different dimensions of the concept can be seen as rhetorical resources intended to legitimize the politically constructed and identity-building project of the EU institutions.

AB Short-term (< 7 years) effects of prescribed litter-raking on forest-floor nutrient pools, stand nutrition, and seepage water chemistry were studied in an N-saturated Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest in Southern Germany subject to high atmospheric-nitrogen deposition. The study was based on a comparison of plots with and without annual prescribed litter raking at three sites with different N-deposition levels. Prescribed litter-raking resulted in a considerable reduction of forest-floor thickness and mass, as well as of forest-floor C, N, P, K, Mg, and Ca pools. Furthermore, it induced a significant decrease of the foliar N content in current-year needles of the pines and a more balanced nutritional status of the stand. Particularly on the site subject to the highest N deposition, but to a lesser degree also at the other sites, the mean NO3- concentration in the subsoil seepage water and the N export into the groundwater were substantially reduced on the litter-raked plots. The results show that in N-saturated Scots pine ecosystems prescribed litter-raking on areas of limited size, which are used as sources of groundwater-derived drinking water and/or serve as habitat for endangered plant species, is a quick and effective method to achieve a more balanced nutritional status of the trees and to reduce seepage-water NO3- concentrations and N export into the groundwater. In terms of sustainable ecosystem nutrient management, the conversion of conifer monocultures into broadleaf-rich mixed stands is the better, yet less immediately effective method to reduce the seepage-water N export from conifer forests subject to high atmospheric-N deposition.

AB We report results of a survey explicitly focused on ocean quahog recruitment in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. The recruitment survey resampled all NMFS survey sites south of Hudson Canyon and a selection of sites north and east of Hudson Canyon off the Long Island coast over the entire depth range of this species with the exception of the most inshore reaches off Long Island. More ocean quahogs were encountered, on a per tow basis, in the vicinity of and north of Hudson Canyon. The proportion of recruits in the size-frequency distribution was higher in the south and the most recent recruitment events were concentrated there. Analysis of the 104 size-frequency distributions delineated regions of recent recruitment, areas that have not seen significant recruitment for many decades and areas that received heavy recruitment some decades previously but not recently. Overall, the survey suggests that three regionally distinctive processes determine the size-frequency distributions of ocean quahog assemblages and recruitment therein. The area northeast of Hudson Canyon is unique in the regionally extensive uniformity of size-frequency distributions among sampled assemblages. the near absence of recent recruitment and the presence of large numbers of older recruits, 65-80 mm in size. The inshore (by ocean quahog standards) area off New Jersey is unique in the dominant presence of the largest size classes of ocean quahogs and the remarkable absence of significant recruitment over an extraordinary time span. The area south of 39 degrees N is unique in the widespread presence of relatively young recruits, including some animals with ages within the time span of the present fishery. Recruitment events in ocean quahog populations, although rare in the sense of occurring only once in a score or two of years, are frequent in the context of the +200-year life span of this species, yet also rare in the context of stock survey timing and fishery dynamics. This study strongly supports the assumption that long-lived species recruit successfully only rarely when at carrying capacity. This study also suggests that the history of recruitment over the last perhaps two-score years, revealed by this survey, may be a poor measure of the recruitment dynamics to be anticipated over the next two-score years when the population abundance is reduced to what is anticipated to approximate the biomass at maximum sustainable yield. Given the long time span required for ocean quahogs to grow to fishable size, a substantive disequilibrium may exist between the recruitment anticipated from the relationship of adult biomass to carrying capacity and the contemporaneous number of recruits for minimally 20 y after adult abundance is reduced from circa-1980 carrying capacity to biomass. maximum sustainable yield.

TI Situating language rights: English and Swahili in Tanzania revisited
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIOLINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Tanzania; Swahili; English; linguistic rights; ethnography; indexicality
AB This paper argues for an ethnographic-sociolinguistic approach to the issue of linguistic rights. in much of the literature on linguistic rights, a fundamentally flawed set of assumptions about language and society is being used, leading to assessments of language situations that are empirically not sustainable. An alternative set of assumptions is offered, grounded in ethnography and focused on language use as oriented towards centering institutions that attribute indexicalities - function and value - to linguistic resources. Such centers are invariably multiple but stratified, and the state occupies a crucial place in these systems, between the world system and local forces. This model is applied to the Tanzanian sociolinguistic situation, where a strong state appeared to be caught between pressures that were both transnational and local. This gave rise to a pattern of distribution of linguistic resources, including English and Swahili, that offered semiotic opportunities to speakers to construct deeply 'local' meanings. The languages were not in themselves agents of inequality, but the way in which they were distributed nationally and in relation to transnational hierarchies is the key to understanding inequality. Discussions of linguistic rights should start from assessments of the real potential and constraints of linguistic resources, not from idealized and static conceptions of language and society and predefined scenarios of their interaction.

DT Article
ID MODELS
AB Surplus production models were used to assess the fishery condition of red seaweed Gelidium robustum off the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula from 1985 to 1997. The maximum sustainable yield and optimum effort estimated by the Schaefer model were 705 in and 457 teams, while the Fox model estimated 670 tn and 510 teams. The determination coefficients were r(2)=0.62 for the Fox and r(2) =0.58 for the Schaefer model. These results suggest that the resource is not overexploited. Fitting the data to Hilborn & Walters ' dynamic model was not satisfactory.

AB The general composition and abundance of microalgae in sediment, water column and stomach contents of scallops were studied at two Euvola ziczac beds on the south-eastern inner Brazilian continental shelf. These areas, which support an extensive demersal fishery, are hydrologically dominated by Tropical and Subantarctic Waters and exhibit a summer water intrusion of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW). The same genera of benthic diatoms, mainly < 30 mu m, were found on sediment and scallop stomach samples. Despite the seasonal variation of hydrographic conditions, the composition and abundance of main benthic diatoms from sediment and stomachs did not change throughout the year. On the other hand, phytoplankton from the water samples collected above the seabed (mainly pelagic diatoms > 30 mu m and dinoflagellates) was composed of distinct taxa and presented a high seasonal variation in abundance. The prevalence of microphytobenthos in the scallop diet suggests the importance of this community to the sustainability of this valuable demersal fishery resource.

AB To define the extent of sequence conservation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) in vivo, the first 320 amino acids of RT obtained from 2,236 plasma-derived samples from a well-defined cohort of 1,704 HIV-1-infected individuals (457 drug naive and 1,247 drug treated) were analyzed and examined in structural terms. In naive patients, 233 out of these 320 residues (73%) were conserved (< 1% variability). The majority of invariant amino acids clustered into defined regions comprising between 5 and 29 consecutive residues. Of the nine longest invariant regions identified, some contained residues and domains critical for enzyme stability and function. In patients treated with RT inhibitors, despite profound drug pressure and the appearance of mutations primarily associated with resistance, 202 amino acids (63%) remained highly conserved and appeared mostly distributed in regions of variable length. This finding suggests that participation of consecutive residues in structural domains is strictly required for cooperative functions and sustainabillity of HIV-1 RT activity. Besides confirming the conservation of amino acids that are already known to be important for catalytic activity, stability of the heterodimer interface, and/or primer/template binding, the other 62 new invariable residues are now identified and mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. This new knowledge could be of help in the structure-based design of novel resistance-evading drugs.

TI Sustainable and tenable renal health model: A Latin American proposal of

AB Background. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) presents a major problem to public health, with complex implications for social and economic structures in every nation of the world. Clearly, Latin American and Caribbean countries are not able to meet the needs of every patient requiring dialysis treatment at ESRD. Consequently, a considerable number of patients die every year as a result of lack of resources. Aware of this serious social, ethical, and economic problem, the Latin American Society of Nephrology and Hypertension proposed a new renal health concept in the region. In December 2002, at the workshop in Valdivia, Chile, a modification to the National Kidney Foundation Classification of Chronic Kidney Disease was approved.
   Project. According to modifications to the concept of chronic kidney disease approved in the Declaration of Valdivia, a new Renal Health Model was proposed. It consists of including orderly follow-up in patients' charts, starting from the earliest stage,, and a model establishing a guideline for the reallocation of financial resources to guarantee continuity of treatment to patients with ESRD.
   Conclusion. The implementation of the Renal Health Program in health ministries of Latin American and Caribbean countries would allow for a substantial improvement in renal health prevention and management, as a result of better distribution of financial and human resources.

TI Effects of changes in water salinity upon exercise and cardiac

AB The European seabass is an active euryhaline teleost that migrates and forages in waters of widely differing salinities. Oxygen uptake (M-O2) was measured in seabass (average mass and forklength 510 g and 34 cm, respectively) during exercise at incremental swimming speeds in a tunnel respirometer in seawater (SW) at a salinity of 30 parts per thousand and temperature of 14 degrees C, and their maximal sustainable (critical) swimming speed (U-crit) determined. Cardiac output (Q) was measured via an ultrasound flow probe on their ventral aorta. The fish were then exposed to acute reductions in water salinity, to either SW (control), 10 parts per thousand, 5 parts per thousand, or freshwater (FW, 0 parts per thousand), and their exercise and cardiac performance measured again, 18 h later. Seabass were also acclimated to FW for 3 weeks, and then their exercise performance measured before and at 18 h after acute exposure to SW at 30 parts per thousand. In SW, seabass exhibited an exponential increase in M-O2 and Q with increasing swimming speed, to a maximum M-O2 of 339 +/- 17 mg kg(-1) h(-1) and maximum Q of 52.0 +/- 1.9 ml min(-1) kg(-1) (mean +/- 1 SEM; n=19). Both M-O2 and Q exhibited signs of a plateau as the fish approached a U-crit of 2.25 +/- 0.08 bodylengths s(-1). Increases in Q during exercise were almost exclusively due to increased heart rate rather than ventricular stroke volume. There were no significant effects of the changes in salinity upon M-O2 during exercise, U-crit or cardiac performance. This was linked to an exceptional capacity to maintain plasma osmolality and tissue water content unchanged following all salinity challenges. This extraordinary adaptation would allow the seabass to maintain skeletal and cardiac muscle function while migrating through waters of widely differing salinities.

AB Thermal spray technologies are used for coating of component parts with a large variety of materials, e. g. for protection against wear and corrosion.
   During the last 20 years, the comparatively novel processes in thermal spraying have been established in surface technologies and will increasingly develop their market. Continuous equipment developments as well as new technologies for thermal spraying guarantee increasing importance of this technology, and will have a sustainable effect on industries with typical wear and corrosion-caused problems. Therefore, thermal spray coated components possess an outstanding suitability and a high application potential for the construction of stone machining machines / plants and the mining industry (as well as associated vehicle and equipment technology), which still has hardly been developed in the area of mining industry and stone machining.
   A short introduction of thermal spray technology and processes and an overview is given for typical applications and already established coating solutions besides some recent examples from the area of stone machining and mining. This article shows the potential of thermally sprayed coatings as solutions for the stone machining and mining industry.

AB Introduction of more durable resistance against Phytophthora infestans causing late blight into the cultivated potato is of importance for sustainable agriculture. We identified a new monogenically inherited resistance locus that is localized on chromosome 4. The resistance is derived from an ABPT clone, which is originally a complex quadruple hybrid in which Solanum acaule, S. bulbocastanum, S. phureja and S. tuberosum were involved. Resistance data of the original resistant accessions of the wild species and analysis of mobility of AFLP markers linked to the resistance locus suggest that the resistance locus is originating from S. bulbocastanum. A population of 1383 genotypes was screened with two AFLP markers flanking the Rpi-abpt locus and 98 recombinants were identified. An accurate high-resolution map was constructed and the Rpi-abpt locus was localized in a 0.5 cM interval. One AFLP marker was found to co-segregate with the Rpi-abpt locus. Its DNA sequence was highly similar with sequences found on a tomato BAC containing several resistance gene analogues on chromosome 4 and its translated protein sequence appeared to be homologous to several disease resistance related proteins. The results indicated that the Rpi-abpt gene is a member of an R gene cluster.

DT Article
DE gender; water; forestry; organic fanning; fishery; natural resources;

AB This article attempts to delineate women's roles in natural resource management by highlighting their roles in management of water, agriculture, livestock forestry and fishery. The article is based on the findings of case studies in rural areas of India and Nepal done during 2003 and 2004 by the author as well as by other researchers. Taking women as primary respondents, empirical work used participatory techniques, such as in-depth surveys, focus group discussions and participant observation. Findings suggest that women clearly outdo men in terms of their involvement in use and management Of all the studied sectors, i.e., water, agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishery. Yet, they face categorical exclusion and denial of equal sharing of benefits from natural resources. In order to ensure sustainable use of these resources, the article recommends that policy makers, planners and development workers must have a better understanding of the relative and often shifting roles of men and women in natural resource management, including division of labour, access to resources, decision-making and traditional knowledge and practices. The article concludes with sector-specific recommendations.

ID CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH
AB Artisanal and small-scale mining are activities that have long been established in many developing countries, employing millions of people globally, either directly or in affiliated industries. Also, such activities are deplored for their adverse environmental impacts and their general avoidance of governments, tax collectors and other regulators. Decades of work have gone into addressing these problems, but with limited overall progress in evidence. Going back to some of the key dynamic relationships involved in artisanal mining and small-scale mining, the need for policy reform that gives consistent and effective incentives is argued to be the foundation on which other discussions about environmental protection, sustainability and livelihoods can be built.

AB Thorium-based fuels can be used to reduce concerns related to the proliferation potential and waste disposal of the conventional light water reactor (LWR) uranium fuel cycle. The main sources of proliferation potential and radiotoxicity are the plutonium and higher actinides generated during the burnup of standard LWR fuel. A significant reduction in the quantity and quality of the generated Pu can be achieved by replacing the U-238 fertile component of conventional low-enriched uranium fuel by Th-232. Thorium can also be used as a way to manage the growth of plutonium stockpiles by burning plutonium, or achieving a net-Zero transuranic production, sustainable recycle scenario. This paper summarizes some of the results of recent studies of the performance of thorium-based fuels.
   It is concluded that the use of heterogeneous U-Th fuel provides higher neutronic potential than a homogeneous fuel. However, in the former case, the uranium portion of the fuel operates at a higher power density, and care is needed to meet the thermal margins and address the higher-burnup implications. In macro-heterogeneous designs, the U-Th fuel can yield reduced spent-fuel volume, toxicity, and decay heat. The main advantage of Pu-Th oxide over mixed oxide is better void reactivity behavior even for undermoderated designs, and increased burnup of Pu.

AB Fast reactors cooled by lead or lead-bismuth alloy offer new interesting fuel cycle and fuel management options by virtue of the superb neutronics and safety features of these heavy liquid metal (HLM) coolants. One option is once-for-life cores having relatively low power density. These cores are fueled in the factory; there is no refueling or fuel shuffling on site. A second option is very long-life cores being made of a fissioning zone and a natural uranium blanket zone. The fissioning zone very slowly drifts toward the blanket. A third option is multirecycling of light water reactor (LWR) discharged fuel without partitioning of transuranics (TRUs) in fuel-self-sustaining reactors. LWR spent fuel could provide the initial fuel loading after extracting fission products and similar to 90% of its uranium. The makeup fuel is natural or depleted uranium. A fourth option is the high-burnup once-through fuel cycle using natural or depleted uranium feed. The initial fuel loading of this reactor is a mixture of enriched and natural uranium. The natural uranium utilization is 10 to 20 times higher than that of a once-through LWR. A fifth option is transmutation of TRUs from LWRs using critical HLM-cooled reactors; such reactors could be designed to have the same high actinide burning capability of accelerator-driven systems and have comparable safety, but at a substantially lower cost. These novel reactor designs and fuel management options are hereby reviewed.

AB Jumping on the bed is a common childhood behavior. However, little is known about the potential for traumatic injury sustainable as a consequence of this behavior save for an understanding of the risk of injury related to falling from a bed, and a growing body of literature related to trampoline injuries. We report a case of a "grid" wire puncture injury that required a minor incision to affect removal. Parents should know about the possibility of this injury secondary to jumping on the bed, and pediatricians should know that the grid wires have hooked ends that may require incision to facilitate their removal.

AB Based on data from 10-year field experiments on residue/fertilizer management in the dryland farming region of northern China, Century model was used to simulate the site-specific ecosystem dynamics through adjustment of the model's parameters, and the applicability of the model to propose soil organic carbon (SOC) management temporally and spatially, in cases such as of tillage/residue/fertilization management options, was identified via scenario analysis. Results between simulations and actual measurements were in close agreement when appropriate applications of stover, manure and inorganic fertilizer were combined. Simulations of extreme C/N ratios with added organic materials tended to underestimate the measured effects. Scenarios of changed tillage methods, residue practices and fertilization options showed potential to maintain and enhance SOC in the long run, while increasing inorganic N slowed down the SOC turnover rate but did not create a net C sink without any organic C input. The Century model simulation showed a good relationship between annual C inputs to the soil and the rate of C sequestration in the top 20 cm layer and provided quantitative estimations of changes in parameters crucial for sustainable land use and management. Conservation tillage practices for sustainable land use should be integrated with residue management and appreciable organic and inorganic fertilizer application, adapted according to the local residue resource, soil fertility and production conditions. At least 50% residue return into the soil was needed annually for maintenance of SOC balance, and manure amendment was important for enhancement of SOC in small crop-livestock systems in which crop residue land application was limited.

AB Characterization of 16 grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.) accessions collected in central Italy (Marche region) was performed for morphological and agronomic traits and for 3-(-N-oxalyl)-L-2,3 diaminopropionic acid (ODAP) content. Field trials, carried out in two locations, revealed high among-population genetic variation. In particular, an evident differentiation between commercial populations, cultivated by market-oriented farms, and household populations (not market-oriented) was found. Genotype x environment interaction was negligible. Medium-high values of ODAP content were observed following colorimetric and capillary electrophoresis analyses. A high positive correlation between the two methods was found (r = 0.83**), but the colorimetric values showed, on average, significant 14% lower ODAP values. This research represents a pre-breeding activity aimed at developing a breeding programme for the preservation and utilization of Italian grasspea germplasm within sustainable or organic agricultural systems.

AB Geographers continue to engage in public debate "inside the Beltway" by participation within and through federal agencies and through the National Research Council. Several examples illustrate the level and kind of this engagement, which has been concentrated on environmental and spatial data and analysis themes. Most professional geographers have the opportunity to engage in this form of public debate through participation in the activities of the National Research Council. The level of this participation has been surprisingly strong, given the small size of the community of professional geographers, and has helped to shape both U.S. and international research agendas relevant to geographic research. Participation, however, is concentrated in a few programs and individuals, raising questions about the sustainability of geography's voice in this public activity.

AB Problem: Measuring a process of care in real time is essential for continuous quality improvement (CQI). Our inability to measure the process of central venous catheter (CVC) care in real time prevented CQI efforts aimed at reducing catheter related bloodstream infections (CR-BSIs) from these devices.
   Design: A system was developed for measuring the process of CVC care in real time. We used these new process measurements to continuously monitor the system, guide CQI activities, and deliver performance feedback to providers.
   Setting: Adult medical intensive care unit (MICU).
   Key measures for improvement: Measured process of CVC care in real time; CR-BSI rate and time between CR- BSI events; and performance feedback to staff.
   Strategies for change: An interdisciplinary team developed a standardized, user friendly nursing checklist for CVC insertion. Infection control practitioners scanned the completed checklists into a computerized database, thereby generating real time measurements for the process of CVC insertion. Armed with these new process measurements, the team optimized the impact of a multifaceted intervention aimed at reducing CR-BSIs.
   Effects of change: The new checklist immediately provided real time measurements for the process of CVC insertion. These process measures allowed the team to directly monitor adherence to evidence-based guidelines. Through continuous process measurement, the team successfully overcame barriers to change, reduced the CR-BSI rate, and improved patient safety. Two years after the introduction of the checklist the CR-BSI rate remained at a historic low.
   Lessons learnt: Measuring the process of CVC care in real time is feasible in the ICU. When trying to improve care, real time process measurements are an excellent tool for overcoming barriers to change and enhancing the sustainability of efforts. To continually improve patient safety, healthcare organizations should continually measure their key clinical processes in real time.

AB Increasing attention is being paid to overfishing and the biological, economic, and social implications of persistent mismanagement of aquatic natural resources. In this chorus of concern, little attention is focused on sustainable fisheries, and the lessons to be learned from management systems that produce these successes. Although there is no one prescription for sustainability, a range of quota-based management tools have been used to eliminate the race for fish, increasing the incentives for long-term investment and efficiency. Variously referred to as fishing rights, tenure rights, or dedicated access privileges, quota-based fisheries confer a percentage (or quota) of the total allowable catch to named entities over some predetermined period, from short-term auction systems to intergenerational customary sea tenure. Whether a rights-based system stems from a traditional fishing rights system or has been recently introduced into modern commercial fisheries, achieving sustainability in the fishery is dependent on incentivizing the collective - from local communities to national fleets - to actively participate in self-regulation of the resource. Thus criticism of the approach often stems from the observation of the potential for cheating at the individual level (e.g., high grading, excessive discards), and the necessary exclusivity that accompanies any transition in management from open access to club membership. It is also worth noting that the resource in question - the fish - remain a public good, and as such, the public should be compensated - or at least not taxed - for their use. Thus the cost of fishery management, and the windfall profits of fishery conversion, should be shared. Rights-based management is not a silver bullet, and is probably not appropriate for all fisheries; however, the successes of the longline fisheries for Pacific halibut and sablefish in Alaska, the artisanal fisheries for loco in Chile and for spiny lobster in Mexico, and the Australian fisheries for Northern prawns and rock lobster, all clearly indicate that fishing rights should have a central place in the fisheries management toolbox.

AB Fisheries management regimes take many forms, but most fail to designate shares of the catch. This failure creates strong incentives for individuals to maximize their share without regard to long-term sustainability, because the benefits of conservation actions do not accrue to individuals. The competition to maximize catch usually entails excessive capital investments in fishing vessels and gear and intense fishing pressure, resulting in overfishing, high by catch rates, and the use of large, efficient types of gear that can harm habitat. Managers respond by increasing regulations, but this often exacerbates perverse incentives. In addition, many fisheries could be producing more value than the current system permits, i.e. large quantities of fish are landed during short seasons, forcing fishermen to sell for low prices. Conservation and economic problems facing fisheries can be addressed in an integrated way, by designating access privileges (specifying shares of the catch) to individuals, harvest cooperatives, fishing sectors, communities, or other appropriate entities. Designated Access Privilege (DAP) systems demonstrably end the competition to maximize catch and often result in better conservation and financial performance. The cost of implementing these systems can be relatively high and has been a barrier to better management. However, this doesn't have to be so. Fisheries could accept investments from a variety of sources and use a portion of the increased financial performance to repay recoverable grants and loans. The key to protecting fish stocks, habitats, and the communities that depend on them will be to implement DAPs that are appropriate for each fishery or community, making investments in sustainability, and creating financing mechanisms that are themselves sustainable, drawing on the increased value that DAP fisheries can produce.

AB Objective. To propose an urban water sustainability index based on indicators that may serve as a foundation for developing planned actions concerning water resources.
   Methods. Eleven indicators (covering aspects of water and sewage) were selected based on the parameters of Brazil's actions Water and Sanitation Information System (Sistema Nacional de Informacao sobre Saneamento) for the years 2000 and 2001. A score and a weight were assigned to each indicator. Based on that, the urban water sustainability index (UWSI) was calculated, using the formula UWSI = product (I-i(pi)), where I-i is the score attributed to each indicator i, ranging from 0 to 100, and pi is the weight for each indicator Sigma(i=1)(n) P-i = 1, where n is the number of indicators considered). The lowest water quality is indicated by an index value of 0, and the best by an index value of 100.
   Results. The urban water sustainability index for the city of Rio de Janeiro was 58.99 in 2000, and it rose to 59.57 in 2001, indicating water of good quality in both those years.
   Conclusions. The improvement in the quality of the water resources between 2000 and 2001 in the city of Rio de Janeiro is possibly the result of the implementation, in the 1990s, of an environmental management program in the Rio de Janeiro region. Environmental planning that includes rational use of water resources and methods to prevent their destruction is crucial to sustaining society.

ID SOLIDIFICATION
AB For the realization of a sustainable society, the number of environmentally friendly products introduced in the recent decades has increased in iron and steel products. Such products are compatible with environmental regulations, are preferable from the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) viewpoint and save energy when used in the final products because of their improved properties. Hydro-forming technology simplifies the production process, of automotive parts and reduces the parts' weight, contributing to an improvement in the fuel consumption rate of automobiles. In the steel-refining process, reduction of slag emission is a key issue and is accomplished by improvements in dephosporization efficiency and the recycling of the refining slag as in the multiple refining converter (MURC) process. Electromagnetic casting reduces the number of defects in hot coils produced from the slab cast by its application and has the possibility of eliminating the slab surface treatment, which saves energy. Control of nonmetallic inclusions and segregation are now utilized for the generation of steel properties more suitable for environmental concerns. Hydrogen gas generation by using coke oven gas and waste plastic recycling by using a coke oven also contribute toward creating a sustainable society.

AB Supplying water to the ecological environment with certain quantity and quality is significant for the protection of diversity and the realization of sustainable development. The conception and connotation of eco-environmental water requirements, including the definition of the conception, the composition and characteristics of eco-environmental water requirements, are evaluated in this paper. The classification and estimation methods of eco-environmental water requirements are then proposed. On the basis of the study on the Huang-Huai-Hai Area, the present water use, the minimum and suitable water requirement are estimated and the corresponding water shortage is also calculated. According to the interrelated programs, the eco-environmental water requirements in the coming years (2010, 2030, 2050) are estimated. The result indicates that the minimum and suitable eco-environmental water requirements fluctuate with the differences of function setting and the referential standard of water resources, and so as the water shortage. Moreover, the study indicates that the minimum eco-environmental water requirement of the study area ranges from 2.84x10(10)m(3) to 1.02x10(11)m(3), the suitable water requirement ranges from 6.45x10(10)m(3) to 1.78x10(11)m(3), the water shortage ranges from 9.1x10(9)m(3) to 2.16x10(10)m(3) under the minimum water requirement, and it is from 3.07x10(10)m(3) to 7.53x10(10)m(3) under the suitable water requirement. According to the different values of the water shortage, the water priority can be allocated. The ranges of the eco-environmental water requirements in the three coming years (2010, 2030, 2050) are 4.49x10(10)m(3)-1.73x10(11)m(3), 5.99x(10)m(3)-2.09x10(11)m(3), and 7.44x10(11)m(3)-2.52x10(11)m(3), respectively.

AB This paper examines the impact of a decade of transition on living standards and welfare in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Following independence in 1991 all countries suffered a sharp decline in GDP per capita, with levels in some countries falling to below a quarter of the pre-transition level. Since then, all countries have experienced positive economic growth. The key questions are whether this growth has been accompanied by declines in inequality and poverty and, if so, how sustainable are these improvements. There is some evidence that recent growth has benefited the poor. However, at the start of the new century, an estimated 39 million people in Central Asia and the Caucasus were living in poverty, of whom over 14 million were living in extreme poverty. Moreover, there is evidence of growing inequalities in terms of access to health and education services, with implications for future human development. Continuing poor governance within the region represents a major barrier to future poverty reduction.

AB The main objective of this article is to discuss the effectiveness of bottom-up, community-driven approaches in promoting community participation and building local capacity within the post-Soviet social, institutional and political context of Armenia. In exploring this issue, the article examines the nature of local participation and social relations in rural communities in Armenia and the impact of the World Bank-supported Armenia Social Investment Fund (ASIF) project on the existing forms of local social organization. One of the objectives of the ASIF project was to promote the participation of local communities in their own economic and social development. The research finds that the project did not change the existing patterns of local social organization and had no significant impact on the nature of participation in the beneficiary communities. Bottom-up, capacity-building interventions that mainly focus on changing patterns of interpersonal social relations may not be effective in fostering sustainable civic institutions without changes in the nature of a country's governance.

ID MANAGEMENT; FISHERY
AB The Seri people, a self-governed community of small-scale fishermen in the Gulf of California, Mexico, have ownership rights to fishing grounds where they harvest highly valuable commercial species of bivalves. Outsiders are eager to gain access, and the community has devised a set of rules to allow them in. Because Seri government officials keep all the economic benefits generated from granting this access for themselves, community members create alternative entry mechanisms to divert those benefits to themselves. Under Hardin's model of the tragedy of the commons, this situation would eventually lead to the overexploitation of the fishery. The Seri people, however, are able to simultaneously maintain access and use controls for the continuing sustainability of their fishing grounds. Using insights from common-pool resources theory, I discuss how Seri community characteristics help mediate the conflict between collective action dilemmas and access and use controls.

AB Use and management of organic waste/residues is currently an important global issue for attaining sustainability in agricultural production. However, knowledge about the decomposition characteristics and nutrient release pattern of added organic materials in subtropical soils and their interaction with inherent soil properties are lacking. Thus, laboratory incubation studies were carried out under aerobic conditions with crop residues and chicken manure (1%) applied to six contrasting soils. In all cases, CO2-C effluxes peaked by day 9 and the active C release phase persisted until day 25, indicating that priming effects might have occurred. The high pH and non-calcareous soils had higher CO2 effluxes than the acidic soils. The relative loss of added C differed between soils and its magnitude depended on the decomposable characteristics of the added organic materials, with chicken manure > mungbean residue > wheat residue. Rapid ammonification with presumed immobilization occurred up to day 15. Thereafter, NH4+ oxidation took place in the high pH and non-calcareous soils, with chicken manure exhibiting the greatest nitrification. By contrast, the acidic soils predominantly accumulated NH4+, thereby showing higher net N mineralization. In the acidic soils, nitrification was either small or stable, with the process being limited by the addition of organic materials with a high C/N ratio. Some disappearances of NO3- also indicated that N immobilization and/or denitrification had taken place. As such, the decomposition rate constant (k) correlated well either with pH alone (R-2=0.59***) or coupled with C/N ratio (R-2=0.61***) of the organic materials. The net N mineralization and nitrification showed a similar trend (R-2=0.26-0.42*), although these processes were mostly regulated by the different soil factors. Our results reveal that the parameters pH and C/N ratio of organic materials should be included in equations to calculate the quality of added organic matter. Our newly proposed equations, incorporated as the organic matter quality index (OMQI), can predict k, net N mineralization and nitrification in different soil types under aerobic conditions, and it could be further improved by also considering inherent soil factors.

ID VEGETATION
AB Fort A.P. Hill's Range and Training Land Assessments (RTLA) program initiated long-term monitoring of installation forests to assess forest health and ensure optimal sustainability of forest resources for military training activities. A subset of forest health indicators developed by the USDA Forest Service Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) and Forest Inventory and Analysis programs were used to assess forest health on Army training lands at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. Indicators of tree crown condition and tree damage condition were taken in forested areas where military training occurs, "tactical concealment areas (TCAs)," and on continuous forest monitoring (CFM) plots established in control stands where military training is absent. A higher percent of trees with high crown dieback, low crown density, and multiple types of stem damage were observed within TCAs than on CFM plots. The results are indicative of possible long-term changes to forest health from military training activities. The FHM forest health indicators proved to be an effective and useful approach to assess tree conditions.

AB In work undertaken in both Malta and Lebanon we have been reflecting on the current means by which the international community apply concepts intended to achieve what is called "sustainable development." In an attempt to make means and ends conform to each other we have developed a holistic approach to what is essentially a timeless need for understanding, systemic planning, and compassionate stewardship. This essay indicates that we may be closer to holistic means with which to realize these goals than we know. It describes how some planning and analysis methods have their origins in ancient traditions. However, the milieu in which sustainability occurs is often unsympathetic to and sometimes incompatible with the ideals of holism. The essay assesses the current understanding of sustainability and points to the need for a wider and more inclusive base to contemporary sustainability as practiced in the community.

AB All households in 32 villages were provided with improved pit latrines as part of a trachoma control programme in a rural part of The Gambia. Latrine provision was externally driven and was not in response to a request from the communities involved. Materials were provided for free and tabour was paid for. To assess durability and acceptability we conducted a follow-up study 25-47 months after construction. Before the intervention only 32% of households in these villages had access to any type of latrine; at follow-up this had risen to 95%. On visual inspection 585/666 latrines (87.3%) were usable and 510 (87.2% of those usable) were currently used. During interviews 566/637 Latrine owners (89%) said they were either happy or very happy with their latrines, and 620 (97.3%) reported that they would make a new latrine of some kind when the current one was full or unusable. We interpret these data to suggest that externally driven Latrine provision, without additional health education, to an area with poor latrine coverage can result in high, sustainable Levels of uptake and generate future demand for sanitation.

ID POLITICAL ECOLOGY; ATHENS; CITY; MANAGEMENT
AB Urban sprawl is eroding the traditionally compact, diverse, and mixed Southern European cities. Besides the rise in land and energy consumption, the expansion of low density urban forms also affects water, a critical resource in the region. This study examines garden watering in the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona in order to illustrate the importance Of Outdoor water use in the urbanization process, and, following the insights provided by urban political ecology, to highlight the differences in garden types and water spending according to power relations derived from income levels. Results indicate that, generally, higher income households prefer and can afford more water-consuming Atlantic gardens whereas lower income households have to resort to more climate-adapted species. These differences produce in turn different urban natures based on who can and who cannot afford water costs.

DE packaging; solid waste; recycling; reuse; environmental monitoring;
   environmental policy; wmr 646-1
AB It is shown that the conventional recycling rate fails to reflect environmental performance for packaging flows with both recycle and reuse. The reuse rate, the total number of reuse trips and the reuse-lifetime are also shown to be inadequate. A new rate index defined in terms of the total amount of packaging material reaching the consumer is proposed. It reflects immediate improvements in environmental impact according to specific criteria and it reduces to the conventional rate for systems with only recycle. Albeit this shortcut environmental assessment is not entirely comprehensive and does not unveil a full sustainability profile, it may be useful for immediate packaging flow evaluation and policy implementation. For given packaging production technology it reveals a specific maximum level on recycling, below which environmental impacts from processing are limited or reduced, even if production level grows. Cleaner technologies in reprocessing of recycled materials may elevate this maximum level while still limiting or reducing environmental impacts.

AB One of the important sectors that contribute to the national economy is the mining sector. During the mining of minerals and ores, waste materials in the form of overburden are generated. As these are not useful to the mine owners, they may be inappropriately disposed of into the environment, posing serious threat to the environment in the form of land degradation, water and air pollution. The present paper discusses the existing status of waste generation, its characteristics and the disposal methods being adopted in India. Impacts associated with waste disposal practices together with preventive measures for waste disposal are also discussed. Finally, strategies for improvements in existing waste management and for incorporating the same in the overall development plan for the mines are suggested.

AB Sustainable development relies on the eco-efficient use of all flows in society; more value created out of each resource unit. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) can be used for treatment of wet organic waste. The technology has been under development for over 20 years but has not yet been fully commercialized. SCWO allows for complete oxidation of all organics in sewage sludge and almost complete recovery of the inherent energy, essentially without harmful emissions. In this paper, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of sewage sludge SCWO (Aqua-Critox) is presented and the results are compared with LCA results for other sludge handling options: agricultural use, co-incineration with municipal solid waste, incineration with subsequent phosphorus extraction (BioCon) and sludge fractionation with phosphorus recovery (Cambi-KREPRO). For SCWO, beneficial utilization of the heat of reaction is of crucial importance for the outcome. The electricity consumed by pumping and the nitrous oxide produced are other important parameters. The best sludge handling option from an environmental point of view depends on what aspect is considered more important in the impact assessment. Regarding global warming, the energy recovery methods perform better than agricultural use.

AB Safeguarding mutual support between generations is vital in an aging society and leads inevitably to a number of sociopolitical challenges. Not only material solidarity, but also immaterial transfers within and outside the family are called for. But in order to develop a sustainable idea of generational solidarity, the traditional definitions of generations on the one hand and of solidarity on the other should be questioned. The following contribution describes main aspects of generational relations and brings up concepts of event based generations and horizontal solidarity for discussion. In the light of a demographic ethic, prerequisites for a promising cohesion between adults with and without children are derived.

AB In the North China Plain (NCP), more than 70% of irrigation water resources are used for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A crucial target of groundwater conservation and sustainable crop production is to develop water-saving agriculture, particularly for winter wheat. The purpose of this study was to optimize irrigation scheduling for high wheat yield and water use efficiency (WUE). Field experiments were conducted for three growing seasons at the Wuqiao Experiment Station of China Agriculture University. Eleven, four and six irrigation treatments, consisting of frequency of irrigation (zero to four times) and timing (at raising, jointing, booting, flowering and milking stage), were employed for 1994/95, 1995/96 and 1996/97 seasons, respectively. Available water content (AWC), rain events, soil water use (SWU), evapotranspiration (ET) and grain yield were recorded, and water use efficiency (WUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) were calculated.
   The results showed that after a 75-mm pre-sowing irrigation, soil water content and AWC in the root zone of a 2-m soil profile during sowing were 31.1% (or 90.7% of field capacity) and 16.1%, respectively. Rainfall events were variable and showed a limited impact on AWC. The AWC decreased significantly with the growth of wheat. At the jointing stage no water deficits occurred for all treatments, at the flowering stage water deficits were found only in the rain-fed treatment, and at harvest all treatments had moderate to severe soil water deficits. The SWU in the 2-m soil profile was negatively related to the irrigation water volume, i.e. applying 75 mm irrigation reduced SWU by 28.2 mm. Regression analyses showed that relationships between ET and grain yield or WUE could be described by quadratic functions. Grain yield and WUE reached their maximum values of 7423 kg/ha and 1.645 kg/m(3) at the ET rate of 509 and 382 mm, respectively. IWUE was negatively correlated with irrigated water volume. From the above results, three irrigation schedules: (1) presowing irrigation only, (2) pre-sowing irrigation + irrigation at jointing or booting stage, and (3) presowing irrigation + irrigations at jointing and flowering stages were identified and recommended for practical winter wheat production in the NCP (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB The wheat- (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn- (Zea mays L.) rotation system is important for food security in Northwest China. Grain yield and water-use efficiency [WUE: grain yield/estimated evapotranspiration (ET)] were recorded during a 24-year fertilization trial in Pingliang (Gansu, China). Mean yields of wheat for the 16 years, starting in 1981, ranged from 1.29 Mg ha(-1) for unfertilized plots (CK) to 4.71 Mg ha-1 for plots that received manure (M) annually with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers (MNP). Corn yields for the 6 years, starting in 1979, averaged 2.29 and 5.61 Mg ha(-1) for the same respective treatments. Whether the years were dry, normal or wet, average grain yields and WUEs for both crops were consistently highest in the MNP and lowest in the CK treatment, and were always lower in the N than in the M treatment and in all others treatments that received N along with P fertilizers. More importantly, WUEs for MNP and for straw along with N annually and P every second year (SNP) were always higher than the other fertilized treatments in dry years. Compared to yield data, coefficients of variance (CV) for WUEs were consistently low for all treatments, suggesting that WUEs were relatively stable from year to year. Yields and WUEs declined over time, except in the CK and MNP treatments for wheat. Declined yields of wheat for the N and M treatments were comparable, and the decline for the NP treatment was similar to that for the SNP treatment. Likewise, corn yields and WUEs declined for all treatments. Grain yields were significantly correlated with ET, with slopes ranging from 0.5 to 1.27 kg m(-3) for wheat and from 1.15 to 2.03 kg m(-3) for com. Balanced fertilization and long-term addition of organic material to soil should be encouraged in this region to maximize the use of stored soil water, arrest grain yields decline, and ensure sustainable productivity using this intensive cereal cropping system.

AB Agriculture is the main non-point polluter of groundwater in irrigated areas as fertilizers and other agrochemicals are the main contaminants in the water that drains out of the root zone to recharge the aquifer. Nitrates from fertilizers, dissolved in percolation losses from rice fields, are the source of pollution considered. The concentration of nitrates in the percolated water depends on the distributed field water and nitrogen balances over the area. Its concentration in the groundwater depends on the total recharge, pollution loading, groundwater flow and solute transport within the aquifer. The development and application of a GIS based decision support framework that integrates field scale models of these processes for assessment of non-point-source pollution of groundwater in canal irrigation project areas is presented. The GIS is used for representing the spatial variations in input data over the area and map the output of the recharge and nitrogen balance models. The latter are used to provide the spatially distributed recharge and pollutant load inputs to the distributed groundwater flow and transport models, respectively. Alternate strategies for water and fertilizer use can be evaluated using this framework to ensure long-term sustainability of productive agriculture in large irrigation projects. The development and application of the framework is illustrated by taking a case study of a large canal irrigation system in India. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The quantitative levels of Cry1Ac and the seasonal decline in expression differed significantly among the eight commercial Bollgard hybrids tested. The Cry1Ac expression was found to be variable among the hybrids and also between different plant parts. The leaves of Bt-cotton plants were found to have the highest levels of Cry1Ac expression followed by squares, bolls and flowers. The toxin expression in the boll-rind, square bud and ovary of flowers was clearly inadequate to confer full protection to the fruiting parts. Increasing levels of Helicoverpa armigera survival were correlated with the toxin levels decreasing below 1.8 mu g/g in the plant parts. Genotype-independent seasonal decline of the Cry1Ac toxin levels was observed in all the hybrids. Cry1Ac expression decreased consistently as the plant aged. The decline in Cry1Ac was more rapid in some hybrids compared to others. The choice of parental background appeared to be crucial for sustainable expression of the cry1Ac transgene. The implications of variability in Cry1Ac expression and the seasonal decline on bollworm management are discussed.

AB This work is within the framework of a project where the overall objective is to create the methodology for a sustainable management of an important wetland in Argentina, "Esteros del Ibera". Rice culture has been identified as the main anthropogenic activity, being necessary to evaluate the impacts of pesticides used in rice culture on the aquatic ecosystem. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of pesticides used in rice culture through the use of a Mackay's model, to identify the potentially more contaminated environmental compartments, and identify their toxicological and physicochemical properties. Based on the results of the model, water samples were collected and two insecticides (endosulfan and carbofuran) were analysed using the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) extraction technique with detection by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To create a decision tool based on monitorization results, pesticide guidelines for water quality (drinking and for aquatic life protection) were calculated and compared with the available international regulations for pesticides; conservative guidelines are recommended. The results of pesticides analysis were compared with these guidelines; some results exceeded the international guidelines (mainly the values for protection of aquatic life) in particular those from samples taken close to the discharge points and due to the presence of the more toxic insecticide endosulfan; however, the impact of pesticides on most waters of the lagoon Ibera seems not yet to be very significant, but monitoring of impacts and careful use of pesticides, specially insecticides, should be observed in the future.

AB Capybara (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris) is the largest living rodent, widely distributed in South America, with a considerable potential as an economic resource. There are large populations in the region of Esteros del Ibera that could be exploited in a sustainable manner and contribute positively to the development of the region. Such exploitation requires to be done responsibly and following a specially designed management plan. In the particular case of wildlife management, a sustainable exploitation of a given species requires knowledge of its dynamics, its density in the area, and its vital rates, as well as understanding how the natural environment will respond to the proposed manipulation. It is also important to determine which environmental variables lead the population dynamics in each region. A mathematical model is a very convenient tool for analyzing possible strategies.
   This work presents a matrix population model structured in five stages. Sensitivity and elasticity analyses of the model provide an understanding of the effects of differentiated class-dependent survival and growth probabilities on the life cycle. A harvest term has been included in the model with the purpose of evaluating the sustainability of a given exploitation scenario or comparing different harvest strategies. The different strategies depend on the exploitation pattern, the exploitation intensity, and the season in which the harvest takes place.
   The purpose is to formulate a simple tool that can be understood by a manager without specific training. Hence, the software interface was specially designed for a user with elementary knowledge of vital parameters of the species. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   TRANSPORT; PARAMETERIZATION; THUNDERSTORM
AB Vertical mixing of chemical tracers and optically active constituents by deep convection affects regional and global chemical balances in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. This important process is not explicitly resolved in global and regional models and has to be parameterized. However, mixing depends strongly on the spatial structure, strength, and temporal evolution of the particular storm, complicating parameterization of this important effect in the large-scale models. To better quantify dynamic fields and associated mixing processes, we simulate a thunderstorm observed on 12 July 1996 during the STERAO-A (Stratosphere-Troposphere Experiment: Radiation, Aerosols, and Ozone) Deep Convection field project using the Goddard Cloud Ensemble (GCE) model. The 12 July STERAO-A storm had very complex temporal and spatial structure. The meteorological environment and evolution of the storm were significantly different than those of the 10 July STERAO-A storm extensively discussed in previous studies. Our 2-D and 3-D GCE model runs with uniform one-sounding initialization were unable to reproduce the full life cycle of the 12 July storm observed by the CHILL radar system. To describe the storm evolution, we modified the 3-D GCE model to include the effects of terrain and the capability of using nonuniform initial fields. We conducted a series of numerical experiments and reproduced the observed life cycle and fine spatial structure of the storm. The main characteristics of the 3-D simulation of the 12 July storm were compared with observations, with 2-D simulations of the same storm, and with the evolution of the 10 July storm. The simulated 3-D convection appears to be stronger and more realistic than in our 2-D simulations. Having developed in a less unstable environment than the 10 July 1996 STERAO-A storm, our simulation of the 12 July storm produced weaker but sustainable convection that was significantly fed by wind shear instability in the lower troposphere. The time evolution, direction, and speed of propagation of the storm were determined by interaction with the nonuniform background mesoscale flow. For example, storm intensity decreased drastically when the storm left the region with large convective available potential energy. The model appears to be successful in reproducing the rectangular four-cell structure of the convection. The distributions of convergence, vertical vorticity, and position of the inflow level in the later single-cell regime compare favorably with the airborne Doppler radar observations. This analysis allowed us to better understand the role of terrain and mesoscale circulation in the development of a midlatitude deep convective system and associated convective mixing. Wind, temperature, hydrometeor, and turbulent diffusion coefficient data from the cloud model simulations were provided for off-line 3-D cloud-scale chemical transport simulations discussed in the companion paper by DeCaria et al. (2005).

AB Introduction: Malaria is the largest cause of health services attendance, hospital admissions and child deaths in Tanzania. At the Abuja Summit in April 2000 Tanzania committed itself to protect 60% of its population at high risk of malaria by 2005. The country is, therefore, determined to ensure that sustainable malaria control using insecticide-treated nets is carried out on a national scale.
   Case description: Tanzania has been involved for two decades in the research process for developing insecticide-treated nets as a malaria control tool, from testing insecticides and net types, to assessing their efficacy and effectiveness, and exploring new ways of distribution. Since 2000, the emphasis has changed from a project approach to that of a concerted multi-stakeholder action for taking insecticide-treated nets to national scale (NATNETS). This means creating conditions that make insecticide-treated nets accessible and affordable to all those at risk of malaria in the country. This paper describes Tanzania's experience in ( 1) creating an enabling environment for insecticide-treated nets scale-up, ( 2) promoting the development of a commercial sector for insecticide-treated nets, and ( 3) targeting pregnant women with highly subsidized insecticide-treated nets through a national voucher scheme. As a result, nearly 2 million insecticide-treated nets and 2.2 million re-treatment kits were distributed in 2004.
   Conclusion: National upscaling of insecticide-treated nets is possible when the programme is well designed, coordinated and supported by committed stakeholders; the Abuja target of protecting 60% of those at high risk is feasible, even for large endemic countries.

AB The sustainability of indigenous Monterey pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) at Ano Nuevo stands in the central coast of California was examined. The foremost management objective in these stands is to establish and maintain stand structures that ensure a sustainable presence of the species in terms of uneven-aged management. The major threats are the proliferation of shade-tolerant tree species and the pitch canker (Fusarium circinatum) disease. The study was based on data from 17 systematically placed sample plots, measured once, in one stand with a very high degree of variation in stand structure and species composition. The results indicated that the sustainability of Monterey pine is not assured by existing stand structures. Monterey pine regeneration is almost completely lacking. Intensive shading and competition from high stand densities of shade-tolerant broadleaf trees are inhibiting regeneration, and growth of seedlings and saplings. Pitch canker is affecting growth, vigor, and competitive status of Monterey pine, but its progress and long-term impact remain unknown. Single tree or group selection cuttings, combined with treatments that enhance regeneration, are urgently required for the promotion of Monterey pine. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aphandra natalia (Balslev and Henderson) Barfod, an economically important fibre producing palm, is common in rainforest on low terraces along the Pastaza and Urituyacu rivers in Amazonian Peru. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution and environmental preferences of Aphandra in old-growth terrace forest to which it is limited in this region. Densities of immature and mature individuals were 507 +/- 212 (S.D.) ha(-1) and 19 +/- 8 ha(-1), respectively, in 11 (5 x 500 m) transects placed in old growth terrace forest near four villages and 739 +/- 188 ha(-1) and 96 +/- 49 ha(-1), respectively, in six irregular transects placed in what the local villagers considered dense Aphandra stands. We examined environmental and spatial correlates of Aphandra occurrences using stepwise multiple autologistic regressions. Site, soil moisture, slope inclination, and topographic position influenced the spatial distribution of Aphandra. Furthermore, the distribution was strongly clumped, independently of environmental factors, with particularly the concentration of immature individuals around adults pointing to dispersal limitation as the likely causal mechanism.

AB Forest harvesting may interfere with long-term ecosystem structure and function and different harvesting methods will differ in their effects on soil fertility (e.g. whole-tree harvesting versus stem removal). In the case of thinning, effects of thinning intensity, rotation length and site quality must be assessed in order to formulate sustainable management practices. Assessment of the relative impact of these practices is difficult, however, given the long temporal scales involved. In this study, we implement a process-based model of nutrient cycling to evaluate temporal changes in ecosystem nutrient dynamics of managed and non-managed forest stands. The model was specifically designed to asses differences between two contrasting site-quality Pinus sylvestris L. stands in the western Pyrenees (Navarre, Spain) managed under two thinning intensities. The model describes the main nutrient fluxes in the stand: litterfall, decomposition, retranslocation, root uptake and management type, and it was parameterized and verified with 3 years of field data. After model verification we examined the effects of thinning intensity, thinning frequency and harvesting method (whole-tree versus stem removal) on potential nutrient losses. The results suggest that in this heterogeneous region, sustainability of forestry practices is strongly site dependent. N and P were particularly sensitive to overexploitation and in no case could whole-tree removal be recommended as it may have a strong negative effect on nutrient reserves. In relation to previous nutrient cycling models, our model offers a satisfactory compromise between simplicity, biological realism and predictability, and it proved to be a useful tool to predict short-term changes in nutrient reserves as well as to evaluate possible negative effects of applying current thinning prescriptions on long-term sustainability of managed forests in the western Pyrenees.

AB In most developing countries, large-scale land use/cover changes are reported over the last few centuries. In most cases, it is attributed to the human population growth. To achieve conservation of biodiversity and ecological functions of natural ecosystem, large tracts were taken over by the Governments in many developing countries. This study analyses the spatial and temporal pattern of land use/cover change in a micro watershed in Central Himalaya, India, during 1967-1997 period based on interpretation of satellite data and using a geographic information system (GIs). During the last 30 years (i.e. 1967-1997) the forest cover was altered drastically with increasing population pressure (both human and animal), agricultural activities and raw material extraction activities. Agricultural expansion at the cost of loss of forest cover was the most prominent change in the forests managed by the people. In Government Reserve Forests, there was no agricultural expansion but changes in tree density and canopy cover were evident. Due to abandonment of large tracts of rainfed agricultural areas on slopping terraces in middle elevations, the area of culturable wastes increased while agricultural expansion at the expense of forests occurred and thus the total cultivated land stayed stagnant between 1971 and 1991. While environmental degradation resulted in low agricultural yields as well as poor fuelwood and fodder yields in most areas, diversification of agriculture in flood terraces in lower valleys due to Government development programmes improved agricultural participation. This study shows that while Government Forest Department is able to resist losses of areas under their control to agricultural expansion, change of vegetal cover indicates, they are not in a position to police the areas with broad leaved trees which are exploited by local inhabitants for their subsistence needs. This paper reiterates the argument that institutions play a crucial role in molding forested landscapes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A density-dependent matrix growth model was constructed for the dry woodlands of Uganda basing on material collected from 42 sample plots with 7904 trees. The model was based on functions for individual tree upgrowth and mortality, and area-based ingrowth, with explicatory variables representing tree size, stand density and stand structure. The trees were pooled into three species groups basing on ecological and morphological criteria. For all groups, parameter estimates for tree size and stand density were found highly significant (p < 0.001) in predicting diameter increment and mortality except stand density for the upper storey species group (p = 0.067), while stand structure was found highly significant only for the intermediate storey species group. Ingrowth was modelled by a two-stage approach. Parameter estimates for a logistic function predicting the probability of ingrowth were statistically significant (p < 0.05) only for the intermediate storey species group, while no conditional ingrowth functions were built for any species group. A visual evaluation of the individual functions was carried out and the matrix model in totality was evaluated by comparing the number of trees ha(-1) and basal area ha(-1) for each plot at the time of the second inventory with the model predictions. Although the data used for model evaluation was not independent, it was concluded that the model is a reliable and fairly accurate tool for prediction of growth of dry woodland trees in of Uganda. The model may become a useful tool for a sustainable management of these woodlands, which are an important source of bioenergy for consumers in several urban centres. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development; modelling; stochastic systems; optimisation
AB Earlier work on sustainable development devised a policy assessment tool that was based on a static optimisation formulation. Key ingredients in sustainable development problems are the presence of random effects and the conflict between different objectives. To accommodate these, the earlier formulation was strongly stochastic and was posed in a multi-objective framework. The purpose of this paper is to consider the extension of the work to a formulation that deploys dynamic optimisation. In particular it is the aim here to use simulations based on a large scale model to derive dynamic rather than static representations, to integrate these into the optimisation scheme and to assess the benefits.

AB The aim of biomass development projects is to identify whether it is possible to utilize biomass in the energy production sector by substituting a portion of conventional fuel by biomass to perform combined combustion. Electricity production from biomass has been found to be a promising method in the near future. The world production of biomass is estimated at 146 billion metric tons a year, mostly wild plant growth. Biomass accounts for 35% of primary energy consumption in developing countries, raising the world total to 14% of primary energy consumption. In the future, biomass has the potential to provide a cost-effective and sustainable supply of energy, while at the same time aiding countries in meeting their greenhouse gas reduction targets. By the year 2050, it is estimated that 90% of the world population will live in developing countries.

AB Deterioration in water quality caused by the movement of excessive soil P has created a condition necessary for the development of a sustainable P remediation technology. In this investigation, the phytoremediation potential of Gulf and Marshall ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) grown in a greenhouse was determined under varying conditions of soil P concentration, pH, and temperature. Both genotypes demonstrated P accumulations >= 1% shoot dry weight depending on soil P concentrations (0-10 g of P/kg of soil), with higher shoot P in Gulf than Marshall ryegrass. An increase in plant biomass was proportional to the increasing concentrations of P up to a level of 10 g of P/kg of soil. The effect of soil pH on plant uptake of P was noticeable with a significant rise in shoot P in acidic soil (pH 5.6) as compared to soil with pH 7.8. Significant differences were observed in the biomass productivity and shoot P accumulation at varying temperatures in both grass types. The patterns of acid phosphomonoesterase and phytase activities in plant roots were interesting, activities being 2-fold higher in alkaline soil than acidic soil in both genotypes. The effect of P supply on the enzyme activity was also distinct, as plants growing in a high P concentration showed higher activity (nearly 30%) than those growing under P deficiency conditions (with no addition of P). These results indicate that Gulf and Marshall ryegrass can accumulate high P under optimal conditions and thus reduce soil P concentrations in successive cropping.

AB The cost of carbon substrates for microbial reduction of perchlorate (Clo(4)(-)) is central to the success and competitiveness of a sustainable bioremediation strategy for ClO4-. This study explored the potential application of starch in combination with an amylolytic bacterial consortia and potato peel waste for ClO4- bioreduction. We obtained a potent amylolytic bacterial consortium that consisted of a Citrobacter sp. S4, Streptomyces sp. S2, Flavobacterium sp. S6, Pseudoxanthomonas sp. S5, Streptomyces sp. S7, and an Aeromonas sp. S8 identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. ClO4- concentration substantially decreased in purified starch medium inoculated with the amylolytic bacterial consortium and Dechlorosoma sp. perclace. Potato peel waste supported ClO ((4)) over bar reduction by perclace with the rate of ClO4- reduction being dependent on the amount of potato peels. Over 90% ClO4- removal was achieved in 4 days in a single time point experiment with 2% (w/v) potato peels waste. ClO4- reduction in a non-sterile 0.5% potato peel media inoculated with perclace occurred with an initial concentration of 10.14 +/- 0.04 mg L-1 to 2.87 +/- 0.4 mg L-1 (71.7% reduction) within 5 days. ClO4- was not detected in the cultures in 6 days. In a non-sterile 0.5% potato media without perclace, ClO4- depletion occurred slowly from an initial value of 9.99 +/- 0.15 mg L-1 to 6.33 +/- 0.43 mg L-1 (36.63% reduction) in 5 days. Thereafter, ClO4- was rapidly degraded achieving 77.1% reduction in 7 days and not detected in 9 days. No susbstantial reduction of ClO4- was observed in the sterile potato peel media without perclace in 7 days. Redox potential of the potato peel cultures was favorable for ClO4- reduction, decreasing to as low as -294 mV in 24 h. Sugar levels remained very low in cultures effectively reducing ClO4- and was substantially higher in sterilized controls. Our results indicate that potato peel waste in combination with amylolytic microorganisms and Dechlorosoma sp. perclace can be economically used to achieve complete ClO4- removal from water.

AB Wastewater reuse presents a promising solution to the growing pressure on water resources. However, wastewater reuse implementation faces obstacles that include insufficient public acceptance, technical, economic and hygienic risks and further uncertainties caused by a lack of awareness, accepted standards, uniform guidelines and legislation. So far, there are no supra-national regulations on water reuse in Europe and further development is slowed by lack of widely accepted standards, e.g. in terms of required water quality, treatment technology and distribution system design and operation. Treatment technology encompasses a vast number of options and membrane processes are regarded as key elements of advanced wastewater reclamation and reuse schemes and are included in a number of prominent schemes world-wide, e.g. for artificial groundwater recharge, indirect potable reuse as well as for industrial process water production. For dual reticulation purposes in urban areas two types of systems have been built, a centralised type of treatment with dual membrane processes, including e.g. microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO), and small scale systems using membrane bioreactors. This paper will provide an overview of the status of membranes processes in wastewater reclamation and reuse world-wide and will depict their potential role in promoting more sustainable water use patterns.

AB Fouling is the major obstacle in membrane processes applied in water and wastewater treatment. To improve the efficiency, a sustainable membrane cleaning procedure is required as well as the determination of fouling reducing operating conditions. Those depend on many parameters such as membrane surface properties, module design and the characteristics of the water to be treated and reliable analytical methods are essential. This study deals with the removal of foulants from polyethersulfone hollow fibres integrated in drinking and wastewater treatment. Membrane samples were taken from pilot-scale plants and cleaned in bench-scale tests using water, NaOH, H2SO4, NaOCl and H2O2. LC-OCD was used successfully to compare the chemical cleaning solutions, regarding their potential to wash off major foulants. The second aspect of this study is fouling prevention by means of membrane modification. Two modification methods, O-2-Plasma and Corona Treatment, were selected for long-term fouling trials in pilot scale under real operating conditions. After about one month of stable operation, membrane samples were taken and also cleaned with the chemical solutions mentioned above. The results of these experiments show that LC-OCD is not only suitable for describing a cleaning solution's efficiency but also for analysis of the adsorption affinity for foulants of unmodified and modified membranes.

AB Propane fuel cells using H3PO4-doped polybenzimidazole polymer membranes produce low and unsustainable current densities at temperatures up to 250 degrees C under anhydrous conditions. Stable intermediate species blocked the surface of noble metal anode catalysts, and the intermediate species could not react further into desorbable final products. In contrast, when water was introduced by light humidification (S-r 0.08%) of the propane stream, sustainable and higher current densities were achieved. Water participated in the reaction sequence to form surface-bound hydrocarbon and then oxygen-containing intermediates and thereby generated CO and CO2 as the only carbon-containing products.

ID FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS; STOCK; CONSTRAINTS
AB This paper examines the conditions under which the market responds to disclosures of significant increases in short selling, and whether proxies for earnings expectations and alternative information sources help explain this response. Our sample is based on firms that experience abnormal short interest increases ("short spikes") during 1989-1998. We find that the mean abnormal return around short spike announcements is significantly more negative for firms with low analyst following, consistent with short sellers providing perceived value when there are limited alternative sources of guidance available. For firms with high analyst following we find the market response is dependent on earnings levels, consistent with investors viewing a short interest increase as providing information about the sustainability of earnings. Additional analyses reveal that these inferences are not affected by measures of firms' earnings quality or by the relative size of the short spike. We infer from our analyses that the information content of short interest disclosures is conditional on both the firms' existing information environment and expectations of future performance as conveyed by prior earnings. This inference is consistent with short sellers' role as information intermediaries covering the lower tail of earnings expectations.

AB Sustainable development is the new design of an old concept, now emerging from the acute endangering of our habitat. Coined by the Brundlandt Commission in 1987, sustainable development was defined as 'Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' (World commission on Environment and Development, Our Common Future, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1987). It appeared on the world stage during the UNO Earth Summit in Rio, 1992. Sustainability became the key term of the 'Agenda 21' (United Nations Conference for Education and Development, Earth Summit, Agenda 21, The United Nations Programme of action for Sustainable Development, United Nations, New York, 1992). The 'Agenda 21' is adopted by 178 states, although to date not all signatories have ratified the Agenda. Sustainable solutions should aim to harmonize ecological equilibrium, economic stability, and social harmony. But in the course of the years, the interpretation of the concept became more and more complicated and its context is becoming fuzzy.

AB A long-term goal of space exploration is the development of a lunar settlement that will not only be largely self-sufficient but also contribute to the economy of the Earth-Moon system. Proposals for lunar mining and materials processing developments, as well as tourism-based applications, have appeared in the literature for many years.
   However, so great are the technical and financial difficulties associated with sustained lunar development that, more than 30 years after the end of the Apollo programme, there have been no practical advances towards this goal. While this may soon be remedied by a series of proposed unmanned orbiters, landers and rovers, the philosophy of lunar exploration and development remains the same as it has for decades: conquer, exploit, and ignore the consequences.
   By contrasting the well-recognised problems of Earth orbital debris and the barely recognised issue of intentional spacecraft impacts on the lunar surface, this paper illustrates the need for a new model for lunar exploration and development.
   This new paradigm would assign a value to the lunar environment and provide a balance between protection and exploitation, creating, in effect, a philosophy of sustainable development for the Moon. It is suggested that this new philosophy should be an integral part of any future strategy for lunar colonisation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Projects to use very high resolution optical satellite sensor data started in the late 90s and are believed to be the major driver for the commercialisation of earth observation. The global political security situation and updated legislative frameworks created new opportunities for high resolution, dual use satellite systems. In addition to new optical sensors, very high resolution synthetic aperture radars will become in the next few years an important component in the imaging satellite fleet.
   The paper will review the development in this domain so far, and give perspectives on future emerging markets and opportunities. With dual-use satellite initiatives and new political frameworks agreed between the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA), the European market becomes very attractive for both service suppliers and customers. The political focus on "Global Monitoring for Environment and Security" (GMES) and the "European Defence and Security Policy" drive and amplify this demand which ranges from low resolution climate monitoring to very high resolution reconnaissance tasks.
   In order to create an operational and sustainable GMES in Europe by 2007, the European infrastructure need to be adapted and extended. This includes the ESA SENTINEL and OXYGEN programmes, aiming for a fleet of earth observation satellites and an open and operational earth observation ground segment. The harmonisation of national and regional geographic information is driven by the European Commission's INSPIRE programme. The necessary satellite capacity to complement existing systems in the delivery of space based data required for GMES is currently under definition.
   Embedded in a market with global competition and in the global political framework of a Global Earth Observation System of Systems, European companies, agencies and research institutions are now contributing to this joint undertaking. The paper addresses the chances, risks and options for the future. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB One of the defining attributes of the Vision for Space Exploration is its emphasis on affordability, which is also linked to another key attribute-long-term sustainability. As applied to space-lift requirements, this overriding constraint may argue for system choices not optimized for architectural elegance but, rather, for lowest development or recurring cost. Affordability constrains most projects and, second only to safety, may be the most important factor in the success of the Vision for Space Exploration. Finding the most affordable space launch approach and designing the architecture for cost may be the key to shaping the overall exploration architecture for success.

AB Highly active Pd/diphosphine catalytic systems incorporating new, air-stable ferrocenyl-furyl-phosphines allow nucleophilic allylic amination at room temperature with unprecedented turnover frequencies. For instance, in the presence of 0.01 mol % catalyst the coupling of aniline to allyl acetate occurs at a TOF of more than 10,000 h(-1); even the addition of the less nucleophile morpholine to allyl acetate is observed with a TOF of 4250 h(-1). The amination of the sterically demanding geranyl acetate, a monoterpene derivative of interest in the flavour industry, at low catalyst loadings demonstrates the scope of this methodology, which provides in addition noticeable advantages in terms of economical (resource- and energy-saving) and sustainable chemistry (high selectivity, no additive, low metal content, and thus easier purification).

AB Critical caring has been proposed as a mid-range theory to guide public health nursing. One of its carative health promoting processes, contributing to the creation of supportive and sustainable physical, social, political, and economic environments, is particularly suited to enacting Nightingale's legacy of political action as an expression of caring. Increasing evidence supports the link between broad societal influences on health inequities. Relative and absolute poverty are significant influences on health and contribute significantly to differential health statuses of populations within and between countries. Nurses, who practice at the intersection of public policy and personal lives, are, therefore, ideally situated and morally obligated to include political advocacy and efforts to influence health public policy in their practice. The health of the public and the future of the profession may depend on it.

FSIs are calculated for the fanning sector in all 50 states and large variation in farm size across the states and over time is determined. The largest FSIs are calculated for a number of Southern, Southwestern, and Pacific states. Increasing FSIs over time are observed in all states as well. The spatial and temporal (between 1987 and 1997) differences in FSIs are explained by running a pooled, cross-sectional time-series model. The most influential variables accounting for the differences have to do with the ownership structure, where a larger presence of individual and family farms relative to corporate farms and cooperatives leads to a lower degree of farm size inequality. Also, states and regions having relatively larger number of farms owned by minorities have higher FSIs. Shrinking opportunities in the agricultural sector relative to the rest of the economy, primarily services, are reflected in a declining share of agricultural sector state income in total gross state product (GSP). This in turn leads to an increase in the fanning sector's FSI suggesting that only larger, more profitable operations are the likely candidates to pursue farming activities. Finally, grains farming regions have all lower degree of farm size inequality than livestock or fruits and vegetables regions. Profitable grains farming requires relatively large farm size and equipment investments, which leads to a relatively homogeneous structure of grains farms. A larger variation in the size of profitable farm operations is possible in fruits and vegetables and livestock. This leads to the existence of a large number of very small but still sustainable farms, and a relatively small number of large farms that capture most of market sales share.

AB This article is concerned with soil-sustainability problems of agriculture in developing countries, in particular with soil erosion. The aim of our study is to develop a comprehensive model that explains the adoption Of Sustainable agricultural practices with respect to soil conservation. Our approach includes the following special features: (a) the model is comprehensive in that it includes a large number of institutional, personal-social, economic, and physical explanatory variables; (b) particular attention is paid to the influence of marketing systems on the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, which to our knowledge has been neglected in past research; (c) the concept of adopting sustainable agricultural practices (ASAP) is differentiated into a limited number of basic components of soil conservation; and (d) the model is estimated by Principal Component Regression, which enhances efficient estimation of the impact of many explanatory variables on ASAP. Our model is applied to Cabuyal hillside farming in Colombia. The application demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed model. ASAP is differentiated into three basic components: soil-disturbance control, soil-protection practices, and run-off control. It appears that soil-distarbance control is particularly influenced by farmers' characteristics, such as education and managerial variables. The second component, soil-protection practices, appears to be strongly influenced not only by farmers' managerial variables but also by their relationship with their environment, in particular marketing institutions. The third soil-conservation component, run-off control, is influenced by the physical characteristics of the plot and by the available farm labor. Our empirical results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model in designing agricultural policies, because it can determine which variables are more likely to influence the adoption of a specific type of soil conservation.

TI A study of the impact of direct trade on Taiwan's fishery sector with
   special reference to the effect of China's WTO accession

ID AGRICULTURE; MARKETS
AB After Taiwan became a member of the WTO in 2002, its tariff rates for fishery products decreased by an average of 35.5% from the level in 2001. Direct imports of fishery products from China would be allowed in 2004. These tariff reductions and the relaxation of import restrictions will have a strong effect on Taiwan's fishery sector. In this paper, we present an analysis of how fishery production, prices, input usage, and welfare distribution might react to trade liberalization. In addition to evaluating the overall impact of tariff reduction on Taiwan's fishery sector, we assess the effects of China's WTO accession on the Taiwanese market. We use a fishery sector equilibrium model in which 40 products and 68 fishing activities are identified. The model also includes an import-export subsector, a factor input subsector, and a supply-demand equilibrium condition to analyze the distributions of social welfare due to trade liberalization. Three simulations are conducted to investigate the impact of tariff reductions in 2004, 2 years after Taiwan has jointed the WTO. The results indicate that Taiwan's fishery sector will be adversely affected when it encounters the extremely low import prices of certain fishery products from China. The total production of the fishery sector and its value are predicted to decrease by 4.03% and 9.96%, respectively, in 2004. Aquaculture would suffer the heaviest loss with a 7.48% reduction in the production and a 19.23% reduction in its value. The demand for labor will decrease by 8.71%. The effect is most pronounced in aquaculture in which the demand for labor will go down by 11.40% and the wage rate will decline by 14.28%. To meet the challenge of globalization, the Taiwanese fishery industry will have to diversify, and improve its operational efficiency as well as production and distribution structures for a sustainable development.

AB Increased water use in the Hebei Plain during the last decades has caused serious groundwater level decline and many geological problems which have become the biggest threat to social-economic sustainability. Thus, to determine the factors resulting in the groundwater decline and to develop a practical plan for long-term groundwater use appear to be necessary in this region. In this paper, a water balance model is used in conjunction with regression techniques to estimate the groundwater recharge coefficient and the specific yield (defined as the ratio of the volume of water that a saturated rock or soil will release by gravity drainage to the volume of rock or soil) and the groundwater withdrawn by different water use sectors and the corresponding drop in the watertable are analyzed. The decline in water-table by different crops and water economic benefit of crops are discussed in detail in order to suggest sustainable use of groundwater resources in the Hebei Plain. Finally, sample policy scenarios are developed to show how groundwater in the Hebei Plain could be used in a sustainable manner. In our study, it is found that agriculture is the major consumer of groundwater, with about 85% of the total groundwater withdrawals, and groundwater depletion is mainly caused by agricultural water use. Production of winter wheat exerts a great negative influence on the groundwater system. Winter wheat is the most water consuming crop and result in significant decline of groundwater table. Water economic benefit of winter wheat is lower than that of other crops and withdrawing winter wheat sown area is rational option to make sustainable use of groundwater. With far-sighted and regional planning, the limited water resource can be used sustainably to generate maximum social benefits. This paper will provide information necessary for land-use planning in a severe water shortage region where farmland is mainly irrigated by groundwater. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cogongrass [Imperata cylindrica (L.) Raeusch.] is a major weed in the tropics where land is intensively cultivated and fallow duration is less than 5 yr. Field studies were conducted in 1999 and 2000 in Nigeria to evaluate cogongrass response to combinations of five weed control options. Treatment combinations were tillage (hoe tillage and no-tillage), corn (Zea mays L.), row spacing (50 and 75 cm), corn cultivar [open-pollinated (OP) and hybrid], herbicide (glyphosate and no glyphosate), and cover crop (velvetbean [Mucuna cochinchinensis (Lour) A. Chev] and no velvetbean). The treatment combinations were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Integrating tillage, herbicide, and cover cropping with velvetbean gave optimal control of cogongrass. Corn height and leaf area were negatively correlated with cogongrass shoot, rhizome, and total biomass. Corn grain yield was negatively correlated with cogongrass shoot biomass and total cogongrass biomass (shoot + rhizome). Good control of other weeds was achieved through the use of narrow corn row spacing and cover cropping with velvetbean. Tillage, narrow corn row spacing, and the use of herbicide had a positive effect on corn grain yield. The use of competitive cultivars, narrow row spacing, cover crop, and herbicide may be sustainable approaches to the control of cogongrass and other weeds in corn.

AB Legume pasture is rotated with wheat (Triticum spp.) to enhance grain production sustainability. The legume species maintain or enhance wheat yield and regenerate from the soil seed bank. Our objectives were to determine: (i) grain yield when wheat followed legume forages and (ii) if legume species regenerated naturally following wheat in western North Dakota. Ten to 30 legume species were established in field experiments in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Legumes that regenerated or persisted in the second year were terminated chemically before seeding wheat in the third year. Plots were fallowed in the second year where legumes failed to regenerate or persist. Grain yield ranged from 1290 to 4100 kg ha(-1) across the 3 yr when wheat followed yellow-flowered sweetclover (Melitotus officinalis Lam.) and was equal or enhanced compared with fallowed plots where legumes did not reseed in 2 yr (P < 0.05). Grain yield never was enhanced and sometimes was reduced when wheat followed other legume forages compared with fallowed plots. Legume seedlings regenerated following wheat in birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) plots in all 3 yr, and forage production exceeded 3 Mg ha(-1) in 2 yr. Other legume species failed to regenerate or produced less forage than birdsfoot trefoil in at least I yr. Birdsfoot trefoil has potential as a regenerating pasture species, but strategies are needed to enhance grain yield in legume-wheat rotations.

AB Dicksonia sellowiana spores were cultivated in mineral solution. After 30 days, young gametophytes were transferred to different substrates: soil rich in organic matter; coxim: coconut fiber; sterilized red soil; sterilized red soil with the addition of organic compost, to determine the best substrate for gametophytes' and sporophytes' development. Red soil with the addition of compost was the best system for growth. When sporophytes were 1.5-2.0 cm in height, they were transferred to pots containing sterilized red soil with the addition of organic compost and kept in the field for 42 days, under 75, 50, 10 and 3% of irradiance, The longest frond height, frond quantity, fresh and dry mass, and RGR were observed in plants growing in 10% of irradiance. Plants kept under 100% irradiance died after 3 days, and under 50% and 75% irradiance they died gradually after 30 days. The fresh mass/dry mass ratio was higher at 3% and lower at 30% irradiance. The levels of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were higher in the plants grown at 3% irradiance. The levels of chlorophyll did not vary between 10 and 30% irradiance, with the exception of chlorophyll a, which was lower under 30% irradiance. The chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b ratio did not vary among treatments. This study provides information for the cultivation of Dicksonia sellowiana with special attention to conservation and sustainable management.

AB Sustainable nutrient management involves a set of management practices designed to conserve soil resources, to maintain or enhance productivity, and to help reduce growers' reliance on chemical fertilizers. Sustainable nutrient management systems will most certainly rely heavily on the use of legume rotation crops and/or organic soil amendments. To realize the full benefit to the crop ecosystem, sustainable nutrient management programs will also likely require longer crop rotations with less frequent potato production. There is considerable research evidence indicating that these systems can maintain or increase productivity while having positive impacts on nutrient supply, soil physical properties, and soil conservation. However, their successful adoption and continued use on a large scale will require resolution of uncertainties related to economic risk associated with inconsistent nutrient availability in alternative nutrient management systems, potential environmental risks associated with excessive P applications in animal manures, and the potential for increased potato pest incidence resulting from manure application.

AB Understanding the total lymphocyte count (TLC)-CD4 count relationship could aide design predictive instruments for making clinical decisions during antiretroviral therapy, especially in underserved resource-poor settings. We performed multiple regression analyses to assess the prediction of CD4 count using TLC on 771 participants with 4,836 visits. In linear and logistic regression TLC, hemoglobin, gender, history of AIDS, and weight predicted CD4 count and CD4 < 200, respectively, before and after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use. On HAART, the adjusted odds ratios (OR) for TLC < 1500 (optimal TLC cutoff) were 5.1 (95%CI 4.0 6.5; P < 0.001), and off HAART, 4.6 (95%CI 3.4, 6.2: P < 0.001) with high predictive power. TLC predicts CD4 count and CD4 < 200 cells/mu L well during HAART. Including the additional factors improves performance. TLC is simple and inexpensive and can be used in many ways to develop clinical decision-making tools in underserved resource-poor settings during HAART therapy.

AB center dot Background and Aims The use of perennial crops could contribute to increase agricultural sustainability. However, almost all of the major grain crops are herbaceous annuals and opportunities to replace them with more long-lived perennials have been poorly explored. This follows the presumption that the perennial life cycle is associated with a lower potential yield, due to a reduced allocation of biomass to grains. The hypothesis was tested that allocation to perpetuation organs in the perennial L. mendocina would not be directly related to a lower allocation to seeds.
   center dot Methods Two field experiments were carried on with the annual Lesquerella fendleri and the iteroparous perennial L. mendocina, two promising oil-seed crops for low-productivity environments, subjected to different water and nitrogen availability.
   center dot Key Results Seed biomass allocation was similar for both species, and unresponsive to water and nitrogen availability. Greater root and vegetative shoot allocation in the perennial was counterbalanced by a lower allocation to other reproductive structures compared with the annual Lesquerella. Allometrie relationships revealed that allocation differences between the annual and the perennial increased linearly with plant size. The general allocation patterns for nitrogen did not differ from those of biomass. However, nitrogen concentrations were higher in the vegetative shoot and root of L. mendocina than of L fendleri but remained stable in seeds of both species.
   center dot Conclusions It is concluded that vegetative organs are more hierarchically important sinks in L. mendocina than in the annual L fendleri, but without disadvantages in seed hierarchy.

ID SOLID-LIQUID SEPARATION; SWINE MANURE; EFFICIENCY
AB Increasing livestock production and regulation of the amount of phosphorus (P) that may be applied to arable land may force livestock farmers to transport animal manure over long distances if plant nutrients in the manure are to be used in a sustainable way. Animal slurry contains large amounts of water and therefore transport costs can be reduced by separating the P from a high volume of slurry into a small dry-matter- and P-rich solid fraction. This study tested different combinations of coagulants (ferric salts) and flocculants (polyacrylamide polymers) that can contribute to an efficient retention of P in a solid fraction. The laboratory studies showed that 98% of the P in slurry was retained in the solid fraction retained on the filter net (12% to 28% retained W:W) after the addition of coagulants and flocculants. Linear cationic polyacrylamide polymers proved to be more efficient at lower dosages than branched polyacrylamide polymers or anionic polymers. More water was retained by using Fe-2(SO4)(3) as the coagulant and the amount of water increased with increasing amounts of Fe-2(SO4)(3) added to slurry (18% to 28%), in contrast to the addition of FeCl3 which retained less water irrespective of the amounts added (12% to 18%). The cost of an efficient separation of slurry using coagulants and flocculants and including the cost of screw press separation was estimated to be $2.4 m(-3) slurry.
