AB An overview of ligand design in the field of coordination chemistry is presented in a perspective format. Four major areas in coordination chemistry, where design and synthesis of ligands are crucial, are reviewed. We show that for successes in research leading towards new catalysts, new materials, insight is biocatalysis and for a sustainable environment, controlled ligand design is a crucial element.

AB The spatial distribution and standing crop of the ciliate community were investigated in the East China Sea during February to March 1993, September to October 1993, and July to August 1994. During these three periods, the ciliate community was dominated by aloricate forms, accounting for 50-93% of the total number of ciliates. All aloricate ciliates were assigned to three groups based on their trophic function: autotrophic ciliates (AC), mixotrophic ciliates (MC), and heterotrophic ciliates (HC). Sometimes AC constituted a sizable part of the ciliate community in abundance, but they were always less important in terms of biomass. MC, represented by oligotrichs of the genera Strombidium, Tontonia, and Laboea, were always a significant component in the upper water column and usually dominated during stratified periods in summer and autumn. HC were mainly comprised of oligotrichs of the genera Strombidium, Strobilidium, and Lohmaniella. They were common and most abundant in winter. Tintinnid ciliates (TC) were a minor component of the ciliate community, but they included of a large number of species, i.e. 74 species from 27 genera for all intact loricae in all seasons. The standing crop of total ciliates varied with depth and season from <10 to 4180 cells 1(-1) and <0.01 to 6.25 mug C 1(-1). Integrated values of total ciliates, ranging from 7.9 to 54.3 x 106 cells m(-2) in abundance and from 8.5 to 136.3 mg C m(-2) in biomass, were similar to those recorded from tropical and subtropical oligotrophic systems. Based on the results obtained by this first quantitative investigation on planktonic ciliates, their production, ingestion and excretion were calculated. Potential ingestion rates and their impact on reported primary production ranged, respectively, from 14% to 86%, except for the inner shelf where the impact was only 3% in the inner shelf waters in winter. NH4+ excretion rates of ciliates were estimated to be 0.1-63.8 mg N m(-2) d(-1), equivalent to 0.1-93.8% of the nitrogen requirement by primary producers. These values suggest that the nitrogen excretion by ciliates could be significant contribution to sustainable primary productivity during summer and autumn. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The uptake of atmospheric CO(2) by the oceans via the biological pump and the sustainability of fish catch are driven by new production of organic matter and its export into deep waters or its consumption by organisms of higher tropic level. The f-ratio based on (15)N measurements of discrete samples for continental shelf waters is around 0.4. However, the system-level constraints imposed by mass balance indicate that this f-ratio may be too high. Specifically, it is more than twice as the value determined on the basis of net export of organic carbon. Such a discrepancy is caused by the fact that, unlike the open-ocean system where remineralized nutrients below the euphotic zone do not return easily, the remineralized nutrients on the shelf reenter the euphotic zone quickly. Since new production based on direct (15)N measurements on the shelf actually utilizes nutrients remineralized on the shelf as well, the value is higher than the net export of organic carbon sustained on external sources of nutrients. It is the net export of carbon, however, that sequesters CO(2) and sustains productivity on the shelf. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB The paper presents a model intended to define and discuss the sustainability of external debts in "emergent markets." The first sustainability condition is the existence of a maximum in the debt-output ratio. With some simple behavior hypotheses it is shown that sustainability depends on the initial debt-exports ratio, the rate of growth of exports and the country-risk premium. An endogenous country-risk premium gives room for multiple equilibrium. The model allows the discussion of vulnerability vis-a-vis financial shocks and the propensity of the economy to jump to unsustainable paths. The first sustainability condition is not a stringent one. Two additional sustainability conditions are added: a positive rate of growth and a minimum in the domestic absorption-output ratio. The discussion of multiple equilibrium, vulnerability and the potential instability of sustainability is then extended.

DT Article
DE Bauhaus; digital aesthetics; Digital Bauhaus; modernism; sustainability
AB An emerging concept of a Digital Bauhaus is described, based around interdisciplinary practices and creative and socially useful products. A short history of the relevant aspects of the original Bauhaus is provided. Three ideas are developed with reference to both this history and contemporary issues. The first concerns a digital aesthetics or style and particularly how we can transcend the simple geometry typical of Bauhaus products. The second concerns the difficulties of genuine collaboration between the creative arts and technology. The third concerns the ethical and political responsibility of design in creating an environment that shapes the lives of others. In this, there is a need to go beyond the materialism of the Bauhaus period and to replace it with the idea of sustainability. The virtuality inherent in digital technologies makes this a distinct possibility.

TI Designing and evaluating health promotion programs - Simple rules for a
   complex issue
SO DISEASE MANAGEMENT & HEALTH OUTCOMES
LA English
DT Article
AB Health improvement planning models exist to support strategic management of health improvement efforts and to guide program administrators in taking a comprehensive approach to health promotion planning from problem identification to program evaluation and diffusion. This article outlines a model which follows four simple steps to program design and four simple steps to program evaluation.
   The first phase is characterized as the 4-Ss of program design, which includes size, scope, scalability, and sustainability.
   The second phase is characterized as the penetration, implementation, participation and effectiveness (PIPE) Impact Metric. Penetration refers to the proportion of the target population that is reached with invitations to engage in the program or intervention. Implementation refers to the degree to which the program has been implemented according to the design specifications and the associated work plans. Participation refers to the proportion of invited individuals who enroll in the program according to program protocol. Effectiveness refers to the rate of successful participants. It is considered in the context of programming conducted in the real-world setting. The product of all elements of the PIPE Impact Metric can be calculated to represent the impact from a program administration perspective, while the product of participation and effectiveness can be calculated to represent the impact of the program from a user/consumer perspective.
   The model is designed to inform program administrators about Opportunities for improvement. First, administrative impact can be compared with user/consurner impact. Secondly, the PIPE Impact Metric total score, as well as its individual subscores, should be considered in the context of the 4-Ss of program design.
   This model has been derived from work conducted in the applied setting, however it is based on scientific theory and appears congruent with findings from existing, but more complicated, models. The results of the application of the model indicate the presence of a simple set of rules related to critical health improvement program design and evaluation features. Whereas additional experience with the model will allow for further modifications and evolution, early experience indicates it serves program planners and administrators well in terms of systematic program improvement and documentation of effort and impact.

AB There are several unmet needs for the appropriate and effective control of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), namely rapid onset of action; effectiveness in disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-resistant disease, including improvements in signs and symptoms, disability, quality of life and radiographic progression; sustainability of response; and a good risk/benefit ratio. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists appear to address these needs and consequently have set a new therapeutic standard for the treatment of RA and have made it possible for rheumatologists to target remission as a primary therapeutic goal.

TI Care for the elderly in Croatia - The need for new models
SO DRUSTVENA ISTRAZIVANJA
LA Croatian
DT Article
AB The increase in absolute and proportionate numbers of elderly people in the population has become the most outstanding demographic trend in the world during the past few decades. Social consequences of such a demographic trend are manifold and they require early planning of optimal types of care for the elderly. Two basic principles need to be obeyed in the planning of care for the elderly: the principle of humanistic approach - according to which care must be organised in a way to preserve social participation and dignity of older people, and the principle of the necessity of sustainable social development, i.e. that the efforts in improving the quality of living of elderly generations do not aggravate economic development of society as a whole. New models of care should satisfy both principles. For these and for reasons of individual differences in the needs of the elderly, only the decentralised, de-institutionalised and care-oriented toward local resources can satisfy all principles of care for the elderly. Stimulating the development of such models of non-institutional care for the elderly is an imperative to all societies which already have or expect to have a great increase in the percentage of old people. Based on the 2001 census, there are 15.7% of people older than 65 years of age in Croatia, and a great increase is expected in the next ten years. Therefore the planning of new models of comprehensive care for the elderly is of top priority today. Beside the already existing institutional care facilities, which will always be necessary for the oldest categories of the chronically ill and those with functionally diminished capacity, the new forms of care for the elderly should be developed, particularly the noninstitutional ones relying on the family and local community, the models that would satisfy the principles of independence, social participation and respect for the dignity of an elderly individual, but at the same time would not be a financial burden to society to the extent that might hinder economic development. In such a decentralised model of care the most important role in the future should be that of non-governmental civic organisations, components of modern civil society.

AB Pakistan has a long history of running fiscal deficits. There are two broad considerations motivating a government to run a deficit - tax smoothing and tax tilting. Tax-smoothing behavior results in fiscal deficits because in the presence of non-lump-sum taxes, optimizing governments seek to minimize the distortionary effects of taxation by keeping tax rates smooth over time, rather than varying contemporaneously with expenditure. Even if we assume that expenditures will remain constant over time, obviating the need for tax smoothing, fiscal deficits may arise due to tax-tilting behavior if the government's discount rate differs from the effective interest rate, as then there is an incentive to shift (tilt) taxation across time. This paper tests a version of Barro's tax-smoothing model, using Pakistan data for the period 1956-1995. The empirical results indicate that Pakistan's fiscal behavior is consistent with tax smoothing, as taxes remained relatively constant in response to anticipated changes in expenditure, most likely due to the government's inability to raise revenue. In addition, its fiscal behavior has been dominated by the stagnation of revenues, large tax-tilting-induced deficits, and the consequent accumulation of excessive public liabilities. An analysis of the time-series characteristics of tax-tilting behavior indicates that the stock of public liabilities is unsustainable under unchanged fiscal policies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO EDUCATIONAL POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE public policy; college finance; college participation
AB This article compares universal and targeted program designs in the federal and state programs to encourage participation in higher education. It begins by reviewing the policy design literature in political science. Then, using that literature, it compares the experiences of universally designed state policies (subsidies for low tuition) and talgeted state policies (high-tuition/high-aid funding). It also compares the experience of a universally designed federal program (Pell Grants) with a targeted program (Stafford Loans). The analysis concludes that design had only a limited impact on program sustainability. However the federal loan programs seemed more sustainable than the Pell Grant. Finally, the article notes the rise of a new design strategy, reverse targeting, evident in the state merit scholarship and federal tax credit programs. This design seems more politically popular than either of the conventional designs.

DE ICT; skill gap; small and medium sized companies; staff development
AB This paper shows the results of a detailed skills audit and skills gap analysis among some 380 people from 38 small or medium sized companies in the South East of England, UK. Most participants reported that their own abilities were consistent with the needs of their jobs in most areas of basic software use ( word processing, database use, spreadsheet use and e-mail), but not presentation and graphics. However, peripheral ICT skills such as browser skills, an ability to select appropriate software for new tasks, a knowledge of computing networks and operating systems management skills were all commonly held to be significant skills gaps. These topics should be the focus for significant staff development and training in innovative firms. More often than not, website authorship and management skills levels were low but few people considered that this topic was necessary for them to do their job effectively. The results are discussed in the context of the widely held contention that lifelong learning and skills development is key to the competitiveness and sustainable growth of firms in the UK.

AB The main issues that have been addressed in the Costa Rican government's policy for low-volume rural roads are discussed. As in most developing countries, providing good roads to support the growing demand for agricultural and tourism activities has been a great challenge, especially in times of important budget limitations. The Costa Rican experience is shared in the hope that it can prove useful in other countries, because its impact has not been limited to just providing better roads; it is also helping to motivate widespread citizen participation and to improve technical and organizational capabilities of the local governments. Because the majority of the rural roads are managed by local governments, whose administrative and technical capacity has been limited in the past, the central government, through the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation, has developed a comprehensive policy based on simple technology transfer programs and regulations for these organizations, while at the same time inducing a method of investment planning that requires organized citizen participation. The program, called Participative Road Conservation, has become the center of the government's policy. Some of the highlights of the program are presented. The strategy of the program has been to give straightforward guidelines in organizational issues of road maintenance at the local government level (including the local road committees), basic technical standards to be followed, and planning methodologies. One of the fundamental principles of the program is the sharing of responsibilities for adequate road maintenance, including financial contributions, among the communities, the local government, and the central government. This policy for sustainable rural roads is making a change in the road maintenance culture of the country. It has required educational programs concerning the importance of roads, the correct way to build and maintain them, adequate control of the work, and so forth. Once the community is involved in planning and rehabilitating a road, it is more likely that the road will not be allowed to deteriorate again. Even children are involved in a program of school patrols. The financial reforms that have been made in Costa Rica to attend to the needs of the national and municipal road systems are also addressed.

AB Over the past two decades, the changing transport demands of agriculture and rural industry and the strategic rail decisions that resulted in the abandonment of many rural rail links have had severe impacts on rural road infrastructure. As larger and heavier trucks haul products over. longer distances on rural pavements, the financial ability of the state and local governments to maintain and improve the rural road network has been diminishing. Clearly there is a need to recognize the significance of the agriculture-transport relationship and to determine the impacts on rural roads associated with major agricultural traffic generators to ensure the sustainability of rural road networks. Evidence of the increased truck volumes associated with industrialized agriculture and strategic changes in the rail industry is,provided through a case study of the grain industry, with specific emphasis on the production and consumption of corn in Texas. A methodology is suggested to quantify the impacts of increased truck volumes and axle loads on rural pavements that were not designed or built to accommodate more and heavier axle loads. It is believed that a simple methodology to quantify pavement damage can be invaluable to demonstrating rural maintenance needs and to informing rural transport investment decisions.

AB In developing countries, research and development (R&D) in road technology has often been neglected in favor of the institutional and funding aspects of road sector reform. In the African context, where low-traffic-volume roads (LTVRs) play a key role, central to the reform efforts is the sustainability of existing road networks. Positive outcomes have already emerged from these efforts, mostly for the trunk paved networks. However, results have so far been mixed for the unpaved network, whose conditions continue to deteriorate. Mozambique and Uganda are no exception to this trend. Aware of this situation, both governments are implementing, with support from the World Bank, major road rehabilitation programs while searching for appropriate low-cost technologies for LTVRs. At a premium, there are the innovative pavement technologies (IPTs) for sealed roads, which can reduce the capital costs while decreasing the maintenance And rehabilitation burden. If these efforts are successful, LTVRs could be economically sealed at lower traffic levels than was hitherto possible. The Mozambique and Uganda road administrations are using distinct approaches to R&D. Whereas Mozambique has set up a program of trial sections, Uganda is developing pilot demonstration projects to select IPTs. The focus here is on management of the R&D process, on quality enhancement for successful innovation, and on the need for the development of specifications and related methods of construction using nonconventional materials for stabilization and surfacing of low-traffic roads.

AB Low-volume roads (LVRs) constitute an integral component of the road system in all developing countries, where their importance extends to all aspects of the social and economic development of rural communities. However, the original documentation. relating to the provision of such roads is based in many respects on technology and research carried out in Europe and the United States some 30 to 40 years ago in environments very different from those prevailing in developing countries. As a result, these traditional approaches are often inappropriate for application in developing countries. Moreover, they tend to focus on the technical environment of road provision, with inadequate consideration of other interrelated environments that critically influence the types of LVRs that should be provided. As a result, a need for new, more holistic approaches to low-volume road provision has been engendered to satisfy the various needs of rural communities in a more sustainable manner. The objective of this discussion is to provide an insight into new, more holistic and sustainable approaches to the provision of LVRs in developing countries. Embodied in these new approaches is a need to rethink the old ways of providing such roads based on research and development work that has been carried out in these countries during the past 20 years. Examples include aspects of planning and project appraisal, geometric and pavement design, construction and drainage, and environmental issues, all of which need to be reconsidered in a more appropriate manner.

AB In the late 1980s, many Finnish low-volume gravel roads were paved. This option was reasonable at that time because the price of bitumen was exceptionally low. No heavy structural rehabilitation was carried out on these roads before paving. It was assumed that these cheap and light pavements would last some 5 years. Now many of those roads have reached 10 to 15 years in age, still without any proper reconstruction, and are becoming increasingly deteriorated. For almost a decade now, the Finnish government has been reducing its spending on public roads. Maintenance and repair efforts have been concentrated on the main road network, and the minor network has deteriorated more and more. Calculations show that from the road agency's point of view, upkeep of gravel roads is economically feasible compared with maintaining paved roads that are in poor condition. Therefore, road authorities have converted some of these paved low-volume roads back to gravel roads. In 2001, the Mime, Turku, and Uusimaa road districts agreed on common principles for these actions. Furthermore, they described minimum requirements for each case in which a paved road in poor condition was turned into a gravel road. Public opposition and political resistance were quite strong before these actions, since the gravel roads are seen as a decline of service level.. People living along the road, however, generally admit that new gravel roads are more comfortable to drive on throughout the year than old deteriorated pavements. The road agency still has to focus on problems such as dust.

AB Practical tools for improving transportation safety are needed worldwide. It has been estimated that motor vehicle-related crashes account for more than 1 million fatalities each year, and the number of serious injuries far exceeds fatalities. Local and low-volume roads are significantly overrepresented in crash statistics. Globally, the road safety audit (RSA) concept has been recognized as an effective tool in identifying and reducing the crash potential of roadways when used to analyze the safety aspects of project plans and designs before completion. In the local rural road arena, many safety issues are associated with existing roadway networks. Many of these networks have developed over time with little or no planning or design. There is a critical need for a practical tool that focuses on the safety of the existing as-built local road network. The RSA review (RSAR) process has been developed for this purpose, giving specific recognition to the functionality of the road being evaluated for safety issues. Significant numbers of safety improvements are needed, and practical approaches to address these needs are crucial. The RSAR tool has the potential to be particularly beneficial to local governments in systematically addressing safety deficiencies on existing rural road networks. In addition, it is a proactive safety tool that has the potential to protect agencies from tort liability since it establishes a record of the organization's safety agenda. An RSAR methodology that can be adapted by local agencies is presented. A case study illustrating the application of this process is included. Also highlighted is a local rural training program that has been presented in several states for county applications. The focus is on U.S. county applications, but it is recognized that the process has utility for other agencies and has application in other countries. The necessity for training as a key component in the development of a sustainable safety program is emphasized.

AB Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation (SHT) is responsible for 26,000 km of primary and secondary highways in the province. The primary system was structurally built to handle high traffic volumes and heavily loaded trucks; the secondary system was constructed to provide links into the primary system for traffic volumes lower than 500 vehicles per day with few heavily loaded trucks. Secondary highways consist mostly of thin membrane surface (TMS) highways, which are oil-treated surfaces over a nonstructural roadbed. In the past few years increased heavy-truck traffic associated with rail line abandonment, elevator closures, and increased truck haul associated with economic development has deteriorated TMS highways. Years of increasing pressures and inadequate funding have forced SHT to develop and implement cost-effective, sustainable methods to manage and preserve them. A new strategy to structurally strengthen the system is a cementitious blend of material called TerraCem. Along with conventional strengthening strategies, this new method is being used throughout Saskatchewan; however, its long-term performance is unknown. Because SHT must make good decisions and should be able to demonstrate they are good, a project-level framework capable of evaluating secondary road management strategies on the basis of whole life-cycle road agency and road user costs, has been developed. The framework determines the lowest-cost strategy (agency and road user) and employs probabilistic modeling to quantify the long-term performance of the TerraCem strategy. The developed framework was applied for a project-level sample.

A special interest is given to the regional (sub-national) dimension. The set of 41 indicators, aggregated to 6 groups pursuing six sustainable development (SD) dimensions has been used with the aim to characterise the state and development of Slovak administrative regions. The next step was the introduction of the Integrated Sustainable Development Index (ISDI) in order to express the global situation of Slovak regions from the SD perspective. Authors also payed attention to regional disparities with the aim to find answers to questions, whether the development of Slovak regions during the second half of the 1990s was compatible with SD principles and criteria, or not, whether the development of the individual SD dimensions was synchronised, and how significant and relevant were disparities among administrative regions in Slovakia.

AB This paper presents an approach to the assessment of the potential for sustainable use of cultural landscapes based on their physical conditions and history of land use development. The most stable areas (which have experienced no change in land use throughout the study period) as identified by multitemporal analyses of historical maps, were overlaid with physical conditions in the form of a geo-complex model, constituted of data relating to geology, climate, soil conditions, slope, aspect and potential natural vegetation. Using the formula of relative frequencies of areas' land use forms, multiplied with relative frequencies of the physical condition within the land use forms, we produced a so-called affinity of land use form to physical conditions index (Affinity Index). This Affinity Index was used to assess the land form potential of the geo-complex. A comparison of present and proposed land use patterns could be employed as a tool with which to assess the potential for the sustainable management of landscapes which takes into account aspects of the cultural landscape.

AB The paper is intended to deal primarily with the current trends in the assessment of ecological, social and economic impacts in land-use planning in relation to sustainable development needs. Ultimately, the need for integrating planning, particularly land-use planning, and impact assessment, is also a matter of discussion. Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is inevitable to be part of each land-use system in land-use planning processes in order to search for common basis of the topic of the integration.
   It aims to address the issue of integration of ecological, economic and social issues in land-use planning and how impact assessment, especially Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) can help that process. The most important function of SEA in land-use planning is its contribution to a stronger environmental orientation in land-use planning. On one hand SEA directly joins the process of planning and decision-making and on the other hand it can meet those impacts that interfere above the framework of the actual decision-making process in land-use planning.

AB An evaluation was made of the status of inundation area of the left bank of the Danube, a territory extending between Dobrohost village (at river kilometre marker 1842) and Sap village (at river kilometre marker 1811). In the first part of this paper, its authors characterise the current landscape structure and territory functions, with a focus on nature conservation priorities. In the second part of the paper, a primary characterisation of actual and proposed water management measures are described. The next part evaluates the actual status and expected progress of the area with respect to the effects of anthropogenic factors. The fact is highlighted that integrated landscape planning is required for sustainable management of the area. The final part of the paper constitutes a review of those measures supporting land use optimisation according to the restoration of ecosystem functions.

AB The aim of the article is to analyse the effect of agricultural landscape pattern in collectivisation on its properties and functioning and also to try to assess the relevance of the phenomenon from the point of view of sustainability criteria. The negative and limited view of the effect of collectivisation on functioning of the landscape prevails among experts. The presented interpretation of the collectivisation process is wider and includes such aspects as for instance forestation or grassing of the previously worked small fields on steep slopes, reduction of the field road network, removal or ploughing away of other line forms, etc. Based on the analysis of the effect of the collectivised agricultural landscape pattern on landscape components, the idea of its sustainable form is formulated. Comparison of harmony or disharmony of the two agricultural landscape patterns with the sustainable forms was made by means of indicators representing the effects of agricultural landscape patterns on the individual landscape components with (+) and (-) signs aligned and summed, which expressed their harmony or disharmony with the idea of sustainable agriculture (Table 1). Scores of the (+) and (-) values showed that the pre-collectivisation pattern was generally more favourable from the sustainability point of view. Closer analysis though, showed that some measures connected with collectivisation were positive for one landscape component and prevailingly negative for other. Consequently, the assessment of the collectivisation from the point of view of the rate of harmony of the agricultural landscape pattern with the principles of sustainable agriculture requires consideration and assessment of the particular conditions of the studied territory.

AB The contribution is dealing with the utilisation of ecological agriculture principles in the development of sustainable arrangement of soil plots in ecological significant areas. For the purpose of this contribution ecological significant areas could be defined as areas with high ecological value, but inappropriate arrangement of soil plots and utilisation of soil, which degrade this value. The ecological agriculture is defined as a part of sustainable management in agriculture practice, which utilises also principles of landscape ecology. Styles of farming reflect specific normative perspectives on farm development. It also implies specific patterns of land use and particular relations with the environment, landscape and natural values. The use of landscape ecology in the arrangement of soil plots, which is possible only in that case, if soil is perceived not from the economical point of a view, but as the landscape component is approached.

TI Independence of a central bank and position of the European system of
   central banks
SO EKONOMICKY CASOPIS

DT Article
AB In the sixties of 20(th) century, monetary policy was still considered as an integral part of demand oriented economic policy, the objective of which was to achieve full employment and gross national product at the level of potential product by optimal combination of fiscal and monetary policy instruments. In that context, moderate inflation was perceived as a legitimate means to achieve mentioned goals. But supply shocks and follow-up inflation advancement in the seventies led to the. understanding of the price stability achievement and sustainability as a top-priority task of monetary policy. This change. in the economic theory main stream came up at the same time with convincing arguments in favor of an independent central bank. In its monetary policy, bank of circulation independent from politicians, electors or media has the best conditions for preferring the long-term objective of price stability to the short-term economic growth and employment increase. On the contrary, politically dependent central bank, would. be,scarcely able to face the possible pressure of the government trying to bring on a favorable political economic cycle and therefore intentions declared in the anti-inflation policy wouldn't be perceived as credible by economic entities. In the effort to ensure the credibility of anti-inflation policy, it is also possible to bind monetary policy by standing rules as an alternative to an autonomous central bank. But this approach did not acquit well either.
   The arguments against politically, independent central bank go out particularly of. the statement that it is incompatible with elementary, democratic principles when the group of non-elected technocrats disposes of large competence and, act without direct, control carried out by the parliament. This objection can be disproved-besides the existing precedent in the form of independent courts-by a mention of indirect legitimacy of a central bank. In a final consequence, it is exactly democratically elected politicians who make the decisions about a degree of the central bank political autonomy, determine monetary policy objectives and they also name senior officials of a central bank; Moreover, various empirical studies confirm the expediency of an independent central. bank for economic development of the country. The states with an autonomous central bank show besides the lower inflation rate also low unemployment, and the rate or volatility of ecomomic growth is not negatively influenced by the independence of a central bank as well.
   Following these arguments, the question of what degree is the independence of their own central bank ensured to, thus becomes very important for the citizens of present and future Member States of the European Economic and Monetary Union. For the purpose of the analysis focused on a degree of autonomy of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the European Central Bank (ECB), we usually distinguish between functional, institutional, personal and financial independence.
   Functional independence implies the question whether a central bank has adequate space for autonomous execution of monetary policy when trying to achieve certain objectives. In this point, it is very important that the ESCB can decide autonomously about a suitable monetary policy strategy. Very significant is also the fact that neither the ECB nor individual national banks are no longer allowed to provide credit to public sector organs and institutions. Potential limitation of functional independence represents exchange-rate policy, which falls within the cognizance of the Council of the European Union. In its execution of exchange-rate policy, the Council of the EU is indeed obliged to respect the primary objective of price stability as well as the independence of the ESCB. In the case of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM II), even the competence beyond the frame of the Treaty on European Union was conceded to the ESCB.
   Institutional independence is being connected with A question of the rate in which other bodies and institutions (government or parliament) have an opportunity to influence a decision-making process in the competent central bank gremium. In this context, when exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by the EU Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB, neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies may seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body. The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the Member States undertake to respect Us principle and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the national central banks in the performance of their tasks. None of the EU political representatives or the individual Member State representatives can even dispose of voting right in any decision-making body of the ESCB. The ECB is exclusively the subject to the European Court of Justice's juridical control as well as the European Court of Auditors' and independent external auditors' control.
   In the view of ensuring personal independence of the ESCB, it has to be evaluated positively in particular that the term of office for the ECB Executive Board Members is limited to a maximum of eight years and shall not be renewable. Shorter five years term of office for the presidents-of the national central banks (governors), even possibly renewable, represents kind of a risk for the independent performing of the tasks related to their function.
   Financial independence is achieved when a central bank disposes of an adequate amount of financial resources necessary for staying in a position to fulfil entrusted duties. Financial independence violation could result in a menace of either functional or institutional independence of a central bank. In the case of the ESCB, financial independence is guaranteed by the fact that the Budget of the ECB is separated from the Budget of the EU, as well as by the fact that not national governments, not the European Union, but the national central banks have provided basic capital of the ECB.
   In conclusion, it has to be underlined that there is a difference between the formal and the real independence of a central bank. Finally, general public attitude towards inflation risk determinates whether monetary policy oriented on the maintenance of price stability is successful or not. However, the European Economic and Monetary Union exists, too short to give a final verdict considering the importance that the citizens of Euro-zone attribute to a stable currency.

AB Monetary policy represents one of the key issues of the integration process of Slovakia into the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Within economic policies, it fulfills a stabilisation. function and in the EMU accession process, monetary policy together with other policies are helping fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria by a targeted time limit for accession.
   In the first section, the article deals with issues to be faced by the monetary policy in the process of accession. The questions discussed here include the selection of a monetary strategy, as well as possible procedures for disinflation and the issue of exchange rate policy, which will in time gain in importance. In this context, account is given of the circumstances of membership in the ERM II, whose purpose is to prepare conditions for introducing a common currency in accession countries. It is noted that the monetary policy operates within the context of a whole economic policy complex and it is exactly the coordination of its individual components that constitutes a prerequisite for building up credibility vis-A-vis markets and thereby a sustainable favourable economic development.
   In the second section, we provide a summary of a range of issues, which will have to be solved as part of the process of accession to the EMU, and an indication of their size. The improvement of indicators decisive in terms of the entry is preconditioned by completing reforms with which certain costs will be associated. From this viewpoint, the most important is a reform of the public finance system associated with reforms in other areas, (particularly pension and health care system reforms), which have to do with the fulfilment of the budget criterion. The performance of the inflation criterion came under pressure, chiefly due to the postponement of price deregulations. These facts also influence conditions for meeting the debt and interest rate criteria.
   A consistent strategy for the process of accessing the EMU will require a close coordination of actions taken by the government and the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS), especially when it comes to the harmonisation of monetary, fiscal, and other policies. A successful assertion of the strategy is preconditioned by a social consensus with regard to the reforms needed. This will require cooperation between the two entities and employers and trade unions, especially when it comes to the regulation of wage development. Last but not least, an efficient information campaign targeted at the population at large, will be required.

ID TWIN DEFICITS; HYPOTHESIS
AB Globalization, capital flows, and growing fiscal and current account imbalances in a relatively large number of countries have motivated increasing research on these issues. The association of high external and internal deficits, which are generally referred to as twin deficits, has attracted increasing attention in the 1980s and the 1990s. Since the second half of the 1990s, this phenomenon has gained importance also in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe. For OECD countries, both current accounts. and fiscal balances display a significant degree of hysteresis as shown by the unit root tests. Correspondingly, "twin deficits" are defined as a cointegrating relationship between the current account, the fiscal balance and investment.
   This paper contributes to the discussion of current account, capital markets integration, and fiscal policy in the following ways. First, the paper analyzes the determinants of the long-ran current account position in a broad set of countries including OECD countries as well as emerging economies between 1970 and 2001. Second, quarterly data are applied in this paper, while the earlier comparative studies are based on annual data. Thus, the issue of parameter stability and nonstationarity can be addressed here, an issue: most authors of comparative studies, have omitted. By contrast, several country studies have focused strongly on the properties of analyzed time series.
   Third, the paper considers both investment and the fiscal balance determinants of the current account in the long ran, while the majority of the previous studies concentrated on only one of these factors. Various degrees of integration of the domestic economy to the international capital markets are found for the analyzed countries. In particular, the EU countries seem to finance a surprisingly high share of their domestic investment from international sources indicating that the so called Feldstein-Horioka puzzle (FHP) is less important in the EU.
   Finally, the paper extends the analysis to the development of the current account and the fiscal balance in transition economies in the 1990s, while also presenting evidence for selected countries for comparison. With few exceptions, this group of countries has been omitted from the analysis so far.
   The results show that twin deficits emerged in the 1980s. However, less evidence is documented for twin deficits in the 1990s. Furthermore, it is shown that the countries pursuing sustainable-fiscal policies also display a high flexibility of the current account. As expected, investment contributed significantly to the current account deficit.
   Despite the increasing role of international financial markets, several countries are still financing their investment mainly from domestic sources (savings). This feature confirms earlier results on the FHP. However, less evidence for the FHP is found for the EU countries and also for transition economics (Hungary. Poland and Slovakia). This result indicates that EU integration has significantly increased the degree of openness in the participating economies.
   The transition economies are found to have high current account deficits, which are unique in a historic comparison, both in relation to developed countries and to emerging markets. By contrast, the transition economies' fiscal indicators are more similar to those reported by other regions. As a result, twin deficits are found for Hungary and Poland, but not for Slovakia.
   Possibly, the large current account deficits and fiscal expenditures may be viewed as an intertemporal phenomenon related to the output collapse at the beginning of transition. As a result transition countries can make use of the possibility of financing current investment and consumption from future income, which is expected to converge rapidly in the course of accession to the EU. Indeed, the examples of Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia indicate that transition countries are comparably well integrated into the international capital markets.

AB The socio-economic dimensions of disparities, the long duration of regional equalisation processes and its political sensitivity require regional policy to become one of the core policies of the government. The second pillar of its successfulness is active participation of regional and local self-governments.
   In this article, we recommend to realise a growth-equalising strategy for the Slovak conditions after the SR accession. The growth-equalising strategy of regional policy should in our conditions:
   Support and keep in growth the regional centres (developed agglomerations) that are decisive carriers of national-economy growth and create not only development resources in the Slovak economy but also a pro-growth environment for the equalisation of regions lagging behind; this part of the overall strategy is called growth-equalising strategy focusing on regional centres of national-economy growth (developed regions). These urban agglomerations are concerned: Bratislava - Trnava, Trencin, Zilina - Martin, Poprad, Kosice - Presov and Banska Bystrica - Zvolen and the region of the city of Nitra.
   Remove negative consequences of production decrement and adaptation to the new market conditions in the regions lagging behind, together with the support of localisation, revitalisation of the regions with deformed demographic and professional structure (the threat of social and economic degradation and marginalisation). This part of the overall: strategy is called growth-equalising strategy focusing on regional centres in. regions lagging behind. Urban centres must be the,carriers of development also in such, regions. In NUTS U. Western Slovakia the development of agglomeration Nove Zamky - Komarno is concerned, in the region of Central Slovakia - the development of the towns of Lucenec - Rimavska Sobota and in the East Slovakia region the development of the agglomeration Humenne - Vranov.
   Both parts of the overall strategy should be implemented with a non-scattered concentrating model. The practice of regional development proved sufficiently that dispersing of funds,,strewing" an area with investments is a short term solution failing to provide long term changes of regional structures.
   In order to pursue effective use of national resources and, in particular, resources from the EU structural funds, the assumption that in the first, after-accession stage (approximately 10 - 12 years) these funds will be absorbed by those cities and agglo-meration that dispose of decisive localisation advantages even today, is realistic.
   Preferring the growth-equalising strategy in its proposed concentrating form in the first stage after EU accession does not mean that the smaller regions out of the reach of the agglomeration development effects shall be excluded from the support.
   In terms of competitiveness changes till the year 20 10, human resources, foreign direct investments, innovations, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and infrastructure, are analysed.
   According to model calculations the consequences of individual policies shall result until 2010, depending on the selected scenario, in changes in the competitiveness of the regions and GDP per capita development following the individual NUTS 11 and Slovak regions. Slovakia would approach 72.7 per cent of the EU 25 average forecast for 2010. (currently it is around 53 per cent). With the exception of the region of Bratislava (164.7 per cent) and partly the region of Trnava (74.3 per cent), Slovak regions would achieve values under 75 per cent of EU 25 GDP per capita.
   The knowledge gained by developed and also cohesion countries, however, shows that mostly the developed scope of regional institutions (including on the one hand institutions necessary for the functioning of the support mechanism and on the other hand institutions supporting transfer of technology and innovation, improving qualification, etc.) can, in particular, affect significantly the sustainability and triggering of regionnal growth. Particularly, the necessity to develop capacities needed for EU membership rises in the pre-accession period. This has resulted from the evaluation of the current situation of the Slovak public administration and ensuring the equalisation of the difference between this situation and the situation required from all EU Member States - existing as well as the new ones. With respect to Slovakia's interest to achieve EU membership in the year 2004 the building of effective and capable capacities for membership is a strategic priority.

AB Business processes in the e-Government are relatively complex, in particular which concerns the number of the persons and authorities involved. In addition business processes have the tendency to change with the time. The more complex the processes, the more largely is the danger, that they drift from and fail the goals of original process modeling within a short time. The process management requires therefore a process control, with which the constant actualisation of the process organization and a continuous adjustment at changed goals and basic conditions can be carried out. An organization concept is presented, with which the transition of a BPR project to a continuous improvement process is supported. It is reported on first experiences with this concept.

AB The paper conceives e-governance as the overall design and implementation of e-government strategies, structures and processes. It argues for paying greater attention to the sustainability of e-government strategies and examines the use of scenario methods for integrating a future-oriented perspective. Two major applications of scenario approaches in the field of e-government are analysed: a scenario project at regional level in the United Kingdom, and the pan-European project PRISMA, a research cooperation within the IST programme. With a focus on the latter, the contribution outlines scenario processes as well as outcomes and derives implications for strategy design. The scenarios suggest certain caveats for future-oriented design which can enhance e-governance. A number of design components which are robust across different scenarios are pointed out, e.g. target group and needs orientation, privacy enhancing measures, access to government-held information, one-stop service centred back-office reorganisation.

One such lesson is to understand how information technologies might further impact on one's knowledge. While there are many recent information technology projects, they are often ad hoc and in "pilot" or "trial" mode, reducing any chance of sustainability or "proof of concept". However, experience has taught people some of the pitfalls, management and effectiveness of information technology, and the capacity to understand, select and critique is increasing. Thus, the edge of the tide creeps slowly forward.

AB The solar envelope, first conceived and tested by the author working with architecture faculty and students at the University of Southern California (USC), regulates development within imaginary boundaries derived from the sun's relative motion. Buildings within this container will not overshadow their surroundings during critical periods of solar access for passive and low-energy architecture. If generally applied as an instrument of zoning, the solar envelope will not only provide for sustainable growth but will open new aesthetic possibilities for architecture and urban design.

TI Comfort in urban spaces: defining the boundaries of outdoor thermal
   comfort for the tropical urban environments
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
LA English
DT Article
DE tropics; adaptation; outdoor comfort
AB With rapid urbanisation, often without climate responsive guidelines, cities in the Tropics are progressively falling short of sustaining outdoor life. While at the building level such inadvertent climatic modifications have lead to a remarkable demand on the urban energy resources. The rationale for developing a thermally desirable outdoor ambience in such a context has implications that go beyond the requisites of urban design and well into the design of buildings. In order to re-establish and sustain life outdoors it is important that we try to make urban spaces comfortable as far as the ambient climate permits. In order to ascertain conditions of comfort for outdoor spaces we need to define comfort for outdoors. This paper presents findings on outdoor comfort based on field investigations conducted in Dhaka, a city in the wet-Tropics. Findings from a survey conducted on a large number of randomly selected people from urban spaces are presented. The findings include factors affecting comfort outdoors for Dhaka and a comfort regime based on environmental parameters for urban outdoors is presented. Interestingly, comfortable ambient climate leads to comfortable indoor environment particularly with regard to free running buildings. With regard to mechanically controlled indoor environments a comfortable outdoor produces lesser strain on energy environment relationship. By defining conditions of comfort for outdoor environments an important step towards achieving sustainability of our urban environments can be made. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Generation and transmission prospects for solar electricity: UK and
   global markets
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB World energy demands are assumed to double within the next 20 years. Fossil fuels are being depleted at a faster rate than ever before. Global warming and its associated climatic change are becoming serious concerns for governments worldwide. There is, thus, an urgent need for much more efficient and environmentally friendly energy resources to be exploited worldwide. Renewable energy is the solution to these challenges. Solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, is an elegant and effective renewable energy resource that is increasingly being seen as a promising candidate for provision of clean and sustainable power. Using up to 20 years of measured solar radiation data from seven widespread UK locations, the feasibility of interconnected, solar powered communities has been presently undertaken. This study has also explored the long term prospects of large scale PV generation in arid/semi-arid locations, around the globe and its transmission using hydrogen as the energy vector. It is estimated that a single solar PV station of 250 x 250 km(2) area, or 12 decentralised stations each of 72 x 72 km(2) area would be sufficient to meet the year 2020 world electricity demand.
   Presently, closer attention is paid towards the feasibility of supply of hydrogen from arid/semi-arid regions to meet partially the year 2020 electrical demand. For OECD-Europe, a modular approach is proposed. Estimates show that a 9 x 9 km(2) PV array area would be sufficient to provide a flow rate of 11.5 kg/s of hydrogen through a 2 m diameter pipeline, which translates to an annual capacity of 9 TW h. Because of the low density of hydrogen, compared to natural gas, staged pumping would be required only after a distance of over 3000 km. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Biomass co-firing for coal-fired boilers
SO ENERGY EXPLORATION & EXPLOITATION
LA English
DT Article
ID STATION; FUELS
AB In this study ground biomass and pulverized coal were used for co-firing test. The tests of co-firing of coal and biomass were carried out in a bench-scale bubbling fluidized bed combustor. Biomass is an attractive and sustainable renewable fuel to supplement coal combustion in utility boilers. Coal co-firing was successful with up to a 20% biomass mix boilers. Coal and biomass fuels are quite different in composition. Ash composition for the biomass is fundamentally different from ash composition for the coal. Chlorine in the biomass may affect operation by corrosion. Ash deposits reduce heat transfer and may also result in severe corrosion at high temperatures. Biomass and coal blend combustion is a promising combustion technology; however, significant development work is required before large-scale implementation can be realized. Issues related to successful implementation of coal biomass blend combustion are identified. Co-firing of coal and biomass is an effective method of control NOx. Formation of NOx decreases with the increase of biomass fraction.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Eco-labeling is a promising market-based approach for improving the environmental performance of products through consumer choice. While eco-labeling itself is not new, eco-labeling to promote energy efficiency or sustainability is a more recent phenomenon. Five such energy-labeling programs in the US are evaluated: Green Seal, Scientific Certification Systems, Energy Guide, Energy Star, and Green-c. Of these, the first four certify energy-efficient appliances while the last one certifies renewable electricity. While Energy Guide and Energy Star are government-run programs, the rest are privately administered. Two evaluation criteria were used-consumer response and manufacturer/marketer response. Very few studies have been done on the private programs making comparative analysis more difficult. It was found that government programs, in general, and Energy Star, in particular, were much more successful than the private programs. For appliance energy labeling, the private programs were found to have an almost insignificant effect on the market. Government support proved to be crucial in determining a program's credibility, financial stability, and long-term viability. Further, targeting of specific product categories, legislative mandates, incentives, and partnerships were found to be other important factors for program success. Simple seal-of-approval logos and labels have generally affected consumer behavior more than the complex information-disclosure labels. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE fossil fuels; subsidies; Australia
AB A common claim during international greenhouse gas reduction negotiations has been that domestic emissions cuts will harm national economies. This argument fails to consider the distorting effect of existing financial subsidies and associated incentives to fossil fuel production and consumption provided by governments in most developed countries. These subsidies support a fossil fuel energy sector that is the major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and conflict with attempts to expand the role of sustainable energy technologies. Reform of these types of subsidies has the potential to provide substantial gains in economic efficiency as well as reductions in carbon dioxide emissions-a 'no regrets' outcome for the economy and the environment. This paper examines financial subsidies to fossil fuel production and consumption in Australia and estimates the magnitude of the subsidies. Subsidies and associated incentives to fossil fuel production and consumption in Australia are similar to those in the United States and the other countries that have pushed for increased 'flexibility' during international negotiations.

AB What assists and what hinders sustainable energy use in being put into effect? Two case studies of sustainable energy concepts-the Zurich Solarstromborse, where electricity can be purchased that is produced by solar panels, and the Swiss CO2-law, a consensus oriented implementation of the Kyoto-protocol-were analysed in order to investigate this question. In both case studies the unfolding of the sustainable energy concepts is reconstructed as a process starting with an abstract idea moving to a concrete realisation. This process passes through a series of different social worlds and is, in turn, affected by them. These social worlds are e.g. those of the concerned scientists, the professional investors, energy suppliers or governmental agencies.
   The case studies reveal three neuralgic challenges that have to be met when a concept advances from idea to realisation through the social worlds: Firstly, the translation between social worlds changes the content of the idea. Secondly, the way each social world looks at things (socially) constructs best solutions to problems and hides others. Thirdly, the actual dynamics of the social world within which it is finally implemented must be adopted by the idea.
   In order to integrate these neuralgic points, scientists as well as other inventors have to retain responsibility for their sustainable energy ideas and are requested to follow them through the social worlds in order to critically survey and eventually influence their "content in flux".

   AGRICULTURE; POLLUTION; ENGLAND; CONSTRUCTIONS; PARTICIPATION;

AB There is increasing public policy interest in the management of rural landscapes for conservation, both in terms of natural and cultural heritage. Agri-environmental policies are an important part of an emerging vision for a sustainable countryside, with increasing support for the existing Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) and Countryside Stewardship (CS) schemes. This paper provides insight into the nature of land-manager attitudes towards the conservation of rural landscapes and how these relate to differing modes and levels of engagement with these two schemes. It is based on the results of a recently completed project exploring the attitudes and practices of 100 land managers towards features of landscape and historic interest. Agri-environmental research has often sought to 'typologise' attitudes and practices around discrete land-manager types; an approach that may downgrade commonalities between land managers, the potential interplay of elements defining these types, and the possibility that land-manager identities may not be uniform. In this paper, in contrast, we emphasise the significance of these three analytical issues surrounding land-manager attitudes and practices. We explore land managers' interest and investment in conservation and go on to explain how these concerns were often closely related to the wildlife, historic and aesthetic goals of the schemes. The analysis then considers in detail how a concern for conservation often came to interplay with economic concerns to produce different attitudes and practices. We term these 'styles of participation and nonparticipation' to emphasise that such modes of uptake are not necessarily associated with specific land-manager types. Land managers developed these attitudes and practices with respect to different parts of their farms, types of landscape feature, and scheme in question. We conclude by emphasising the importance of contextualised analyses of land-manager values, knowledges, and practices for exploring the nature and possibilities of a 'sustainable countryside, and the role of agri-environmental policy within this policy vision of rural areas.

DE Gibraltar; soils; sustainable development; urban geochemical survey
AB The extreme density of population of Gibraltar, situated at the southern tip of Spain, exerts considerable pressure on land use and thus future planning is of utmost importance. An initial reconnaissance soil geochemical survey of Gibraltar was based on 120 surface samples (0-15 cm) taken from a wide range of exposed, either bare soil or vegetated sites, to provide the optimum geographical distribution. The 'total' elemental concentrations of 26 elements (Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Al, La, Ti, V, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ag, Zn, Cd, Pb, P, S, As) were determined by nitric/percholric acid digestion followed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis. The reconnaissance data shows that the spatial distribution of various elements depended on previous and present land use. Most elements (Ca, Cr, Mg and Mn excluded) exhibited relatively high concentrations in civilian and natural soils. Trends have been established for many elements, and concentrations exceeding guideline values have been found in certain areas of Gibraltar. This reconnaissance of Gibraltar is at present being followed by a more detailed baseline geochemical survey, which will establish the extent and magnitude of the variations in major and trace elements in soils and dusts, assess the impact of industrial, commercial and urban development on the geochemical landscape and to make recommendations concerning sustainable development.

AB The terms used to describe and negotiate environmental quality are both ambiguous and value-laden. Stakeholders intimately and actively involved in the management of forested lands were interviewed and found to use ambiguous, tautological, and value-laden definitions of terms such as health, biodiversity, sustainability, and naturalness. This confusing language hinders public participation efforts and produces calls to regulate and remove discretion from environmental professionals. Our data come from in-depth interviews with environmental management professionals and other stakeholders heavily vested in negotiating the fate of forested lands. We contend that environmental science and management will be more effective if its practitioners embrace and make explicit these ambiguous and evaluative qualities rather than ignore and disguise them.

AB Within the framework of a general equilibrium model we study the long-run dynamics of resources and population if the growth rate of resources and population and the share of labor devoted to production are adversely affected by resource scarcity. Our results show that sustainability, i.e. a positive value of resources and population in the long run, essentially depends on the level of per capita resources at which these feedback mechanisms become active. A detailed bifurcation analysis evidences the richness of possible long-run dynamics.

AB To meet the challenges of sustainability and catchment management requires an approach that assesses resource usage options and environmental impacts integratively. Assessment must be able to integrate several dimensions: the consideration of multiple issues and stakeholders, the key disciplines within and between the human and natural sciences, multiple scales of system behaviour, cascading effects both spatially and temporally, models of the different system components, and multiple databases. Integrated assessment (IA) is an emerging discipline and process that attempts to address the demands of decision makers for management that has ecological, social and economic values and considerations. This paper summarises the features of IA and argues the role for models and information systems as a prime activity. Given the complex nature of IA problems, the broad objectives of IA modelling should be to understand the directions and magnitudes of change in relation to management interventions so as to be able to differentiate between associated outcome sets. Central to this broad objective is the need for improved techniques of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis that can provide a measure of confidence in the ability to differentiate between different decisions. Three examples of problems treated with an IA approach are presented. The variations in the way that the different dimensions are integrated in the modelling are discussed to highlight the sorts of choices that can be made in model construction. The conclusions stress the importance of IA as a process, not just as a set of outcomes, and define some of the deficiencies to be overcome. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urban sprawl is an essential environmental issue to be monitored and forecasted in order to think about alternatives that could lead to a more sustainable future development. Thus, the objective of the project presented here is to simulate the past and future transformation of suburban land use patterns in the Vienna Region. (The paper describes some results of the project, "STAU-Wien" (City-Suburb relations and development in the Vienna Region), was carried out during 2000-2002).
   The paper discusses driving forces of suburban growth, and presents a model that simulates polycentric development of suburban systems. The model introduces different settlement growth velocities within the suburban region considering housing area densification and land use change from open space to built up area. In particular, the model takes into account suburban population migration and commercial start ups controlled by regional and local factors (attractiveness/constraints) in the suburban Vienna Region: large and small scale accessibility (traveling time to the core city, access to motorways), land prices, landscape attractiveness, social and commercial services supply, traffic exposure obstacles as well as (land use) zoning constraints. The approach concentrates on a Spatial Agent Model to stimulate regional migration and allocation decisions of households and commercial enterprises aiming in the selection of target municipalities. Land use change will finally be performed by a cellular automaton to decide on densification and land use change. The model has been developed and applied to simulate prior and future landscape transition processes for the suburban region in the surroundings of Vienna, Austria. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE GIS; eco-balances; environmental planning
AB During the last several years, environmental impact assessment, regional or spatial planning, and environmental. balancing seem to develop similarities, e.g. joint basic methodological approaches like the use of environmental indicators, the focus on same environmental goods like air, water, soil, flora/fauna, etc. (Lenz, 1999). Especially Geographical Information System (GIS)-based software systems show their multiple applications in these fields.
   Experiences from a set of regional environmental (or eco-)balances show a wide range of advantages as well as disadvantages of the widespread use of GIS-based planning tools. With the background of concepts and examples for spatial eco-balances for the district Pfaffenhofen (Upper Bavaria, Germany; cf. Lenz, 1997) and the municipality Mulfingen (Hohenlohe, Germany), both related to the concept of environmental indicators of the advisory board of environmental affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany (SRU, 1994) and the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA, 1995), we can show GIS-based information systems of a high practical relevancy. Aims were to balance environmental effects in a map scale of 1:5000-1:50,000, in order to provide the administration with tools for an environmentally sound and sustainable development of their area (Lenz, 1997, 1999; Beuttler et al., 1999). In this contribution we will discuss the technical and practical designs of these information systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new greenhouse climate control system has been constructed with the objective of decreasing energy consumption while maintaining. or even increasing, plant production. The system is based on the use of mathematical models for estimating the absorption of irradiance, leaf photosynthesis and respiration. The model builds on a general leaf model that with a few modifications can be used for different greenhouse crops. The temperature, which was controlled according to the natural irradiance, was allowed to vary considerably more than in a standard climate. Under low light conditions, energy use was reduced because the temperature was lowered. In contrast, when irradiance is higher, the plants seem able to utilize both a higher temperature and CO2 During nighttimes the temperature was lower than in standard climate. The thermal screens were used according to a screen simulation system. The system balances the energy costs saved via isolation against the production loss caused by the decrease in irradiance. A six-month trial of the system resulted in energy savings ranging from 8% in late spring (April-June) to 40% in early spring (March-May). During the winters 1997-98 and 1998-99 the accumulated energy savings per season varied between 20% and 38% at two different locations in Denmark. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE GIS USLE; GIS based hydrology; river basin; non-point source pollution;
   validated transport model; enhanced spatial resolution; enhanced
   attribute
AB In the southeast in Noffkoping, Sweden, is a small fjord-like bay called Slatbaken. The water quality in Slatbaken-with its narrow outlet to the Baltic Sea-depends highly on the water quality of the streams that flow in it. While point pollution sources can be identified easily in general, the non-point sources are harder to find. The most important sources for non-point pollution are agricultural areas, and the pollutants are mostly nutrients like phosphorus, which come from the fertilisation of the fields. One important catchment area for Slatbaken is the 57.7 km(2) Gisselo river basin (part of the topographic map 8GNO), which contains large agricultural areas.
   The transport of water pollutants is based on the same hydrological processes as erosion and sediment transport. The implementation of such a model in a GIS allows the analysis of a large area with a high resolution. When choosing the model, special attention was paid to the possibility of using a verified model that is easy to implement in a commercial GIS without the need of too much expert knowledge. This may allow its widespread use in many administrative applications that need non-point source information. A feasibility test for an enhanced GIS USLE model was done in the Gisselo drainage basin before it was implemented for all river basins in the whole administrative area of Norrkopings kommun.
   It is possible to use the suggested simplified USLE model to estimate the load of both pollutants and sediments, and it is able to show the areas that are critical for the water quality at the outlet of the water basin. The model has been evaluated in three studies [Int. J. Geogr. Inf. Syst. 2 (4) (1988) 365; A GIS to target critical areas for non point source management, in: Proceedings of the International Non Point Source Management Symposium, Austin, TX, November 7, 1989; Vatten 48 (1992) 117]. Then, implemented in a very simple GIS that allowed only rough estimates of terrain models and distances, the model was able to estimate the total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in the Svarta river basin of 1539 km(2) in the same region as Gisselo and the Bornsjo river basin outside Stockholm. Besides an estimated R-2 of 0.91-0.98 (verified by a more than one year measurement from manual and automated sampling stations in the whole river basin), the benefit with the GIS implemented USLE was the possibility to identify the risk areas with high spatial accuracy. During the last decade, both available databases and software have changed the possibilities to identify areas at risk of nutrient leakage. Schein [GIS Methods for Monitoring Sustainable Development by Analysis of Land-use and Land Cover Changes in the Surroundings of Linkoping (Sweden), Institut fur Photogrammetrie und Fernerkundung, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany] and Schein and Sivertun [Method and models for sustainable development monitoring and analyses in GIS, in: Proceedings of the International Workshop on Geo-Spatial Knowledge Processing for Natural Resource Management, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy, June 28-29, 2001] show that the enhanced land use data available through the European Union agricultural support program can be used together with remote sensing data to fine tune the modified GIS USLE model. The problems with the new 50 x 50 m digital elevation data now available are also pointed out here. Obvious errors in the data and possibilities to enhance the model by introducing a better terrain model were two important suggestions in these works. In this article, two modifications to the original model are suggested. One is enhancement of the digital terrain model by using height curves from the digital 1:50 000 scale topographic map, and the other is a smooth distance function that better reflects the impact of nutrients on water bodies.
   Because of its easy implementation on standard low cost systems, the GIS USLE model is suitable for analysing huge areas for critical places. The results can lead to more detailed studies in the risk areas thus identified or to investigations on the effect of land use changes, or can be used simply for taking care in the use of fertilisers and other chemicals in the critical agricultural areas.

AB Biodiversity is the feedstock for the biotechnology industry. Hence, the conservation, enhancement and sustainable and equitable use of biodiversity should be accorded high priority in all national environment protection programmes. Lichens serve as useful indicators of environmental health. Similarly, several blue green algae help to sequester salt from water. There is need for the more widespread use of such biomonitoring and bioremediation agents. Bioprospecting research designed to identify novel metabolites must be rooted in the principle of equity in sharing benefits with the holders of traditional knowledge. There is need for greater vigil against alien invasive species, since with growing world trade in food grains and other agricultural commodities, there is an increasing possibility of introducing new pests, weeds and harmful micro-organisms. Finally, biological scientists should place emphasis on their ethical responsibility for the consequences of their research, since otherwise bioterrorism could become a major threat to human security.

AB Thirty-two Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in southern Sweden were studied for a period of 12 years to evaluate acidification-induced chemical changes in the soil. Soil, at 20-30 cm depth in the mineral layer, was sampled three times during this period (1988, 1993 and 1999). The results show that pH(BaCl2) in mineral soil decreased by, on average, 0.17 units between 1988 and 1999, accompanied by an increase in aluminium (Al) concentration and a decrease in base saturation in the soil. In 1999, the base saturation was below 5% in 58% of the 32 sites compared with 16% in 1988 and 7% in 1993. Concentrations of calcium (Ca), potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) are low and decreasing. Based on C/N ratios in humus, 45% of the sites may be subjected to leaching of considerable amounts of nitrate. The results show that the acidification of coniferous forest soils in southern Sweden is continuing, and that the negative effects on the nutrient status in soil are extensive. The results are compared with reference values for productive, long-term sustainably managed boreal coniferous or mixed forest soils and implications for long-term sustainability are discussed.

AB The purpose of the present work is to work out an approach for the development of software and the choice of hardware structures when designing subsystems for automatic control of technological processes realized in living objects containing limited space (microenvironment). The subsystems for automatic control of the microenvironment (SACME) under development use the Devices for Air Prophylactic Treatment, Aeroionization, and Purification (DAPTAP) as execution units for increasing the level of safety and quality of agricultural raw material and foodstuffs, for reducing the losses of agricultural produce during storage and cultivation, as well as for intensifying the processes of activation of agricultural produce and industrial microorganisms. A set of interconnected SACMEs works within the framework of a general microenvironmental system (MES). In this research, the population of baker's yeast is chosen as a basic object of control under the industrial fed-batch cultivation in a bubbling bioreactor. This project is an example of a minimum cost automation approach. The microenvironment optimal control problem for baker's yeast cultivation is reduced from a profit maximum to the maximization of overall yield by the reason that the material flow-oriented specific cost correlates closely with the reciprocal value of the overall yield. Implementation of the project partially solves a local sustainability problem and supports a balance of microeconomical, microecological and microsocial systems within a technological subsystem realized in a microenvironment maintaining an optimal value of economical criterion (e.g. minimum material, flow-oriented specific cost) and ensuring: (a) economical growth (profit increase, raw material saving); (b) high security, safety and quality of agricultural raw material during storage process and of food produce during a technological process; elimination of the contact of gaseous harmful substances with a subproduct during various technological stages; (c) improvement of labour conditions for industrial personnel from an ecological point of view (positive effect of air aeroionization and purification on human organism promoting strengthened health and an increase in life duration, pulverent and gaseous chemical and biological impurity removal). An alternative aspect of a controlled living microenvironment forming is considered.

TI Agricultural policies in Norway and effects on soil erosion
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE agricultural policy; soil erosion; subsidies; land levelling; Norway
AB Norwegian agriculture depends heavily on governmental subsidies, due to small farming units and high costs. Due to a limited home market, many agricultural productions are also quantum regulated. Milk and grain production was regulated starting in the 1950 using region specific prices. At the level of three counties in south-eastern Norway, this policy resulted in an increase in the grain producing area from 30 to 80% of total agricultural area causing a similar reduction in grassland area over a 30 year period. The change in land use caused by this policy more than doubled the estimated soil losses by water erosion. During the late seventies extensive land levelling in the same region stimulated by subsidies lead to an estimated two-three fold increase in soil erosion. The increase was especially high when former ravine landscapes used for pasture were levelled and turned into arable land that was ploughed in autumn. Very visible erosion and increasing negative offsite effects on water quality together with overproduction put an end to the subsidies for land levelling. Erosion research was started around 1980 and the results from this research lead to the introduction of several kinds of payments in the early 1990 to encourage more sustainable agricultural production. Since the policy changed there has been changes in cultivating systems and a reduction in soil erosion has been estimated. Thus, farmers' behaviour and soil erosion in Norway is strongly influenced by agricultural and environmental policy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DEGRADATION
AB A recent national erosion assessment programme reveals that soil erosion is more active in Iceland than is witnessed in other European countries. Most of the communal grazing areas in the central highlands are not suitable for grazing by sheep because of poor condition. Agricultural subsidies are a substantial proportion of Iceland's national budget and the sheep farming is dependent on subsidies. Recently, a landmark agreement was made between sheep farmers and the government, where part of the production subsidies were tied to "quality management", including sustainable land use. This agreement calls for rapid assessment of all grazing land in Iceland. These challenges have been met by the use of classification of satellite imagery and innovative methods in obtaining farmland boundaries. The subsidy agreement may have more importance for attaining sustainable land use in Iceland than most government initiatives to date. Financial incentives. such as linking subsidies to land condition and improvements, encourage a reduction of grazing pressure on marginal highland areas, but do not lead to exclusion of such grazing practices. We believe that Icelandic rangelands should be divided into two categories: land intended for use (farmland), and land that should be protected from grazing by national law.

AB This research explores the socio-economic, climatic and lithological components of the contemporary erosion problems in the Sorbas area of Almeria, Spain, and devises a mapping schedule to describe the particular risks associated with the large-scale clearance of dispersive soils for arboriculture. The paper firstly tracks the pace of the agricultural change across this sensitive landscape using provincial agricultural statistics. Secondly, the elements of geomorphological sensitivity in a 70 km(2) study area southwest of Sorbas are considered. Previous work has suggested that dispersive properties of local lithologies are important risk-associated variables alongside vegetation cover and topography. A method whereby all these factors can be included in the assessment of the degree of erosion risk is developed. Using repeat NERC air photography for 1996 and 2001 as a basis, aerial photomosaics of the study area are compared, producing a map of land-use change between 1996 and 2001. With this map as a basis, the risk-mapping schedule is piloted for a sub-study area on newly cleared land. The sustainable management of these extensive changes is discussed in a final section. It is argued that the proposed algorithm for erosion risk mapping could facilitate the management of existing agricultural clearances, and the siting of new developments to minimise soil loss.

AB Ecosystem management. by seeking to emulate natural disturbance, has been proposed by the ecological and forest C management community as a means of maintaining the biodiversity and productivity of boreal forests, key components of sustainable forest management (SFM). However, it is argued that ecosystem management overlooks the paradox inherent in the concept of Nature, limiting the scope of the SFM debate by maintaining a binary opposition between Nature and Society, humans and the environment. Nature is paradoxical because humans are part of Nature, by the theory of evolution, while at the same time Nature is a social construction created by humans, and thus artificial. Recourse is made to postmodernism in order to examine the metaphysical and sociopolitical implications of the deconstruction of this paradox. Based on a review of the philosophy of Foucault and Derrida, the concept of Nature is demonstrated to be socially mediated. an entwinement of reason and power. In order to address metaphysical challenges of the Nature-Society dualism identified above, I refer to Habermas's theory of communicative action and cite results from a case study in this regard. Results from this case study prompt a critical examination of the legitimacy of a discourse ethic about Nature, making use of the negative dialectics of Adorno. As a result, at the metaphysical level, a different role for ecologists and forest managers in public participation procedures is proposed, one whereby ecologists talk through Nature to the evolutionary agents to which it is intended to refer as a means of discussing whether specific management options will contribute to sustainable development. It is argued that at the sociopolitical level SFM will necessitate improved transparency and participation in forestry, criteria that can be attained through community-based ecosystem management. Both elements require a science more actively engaged with civil society. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB NASA's Earth Observation System (EOS) satellite data are contributing to the development of policy relevant, remote sensing applications. To promote the use of EOS data for application development, NASA funded the Synergy program in 2000 in partnership with academia, end users, and industry. Three examples of remote sensing applications from the Synergy program are presented here and include agriculture, range management, and water resource management. These examples show that remote sensing products have the potential to be useful to a variety of decision makers and policy makers because of the opportunity to reduce chemicals in the environment, improve crop yields and better manage range lands and water resources. Transitioning from research and development to successful applications must overcome challenges such as the lack of awareness by end users of these technologies, inadequate feedback mechanism between application developers and end users, and unproven cost benefits of remote sensing data. Experience from the Synergy program indicates that these issues could be mitigated by educating and training end users, demonstrating the utility of remote sensing data in improving decision making, and establishing and maintaining a continuous dialogue between developers and end users. Sustainability of remote sensing applications ultimately depends on users continuing reliance on products and benefits from remote sensing data. The Synergy program also demonstrates that remote sensing data sets that are collected primarily for global change research contribute to the development of applications in a variety of disciplines at the regional and local level.

TI Recycling of hazardous solid waste material using high-temperature solar
   process heat. 2. Reactor design and experimentation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A novel high-temperature solar chemical reactor is proposed for the thermal recycling of hazardous solid waste material using concentrated solar power. It features two cavities in series, with the inner one functioning as the solar absorber and the outer one functioning as the reaction chamber. The solar reactor can handle thermo-chemical processes at temperatures above 1300 K involving multiphases and controlled atmospheres. It further allows for batch or continuous mode of operation and for easy adjustment of the residence time of the reactants to match the kinetics of the reaction. A 10-kW solar reactor prototype was designed and tested for the carbothermic reduction of electric arc furnace dusts (EAFD). The reactor was subjected to mean solar flux intensities of 2000 kW m(-2) and operated in both batch and continuous mode within the temperature range of 1120-1400K. Extraction of over 90% of the toxic compounds originally contained in the EAFD was achieved while the condensable products of the off-gas contained mainly Zn, Pb, and Cl. The use of concentrated solar energy as the source of process heat offers the possibility of converting hazardous solid waste material into valuable commodities for processes in closed and sustainable material cycles.

AB Based on data originating from neuroepidemiologic studies in India, epilepsy has been identified as a public health problem. The treatment gap varies from 50 to 70% among persons with epilepsy and is compounded further by limited availability of neurologists, often working in urban metropolises, thus restricting the availability of services in a predominantly rural agrarian country. Cost-effective, sustainable epilepsy care programs are urgently required in India. To bridge this wide gap, a district model was developed with the central focus on training the district medical officers in providing epilepsy care with sensitization of state health administrators and nodal neurologists to support and sustain the program. Workshops were conducted for all three groups during the period 1999-2001, with the involvement of 21 state health administrators, 148 district medical officers, and 28 neurologists. Preliminary evaluation indicates a growing interest, enthusiastic commitment, and willingness among health professionals to expand epilepsy care to the periphery. The program revealed that it is possible to reach people with epilepsy on the premise of early diagnosis and management, need-based referral network, and a rational planning for uninterrupted availability of antiepileptic drugs along with education of families. Policy-level initiatives are required further to transform this on a wider scale and to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of this approach.

AB Aluminum toxicity is one of the major constraints for plant development in acid soils, limiting food production in many countries. Cultivars genetically adapted to acid soils may offer an environmental compatible solution, providing a sustainable agriculture system. The aim of this work was to identify genomic regions associated with Al tolerance in maize, and to quantify the genetic effects on the phenotypic variation. A population of 168 F-3:4 families derived from a cross between two contrasting maize inbred lines for Al tolerance was evaluated using the NSRL and RSRL parameters in nutrient solution containing toxic level of aluminum. Variance analyses indicated that the NSRL was the most reliable phenotypic index to measure Al tolerance in the population, being used for further QTL mapping analysis. RFLP and SSR markers were selected for bulked segregant analysis, and additional SSR markers, flanking the polymorphisms of interest, were chosen in order to saturate the putative target regions. Seven linkage groups were constructed using 17 RFLP and 34 SSR markers. Five QTLs were mapped on chromosomes 2, 6 and 8, explaining 60% of the phenotypic variation. QTL(4) and marker umc043 were located on chromosomes 8 and 5, close to genes encoding for enzymes involved in the organic acids synthesis pathways, a widely proposed mechanism for Al tolerance in plants. QTL(2) was mapped in the same region as Alm2, also associated with Al tolerance in maize. In addition, dominant and additive effects were important in the control of this trait in maize.

AB To identify the reserve of an individual's tolerance of the sensation of breathlessness and metabolic stress in maintaining intense intermittent exercise at exhaustion under conditions of normal breathing, the contribution of the effect of modest inspiratory load on these two responses to the change in the exercise sustainability (Ex(sus)) were examined. Seven men repeatedly performed 12 s exercise at 160% maximal aerobic power output followed by passive recovery for 18 s under normal and ventilatory muscle loaded (VMC) breathing conditions until exhaustion. In the VML trial, ventilatory muscle work at exhaustion was double that of the normal control. The control Exsus was reduced [mean (SEM)] [31.7 (6.6)%] while the slope of the time course for the rating of the perceived magnitude of breathing effort (RPMBE/Time), which reflected the intensity of breathlessness, was increased [164.8 (32.2)%] from control and the RPMBE at exhaustion was higher than corresponding control value [144.4 (21.8)%]. Moreover, increases in plasma ammonia and uric acid concentrations, which indicated metabolic stress, were increased [168.1 (28.0)% and 251.7 (57.4)%, respectively], with no change in total oxygen uptake from control when the control exercise was repeated with an identical duration of VML exercise. It was found that the reduction in Exsus in the VML trial was correlated to the increase in their sensations of the intensity of breathlessness (RPMBE/Time: r = 0.81; RPMBE at exhaustion: r = 0.97, P < 0.05). The reduction in Ex(sus) however, was not correlated to the increase in metabolite concentrations. These findings implied that there was no substantial reserve of tolerance of the sensation of breathlessness relative to that of metabolic stress in subjects maintaining intense intermittent exercise at exhaustion under normal conditions of breathing.

AB Background: Presence of tattoos has been a criterion for temporary deferral of blood donors. Scientific evidence remains equivocal regarding the association between tattooing and transfusion-transmitted diseases (TTDs). Methods: A cross-sectional matched study was undertaken among adults attending a Brazilian hospital and blood bank. The exposure of interest was having at least one permanent tattoo, and the outcomes were the presence of serological markers for the following TTDs: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, syphilis, and Chagas' disease. Exposed and unexposed subjects were matched on age, sex, and main clinical complaint. Associations were assessed by odds ratios (ORs), adjusted for confounders by unconditional logistic regression. Findings: The study recruited 345 subjects, 182 with tattoos. Having a tattoo was associated with HCV ( OR: 6.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29, 31.84), and with having at least one positive test for any TTD ( OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.11, 3.81). No statistically significant associations were found between tattooing and HBV or HIV infection, syphilis or Chagas' disease, but these results are inconclusive given the large CI obtained. Interpretation: Having a tattoo is not an important indicator for testing positive for a TTD, except for HCV infection. Taking into consideration the increasing prevalence of tattooing in the general population, the absolute need of a safe and sustainable blood supply and optimization of the cost-effectiveness of screening blood donors, further research on tattoos is urgently required.

AB In order to demonstrate that welfare theory can be put into practice, mathematical-programming methods are used here which can handle the aggregation problems facing us when information concerning the relative valuation of external factors (emissions, safety risks, non-renewable-energy use, noise, etc.) is highly uncertain. Product- and policy-performance measures are presented and then applied to one-time-period real data on the single, perhaps most welfare-affecting man-made consumer product of the 20th century: light-duty vehicles (LDVs). The focus when examining costs imposed on society due to individuals' (or other economic units') purchase and use of LDVs is here the total external cost from the choice of LDV technology. The relative weights of the external factors are then determined endogenously by (first) using, for each LDV model, the (unconstrained) set of weights most favorable to itself. The flexibility of the relative weights is then constrained according to assumed knowledge about "true" external relative costs. By this procedure it is possible to aggregate the multiple societal-impact factors of LDVs and thus to measure the total external impact of individual LDV-models relative to current best-practice technology.

AB As theories of performativity struggle to disentangle and reconfigure the relationships between act and identity, a heterowoman who relishes the performance of femininity is still aware that she can be read as reactionary. Her choice of sexual partners seems to undermine the efficacy of similar strategies constructed by femme lesbians. One queer option for a heterosexual woman is to 'act' like a gay man. As more than one cultural commentator has pointed out, it appears that only a male drag queen can be a 'lady' these days. This particular woman does not want to change her biological sex to 'be' a gay man. She has learned how to be a 'lady' from the 'feminized fags' who may have learned from her mother. Their ironic distancing, camp connoiseurship, and parodic appropriation of the notion of a stable gender identity came as part of the package. As a result of this transaction, she acts as if she has balls under her dress. Such mimetic masquerades can be most easily recognized as resistant when performativity is 'bound' into a formalized performance. It is implicit that this artifice is not sustainable, nor is this desirable. 'Doing' queer means possessing the agency to defy and destabilize gendered behaviours, sexes, and sexualities through continuing and conscious decisions. This article explores the efficacy of heterosexual femme performances that attempt to challenge and subvert ideological normativities through their transactions with gay men.

DE economic and monetary integration; Portuguese economy
AB The Portuguese economy initiated its path towards economic and monetary integration in 1960 by taking part in the group of countries that founded the European Free Trade Association. Since then until the adoption of the euro as the national currency in 1999 a long path was followed. The economic and financial integration process, has been successful and benefited from the support of a large majority of domestic agents. Along this path the country witnessed substantial real and nominal convergence to the European Union average. However, Portugal is still lagging behind and important challenges lie ahead. Economic and financial integration in the EU was a catalyst for needed economic reforms, it increased the degree of openness and the gains from trade and facilitated nominal convergence through clearly defined and politically assumed macroeconomic objectives. Nevertheless, as the recent years in Portugal illustrate, financial and monetary integration do not guarantee sustainable economic growth nor avoid macroeconomic imbalances. Only continued increases in total factor productivity based on effective supply-side policies can deliver these results.

AB Changes in fatty acid metabolism in Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar) induced by vegetable oil (VO) replacement of fish oil (FO) and high dietary oil in aquaculture diets can have negative impacts on the nutritional quality of the product for the human consumer, including altered flesh fatty acid composition and lipid content. A dietary trial was designed to investigate the twin problems of FO replacement and high energy diets in salmon throughout the entire production cycle. Salmon were grown from first feeding to around 2 kg on diets in which FO was completely replaced by a 1: 1 blend of linseed and rapeseed oils at low (14-17%) and high (25-35%) dietary oil levels. This paper reports specifically on the influence of diet on various aspects of fatty acid metabolism. Fatty acid compositions of liver, intestinal tissue and gill were altered by the diets with increased proportions of C-18 polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreased proportions of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in fish fed VO compared to fish fed FO. HUFA synthesis in hepatocytes and enterocytes was significantly higher in fish fed VO, whereas beta-oxidation was unaltered by either dietary oil content or type. Over the entire production cycle, HUFA synthesis in hepatocytes showed a decreasing trend with age interrupted by a large peak in activity at seawater transfer. Gill cell prostaglandin ( PG) production showed a possible seasonal trend, with peak activities in winter and low activities in summer and at seawater transfer. PG production in seawater was lower in fish fed the high oil diets with the lowest PG production generally observed in fish fed high VO. The changes in fatty acid metabolism induced by high dietary oil and VO replacement contribute to altered flesh lipid content and fatty acid compositions, and so merit continued investigation to minimize any negative impacts that sustainable, environmentally-friendly and cost-effective aquaculture diets could have in the future.

AB Egg and larval quality of red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus from natural spawns of domesticated brooders and hormone-induced spawns of wild fish were compared. Eggs and larvae from natural spawns were found to be more viable in terms of fertilization, hatching and survival rate. Also, eggs from natural spawns were larger, and eggs and recently hatched larvae had larger oil-globule. These findings indicate that natural spawning of red snapper can be a sustainable and reliable source of good quality eggs.

AB Inoculum of an indigenous mixture of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) containing Glomus mosseae, Glomus fasciculatum, Glomus etunicatum, Glomus intraradices and Scutellospora sp. was applied to four of the most frequently used crop species in Slovenia: green pepper (Capsicum annuum), parsley (Petroselinum crispum), carrot (Daucus carrota) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). A simple, feasible, and effective protocol for application of AMF biotechnology in horticulture was adopted.
   Mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased the plant biomass parameters of pepper, and parsley and the root biomass of carrots. Statistically significant correlations between biomass parameters of pepper, parsley, and the root biomass of carrots with mycorrhizal colonization parameters (mycorrhizal frequency (F%), global mycorrhizal intensity (M%) and arbuscular richness (A%)) were calculated. A significant increase in chlorophyll content was observed in mycorrhizal parsley and a significant increase in carotenoids was observed in mycorrhizal parsley, carrots, and tomato fruits. A significant increase in titratable acidity of fruits from inoculated tomato plants indicates prolonged fruiting period of mycorrhizal tomatoes. In addition, inoculation with an indigenous AMF mixture significantly increased the mycorrhizal potential of soil and thus the growth of non-inoculated plants in the second season. Thus, the results confirmed the potential of applying mycorrhizal biotechnology in sustainable horticulture.

AB The existing forest economic models, rooted in sustained yield timber management systems and neo-classical economic framework, are subject to many limitations. Social, economic, and ecological features of sustainable forest management (SFM) are different than that of sustained yield timber management. Hence, the economics of SFM will be based on different economic principles. The two main requirements of the economics of SFM are the economics of multiple equilibria, and a consumer choice theory that incorporates heterogeneity of agents, context specific and dynamics of preferences, distinction between needs and wants, and the subordination of needs. These requirements will need the extension of the boundaries of forest economics. Five basic principles-principles of 'both-and', 'existence', 'relativity', 'uncertainty', and 'complementarity' will work as a foundation, and the economic principles, developed by evolutionary, institutional, ecological economists and economists from other new streams of economics, will be the useful tools to extend these boundaries.

AB In northern Ethiopia, eucalyptus is the most commonly observed tree species in community and household woodlots. In an environment suffering from biomass and water shortages, erosion and land degradation, fast growing and resilient eucalyptus perform better than most indigenous tree species. Smallholders show a clear preference for eucalyptus poles, which are useful for farm implements and constructing dwellings and fences. In addition, the sale of eucalyptus poles and products has the potential to raise farm incomes, reduce poverty, increase food security and diversify smallholder-farming systems in less-favored areas of Tigray. Despite the potential for eucalyptus to improve rural livelihoods, in 1997 the regional government of Tigray imposed a ban on eucalyptus tree planting on farmlands. The ban was precipitated by concerns about the potential negative environmental externalities associated with eucalyptus, and the desire to reserve farmland for crop production. However, the regional government promotes the planting of eucalyptus in community woodlots, and has recently begun to allow private planting of eucalyptus on community wasteland and steep hillsides. In this paper, we review the ecological debate surrounding the planting of eucalyptus trees. In addition, the economic factors that influence smallholders to invest in tree production are considered. Ex ante benefit-cost analysis based on community and village level survey data from Tigray illustrates that planting eucalyptus yields high rates of return, well above 20% in most circumstances. The effect of variable harvest rates, and the potential costs of decreased crop production when eucalyptus trees are planted on or near farmlands are considered relative to our base case scenario. Based upon the review of the ecological and economic impacts of eucalyptus, we conclude that a policy option favoring the allocation of wastelands for private tree planting offers the greatest opportunity for rural smallholders.

AB Single-species conservation and natural reserves seem insufficient for protecting biodiversity to scientists, and conventional forestry seems suspect in sustainability to much of the public. In north-western USA, comparisons of natural and managed coniferous forests support the idea that both single-species conservation and conventional forestry are unlikely to be successful because biocomplexity is more important than individual habitat elements in maintaining the diversity of forest ecosystems and their capacity to produce useful goods and services. Experiments in inducing heterogeneity into forest canopies support the importance of biocomplexity to various biotic communities including soil organisms, vascular plants, fungi, birds, small mammals and vertebrate predators. Holistic management, however, requires a suite of techniques to direct developmental processes to useful trajectories.

AB A 20-year programme of research suggests that old-growth forests are ecologically unique and highly valued by people, that naturally young forests with legacies from old forests sustain many, if not all, the higher organisms associated with old growth, but that many managed forests are impoverished in species. Thus, restoring landscape function entails restoring function to managed stands. Managing processes of forest development, not just providing selected structures, is necessary to restore function and biodiversity. Systems of reserves and riparian corridors that do not take into account ecological restoration of managed forests and degraded streams may be self-fulfilling prophecies of forest fragmentation and landscape dysfunction. Intentional management can reduce the need for wide riparian buffers, produce landscapes dominated by late-seral stages that are hospitable to wildlife associated with old-growth forests, provide a sustained yield of forest products and contribute to economic, social and environmental sustainability.

TI Using tree recruitment patterns and fire history to guide restoration of
   an unlogged ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir landscape in the southern Rocky
   Mountains after a century of fire suppression
SO FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID PINE; FOREST
AB Tree age and fire history were studied in an unlogged ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir (Pinus ponderosa/Pseudotsuga menziesii) landscape in the Colorado Front Range mountains. These data were analysed to understand tree survival during fire and post-fire recruitment patterns after fire, as a basis for understanding the characteristics of, and restoration needs for, an ecologically sustainable landscape. Comparisons of two independent tree age data sets indicated that sampling what subjectively appear to be the five oldest trees in a forest polygon could identify the oldest tree. Comparisons of the ages of the oldest trees in each data set with maps of fire history suggested that delays in establishment of trees, after stand-replacing fire, ranged from a few years to more than a century. These data indicate that variable fire severity, including patches of stand replacement, and variable temporal patterns of tree recruitment into openings after fire were major causes of spatial heterogeneity of patch structure in the landscape. These effects suggest that restoring current dense and homogeneous ponderosa pine forests to an ecologically sustainable and dynamic condition should reflect the roles of fires and variable patterns of tree recruitment in regulating landscape structure.

TI Forest and community sustainability - An Ontario perspective
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE

AB Challenges to the sustainability of communities in northern and central Ontario are both ecological and socio-economic in nature. Ecological challenges include persistent impacts such as acid deposition as well as emerging challenges such as the advance of forestry northward and its impact on wildlife populations. Socio-economic challenges of the communities in this region include a declining population level as well as a workforce that is aging. Despite these challenges, northern communities, and forestry planners in particular, have knowledge and experience of value to community planning throughout Ontario. Examples include the fact that foresters and forestry-based communities know how to plan at the landscape ecosystem level, integrate biodiversity conservation and decide on the long-term disposition of land. This knowledge could make a significant contribution to community sustainability in southern Ontario communities, and inadvertently enhance the credibility and influence of forest planning methods and foresters in urban centres.

AB One of the components of the IUCN-The World Conservation Union project, "Building Partnerships for Forest Conservation and Management in Russia" funded by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), is designed to assist remote communities of the Russian Far East to sustainably develop their NTFP resources. In our project, NTFPs are viewed as one part of a local sustainable livelihood strategy (including tourism, cultural activities, hunting, herding). We provide business and legal issues training, consultation on small business and community-based enterprise development, and support for sustainability and monitoring programs. One of the basic principles of the project has been a participatory approach to project development and implementation. It is the hope of project participants that the successful development of NTFP and other opportunities will decrease the pressure to move forward with potentially damaging resource exploitation activities. Although community economic development is the primary goal, the revival and sharing of indigenous knowledge about NTFPs has been identified by participants as a key issue, and is a focus of educational materials being developed through the project.

AB The annual increase of power energy consumption and the incapability of the currently installed energy production system in a hypothetical area to cover the future demand, are raising the issues of developing new policies and introducing new ways to produce energy in a sustainable way. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how a well-known multicriteria analysis method, namely outranking relation theory, can be used to evaluate alternative scenarios for sustainable management of the energy system in the area. These scenarios are combinations of penetration of different energy producing units, such as conventional units and renewable energy units. A set of sustainability indicators is proposed, that denote resource, environmental, economic and social aspects of each scenario.

DE hazardous concentration; soil function; soil organism; soil protection;
   soil value; trigger value
AB Soil flora and fauna are essential to soil formation and to the preservation of soil functions. They are involved in substance cycles such as degradation and transformation in soil and play an indirect role in the water cycle. This means that sustainable protection of the habitat of plants and soil organisms simultaneously creates the basis for protecting the other natural functions mentioned in the Federal Soil Protection Act (Art. 2 para. 2).
   The current Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance (BBodSchV of 1999) [1] only defines trigger values for the soil-human being, soil-food plant and soil-groundwater pathways. In order to comprehensively protect all natural soil functions, soil values must also be derived for the pathway "soil --> soil organism" including soil invertebrates, microorganisms, and higher plants.
   This contribution presents the conceptional framework for the derivation of these soil values. It describes in detail the basic conditions for the selection of ecotoxicological data, and the statistical calculation of soil values and their plausibility analysis. An example is presented to illustrate the derivation methodology.
   The development of the derivation methodology, the calculation of soil values for soil-relevant substances and the experimental validation of the concept occurred in the framework of activities of the Technical Committee on Biological Soil Assessment of Technical Group 4, Soil Functions and Soil Pollution, of the Federal Soil Association (Bundesverband Boden-BVB);and a research project funded by the Federal Environmental Agency, entitled "Development of ecotoxicological guide values for soil".

During the period of research, the plant received municipal as well as untreated industrial pollutants in continuous wastewater inflow. The treatment system was operated in a continuous AAA (alternating aeration-anoxic) mode. The results showed that immobilized microorganisms delivered costs-saving and high efficiency of pollutants removal, i.e., 85%-90% of COD (chemical oxygen demand), 80-90% of NH3-N (ammonia) and 50% of TP (total phosphorus) with 0.15-0.25 Kwh/m(3) of electric power in 5-6 of residence hours. The application of immobilized microorganisms produced about 75% less sludge than conventional "activated sludge" at the FZWWTP site. Moreover, the immobilized system withstood the shocks from irregular and high intensity untreated industrial pollutants and maintained sustainable efficiency of pollutant removal.

AB Recycling of wood building waste has been required and wood boards are prospective recycled materials. The concept of FGM was introduced to the wood board as a base material of a floor heating system to develop an FGM board with higher energy efficiency. Two-dimensional unsteady heat transfer problem in an FGM plate with material properties of wood was analyzed, which modeled the state that the base material was heated partially. The Laplace transform and the perturbation method were applied for the analysis. The tactile warmth of a facing plate in the floor heating system, which touches to human sole directly, was discussed to avoid losing the goodness of wood.

AB The capability of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to handle premature convergence is critically important when applied to real-world problems. Their highly multi-modal and discrete search space often makes the required performance out of reach to current MOEAs. Examining the fundamental cause of premature convergence in evolutionary search has led to proposing of a generic framework, named Hierarchical Fair Competition (HFC)([9]), for robust and sustainable evolutionary search. Here an HFC-based Hierarchical Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization framework (HEMO) is proposed, which is characterized by its simultaneous maintenance of individuals of all degrees of evolution in hierarchically organized repositories, by its continuous inflow of random individuals at the base repository, by its intrinsic hierarchical elitism and hyper-grid-based density estimation. Two experiments demonstrate its search robustness and its capability to provide sustainable evolutionary search for difficult multi-modal problems. HEMO makes it possible to do reliable multi-objective search without risk of premature convergence. The paradigmatic transition of HEMO to handle premature convergence is that instead of trying to escape local optima from converged high fitness populations, it tries to maintain the opportunity for new optima to emerge from the bottom up as enabled by its hierarchical organization of individuals of different fitnesses.

AB Quality of soil maps is a prerequisite for rational land use and soil management. To assess the accuracy of the existing reconnaissance soil map (1:50,000) of the Chaharmahal Bakhtiari province, Iran, a second-order soil survey was conducted. Using aerial photo interpretation, profile description, and field observations, a detailed soil map (1:20,000) was prepared. Then, 85 pedons were described and samples were taken for laboratory analyses. The location of pedons was determined with a Global Positioning System (GPS) and then marked on both soil maps using ILWIS software. Properties of the surface horizons including percentage of gravel, clay, sand, silt, CaCO3 equivalent, organic matter, and the thickness of A horizon were determined. Although detailed soil map units were more homogenous, purity of map units at family and series levels was lower than those expected in American Soil Survey Manual. Taxonomic purity at series level was 18.75% to 33.3% and 0% to 1.3% for detailed and reconnaissance soil maps, respectively. With respect to similar soils, interpretive purity could improve to 75% in detailed soil map. For all the surface soil properties except organic matter, the detailed soil map had within-map unit variances that were smaller than the total variance, whereas reconnaissance soil map variance remained high. Soil classification in both the detailed and the reconnaissance mapping units accounted for 5% to 45% and 1.1% to 27% of the total variance for these properties. Sampling demand to predict mean values was much larger in the reconnaissance soil map for most of the topsoil properties. Laboratory studies showed that the detailed soil map units in similar physiographic units could have different soils and vice versa. It appears that the definition of mapping units based on guidelines by Soil Survey Manual is rather optimistic and does not have sufficient reliability for using in sustainable agriculture.

AB This study appraises the effects of land use on soil properties in a typical watershed in the northwestern highland of Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected from major land use types in the watershed: natural forests, cultivated lands, grazing lands and Eucaliplus plantations. The natural forests served as a control against which to assess changes in soil properties resulting from the establishment of the other land use types. Samples were taken at two depths (0-15 and 15-30 cm) in the upstream and downstream areas of the watershed and analyzed for a range of soil properties. The soils in the cultivated fields, grazing lands and Eucalyptus plantations showed significantly higher sand content, but lower Ca2+ and Mg2+ contents and cation exchange capacity (CEC) compared to soils under natural forests. Eucalyptus soils had a statistically significant higher bulk density (BD) than soils under the other three land use types. The forest and Eucalyptus soils also differed significantly from each other in their soil organic matter (SOM) and total N contents. A significant difference in available P among soils of the four land use types was caused by the difference between cultivated and Eucalyptus soils. In contrast, the distribution of soil silt fraction Na+, K+ and pH values did not differ among the four land use types. Significant differences in many of the soil properties were also observed between soils in the two sampled villages. The study underscores the need for policies and strategies for sustainable land use that will attune objectives of economic development to environmental management at the regional and local levels.

AB An ethnoecological study was carried out in the Purhepecha community of San Francisco Pichataro, west central Mexico, with the purpose of investigating how land degradation, in terms of soil erosion and fertility depletion, was (and still is) handled by indigenous farmers so that traditional agriculture could remain sustainable over centuries. After briefly reviewing opposite views on the land degradation issue in the regional context of the Patzcuaro lake basin, the paper focuses on land management at local level. The indigenous concept of land is discussed as an integrated whole, including water cycle, climate, relief and soils. Indigenous people venerate land as the mother of all living beings, including humans. Therefore, people's health and survival require good land care and management. Local knowledge on land management is organized around four basic principles: land position, land behaviour, land resilience and land quality. Farmers recognize land as a dynamic subject, a concept reflected in the expression 'land moves and behaves'. Soil erosion and fertility depletion are perceived as 'normal' processes the farmers control by means of integrated management practices. Farmers recognize several land classes, primarily controlled by landscape position, which require different land care. The example of San Francisco Pichataro demonstrates that traditional agriculture does not necessarily lead to land degradation. But the collective knowledge, or social theory, on land management is increasingly exposed to be fragmented as the community undergoes structural changes and loses its social cohesion under the pressure of externalities such as off-farm activities, out-migrations and governmental intervention, among others.

AB Sustainability of a land use system is determined through optimal interactions between the four factors (subsystems) land, tabour, capital and management, often grouped into the two environmental (biophysical) and socioeconomic systems. Considering the fact that each of these systems is complex, consisting of various entities, interactions between the entities will be determinant also at lower categories. Take, for instance, the land component, where, among others, climate, soil, topography and geology are involved.
   Many researchers have stated that comparatively traditional agricultural systems were environmentally sound. This is obviously too generalized a statement, because land degradation took place in the past, also, for different reasons, in some cases because of social disturbances and in others being more environmentally oriented. Nevertheless, local studies show remarkable cases of environmentally sound traditional agricultural systems, having been developed in a long historical period.
   The intention of the paper is, in the first place, to demonstrate that degradation is not a new phenomenon, and secondly to argue that many factors, both physical and social, could have played a role in the occurrence or absence of land degradation. It is remarkable that the land surrounding the Hagmataneh hill in Hamadan, Iran, with over 5000 years of agricultural history, does not show any sign of degradation, whereas other sites in the same district are degraded. Similarly, in the territory of San Francisco Pichataro, an indigenous community of Central Mexico, with at least 4000 years of agricultural history, no sign of land degradation is visible, whereas some other sites, with comparatively similar physical characteristics, are degraded.

DE water demand; beach degradation; tourism; Mallorca; beach-dune system;
   desalination; groundwater overexploitation
AB The development of tourism in Mallorca has led to the island's economy being based, almost exclusively, on this sector. Since 1955 mass tourism has affected the economic and social structures of Mallorca. The development was based on a rapid growth of tourist demand and on a chaotic development of tourist facilities. This has had severe consequences for the island: insufficiently controlled urban planning, overcrowded beaches, and erosion of the beach-dune system caused by massive construction on the coastal zone. Many beaches have been transformed into urban beaches and their coastline has retreated. Solutions like sand renourishment have not stopped the erosion process. The increasing number of residents and visitors exerts a strong pressure over water resources producing overextraction and a lowering of the groundwater table in aquifers. A strong seasonal concentration of visitors in coastal summer resorts represents a high peak demand during the dry season. The exhaustion of groundwater resources and the higher water demand are managed with environmentally and economically expensive resources such as seawater desalination. The results show that the dwelling capacity of the island has been exceeded and the present levels of water demand and beach degradation are not sustainable. This indicates that tourism in Mallorca is becoming unsustainable and a water and coastal management policy is urgently required if sustainability is to be achieved.

   on morphology, community dynamics and sustainability
SO GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
ID ATLAS MOUNTAINS; MANAGEMENT
AB This article examines the influences of environment and culture on the morphology, community dynamics and sustainability of two subterranean settlements in southern Tunisia. The settlements and their individual dwellings are strongly influenced by geology and topography. Subterranean dwellings moderate extremes of temperature and humidity, and shade occupants from the glare of the summer sun. The settlements are shaped by religious and social values; there are prominent mosques, and private courtyards necessary for the seclusion of women. Modern settlement planning in the region must take account of these aspects if it is to prove successful. These traditional societies provide a model of good practice in terms of sustainable resource use, but they have been exposed to external influences from local to international scales. Out-migration and an increasing influx of tourists provide both challenges and opportunities for the future of the settlements.

ID FEMINISM
AB In this article I focus on a subaltern approach to knowledge networks by examining the process of setting up such a network, the South Asia Research Network (SARN) on Gender, Law and Governance. I reflect on the construction of discourses about 'knowledge' and 'knowledge-makers' and the issues of access that emerge as a result of these discourses and practices. I outline three aspects of a 'politics of network(s)-ing': the politics of process; the politics of outcome; and the politics of framing. I conclude that the borders of which we need to be aware are not just national borders but also borders of power. Knowledge networks are politically heterogeneous and for subaltern networks to have sustainable organizations as well as critical politics they need to be self-reflective and deliberative.

TI How hazardous are ionic liquids? Structure-activity relationships and
   biological testing as important elements for sustainability evaluation
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB For ionic liquids only few toxicological and/or ecotoxicological data are available until now. A strategy is presented which aims at an environmental risk assessment of chemicals, using a combination of structure-activity relationships (SAR), toxicological and ecotoxicological tests and modelling. The parts "test-kit-concept" and "multidimensional risk analysis" are described in detail by means of selected imidazolium ionic liquids. The iterative process of this strategy offers a tool for sustainable product design.

TI A novel non-phosgene polycarbonate production process using by-product
   CO2 as starting material

ID SOLID-STATE POLYMERIZATION
AB Asahi Kasei Corp. has succeeded in the development of a new green process for producing an aromatic polycarbonate based on bisphenol-A (hereafter usually abbreviated as PC) without using phosgene and methylene chloride.(1) The new PC production process is the world's first to use carbon dioxide (CO2) as a starting material. Until Asahi Kasei's new process was revealed, all of the PC in the world has been produced using carbon monoxide (CO) made from cokes or lower hydrocarbons and oxygen as a starting material. Furthermore, more than about 93% of the PC has been produced-by the so-called "phosgene process" which uses phosgene made from CO and chlorine (CIA as a monomer. However, the phosgene process inherently involves a number of environmental and economic shortcomings in addition to the high toxicity of phosgene itself and the high carcinogenic probability of methylene chloride itself. Asahi Kasei's new process enables high-yield production of the two important products for our citizens' lives, high-quality PC and high-purity monoethylene glycol (MEG), starting from ethylene oxide (EO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and bisphenol-A. This new technology not only overcomes the environmental and economic problems existing in the phosgene process, but also achieves resource conservation, and energy conservation. Furthermore, the new process contributes to the earth environment by the reduction Of CO2 emissions (173 tons per thousand tons of product PC). Commercial application of the new process was carried out at the 50,000 top year(-1) PC plant of Chimei-Asahi Corporation, a joint venture between Asahi Kasei Corporation and Chi Mei,Corporation, which was. newly constructed in Taiwan and has' been successfully operating since June 2002, In,recognition of the outstanding advance in ecological and sustainable performance that this technology represents, Japan's Minister of Economy Trade and Industry conferred the Green and Sustainable Chemistry Award of 200 on us. Furthermore, the Chairman of Japan Chemical Industry Association also conferred the 35th Japan Chemical Industry Association Award of 2003 on us as an outstanding chemical. technology. An outline of this new non phosgene PC process embodying the spirit of Green and Sustainable Chemistry is given here.

AB The biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) from waste edible oils and tallow by Ralstonia eutropha was investigated. Waste plant oils as well as waste tallow were assimilated-And successfully converted to PHA with relatively high yield by the bacterial fermentation. The waste plant oils usually gave poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) while waste tallow gave poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). The ratio of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) unit in the copolyester was controlled by the addition of sodium propionate to the cultivation medium containing waste plant oils as' carbon sources. The ratio of PHA Accumulated was also quite high and up to 80% of the cell dry weight. The PHA accumulated was easily isolated by simply mixing the cells in aqueous sodium hypochlorite without using any organic solvents. We propose herein the biorecycling of waste oils as renewable resources for sustainable society.

AB This study analyzes changing trends in U.S. health spending and concludes that although the long-term growth trend has been a good predictor of future spending, periodic differences in the growth trend are important. Of particular concern is the rapid acceleration in health spending beginning in 1998. If left unchecked, the current growth rate will result in almost 24 percent of GDP spent on health by 2011. The authors question whether such unconstrained spending levels are either desirable or inevitable, and they offer a guide to how the United States might develop a long-term cost-containment strategy that is both effective and sustainable.

TI Water for everybody - Between dream and reality
SO HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU
LA French
DT Article
AB Water for all! Is this possible? What is the state of the resource today on the surface of the planet? Can we manage? What technologies should we put to the service of water to ensure better access? Do we have the will to do this? Is water holding the priority it deserves in international as well as local development policies?
   Even if water is an abundant resource, it is often hardly accessible for a large portion of the world's population. Several regions suffer from a permanent hydraulic stress and severe shortages are always a threat. These natural unbalances are amplified by the global warming up, human behaviour, the pollutions and conflicts it generates. In short, Humankind is often an enemy for water.
   What changes in our behaviour should we bring forth to reverse the trend?
   First, encourage the use of a set of techniques aimed at developing the availability of the resource, its distribution and treatment. Improve the management of this resource by limiting waste and thus by consuming less. Contribute to the use of new treatment techniques such as desalination, deep water tapping, trans-continental transfers.
   Secondly, give water a real priority not only with words but with actions : drinking water before mobile telephony, effective decentralization of water competencies, revenue based self-sufficient budgets, passion free public-private partnership based on a mutual understanding and the will to create and maintain a quality public service.
   Thirdly, transform the relationship between water and the community. The need for a permanent debate on the resources, uses, tariffs and statutes. The will to educate through a genuine basic training policy dedicated to water issues. The promotion of active and sustainable R&D activities based on a network of local authority associations, universities and businesses.
   Water for all is more than a mere evolution. It is the expression of a peaceful and mobilising revolution. It is the expression of our responsibility to guaranty access to water in all places at all times.

CL GRENOBLE, FRANCE
AB Aluminium was produced for the first time in 1854 through a very expensive chemical process. So it was only used in jewelry until the discovery of an electrolytic process, using hydropower, which paved the way for its industrial development.
   The first aluminum smelters, in the turn of the century, were located close to the Alpine and Pyrenean waterfalls, with the addition in the thirties of regulative dams and interconnecting power lines. But after the nationalization in 1946 the aluminium companies had to turn to overseas hydropower resources.
   Hydroelectricity and aluminium are jointly participating in the sustainable development. Hydroelectricity is still the most appropriate power for aluminium smelting. The metal is easily recycled and useful for power savings. On the other hand aluminium had to be very often associated to the financing of huge hydroelectric works which delivery electric power throughout large areas.

DT Article
ID SEDIMENT; EROSION; SLOPES; SOIL
AB Erosion in marly torrential catchments in the French Southern Alps causes silting of hydroelectric dam impoundments established along the Durance river. One solution to assist in solving this problem consists of retaining the sediments within the catchments. To do this, vegetation and bioengineering works can be used as efficient and sustainable means to avoid sediment erosion and transport to dam impoundments. Effectively, the cover provided by vegetation and bioengineering works acts as a barrier to soil erosion. The studies showed that vegetation barriers can stop sediment yield at the exit of gullies only partially covered with vegetation, if the vegetation is located downstream of the gully. This paper presents the current and improved knowledge about the influence of vegetation barriers on erosion, and explains how to use this knowledge to propose optimal strategies for reduction of the sediment load in rivers and hydroelectric dam impoundments, by the use of ecological engineering techniques.

AB Much has been said around the controversial question of whether water should be considered as a social good or as a commodity. Breaking away from this fruitless debate the answer this article is intended to illustrate, in three steps, is "Water is a social AND economic good."
   No one would contest the social nature of water, as the element most essential to life. At SUEZ we believe in the universal right to water. But also believe that to become a reality, this universal right must come with the Public Authority's duty to ensure and guarantee access to water to all the people it serves.
   Freshwater resources are, and should be, a local public good. Freshwater is not a commodity. But the service of making it available to the population does have an economic value. This value includes much more than the cost of building, maintaining, and operating the water distribution system: it also includes the level and quality of service, the public health, environmental, and employment benefits, and its roll in poverty alleviation.
   Despite the social role of water, the Poor often do not benefit from collective water infrastructure, and therefore pay more for water than the Better Off. Our 15 year practical experience as a water operator in developing countries shows it is possible to reconcile the social nature and the economic aspects of water. I propose here some answers to the following questions: who should pay for water? How the cost should be distributed fairly among users?
   Accepting the economic value of water allows for its better and more sustainable management and helps ensuring its social role. This is a key to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

AB Some institutional hopes are based on present practices: a panel of senior financiers have been brought together by Michel Camdessus, with purpose to deliver proposals to the Water Ministerial Conference to be held during the Third World Water Forum, Kyoto, March 2003; the water Right is supposed to develop new rules for a widened solidarity in favor of a better share of the water resources; a more accessible information will strengthen the links between the various stakeholders of an improved governance of the water policy.
   Some other basic hopes complement this first approach with along range extension: the sustainable development of the water resources and uses must pay attention to the socio-economic background for any implementation; the Deming cycle must be observed when building the ater policy; financial achievement is beyond the economic analysis, its rules must be strictly obeyed.
   As a starting statement for the future, a global hope is addressed to a higher spirit of responsibility, an improved efficiency and a more practicable generosity.

AB This research work attempts to determine and to analyse the behaviors of the farmers in term of adaptation and viability of production systems to the dubious and limited availability of water in small darns. For that, on analysis of the case of the Djebel Hallouf reservoir, located in the district of Kairouan with a storing capacity of 95 000 m(3) was used. The practical method followed in work consists of three essential stages : (i) initially, a typology allowed the identification of the various production systems undertaken by farmers. The various types of exploitation around the reservoir were then modeled using the stochastic programming; (ii) in the second time, results of the basic models and their sensitivities to annual variations of irrigation water, were analyzed. The water demand functions of the various forms are set up and analyzed; (iii) in a third phase, and in order to analysis the technical and economic functioning of water reservoirs with regard to the problem of siltation which affects its capacity in the time, dynamic model have integrated the factor time and have been useful to analysis the production systems evolution and their subsequent incomes. In general, the randomness of the filling of the reservoirs is the origin of the instability of the annual farmers incomes, The water demand functions of various farms are rigid owing to the fact that the cost of water represents a weak share of the gross margin of crops. Production systems based on annual crops were not viable given the siltation process, which affects directly the through time water supply. The practice of these later comes in contradiction with the logic of sustainable development which governs the sectorial policy of the government in matter of hill reservoirs construction. Thus, the practice of tree plantation comes as a viable alternative able to generate through time relatively steady incomes and to induce consequently a sustainable local agricultural development around hill reservoirs.

AB This article investigates issues linked to the development of water pricing policies in accordance with the newly adopted Water Framework Directive. This directive includes specific provisions for the development of pricing policies that ensure an adequate incentive for users to use water efficiently and an adequate recovery of the costs of water services by the main water uses (agriculture, industry, households). Today, water pricing policies in Europe are highly diverse and changes in these policies will be required to account for the Water Framework Directive. Specific elements will then need to be considered when developing new pricing policies that account for the environmental objectives of the Directive. Overall, the Directive will promote higher transparency on who uses and pollutes, what does it cost and who pays for these costs, that will be key in the context of information, consultation and participation of the public and stakeholders.

AB The debate on water in France often emphasises the low contribution of Agriculture to the Basin Agencies' budgets. However blatant, this point incites some people to maintain that "making farmers pay for water; would be sufficient to regulate all users conflicts. This assertion ignores the economic realities of irrigated agriculture in France, which today pays for the major part of the water service cost. Is there any other economic activity or industry being charged for water up to 16% of its turn-over? Yet, the average figure is the true reality of south-west France irrigated agriculture, even after including the compensation payments of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy). It is on the basis of a clear understanding of this point that the socio-economic and environmental stakes of irrigation can be assessed and that the adapted economic instruments can be devised to release the pressure on water resources: the choice of the water price compared to the water value ('the sustainable cost pricing') and the type of pricing method are two examples of these instruments which are capable of both ensuring the sustainability of assets and giving a better control on the water demand.

AB The debate on sustainable water management, and on its recognition as an economic good and a market good is becoming global, but within a certain confusion. It is not only due to mixing up water as a resource and water markets on the one hand, and water as a public service and its privatisation on the other hand. This paper tries to show that economists themselves disagree as to how consider efficient management of renewable natural resources, and also as to the evaluation of the efficient and fair price for water services provision. The review of these various trends is followed by afterthoughts on the evaluation report of the French Agences de I'eau by the Commissariat au Plan. Lastly, the presentation for the concept of full cost recovery of water services is illustrated by two contrasted examples on Barcelona and Los Angeles, which help understand what demand side management brings to the issue.

AB One of the reasons for the inadequate quality of indoor air arises from the poor articulation, appreciation and understanding of basic principles underlying the policies and actions related to indoor air quality. A WHO Working Group derived nine statements on rights to healthy indoor air. The discussions and statements are available as a WHO report. It informs the individuals and groups responsible for healthy indoor air about their rights and obligations, and empowers the general public by making people familiar with those rights. One year after their publication the statements have been adopted as the base for future regulation and guidance. The Board of Directors of the International Society of Indoor Air Quality (ISIAQ) an the participants of two international conferences endorse the use of the statements. No opposition to the statements have been registered. The statements have entered curricula of training courses and have been used in lawsuits.

AB Ahipa (Pachyrhizus ahipa [Wedd.] Parodi) is a tuberous root producing legume which can be used for the production of raw materials such as starch, sugar and protein in a sustainable agriculture system. In this study, we studied root and pod production of available landraces grown at two different locations for making preliminary yield assessments and analyzed root and seed composition to determine production of raw materials. Important variation in root and pod growth and harvest index was observed among accessions. Some landraces showed higher potential for root production than others, with a higher potential for seed production. Root dry matter ranged from 16.3 to 21.1%. Root starch content ranged 38.6-54.4%, while a wider variation in root sugar content was observed (21.8-51.4%). Seeds had high protein (25.2-31.4%) and high oil contents (18.7-22.4%). Free amino acid concentration in roots was quite high (0.26-0.41%), with asparagine as the main amino-N compound. An important accumulation of canavanine, amino acid structural analog of arginine, was found in seeds of some accessions. With low nutritional requirements and high pest resistance, which underlines the low environmental impact, ahipa reaches root and seed yield similar to other root or pulse crops. Since of its yield and root and seed components (starch, sugar, proteins, oil), which could be improved by breeding, the ahipa appears a promising alternative to other traditional sources of raw materials.

AB Due to its quality, limited vulnerability, and relatively continuous availability groundwater is a resource of strategic importance. Therefore, its exploitation must be ruled by sustainability criteria. This work intends to describe, in a general framework, the basic criteria that must rule the sustainable management of groundwater In its first part ("Criteria for a Sustainable Exploitation of Groundwater 1. Well Hydraulics and the Regional Simulation of Aquifers", Hydraulic Engineering in Mexico, vol. 17, no. 4, October-December 2002, pp, 57-77), the emphasis was placed upon the quantitative aspects, especially in the limitation of the groundwater table drawdowns. However, it is necessary to describe with the same depth the qualitative criteria and their integration with the quantitative ones, in order to define strategies for the sustainable management of groundwater This is the purpose of this second part. New, recently developed methods for the prevention of saltwater intrusion are described, together with a specific example of the use of a freshwater barrier for this purpose. The criteria that should be used for groundwater management in regions with possible salinization of soils are also described. Groundwater remediation methods are listed. The methods for the protection of the resources and the sources against contamination are also explained. The comprehensiveness of the approach is consolidated by including the management measures, emphasizing the coupled utilization of surface and groundwater, artificial recharge and demand management approach, all of which are illustrated with several examples of the international trends in this field.

AB Coordination, accounting for the global coherence of system behaviour, is a fundamental aspect of complex multi-agent systems. As such, coordination in multi-agent systems provides a suitable level of abstraction to deal with system organisation and control. However, current coordination approaches in multi-agent systems are not always fully equipped to model and support the global coherence of open computational systems, i.e., multi-agent systems that are situated in complex and dynamic physical environments. We therefore emphasise the critical roles of observation and construction to sustain coordination in open systems. We present the methodological framework Vocs (Visions of open computational systems), exemplified in terms of a naval multi-agent system scenario (TWOSOME) and the tools explicitly developed and used in construction and observation of this system, SOLACE and DISCERN.

DT Article
ID POLITICS
AB This article identifies the development, effects and usefulness of UN global conferences on sustainable development, with a particular focus on the world summits in Stockholm (1972), Rio (1992) and Johannesburg (2002). It is argued that the global conference diplomacy has contributed to agenda setting and greater awareness, the integration of non-governmental actors in international environmental and development politics, and the adoption of new norms, principles and standards, as well as international and domestic capacity building. Based on the experiences from Johannesburg, negative effects of the conference diplomacy are also discussed, including renegotiations and backsliding, re-circulation of commitments, a fragmented agenda and lack of co-ordination, counterproductive issue-linkages, and inefficient use of time and resources. The lack of progress on several issues in Johannesburg may indicate that the conference diplomacy is more effective in the agenda-setting phase than in the implementation phase.

AB Home hygiene plays a significant role in well-being and health of consumers. It is linked with the nature and quality of household practices and of the household technical system. At the same time the impact of the level of home hygiene on well-being and human health is related to demographic parameters such as percentage of elderly and family organisation and composition. In this paper the impact of some demographic, social and technological changes on the level of home hygiene is discussed. In conjunction the interaction between housekeeping and the achievement of home hygiene is elaborated.
   If the level of home hygiene alters, a household will try to adjust their practices such that a desired level of hygiene is regained. For that correction process a household needs reliable information about the actual hygiene situation. It is discussed how the validity of the traditional hygiene indicators is fading away and how this may affect public health.
   Key conclusions:
   Demographic changes in the upcoming decades will lead to an increasing number of people with a greater propensity for infection.
   Changes in the micro-social system, housekeeping, will lead to a decrease in housekeeping hygiene and therefore to an increased exposure to micro-organisms.
   Innovative, sustainable technology in housekeeping will lead in some circumstances to a lower level of hygiene in housekeeping.
   The traditional hygiene-indicators in housekeeping lose their validity when housekeeping cannot anticipate the changes in the level of hygiene.

AB The natural environment has been a missing topic from education and public policy forums concerning an aging society. This study examines demographic trends and several socio-demographic influences on attitudes, concerns, and active support for environmental issues among older adults in a retirement "hot spot" in the New West. A sample of 394 older adults in southwestern Utah was obtained from questionnaires mailed to those randomly selected from a larger dataset, and through hand-distributed questionnaires at selected RV parks. We found a high degree of variability among respondents in regard to environmental attitudes and concerns. Despite a personal attitudinal desire to protect the environment, most older adults did not want to become involved in protective actions for the environment. We found that residency status and religious affiliation emerged as the strongest relationships with measures of attitudes and concerns, and willingness to support the environment. The most influential factors associated with willingness to take action in support of the environment were having higher levels of active/social concerns, and higher levels of awareness of environmental consequences. The New West is one of the fastest-growing areas for demographic aging, and the opinions and actions of older adults will play a significant role in the stewardship and sustainability of natural resources, particularly in retirement hot spots.

AB In today's economy, Chemical Engineering must respond to the changing needs of the chemical process industry in order to meet market demands. The evolution of chemical engineering is necessary to remain competitive in global trade. The ability of chemical engineering to cope with scientific and technological problems is addressed in this paper. Chemical Engineering is vital for sustainability: to satisfy both the market requirements for specific end-use properties of products and the social and environmental constraints of industrial-scale processes. A multidisciplinary, multiscale approach to chemical engineering is evolving due to breakthroughs in molecular modelling, scientific instrumentation and related signal processing and powerful computational tools. The future of chemical engineering can be summarized by four main objectives: (1) Increase productivity and selectivity through intensification of intelligent operations and a multiscale approach to process control; (2) Design novel equipment based on scientific principles and new production methods: process intensification; (3) Extend chemical engineering methodology to product design and product focussed processing using the 3P Engineering "molecular Processes-Product-Process" approach; (4) Implement multiscale application of computational chemical engineering modelling and simulation to real-life situations from the molecular scale to the production scale.

AB Often touted as a modern marvel, the increasingly rapid pace of technological innovation in our day might alternatively be interpreted as a sign of imminent crisis. The urgent need for attention to 'design' (to use the current term), however, remains. Sustainability, satisfying work, preservation of the rudiments of human community-even concern with a basic sense of meaning and engagement with the world-all present urgent calls for redesign, not just at the level of individual devices, but at the level of systems and interrelated and mutually dependent ensembles of technology. 'Other directed design' will then be in order. Profit and efficiency will not vanish, but they will need to serve rather than lead or dictate.

AB A key role of engineers in the transition to more sustainable activities is likely to remain that of seeking to achieve pollution prevention and energy efficiency in manufacturing/production activities. A fundamental concept that has proven useful in teaching pollution prevention is that of 'intrinsic' vs. 'extrinsic' wastes. The same concept may be amenable to promotion of energy efficiency.

AB Although the problem of hazardous waste has always been with us, relatively little is known about its effects on human health and the environment in many localities throughout the world. Nevertheless, as industrial economies and mass production systems emerge in the global periphery, hazardous waste has become an increasingly serious ecological, social, economic and political problem. As attempts to bury toxic waste have clear limitations,1 the need to educate the public, industry, and government is apparent. With the use of practical examples from African cities, this paper attempts to further awareness about the implications of hazardous waste in urban environments. We argue that adverse impacts of hazardous waste threaten to disrupt socioeconomic development strategies, and thus derail sustainable development initiatives.

AB This paper assesses CO2 mitigation strategies in Delhi and Mumbai against the dynamics of local pollutants. After testing against techno-economic feasibility, compressed natural gas (CNG) technology, four-stroke two-wheelers and battery-operated vehicles (BOV) were selected as candidate options for Mumbai and Delhi. Multiple constrained optimization for finding out the optimal mix of vehicles to meet the travel demand under the business-as-usual scenario for the period of 1998-2020 revealed the dominance of CNG vehicles. CO2 mitigation targets of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25% resulted in reduced stock of diesel and petrol vehicles, with the reduction spanning over different points of the above time period. In the case of Mumbai, battery-operated three-wheelers dominated the vehicular mix, with the share of CNG vehicles remaining at a standard level. CO2 reduction targets did not influence the CNG option significantly.
   CO2 mitigation influenced the dynamics of local pollutants considerably in both Delhi and Mumbai. In Delhi, TSP and SOx reduction levels against the CO2 mitigation target were found to be significant. In Mumbai, the percentage reduction in local pollution (TSP in particular) was higher than the target CO2 reduction. Local pollutants other than TSP and SOx showed an increasing trend against the CO2 mitigation strategies in Delhi. In the case of Mumbai, all nontarget pollutants showed a falling trend against the CO2 mitigation strategies, though insignificantly for pollutants other than TSP and SOx.

   mechanism; urban environmental evolution
AB This paper discusses how an evolutionary viewpoint can contribute to the understanding of the processes and mechanisms of urban environmental change. There are four major components in the urban environmental evolution concept: (a) cities can be viewed as complex systems that are subject to constant change, which constitutes a dynamic evolutionary process; (b) urban environmental profiles of cities are diverse, but there are certain commonalities in the longitudinal dynamics among different cities; (c) nevertheless, there is a strong non-linearity in the trajectories of the environmental evolution of cities, rather than there being a fixed common pattern; (d) the trajectory is shaped by a unique combination of endogenous and exogenous forces, reflecting both the outer pressures and the responses within the city. The evolutionary perspective has important policy implications by emphasizing the possibility for cities in developing countries to follow a more environmentally sound pathway to sustainable development.

AB Palestinians were given control over their own health services in late 1994. Since then they have been facing the challenge of reorganizing disordered health services into a cohesive, regulated and sustainable health care system.
   This paper focuses on the experience of organizing health care during political instability. It considers the ways that health care is currently provided and funded in the Palestinian Territories. The patterns of accessibility to health care services in terms of insurance coverage and provision (physical allocation) of services are discussed. Finally, the major health care policy changes in this transitional period are examined. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. The purpose of the present study was to perform an environmental assessment for the entire life cycle of a seafood product and to include fishery-specific types of environmental impact in inventory and assessment. Environmental data for a frozen block of cod fillets was collected and used for a Life Cycle Assessment, including the fishery-specific environmental aspects seafloor use and biological extraction of target, by-catch and discard species. The fishery takes place in the Baltic Sea where cod is mainly fished by benthic trawls and gillnets.
   Methods. The functional unit was a consumer package of frozen cod fillets (400 g) reaching the household. Data was gathered from fishermen, fishery statistics, databases, companies and literature. Fishery-specific issues like the impact on stocks of the target and by-catch species, seafloor impact and discarding were quantified in relation to the functional unit and qualitative impact assessment of these aspects was included.
   Results. Findings include the fact that all environmental impact categories assessed (Global Warming Potential, Eutrophication Potential, Acidification Potential, Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential and Aquatic Ecotoxiciy) are dominated by the fishery. Around 700 m(2) of seafloor are swept by trawls and around 50 g of under-sized cod and other marine species are discarded per functional unit. The phases contributing most to total environmental impact following fishery were transports and preparation in the household. The process industry and municipal sewage treatment cause considerable amounts of eutrophying emissions.
   Conclusions. Conclusions are that there are considerable options for improvement of the environmental performance of the seafood production chain. In the fishery, the most important environmental measure is to fish sustainably managed stocks. Speed optimisation, increased use of less energy-intensive fishing gear and improved engine and fuel technology are technical measures that would considerably decrease resource use and environmental impact caused by fishery. Due to the importance of fishery for the overall results, the most important environmental improvement option after landing is to maintain high quality and minimise product losses.
   Recommendations and Outlook. The need for good baseline data concerning resource use and marine environmental impact of fisheries in order to perform environmental assessment of seafood products was demonstrated. LCA was shown to be a valuable tool for such assessments, which in the future could be used to improve the environmental performance of the seafood production chain or in the development of criteria of eco-labelling of seafood products originating in capture fisheries.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. The object of the study is the Italian system of plastic packaging waste recycling, active until 2001, that collected and mechanically recycled the post-consumer PE and PET liquid containers. The phases of collection, compaction, sorting, reprocessing and refuse disposal were individually analysed and quantified in terms of energy and material consumptions as well as of emissions in the environment. The work is the result of a joint research project with the Italian Consortium for Packaging (CONAI), carried out in co-operation with the main Italian companies active in the field. The main aim was the quantification of the real advantage of plastic container recycling and the definition of criteria, at the same time environmentally compatible and economically sustainable, for their management.
   Main Features. For each of the unit processes, and in order to increase the data quality, all the data of interest were collected during technical visits to several selected plants active in Italy or deduced by official documents and certificate declarations of the same companies. To allow comparison of resource consumption and environmental pollution from different management scenarios producing different products, the basket of products method was applied.
   Results. The results indicates that the production of 1 kg of flakes of recycled PET requires a total amount of gross energy that is in the range of between 42 and 55 MJ, depending on whether the process wastes (mainly coming from sorting and reprocessing activities) were sent or not to the energy recovery. The same quantiry of virgin PET requires more than 77 MJ. The energetic (and then environmental) saving is so remarkable, even for PE, being 40-49 MJ for the recycled polymer and about 80 MJ that for the virgin polyolefin. The calculations were made with the reasonable assumption that the final utilisation can use the virgin or the recycled polymer without any difference.
   Conclusions and Outlook. The analysis defined and verified a suitable tool in the field, based on objective data, for comparing different coherent scenarios of waste management politics. This allows one to propose the extension of the tool under different collection schemes, as well as for different systems of packaging recycling. As an immediate consequence of the success of the present study, the joint-research programme with CONAI has been extended for another three years. The focus will be the Italian system for paper and paperboard recycling and that for all plastic packagings. In parallel, a different study has been scheduled with reference to the integrated solid waste management of the Regione Campania, the largest and most populated area in the South of Italy.

AB Sustainability-a term originating from silviculture, which was adopted by UNEP as the main political goal for the future development of humankind-is also the ultimate aim of product development. It comprises three components: environment, economy and social aspects which have to be properly assessed and balanced if a new product is to be designed or an existing one is to be improved. The responsibility of the researchers involved in the assessment is to provide appropriate and reliable instruments. For the environmental part there is already an internationally standardized tool: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Life Cycle Costing (LCC) is the logical counterpart of LCA for the economic assessment. LCC surpasses the purely economic cost calculation by taking into account hidden costs and potentially external costs over the life cycle of the product. It is a very important point that different life-cycle based methods (including Social Life Cycle Assessment) for sustainablity assessment use the same system boundaries.

TI Functional priorities in LCA and design for environment
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT

DE design for environment; functional product characterization; functional
   profile; functional unit; life cycle assessment; product development;
   product planning
AB Aim, Scope and Background. The interest in environmental questions has increased enormously during the last decade. Environmental protection has become an issue of strategic importance within the manufacturing industry and many companies are now working in the field of Design for Environment (DFE). The main purpose of DFE is to create products and services for achieving a sustainable society. Designers are widely believed to have a key role in adapting products to a sustainable society and one of the major instruments in the context of Design for Environment is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). However, product development creates particular challenges for incorporating environmental issues that combine functional and environmental assessment. A natural and important part of product design is to define and analyse the functions of the product. Consequently, the functional unit in LCA is a core issue in DFE. Most recent research in DFE has focused on how to reduce the environmental impact of products throughout their life-cycle by addressing environmental aspects, while little attention has been given to the functionality of the product. Additionally, early product development phases, so called re-think phases, are considered to have the influence on major changes in products in general. These phases have thus the highest potential for changing products and product systems towards a sustainable development.
   Main Features. This paper discusses an extended functional representation in design for environment methods to evaluate sustainable design solutions, especially in early (re-think) phases of product design. Based on engineering-design science and several case studies, a concept has been developed describing how functional preferences can be visualised in design for environment and product development. In addition, the functional unit in LCA is discussed. The concept is called Functional Profile (FP) and is additionally exemplified in a case study on radio equipment.
   Discussion. The new functional characterisation concept helps identify functional priorities in design for environment. The Functional Profile is a structured, systematic and creative concept for identifying the necessary functions of a new product. The FP is envisioned to complement existing design for environment methods, not to replace them. Instead of being a product-development tool or method, the concept is an approach that increases understanding of inter-reactions between functional characteristics of products and their environmental characteristics, which furthermore facilitates trade-off decisions. One of the objectives behind the concept is to highlight the importance of balancing functional requirements and environmental impacts, presenting both the advantages and disadvantages of the product.
   Outlook. A second paper will be produced to complement the functional-environmental characterisation concept in early product development phase, presenting the environmental characterisation part and illustrating correlations between the functional and environmental sides.

   impacts and economic aspects in a life cycle thinking perspective

   (TCA)
AB Aim and Background. Many analytical tools have been developed to support the implementation of sustainable development. Principal among these are the ones that are based on physical aspects such as life cycle assessment (LCA), while others focus on non-physical aspects, namely on monetary concepts, such as life cycle costing and total cost assessment. Each kind of tool is designed to assess a specific aspect (environmental or economic) of the entire life of a good or a service. Unfortunately, even if the literature clearly states the advantage of combining these tools, case studies with global conclusions considering both aspects are still rare. Most often, studies conclude separately on each aspect; environmental impact and cost assessment.
   Definitions. The already published concept of Return on Environment (ROE), inspired from return on investment, is a first step in the right direction for combining these tools and hence, achieving better alternative comparisons. Considering some limitations as to the ease with which it compares two or more similar goods, two new indexes are suggested here. The first one, called the Environmental Return (ER), focuses only on environmental aspects. It allows the comparison on an environmental basis of several goods or services fulfilling the same function. The second definition, called the Econo-Environmental Return (EER), is an index created by the combination of the environmental impact assessment results (such as an LCIA) and those from an economic assessment (such as an LCC or a TCA). From a simple decision rule, a decision-maker can compare several goods on both environmental and economic aspects.
   Discussion and Conclusion. A simplified case study is used to present a numerical application of these two definitions and to interpret their different results and conclusions. Two different types of broadloom carpet, PET (recycled polyester) and nylon, are compared. When they are only compared on an LCIA basis, the PET carpet is preferred over the nylon one, while the opposite is true when they are compared on both economic aspect and environmental impact bases. The major advantage of the Econo-Environmental Return is that two goods can be compared without requiring a specific industrial sector reference value.

DT Article
DE alternatives in LCA; goal definition; guidelines; social support;
   stakeholder participation; sustainability; factor 20; toolbox
AB Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) frequently do not contribute to sustainable development because product alternatives with a truly low environmental burden are not included in the assessment. As a result, environmentally-friendly alternatives are not uncovered, although much effort has been put into collecting inventory data and making an impact assessment. Part of this problem is caused by the defensive use of LCAs. Companies eager to show that their product is not too bad for the environment prefer to compare their product with alternatives that are not very promising in an environmental sense. To (mis)use LCAs in this way is quite easy, because the LCA methodology and handbooks provide few guidelines and little advice on how to generate and select adequate alternatives. An analysis of the problems related to the alternatives is given using insights drawn from the field of policy analysis - a field in which methodological rules for the generation of alternatives in policy studies have been developed - ecodesign and the LCA discipline, and measures to reduce the problems are developed. Explicating the different steps in the determination of alternatives in the goal and scope formulation stage of an LCA process, and the development of a toolbox for this activity, would certainly improve the quality of the selection of alternatives. Furthermore, involving stakeholders and a group of experts in the generation and selection process will increase the variety and relevance of alternatives, and the social support for alternatives.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. In this article, the Life Cycle Impact Assessment of the average passenger vehicle of the Netherlands is performed, with emphasis on the current dismantling and recycling practice in this country. From calculations on recovery rates of the several material streams from ELV (End-of-Live Vehicle) recycling, it seems that attaining the European ELV legislation recycling targets (Directive 2000/53/EC 2000) is very difficult, even for countries with advanced collection and recycling infrastructures such as the Netherlands. An LCA of the current average passenger vehicle of the Netherlands, including a detailed modelling of the recovery and recycling should form a sound basis for comparison with alternative automotive life cycle designs and legislation efforts.
   Model and System Definition. An average passenger vehicle is defined, having average weight and material composition. A cradle to grave approach is taken, including all relevant upstream processes for the production of materials and fuels, and the return of the recycled materials to the material cycles in the EOL (End-of-Life) phase. A particularity of this model is the detailed description of the Dutch collection and recycling infrastructure, with current data for the shredding, separation and metallurgical recycling processes (ARN 2000, Barkhof 1998, Chapman 1983, Pilchert et al. 1994, Worrel et al. 1992).
   Results and Discussion. According to the Eco-indicator 99 (EI99) (Ministerie van V.R.O.M 1999), the largest environmental impact of the passenger vehicle's life cycle occurs in the use phase over 90% -, due to the combustion and depletion of fossil fuels. This is in agreement of previous studies (Kasai 2000, Kanesaki 2000). Also in the other life cycle phases, the use of fossil fuels is the dominant impact, even for the production phase. Resource depletion due to the use of the materials employed in the vehicle causes a comparatively lower environmental impact, namely due to the high recovery rate and efficiency of the metallurgical recycling, that balances for about 30% the total impacts of the materials production and use. NOx emission was one of the smallest emissions to air in quantity, but was responsible for 36% of the impact of the life cycle, while CO2 was the largest emission to air but caused only 6% of the environmental impact.
   Conclusion and Recommendation. Although there is a growing awareness and concern on increasing the recyclability of vehicles, the use phase still has the largest environmental impact of the vehicle's life cycle. A life cycle assessment can be a Sound basis to evaluate and compare design alternatives to increase the sustainabiliry of passenger vehicles. The ASR (Automotive shredder residue) is currently the greatest concern with regard to the recovery targets. It is a large amount of materials (about 32 wt.%), difficult and costly to recycle, and thermal recovery is limited to a maximum of lSwt.% in 1015 by the European ELV legislation. joint efforts from the automotive industry and legislative institutions are required to find a sensible solution. LCA can be a useful tool to support legislative decisions, as purely weight-based recovery definitions are not adequate to evaluate the sustainability of the automobile life cycle.

AB The aim of this paper is to explore the reasons why businesses, hating adopted total quality management (TQM), fail to sustain their reforms over time. In order to gain insights into the pressures that, despite good intentions, can make full implementation of TQM problematic, a case study approach is used The research indicates that a lack of attention to the human element of change, especially inconsistent senior management support, a lack of involvement of supervisors and middle managers in planning for change, and lack of attention to groups of staff affected negatively by the changes, explain why businesses may face difficulty sustaining reform programs.

   Initiative
AB Exercising the right to a sustainable and healthy environment requires the ability to participate in government and business decisions that affect the environment. A global coalition of public interest groups and research organizations measured the public's ability to participate in such decisions in nine countries representing a range of income levels and development paths. The investigation assessed the three elements of public participation as defined at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992: access to information, access to the decision-making process, and access to redress. The results show that, despite considerable progress in these areas, serious gaps remain in the public's ability to participate in important environmental decisions. These gaps occur in both developed and developing nations, and reflect limited articulation of participation rights in national law and institutional practice. The results also suggest that the public is often unfamiliar with and unaccustomed to exercising the rights they already have.

AB To counter the lack of corporate accountability of the agrochemical industry for the damage caused by its perpetuation of the use of harmful chemical pesticides, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund staff in June 2002 brought together concerned scientists, lawyers, socially responsible investment professionals, and sustainable agriculture advocates at their Pocantico Conference Center. The group's objective was to communicate to market analysts the long-term downside risks of investments in pesticides, in the hope that dissemination of this information would contribute to increasing corporate accountability and safeguarding public and environmental health.

Published methods for identifying and assessing resources are reviewed and, based on current theory, improvements are developed, tested and critiqued A historical representation of the firm's activities in its service prom. si. on over more than ten years is used to enable grounded identification of the resources involved Sets of theory based questions are used to assess the value and sustainability of the resources identified The plans and actions that appeared to relate to the intervention are then described over the following two years. Finally the methods are discussed from three perspectives - first, their appropriateness; second, the resource data they generated, and third, their apparent utility for managers.

AB Outlines and describes the results of research at Cardiff Business School into the sustainability of process improvement involving shop floor personnel. The study identified a number of factors that influence the success or inhibit progress in terms of performance and sustainable improvement. The findings identify what companies perceive to be inhibitors and enablers for sustainability, within 21 companies who have conducted process improvement (PI) activities using a common intervention approach The paper presents five classificatory profiles and concludes that managers can easily identify specific inhibitors in their own companies, but find it difficult to formulate specific enablers associated with successful and sustainable improvement The general and cultural nature of the identified enablers indicates that managers perceive progressing PI activities are reliant on a change of culture within their organisations in parallel with "up-skilling" the technical knowledge of employees for change to be successfully, enacted The lack of specific processes to change culture, identified in the enablers, also indicates that managers do not know what to do to change their cultures or how best to deal with the inherently challenging and demanding nature of process improvement with shop floor operators.

DE organizational change; operations management; manufacturing industry
AB Organisational change, as a general topic, has been extensively researched since the 1950s, as evidenced by the proliferation of papers in the last five decades. As a research topic within operations management, it offers fascinating insights into the way manufacturing organisations function and adapt in reality. This paper evaluates what has worked, and what has not been effective, within a UK-based manufacturing company, tracking, multiple change initiatives over several years across two company sites. The core research focused on the implementation of change initiatives based on common constructs, such as planned change, as defined by management writers and consultants. From the research it emerged that a realistic interpretation of the change process had to take into account multiple and varied forces, such as: customers and suppliers; the economic environment; national and international Legislation, the history of the organisation; etc. The research underpinning this paper enabled an identification of the specific influences on changes in the organisation and the way these interacted over time. A model of organisational change, developed from the research, is presented The contribution of this paper lies mainly in deepening operations managers' understanding of organisational change. It also uncovers the underlying rationales that steer change initiatives (planned or emergent) and identifies the key influences on organisational change. It provides and renews the necessary vocabulary, allowing managers to understand better and act on the multiple dimensions of organisational change. Furthermore, the provision of key learning points through a number of management "guidelines", provides specific advice on how to effect sustainable change within organisations.

ID COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
AB The resource-based view of the firm has recently emerged as a new paradigm in strategic analysis. According to this view, firms are heterogeneous collections of resources that lead them to distinct market performance. This paper uses this approach not to analyse an individual firm but a cluster of firms, whose competitiveness depends not only on their individual resources and capabilities but also on those shared by the cluster as a whole. The analysis was developed for a wine cluster located in southern Brazil. The main objective was the identification of the resources and capabilities shared by the cluster in its effort to formulate sustainable competitive strategies. The research method employed combined the techniques of cognitive mapping analysis with the theoretical basis of the resource-based view approach. The results of the study produced a significant improvement in managers' and strategists' perceptions about the competitive potential of the cluster.

DE continuous improvement; quality; Japan
ID MANAGEMENT; EMPLOYMENT; MODEL
AB This paper reports the study of kaizen as practised in a selection of Japanese companies. After discussing the general understanding of kaizen and proposing a clear definition, the paper describes the methodology of the study, and presents findings from the research, taking Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) as a base model and comparing this with the data from other companies. The development of kaizen activity in NSC is presented together with a description of the current nature of kaizen, which is compared with other firms in the steel and automotive industries to assess uniformity. The paper concludes that kaizen evolves uniquely within each organisation, following changes to the organisation's business environment. Detailed implementations vary considerably between organisations, but all rely on kaizen to achieve targets as an integral element in the operations management system. This yields insights into kaizen's sustainability, and points to its vulnerability to external economic conditions.

ID QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT; REQUIREMENTS; TARGETS; MODELS
AB Great efforts have recently resulted in increasing the environmental performance of industrial products. However, to obtain more sustainable solutions, environmental properties must meet customer requirements. This paper introduces a novel approach for identifying environmental improvement options by taking into account customer preferences. The Life Cycle Assessment methodology is applied to evaluate the environmental pro le of a product, using eco-Indicator99 as the impact assessment method. A fuzzy approach based on the House of Quality in the Quality Function Deployment methodology provides a more quantitative method for evaluating the imprecision of the customer preferences. Experimental membership functions have been obtained directly from users and design team members through an opinion poll. The proposed methodology has been applied to identify environmental improvement options by taking into account customer opinions of an office table and identifying three product components where the environmental performance of the table could be improved.

AB Great advancements have been made in air source heat pumps (ASHP) due to concerns for water and consciousness of sustainable development; however there is still a serious shortcoming that limits their widespread applications, especially in sub-zero regions. This article proposes a new sub-cooling system employing a scroll compressor with a supplementary inlet which can effectively solve these problems. The prototype ASHP was validated and ran a whole winter in Beijing, China. The relevant dynamic-performance functions were tested and the outcomes show that this new kind of ASHP can work very well under ambient temperatures as low as -15 degreesC. In addition, the efficiency of the improved ASHP under all circumstances was addressed and great energy can be saved through the improved system's increased efficiency. In this way the applications of ASHP were enlarged and a simple and feasible alternative heating service was developed for heating in north China which can also partly solve the severer and severer atmosphere pollution problems in these regions.

AB What margins of maneuverability do urban-based progressive movements have for affecting policy outcomes in entrepreneurial and neoliberal political systems? This article provides a partial answer to this question by examining how relations developed and stabilized between actors in the different sectors (community based organizations, labor, university) of Los Angeles' progressive community. Such relations are a necessary but not sufficient condition for affecting policy outcomes. I argue that these relations have resulted from a 20-year process of interactions between the more innovative agents of each of the sectors. Through their repeated experimentation in building frameworks to coordinate their partnerships, I argue that a variety of complex mechanisms have taken shape that nourish relations and coordinate complex forms of collective action. Functioning as 'relational platforms', these coordinating mechanisms have combined to form an emergent 'organizational infrastructure' that facilitates both ongoing relational processes and the mobilization of collective resources in politically effective ways. Thus, by examining the organizational infrastructure that makes such a broad based 'movement' possible and sustainable, the article offers the reader one insight into how urban progressives have been able to build the power necessary to affect policies in one of the world's most entrepreneurial and neoliberal cities.

AB Considerable research has been undertaken over the past two decades to apply remote sensing to the study of fire regimes across the savannas of northern Australia. This work has focused on two spatial scales of imagery resolution: coarse-resolution NOAA-AVHRR imagery for savanna-wide assessments both of the daily distribution of fires ('hot spots'), and cumulative mapping of burnt areas('fire-scars') over the annual cycle; and fine-resolution Landsat imagery for undertaking detailed assessments of regional fire regimes. Importantly, substantial effort has been given to the validation of fire mapping products at both scales of resolution. At the savanna-wide scale, fire mapping activities have established that: ( 1) contrary to recent perception, from a national perspective the great majority of burning in any one year typically occurs in the tropical savannas; ( 2) the distribution of burning across the savannas is very uneven, occurring mostly in sparsely settled, higher rainfall, northern coastal and subcoastal regions (north-west Kimberley, Top End of the Northern Territory, around the Gulf of Carpentaria) across a variety of major land uses ( pastoral, conservation, indigenous); whereas ( 3) limited burning is undertaken in regions with productive soils supporting more intensive pastoral management, particularly in Queensland; and ( 4) on a seasonal basis, most burning occurs in the latter half of the dry season, typically as uncontrolled wildfire. Decadal fine-resolution fire histories have also been assembled from multi-scene Landsat imagery for a number of fire-prone large properties (e.g. Kakadu and Nitmiluk National Parks) and local regions ( e. g. Sturt Plateau and Victoria River District, Northern Territory). These studies have facilitated more refined description of various fire regime parameters ( fire extent, seasonality, frequency, interval, patchiness) and, as dealt with elsewhere in this special issue, associated ecological assessments. This paper focuses firstly on the patterning of contemporary fire regimes across the savanna landscapes of northern Australia, and then addresses the implications of these data for our understanding of changes in fire regime since Aboriginal occupancy, and implications of contemporary patterns on biodiversity and emerging greenhouse issues.

AB Consolidated during the Cold War and reasserted during the 1997-8 crisis, us "primacy" in East Asia is the predominant interpretation associated with the "Making of the East Asian Miracle." A closer look at the 1950 and 1997 periods yields a different conclusion, supportive of the pluralistic interpretation of "dynamic equilibrium." At the outset of the Cold War, the us sought to restore the triangular pattern of international trade and finance between North America, Western Europe and Southeast Asia/Japan, necessitating a re-forging of links between Europe and Southeast Asia. What happened to this project? In the recent East Asian economic crisis, the Eu-Europeans contributed more to the rescue packages than did the us. This study posits Europe as the third actor in the evolution of a sustainable "capitalist" economy at the international and regional levels. Rejecting a hegemonic economic interpretation for any of the actors, this analysis portrays an emergent commercial and trade linkage among Europe, Asia, and North America that is balanced and never more vital.

TI Conserving groundwater for irrigation in the North China Plain
SO IRRIGATION SCIENCE

ID WHEAT; MANAGEMENT
AB Winter wheat and summer maize are the staple crops in the piedmont of Mt. Taihang in the North China Plain. High levels of production depend largely on the use of irrigation. However, irrigation is causing a rapid decline of the groundwater table. To assure sustainable agricultural development in this densely populated region, improvement is needed in farmland water-use efficiency (WUE) to reduce the overall application of irrigation water. This paper investigated two ways to improve WUE, which could be easily implemented by local farmers. One way was to regulate the irrigation scheduling of winter wheat. The other was to utilize straw mulching with winter wheat and maize to reduce soil evaporation. Field experimental results, carried out at Luancheng Station from 1997 to 2000, showed that the common practice of irrigating winter wheat four times each season did not produce as high a yield as three irrigations in a dry year, or one irrigation in a wet year. The latter produced the highest grain production and highest relative WUE. Measurements of evapotranspiration and soil evaporation using a large-scale weighing lysimeter and microlysimeters showed that about 30% of the total evapotranspiration was from soil evaporation. Straw mulching reduced soil evaporation by 40 mm for winter wheat and 43 mm for maize in the 1998/1999 seasons. WUE was improved by over 10%. The combination of these two measures could reduce irrigation applications in the region.

DE Chinese milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L.)
ID RICE; INPUT
AB Narrowleaf vetch (Vicia angustifolia L.) (NLV) is a legume widely distributed in the Eurasian continent. Although commonly growing as a weed in cultivated areas, NLV could become a suitable species for cultivation as a green manure crop to increase the nitrogen content of soil. We examined NLV and a common green manure crop, Chinese milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L.) (CMV), both in monocultures and in mixed cropping of the 2 species. The nitrogen-fixing activity and root nodule activity of the species were determined and the effects on the nitrogen (N) supply to soil were evaluated. CMV produced more plant N than NLV, largely as a response to better growth after the over-wintering period. The amount of atmospheric N fixed by NLV (4.3 g m(-2)) was only half of that fixed. by CMV (8.6 g m(-2)). Nevertheless, the amount of N in NLV (up to 14 g m(-2)) was sufficient to supply the demand of the following crop. The mixed culture of CMV and NLV performed better than the monoculture. Since developing countries cannot afford to invest money on nitrogenous fertilizers or legume seeds, the use of the widely distributed NLV as a green manure might be effective and contribute to the sustainability of cropping systems.

AB In Part 1 of this paper, we presented a phased approach to the development of a Mars pole human-inhabited research station modelled on those in the terrestrial polar regions. To support this phased growth, a number of critical technology issues need to be addressed. In this Part 2 we review some of the important technologies for the establishment of a human presence at the poles. Transport, both robotic and manned will be required to provide range of exploration on Mars. Much of the critical technology revolves around the robust provision of significant amounts of power to support both robotic and human activities. Nuclear sources of power are highlighted as the only viable option for providing the power levels required for station infrastructure. Independent materials provision through in-situ resource utilisation is examined, especially the extraction of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the polar ice and subsurface in the circumpolar erg. Drilling technologies relevant to this objective are reviewed. Finally, the issue of the provision of materials for life support systems is discussed. Generally, the technological requirements are based on the provision of energy and materials to support a human-inhabited infrastructure near the poles - this imposes significant requirements for the sustainable growth of Mars pole exploration stations.

SO JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION

DE Cattle; enterprise development; grazing; livestock; scenarios
AB Historically, semi-natural pastures were important for Sweden's food supply but this importance, and the area grazed, decreased strongly during the 20th century. Remaining areas are of major importance for nature conservancy today on account of their high biodiversity and cultural values. Consequently, a national goal is to ensure that those areas still grazed are also grazed in the future and that grazing is expanded to include particularly important seminatural pastures where grazing has ceased. The aim of this paper is to consider scenarios under which economically sustainable grazing of species-rich semi-natural pastures can be achieved. These scenarios are informed both by agricultural statistics describing trends in livestock availability in Sweden and by interviews with a sample of farmers who manage valuable pastures. The statistics show a rapid decrease in number of herds and a slightly reduced number of grazing animals. Three scenarios are considered: 1, continued grazing on existing farms with the farmer's own animals; 2, nature conservancy entrepreneurs who move grazing animals around on otherwise ungrazed pastures, and 3, creating large areas of pasture-forest mosaics from existing and previously abandoned pastures and marginal arable land, thereby enabling a combination of nature conservancy and cost-efficient meat production. The interviews reveal that it would be unrealistic to expect scenario 1 alone to fulfil the conservation goal, especially in forest-dominated regions characterised by a high proportion of elderly farmers with small herds. Development of new enterprises, according to scenarios 2 and 3, is therefore an essential complement to the present EU environmental allowances if the cost of preserving grazing-dependent biodiversity is not to increase massively in the future.

AB The notion that the idea of nature is not quite the unbiased rule to design sustainable futures is obvious. But, nevertheless, questions about nature, how it functions and what it might aim at, is leading the controversial debates about both sustainability and biotechnology. These two research areas hardly have the same theory background. Whereas in the first concept, the idea of eternal cyclical processes is basic, the latter focuses on optimization. However, both concepts can work together, but only under a narrow range of public acceptance in Europe. The plausibility of arguments for using biotechnology within sustainable technologies varies according to the assumed part nature itself plays for reaching optimized states. The culture related vision of nature's functions has impact on agricultural biotechnology, dealing not only with food crops but also with non-food plants like renewable resources that are used for energy or fiber production. These plants are grown to reach sustainable development. However, there is a fundamental difference between regarding biofuels as "renewable" and "regenerative," due to the tension between the concepts of "the natural" and "the sustainable." Arguments of optimization, efficiency, and efficacy are critically discussed in order to take the present need for sustainable technologies for serious.

ID BIOTECHNOLOGY; FOODS
AB In spite of stricter provisions in the new EU directive on deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), critics still advocate a moratorium on permits for cultivation of GMOs. However, in an attempt to meet concerns raised by the public, the directive explicitly gives Member States the possibility to take into consideration ethical aspects of GMOs in the decision-making. This article investigates the potential effects of such formulation by means of an empirical analysis of experiences gained the last years from similar Swedish regulations for GMOs, aiming at promoting sustainable development. The faulty implementation shown in the Swedish case indicates that legal stipulations for ethics as such have limited importance. It is suggested that public participation is an important factor for successful implementation of the ethics of sustainable development.

TI Environmental implications of the erosion of cultural taboo practices in

   trees, and water resource preservation
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS

AB Cultural taboos and their sanctions have helped to check abuse of the environment at least among the local people. The disregard for these traditional checks and balances especially among Christians has adversely affected their enforcement at this time. The environment and culture preservation in Awka-South were investigated. The faithful observance of the traditional laws in the study area was attributed to the fact that Awka-South area had remained occupied by the same people for centuries. The study showed that the preserved forests and their shrines in Nibo town have largely remained intact. In Nise town, however, with nine shrines still in existence, the rules have relaxed a little, mainly because they embraced modernization. In this town, the fringes of the forests may be used for farming but no felling of trees would be allowed. The "god" of the shrine in Obunagu village was much revered until the advent of Christianity. This religion has had an eroding effect on the taboos, which were put in place to protect their forests and streams. The abandonment of traditional cultural practices is doing harm that goes beyond the abrogation of traditional cultural practices to serious threat to natural environmental structures. The cultures of the different tribes in Nigeria need to be revisited for evaluation and studies to enable their integration into modern practices that will make the environment more sustainable. This will be more productive than the unilateral introduction of programs, execution, and maintenance methods that are completely new, or in many cases run contrary to the cultural practices of the local people and tribes of Nigeria.

AB Based on its production guideline, organic agriculture has set for itself the goals of minimizing all forms of pollution and maintaining sustainability of the farming system. By striving for these goals, organic farming meets the demands of an increasing number of consumers who are critical of conventional production methods. This paper gives an overview of the present state of the art in the different issues. Possibilities of and limitations in performing the self-aimed goals under the basic standards of organic agriculture are discussed. Concerning environmental protection, in general, the risk of adverse environmental effects is lower with organic than with conventional farming methods, though not necessarily so; with reference to soil fertility and nutrient management, organic farming is suited to improve soil fertility and nutrient management markedly on the farm level; regarding biodiversity, comparison studies show that organic farming has more positive effects on biodiversity conservation; in relation to product quality, under the basic standards of organic farming, there is no sufficient evidence for a system-related effect on product quality due to the production method.

AB The main purpose of The Norwegian Gene Technology Act (1993) is to enforce containment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and control of GMO releases. Furthermore, the Act intends to ensure that "production and use of GMOs should take place in an ethically and socially justifiable way, in accordance with the principle of sustainable development and without detrimental effects to health and the environment." Hence it is obvious that, for the Norwegian authorities, sustainable development is a normative guideline when evaluating acceptable consequences of GMO use and production. In accordance with this, we have investigated the extent to which the sustainability criteria were decisive for the destiny of one approved and one declined application of genetically modified plant release. The present understanding of the ecological, socioeconomical, and cultural consequences of GMO use and release is fragmentary and uncertain. We consider the Precautionary Principle and the notion of equitable distribution as key issues within the sustainable development framework, hence constituting important foundations for our analyses. The Act is legitimizing sustainability criteria, but does not seem to secure their conversion into concrete action. We envisage a more conscious implementation of the Norwegian Gene Technology Act. Sustainability concerns ecological, economical, and social values, and these can only be ensured through long-term thinking, initiation of independent risk-associated research, and broad involvement of all stakeholders in the evaluation of GMO issues and concerns.

AB This paper is the report of a meeting that gathered many of the UK's most senior animal scientists with representatives of the farming industry, consumer groups, animal welfare groups, and environmentalists. There was strong consensus that the current economic structure of agriculture cannot adequately address major issues of concern to society: farm incomes, food security and safety, the needs of developing countries, animal welfare, and the environment. This economic structure is based primarily on competition between producers and between retailers, driving food prices down, combined with externalization of many costs. These issues must be addressed by a combination of legislation, restructuring of the market, and use of public funds. The meeting included workshops that made other recommendations for research and education. The most urgent requirement is recognition that change is needed and development of a vision for what that change must achieve.

TI Ethical opportunities in global agriculture, fisheries, and forestry:
   The role for FAO
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB FAO has a unique and essential role in addressing the ethical problems facing humanity and in making these problems into opportunities for practical resolution. A broad range of ethical issues in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry were identified by analysis of the literature and by interviews with FAO staff. Issues include sharing access to and preserving natural resources, introduction of new technology, conservatism over the use of genetic engineering, ethics in animal agriculture, access to information, food security, sustainable rural development, ensuring participation of all people in decision making and in receiving benefits of agriculture, reducing corruption, and involvement of private and public sectors in decision making. Rather than viewing these issues as problems, they should be viewed as opportunities for debate, learning about others' views, and resolution. The United Nations has an important role to play in how decisions are made in the global ethical debate in food and agriculture. The ethical role of FAO is to promote global food security, balanced conservation, management and utilization of natural resources, and sustainable rural development. FAO should fully and publicly assume its ethical responsibilities, gathering and sharing information on ethics in its areas of mandate, acting as an interactive forum, and providing expert guidance on policy options and choices based on practical ethical analysis.

   problems? The case of unauthorized appropriation of genetic resources
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS

DT Article
DE benefit-sharing; biopiracy; genetic resources; intellectual property
   rights; traditional knowledge; TRIPS agreement
AB Unauthorized appropriation of genetic resources has been described by the term "biopiracy." Technological breakthroughs including biotechnological applications can increase considerably the instrumental value of biodiversity as new products or products with new properties can be made. Nevertheless, it appears that, in most cases, the properties in question were already known to the indigenous people and used for centuries. The analysis discusses both from an economic and an ethical perspective whether it is just that traditional knowledge is rewarded. As the conflict intensifies over questions of ownership and control of biological materials, Intellectual Property Rights are at the center of controversies. The current global system governing biotechnology has largely been shaped by Western expectations and valuations and consequently has drawn severe criticism. The critics doubt both the stability and sustainability of the current patent system and argue for restructuring through benefit-sharing systems in order to address some of the existing inequalities. With the help of a case study (US patent no. 5,751 on ayahuasca) the theoretical notion of biopiracy is applied to real problems.

AB For a typical smallholder agricultural area in northeast-Thailand this paper describes the land- use changes, their main driving forces and their- consequences over the last forty years - from the conversion of the original forest to the present agricultural land use.
   The area has a relatively short agricultural history. - From the 1960s onward, people started to settle in the area and began to clear-cut the forest to grow subsistence crops, such as upland rice and castor beans. After a relatively short period dominated by subsistence crops, the land use rapidly developed into - maize-based cash-crop systems. Maize is still the main crop. Since the beginning of agriculture in the area, the farmers practiced continuous cropping. Shifting cultivation was never practiced. Initially, the soil was not tilled, and dibbling of seeds was exclusively practiced. All soil and crop husbandry practices were carried out manually. Due to the influx of more people, the agricultural land area expanded rapidly. Most of the land remains government property. Only recently, limited land-use rights for the farmers are being issued. With the change of the land-use systems over time, i.e., from upland rice to maize, and from subsistence to more market-oriented farming, the agronomic practices also changed adapting to the requirements of the new crops. The application of inorganic fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides became standard practice. The use of these inputs led to a significant increase in land productivity. However, most farmers do not have sufficient capital to purchase all required inputs fore cultivation and they largely depend on private money lenders and middlemen for input supply at extremely high interest rates.
   There is a general perception amongst farmers of a considerable soil-fertility decline and that more and more fertilizer needs to be applied to maintain the current yield levels. To realize more sustainable agriculture, land-use technologies need to be adopted at the farm level that increase the efficiency of nutrient and organic matter cycling and reduce soil-degradation risks. Simultaneously, an enabling environment needs to be developed based on appropriate extension services and adequate credit facilities for the farmers.

DE on-farm water management; problems of on-farm water management;
   challenges of modern on-farm water management
AB Most on-farm water management (OFWM) problems are not new. They have been a threat to agriculture in many countries around the globe in the last few decades. However, these problems have now grown larger and there is increasing public demand for the development and management of land and water to be ecologically sustainable as well as economic. As there is a close interrelationship between land use and water resources, farmers need to be aware of this interrelationship and adjust their OFWM efforts in order to address the issues. In their management efforts, they need to consider both the on-site and the off-site effects.
   This paper highlights holistic approaches in water management as being indispensable in the future. Present and future water-utilisation problems can only be solved on the basis of an intersectoral participatory approach to water management conducted at the level of the respective catchment area. In the context of this approach, farmers need to realise that they are part of an integral whole.
   The paper also lists a range of present and future challenges facing farmers, extensionists, researchers, etc. in relation to OFWM efforts. Among the challenges are: the effects of the increasing competition for freshwater resources; the increasing influence of non-agricultural factors on farmers' land use decisions; the fragmentation of the labour process and its effects on farming skills; the information requirements of farmers; the participatory dissemination of information on OFWM; the process of changing permanently the agrarian structure; and the establishment of criteria of good and bad OFWM.

DE resource management; poverty; gender; Ethiopia
AB High population pressure and land degradation are threats of food security in the highlands of Ethiopia. Poverty and food insecurity are closely related phenomena. Both of them compel poor farmers to practice unwise use and resource management, which lead to low resource productivity. This study examines the various factors determining poverty and resource management at a household level with gender perspective in Libokemekem district of Ethiopia. Farm level diversification of crops and mitigating food insecurity is highly constrained due to lack of farm resources principally limited land size. Consequently, households with large family-sizes and limited resources are vulnerable to food insecurity. Although households practice various coping mechanisms and alternative resource management strategies, they are not sufficient to curb household food security. The magnitude however, varies between female and male-headed households. Socioeconomic factors such as age, soil type, farm size, sex of household heads, area under rice production, number of oxen, and slope of the land are among the major factors to influence and discriminate between female and male-headed households. This study concludes by highlighting and indicating possible direction for policy intervention in view of enhancing food security and sustainable resource management.

DE war-affected communities; Sri Lanka; rural livelihoods; risk management
AB Rural societies in war-affected areas can be described as 'distressed livelihoods': they experience a dramatic increase in risk and uncertainty. How does this affect land use and agricultural coping strategies of small-scale farm households? This was the key research question of a multi-disciplinary, comparative village study carried out in the war-torn areas of Sri Lanka. The study employed the analytical framework of rural livelihoods promoted by DFID. In addition, theoretical models of risk management were instrumental in illustrating behavioural patterns of households in the war zones. The study shows that changed patterns of mobility are a key response of people to adjust to the risk-prone environment. These strategies place heavy demands on the extended family network. Furthermore, access to and priority claims for resources are critical in determining differences in livelihood strategies in different communities. Limited accessibility to natural resources due to war restricts the freedom of livelihood options. Many adapting strategies of farm households thus reflect the declining entitlements to resources due to war and violence. Households gradually deplete their capital stock after each political crisis. Investment in sustainable land management is not rational for farm households that are uncertain about future developments affecting the fundamentals of their lives. Households therefore employ risk minimisation strategies to downsize possible losses and focus on cash earning (especially from overseas employment) and/or state welfare for survival.

ID EMPTY CORE; MARKETS; ANTITRUST; ECONOMIES; INDUSTRY
AB The major air transport markets at the early part of the 21st century are failing to generate sufficient revenues to cover their long-run costs. Many airline are being supported by subsidies, going out of business (e.g. Sabena, Ansett, Canadian International, Swissair) or having to resort to various forms of financial restructuring such as afforded by Chapter I I bankruptcy laws in the US (US Airways, Midway, National). The effects of the terrorist attacks of September 2001 have exacerbated this situation, but the data suggests the problem be more deep routed in the 'deregulated' markets that now exist in many parts of the world. This paper concerns itself with the issue of whether there are intrinsic features of the scheduled network airline industry that makes the current structure of liberalized markets unsustainable. It highlights on a number of features of this market but pays particular attention to the question of whether the market is naturally prone to excesses in competition that, because of its nature, forces airline fares down to the level where full costs cannot be recovered. It focuses in this sense on a long established concept in economics, namely does a core exist in this market. The fact that there is prima face evidence to suggest that the core is empty then leads to a discussion of appropriate policy reactions that may allow a more sustainable market structure to survive.

AB Field studies were conducted during low (1995:266.5 mm) and high (1996: 424 mm) rainfall years to evaluate the performance of early and late genotypes of moth bean (Vigna aconitifolia (Jacq.) Marechal) in a genocropping system (i.e. planting early and late genotypes together). Early (RMO-40) and late (Maru moth) flowering genotypes were planted as sole or mixed crops either within alternate or paired rows or mixture (1:1 by weight) of each genotype providing 100% or 50% plants of each variety in a plot. The crop performance, water use and water use efficiency were better during high as compared to low rainfall year due to more favourable soil moisture conditions. Furthermore, seed yield of early genotype when grown as sole crop was higher as compared to late genotype in the low rainfall year, but under the high rainfall situation late genotype performed better. However, when grown as mixed crop as alternate rows the seed yield was 2.5% and 42.9% higher than sole crops of early and late genotypes, respectively, under low rainfall conditions of 1995. During 1996 also the mixed crop provided higher seed yield than sole genotype, notwithstanding favourable moisture conditions. The improved performance of mixed crop, particularly under the low rainfall situation, could be attributed to more efficient use of water, low initial canopy development and higher photosynthetic rates. It has been concluded that for yield stability of moth bean, planting of early and late genotypes in a 1:1 ratio as alternate rows is most appropriate under low as well as high rainfall conditions.

AB This paper is a contribution to the debate on the redefinition of needs and perspectives of university level education in the field of sustainable design. It discusses the role of design research in relation to the production of new educational forms, methods and tools for a new generation of designers (and designer educators) enabling them to more effectively confront the transition towards a sustainable society. The paper is based on two premises; Firstly: in today's climate there is a need for a general redefinition of education, as a result of the influence of new technological opportunities and changed socio-cultural conditions. Secondly: the design activity itself needs to be redefined in order to positively and effectively contribute to the radical change required by the transition towards a sustainable society. Industrial designer, educators and other design practitioners are all searching for ways to enhance their environmental capabilities and to produce sustainable designs. The academic discipline of design education in Italy (at the higher educational level) has responded by broadening its scope to produce more 'environmentally skilled' designers sensitive to issues of sustainable production and consumption. The Interdepartmental Research Centre in Innovation for Environmental Sustainability (CIR.IS) of the Politecnico di Milano University has developed an innovative and highly flexible response to these new design education needs. A set of interrelated projects-co-ordinated by the author-is outlined in the following paragraphs. These projects are funded by the Italian Environmental Protection Agency (ANPA). A university network (RAPI.RETE) has been established and a group of innovative and technologically advanced tools (ECO.CATHEDRA, ECO.OFFICINA, ECO.DISCO and DPS.MANUAL) are being developed to support teachers and students in the educational content and processes. The tools are now going to be distributed (free of charge) in Italian Universities and, both the ANPA and the CIR.IS have given their consent for their translation/adaptation into other languages (without charge).

   processing; clean technologies; processing centers
ID MERCURY POLLUTION; BRAZIL
AB Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) provides an important source of livelihood for rural communities throughout the world. These activities are frequently accompanied by extensive environmental degradation and deplorable socio-economic conditions, both during operations and well after mining activities have ceased. As gold is easily sold and not influenced by the instability of local governments, it is the main mineral extracted by artisanal miners. Mercury (Hg) amalgamation is the preferred gold recovery method employed by artisanal gold miners and its misuse can result in serious health hazards for miners involved in gold extraction, as well as for surrounding community inhabitants, who may be exposed to mercury via the food chain. The rudimentary techniques characteristic of ASM result in a number of occupational hazards, other although most risks are primarily attributed to machinery accidents and ground failure, such as landslides and shaft collapses.
   Several technologies and methods commonly utilized by large-scale mining operations can be downsized to smaller scale operations. However, the likelihood that miners will adopt these large-scale methods, or those developed specifically for ASM, depends upon some key factors. For an artisanal miner, these factors include: (1) increased or comparable simplicity, (2) quick recovery of the economic mineral, and (3) demonstrated financial gain. Other practical aspects, such as the availability of materials (chemicals, steel rods, piping, generators, etc), capital and operating cost requirements and access to technical support, also influence acceptance of new techniques.
   This article will review four inter-related areas: first, the limitations and benefits, for ASM, of a number of specific technologies; second, the role of Processing Centers in education, information dissemination and provision of "clean" services; third, benefits and challenges associated with formalization of ASM activities; and fourth, the contribution of ASM to the development of sustainability of communities, primarily through diversification of livelihoods. The appropriate application of technologies, particularly given the diversity of ASM communities around the world, will also be explored. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   friendliness or soundness; sustainable development
AB Small-scale mining in Ghana is defined to include both the exploitation of mineral deposits (1) using fairly rudimentary implements and/or (2) at low levels of production with minimal capital investment. While the large-scale mining-of particularly gold-has become predominant, small-scale mining, which predates such operations, has continued to be an important economic activity, particularly within the remote and poorer areas of the country. The environmental impacts of such small operations have, however, varied, depending on methods and the scale of operation. The factors that have contributed to aggravating these environmental impacts are economic, technical, legal, and operational in nature. Although mitigation efforts have had a limited impact, it is expected that the measures now being considered for adoption will improve the efficacy of the Government of Ghana's drive towards improving environmental management in resident small-scale precious metal mining operations.
   This paper examines the environmental impacts of small-scale mining in Ghana-with particular emphasis on precious minerals and metals extraction-and outlines a series of initiatives for improving environmental performance in the industry. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The challenge of sustainable development is now recognised world wide. Three dimensions are relevant: the interaction between culture, structure and technology, the approaches optimisation-improvement-renewaI and the parties involved. Renewal of systems requires new ways of search and design of exploration processes comprising human needs as a starting point, backcasting as a method and jumps in eco-efficiency, measured as factor X as orientation. This implies a strategic approach to innovation and breakthroughs in which transdisciplinarity is a key factor to obtain viable results. Dutch experiences reveal that innovation options can be identified and innovation paths can be paved. Support conditions were identified; in order to ensure the availability of sufficient capacity, strong efforts must be made in the system of (higher) education. A proposal is made for a European policy to strengthen and spread the system's renewal approach in interaction with educational renewal. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE environmental education; engineering
AB The issue of sustainability places particular demands on engineers to become more 'connoisseur' of the roots of the problems, in addition to being 'trained' in problem solution techniques that emphasize holistic approaches (for both the social and ecological environment). We have introduced the new E3 model, as outlined here, to chemical engineering students, with an integrated approach to translate 'generic' common-sense pollution prevention strategies (design, operation) into definite problems where engineering science can be put into action. New,tools (such as minimization hierarchy and life cycle), as well as abilities both to identify and evaluate environmental problems, and to propose, select and implement solutions, provide methods for understanding a problem and for mitigating it through (re)design of a product or process, by emphasizing basic approaches to analysis, synthesis and integration. Additionally, control technologies can be systematized, including the best available selection procedures on which the emission limits are based. Awareness, institutional factors and normative-ethical aspects are also considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article introduces a modified calculation model of the ecological footprint for energy planning. The original footprint model can only evaluate energy savings, but not the substitution of fossil through renewable energy carriers. With the modified calculation model, energy savings as well as substitution potentials can be described. The examination of case studies where this model has been applied in energy planning led to the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the modified calculation model which are discussed subsequently. Hence it follows that the modified calculation model is suitable for energy planning processes from analysis to decision making. Used as a communication tool the model shows whether the principles of sustainable development. are being realized on different levels of energy planning. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE cross sectoral; stakeholders; interactive; communication
AB While there are examples of good practice the engagement of business in Local Agenda 21 has been restricted. This is certainly true in the UK experience. 'Missing' the supply side of the economy in this way is clearly unsatisfactory. This problem has been addressed by the Centre for Sustainable Development from a particular perspective, which follows the multi stakeholder principles of sustainable development (SD). This paper analyses a project to make a simple clear communication tool, without jargon, to communicate the meaning of SD in different dimensions to small and medium sized businesses. The project produced a business workbook directly useful to business and that can be utilised by local authorities in the business interaction parts of their Local Agenda 21 programmes. The paper examines further what is involved in a particular aspect of the process of SD, in the regional context, and seeks to underpin the understanding that SD is a process. As part of this issues relevant to culture change are examined. A consideration of the stakeholder relationships and dynamics is central. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes that protecting Asia's environmental quality will require significant decreases in the intensity of resource use and pollution. This requires a focus on consumption, production and distribution of goods and services as the foundation of environmentally sustainable economic development. Cleaner Production (CP) is the strategy used by ADB to affect intensities of resource use and pollution generation. CP includes many tools for many different areas, but they all include a foundation of life cycle management and risk reduction. CP began in ADB as a technical approach to improve the environmental performance of projects. It has evolved into a broad program that seeks to integrate preventive environmental management and technology into national and regional policies and sustainable development strategies. Experience has shown that CP is promoted primarily by changes in behaviors, not technologies. The challenge for, the ADB is to help its Developing Member Countries bring CP concepts into national development policy, governance, technology development and information exchange, and private sector investment. Promoting CP in new industrial investment in Asia, particularly by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and promoting the adoption of CP principles as development policy in DMCs will be major goals of the ADB.

AB The Expert Working Group on "Improving the Role of Government in the Promotion of Environmental Management Accounting (EMA)" was set up by the United Nations Division for Sustainable Development (UN DSD) in cooperation with a number of government agencies and non-governmental experts to promote Environmental Management Accounting (EMA) through publications, pilot projects and by establishing an international forum for discussion on the role of governments in the promotion of EMA.
   EMA, Environmental management accounting represents a combined approach that provides for the transition of data from financial accounting, cost accounting and mass balances to increase material efficiency, reduce environmental impacts and risks and reduce costs of environmental protection. EMA is performed by private or public corporations, but not by nations and has a financial as well as a physical component.
   The core focus of environmental management accounting and of the EMA UN DSD methodology is assessment of total annual environmental expenditure on emission treatment, disposal, environmental protection and management. In addition, and that is new and challenging for most companies, the material purchase value of all non-product output and its production costs are added. This total sum often provides a frightening picture of total annual costs of inefficiency and gets companies to improve their information systems and material efficiency options, which is the goal in the light of cleaner production.
   The first book published by the Expert Working Group, Environmental Management Accounting-Procedures and Principles (Jasch, C., United Nations, New York, 2001), defines principles and procedures for EMA, with a focus on techniques for quantifying environmental expenditures or costs, as a basis for better controlling and benchmarking purposes. The methodology excludes costs external to the company (so-called externalities, e.g. environmental and social effects that occur to the general public), but focuses on comprehensive assessment of direct annual expenditure on emission treatment, environmental protection and management as well as wasted material and energy input (efficiency losses in production). Firstly, total annual expenditure is assessed, then improvement options, savings and investment projects as well as product prices can be (re-)calculated. The method is currently applied in several case studies. The following summary provides some of the core definitions and generic assessment tables. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines a high profile and often provocative segment of the financial industry: that of Ethical or Socially Responsible Investment. By offering an ethical or sustainable product which has the potential to influence so many stakeholders-the financial industry is in a unique position to guide change towards corporate sustainability. However, what message is ethical investment really giving to companies and the financial industry? Are ethical investors and their rating agencies capable of effectively influencing corporations towards more sustainable patterns of production and consumption; and are their approaches consistent with the principles of Cleaner Production? This paper first gives an overview some of the definitions 'ethical investment' and the scale of activities under this umbrella term. Then the actual screening methods and their application is examined. A typology of the different ethical mutual funds is given, and two cases of ethical funds are described (Robur's Environmental Fund, and Sustainable Asset Management's sustainability rating tool). Each are analysed in terms of their potential to either reveal or conceal cleaner production innovations by the firms they assess. In order to ascertain where Ethical Investment might lead companies, the effects of ethical investment on companies-and back on the asset management companies themselves is explored. A reflexive model of corporate and finance sector learning based on the ethical screens is proposed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There have been too many environmental surprises during the last century-too many occasions where decisions relative to the environment, were taken in the belief that there was a well-established, scientific basis for the decisions and faith in the expertise that provided the information. The surprises illustrate that the knowledge base and models in some cases do not even come close to reality. The reason may be incertitude, which covers the spectrum from determinism, uncertainty, ignorance and indeterminacy. In relation to risk assessment. and sustainability, society, politicians and professionals have to come to terms with the fact that ignorance plays a far greater role than normally acknowledged by natural scientists and engineers.

AB Groundwater resource management should be integrated with regional land-use planning. The objectives of such planning should respond to regional and long-term design needs, which can maximize human-life quality, achieve a balance between ecological and engineering approaches to land-use alteration, and lead to sustainable groundwater resources. Regional plans should be designed in harmony with natural amenities, restrictions of the environment, and water needs so as to provide adequate rural amenities to urban areas and adequate urban amenities to rural areas.
   Maximum efficiency of these remediation measures can be attained in urban areas only if hydrological barriers which aim to preserve fresh water resources from pollution are simultaneously emplaced with greenbelts which not only aim to promote ground vegetation and soil stability, but also reduce the input of potential pollutants. Similarly, in rural areas abstraction of fresh groundwater should also be paired with aquifer recharge. From this study it can be stated that only integrated hydrological, environmental, and land-use measures could offset the present malaise of inharmonious land-use, water resources, and socio-economic planning with balanced design needs, in order to achieve integrated urban/rural land-use for sustainable groundwater resources planning.

AB Chemical use reduction is strongly desirable for environmental and public welfare reasons, and is a critical element of moving towards more sustainable consumption in the business-to-business economy. However, the fundamental economic relationship between chemical supplier and chemical customer creates supply side incentives for increased chemical use. Chemical management services (CMS) is a business model that aligns economic incentives in the chemical supplier-customer relationship towards reduced chemical use by making chemical services rather than chemical volume the basis of supplier compensation. CMS thus servicizes' the chemical supply chain and is a Product Service System with significant potential environmental benefits. CMS enjoys high penetration in the US auto and semiconductor sectors, and is emergent in other sectors. The paper synthesizes lessons learned from hands-on work with 15 chemical-using firms over 5 years in all aspects of CMS program implementation. Key points are that poor cost accounting and chemical information management form significant barriers to making, understanding and evaluating the CMS business case. The details of contractual compensation mechanisms are critical to achieving in practice the potential environmental benefits of the CMS model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   innovation; life cycle design; product-service system
AB The product service systems' (PSS) sustainability potential is described in the framework of the new types of stakeholder relationships and/or partnerships, producing new convergence of economic interests, and a potential concomitant systemic resources optimization. In this perspective, it is argued that the design competencies should move towards those of the 'strategic design', thus introducing the concept of 'strategic design for sustainability': the design of an innovation strategy, shifting the business focus from designing (and selling) physical products only, to designing (and selling) a system of products and services which are jointly capable of fulfilling specific client demands, while re-orienting current unsustainable trends in production and consumption practices. Some examples of PSS are presented and discussed using the PSS categories 'services providing added value to the product life cycle', 'services providing final results to customers', and 'services providing enabling platforms for customers'. The cases derive from an analysis of the 'environmental friendly innovation' yearly endowed prize submissions. The Politecnico di Milano University together with the Bocconi University and Legambiente (an environmental NGO) promotes the initiative in Italy. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper presents the main results of a recent study on sustainable use of products. It reveals that strategies of use intensification and useful life extension are environmentally beneficial. Moreover, analysis of household washing and winter sports illustrated that successful implementation of sustainable use patterns occurs as a shift of use regimes. Such regimes are the result of a complex interplay of supply and demand side factors, relationship among actors, technical trajectories, organisational structures etc. One decisive factor is the presence of strategic players, so called "change agents". In addition, four user types have been identified in a representative survey ("ownership-oriented", "open-minded", "consumption-oriented", "low interest") to which use intensification and useful life extension can be targeted.

AB In light of increasing pressures to adopt a more sustainable approach to product design and manufacture, the requirement to develop sustainable products is one of the key challenges facing industry in the 21st century. Hence, the concept of developing sustainable products as well as services is evolving as a key element of Cleaner Production. Sustainable product development initiatives (mainly through eco-design) have been evolving for some time to support companies develop more sustainable products. Ireland has been running the highly successful Environmentally Superior Products (ESP) initiative that supports industrial companies to incorporate a more sustainable approach to the development of products and/or services. The lessons learned from the ESP and other global Sustainable Product and Service Developments in industry and research, are being used to develop a method for effective sustainable product and/or service development (SPSD) in industry. The method is designed to provide pragmatic guidance to business and industry for developing sustainable products and services as well as incorporating this approach within existing corporate strategy, cleaner production and product development systems. This method is being developed by the authors at the Environmental Policy and Management Group (EPMG), Department of Environmental Science and Technology, Imperial College London, UK in conjunction with industry and practitioners. The method provides a framework for implementing SPSD throughout the entire lifecycle of a product and/or service. It can be used to identify, assess and implement the options for optimum sustainability in the design and development of a product and/or service. This paper describes the key features of this method. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The focal point of this paper is the relatively unknown concept of alternative function fulfilment (AFF), which is a design strategy that can be used to generate new ways of fulfilling a certain function and is referred to in the context of ecodesign. It can be considered an attractive environmental innovation strategy, provided that the increased design space is used to create more sustainable products and services.
   This paper explores the AFF concept and discusses the implications of adopting this concept. It thus focuses on how design and business processes may need to change to allow the radical shift towards AFF, in order to facilitate the envisaged significant environmental improvements.

AB This paper explores the role of the business community in promoting sustainable consumption. While businesses play an important role in shaping social trends, including the growth of material consumption, allegations that individual corporations wield excessive power may have been overstated. Most of the time corporations are simply playing by the rules and culture of the market.
   Businesses have mostly assumed that their contribution to sustainability lies in improving eco-efficiency-staying within the current business framework. But sustainable consumption will require wider change, including shifts in the incentives that shape the actions of businesses and others, and a change in the culture that underlies market expectations. Finns, governments, the media and civil society may need to enter a dialogue together to develop a new story about the nature of prosperity and the role of the business community in promoting it. The initiative is most likely to come from civil society. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most OECD countries have implemented policies to reduce the environmental impacts from household activities. Some of these aim to influence household decision-making directly by encouraging energy conservation or waste recycling, for example. Others influence the options open to consumers in the market by imposing standards so that more environmentally benign goods are available, or by using taxes or fees to increase the relative prices of products with greater negative environmental impacts.
   Some of these policies have resulted in limited changes in behaviour. Still, many of the environmental impacts resulting from household decisions are expected to intensify over the next two decades (see accompanying article in this issue). Practical experience and analysis is showing that many environmental problems will be difficult to resolve without addressing diffuse sources of pollution, including household consumption. OECD governments will need to reinforce their policies to help households make day-to-day and major investment decisions at a lower cost to the environment.

AB The Oxford Commission on Sustainable Consumption aims to promote debate and action to achieve sustainable consumption. It has met four times since it was established in 1999. Commission members have undertaken a number of projects around the world, working with communities to explore pathways to more sustainable consumption. This paper summarises the Commission's progress and the messages emerging from its work. Current consumption trends are supported by a number of social trends, including individualisation, the spread of the market ethos, urbanisation, globalisation, and the increasing awareness of risk and uncertainty. However, these trends contain the seeds of their own limitation. In particular, increasing discourse about ethics and social goals may be the key to a shift towards more sustainable consumption.

   GUIDELINES; CLIMATE; ISSUES; IMO
AB This paper is concerned with the role of cultural heritage in coastal areas, including land belts and coastal marine waters in the prospect of operating sustainable development-aimed strategies. It is a part of the investigations carried out in the framework of the Progetto Finalizzato Beni Culturali (Special Project Safeguard of Cultural Heritage) convened by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR, the Italian National Research Council). Essentially, it aims at contributing to the discussion on how the mise-en-valeur of the coastal cultural heritage may be framed within integrated coastal management programmes. In this view, the discourse on the coastal cultural heritage runs along this pathway: (i) global (climatic) change and globalisation are assumed to be the key components of the external environment with which the coastal area interacts; (ii) the conceptual framework of coastal management, as it can be deduced by the background guidelines from Agenda 21 (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, UNCED), is considered; (iii) the legal framework, which the coastal area is characterised by, is taken into account by focusing on its implications on the management patterns. At this point, attention is concentrated on the role of cultural heritage in the framework of integrated coastal management approaches. It is considered, how this pivotal component of the coastal area has been dealt with bythe intergovernmental organisations. Special consideration is attributed to the European Code of Conduct for Coastal Management Zones, since it considers the ecological patrimony and cultural heritage as giving shape to a unique ethically-endowed reality, which materialised through landscapes and seascapes. The final step consists of the design of a tentative Code of Conduct for Coastal Cultural Heritage consisting of some background and operational principles.

DE Laser cleaning; Sandstone; Aged oil paint; Brown colour; Brittle
   surfaces; Consolidation
AB Laser cleaning was applied to remove aged and soiled oil paints of the 19th century from weathered, brittle sandstone surfaces. In contrast to other tested cleaning methods, the laser technique allows the removal of the oil paint layers with a minimum of material loss in brittle zones. The cleaned test areas have been investigated by optical and scanning electron microscopy as well as by colour measurements. The investigations have shown that the dirt and the oil paint layers can be removed by laser cleaning without affecting the original sandstone surface and that the pores can be opened again. The brown shade after cleaning is not caused by laser interaction with the sandstone surface but by historic impregnation with linseed oil. Immediately after cleaning, a treatment with chemical consolidants is necessary to preserve the brittle sandstone surface. Sustainable consolidation could be problematic in some areas, because the laser cleaning also preserves heavily damaged, crumbling zones of the carvings. For economic reasons, laser cleaning should be applied only in the most endangered zones of carvings and combined with classical methods (organic solvents and scalpel).

ID CARDIFF; PORT
AB The role of commercial and naval port evolution in the growth of coastal zone cultural heritage is outlined and problems of heritage sustainability are identified. It is proposed that these problems may be related not only to the issue of heritage conservation but also to the difficulties of identifying appropriate new uses that will secure the long-term economic viability of the port system's patrimony. The conservation issue is explored through a case study of cultural heritage loss in the UK's South Wales coal ports. Issues relating to economic sustainability are examined with respect to a defunct, yet architecturally outstanding, naval facility, the Royal William Yard, Plymouth, UK. It is argued that both problems can be better understood with reference to clusters of interacting and controlling 'environments' within which the cultural heritage is set. It is concluded that coastal zone management must recognise the challenges posed by such 'environments' if effective strategies to secure the future of port-based cultural heritage are to be devised. It is also suggested that the scale and complexity of the challenges are such that there is a leadership role in this sphere for international organisations such as the European Union.

AB This paper aims to present preliminary key findings from an investigation conducted in the framework of the Progetto Finalizzato Beni Culturali (Special Project for Safeguarding Cultural Heritage), convened by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR-National Research Council). The investigations focused on the role of cultural heritage as a positive force in the operation of integrated coastal management programmes in ways consistent with the application of Agenda 21 in the Italian coastal zone (http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/agenda21.htm). The region of Liguria, in northwestern Italy facing the Ligurian Sea, has been taken as a case study because it is one of the richest Italian regions as regards cultural heritage and one of the most subject to human pressure. The initial phase of the research focused on the role of museums, with the aim of devising scenarios to integrate them optimally into coastal programmes and plans. It also considered a number of landscape and cultural characteristics of the region taking into account the influence exerted by the geographical distribution of these resources. The paper reports on this stage by reviewing planning and the role of coastal cultural heritage in Italy; exploring the Ligurian geographical context and its significance for the nature and distribution of cultural heritage resources; examining a discernable expansion of cultural heritage tourism within the region; sketching scenarios for encouraging this development based on museum-orientated itineraries; and identifying a range of obstacles confronting the successful creation of such itineraries. The ultimate aim of the work is the development of guidelines to be addressed to decision-making centres, and particularly to coastal regional authorities to ensure the optimum inclusion of cultural heritage in the framework of coastal management programmes and planning.

SO JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE

AB Theoretical ideas of sustainability of heritage are applied to a practical case study. The south western peninsula of England has a rich variety of coastal heritage, analysis of which is undertaken via the 'fields' of nature, landscape, buildings, sites, artefacts, activities and people. The value of treating the cultural heritage apart from the natural heritage is seriously questioned, particularly in a coastal context. Disputes relating to the preference for one type of heritage over another are identified. While major successes are demonstrated in landscape and urban conservation, numerous failures and challenges are also recognised. It is argued that, reflecting institutional dominance of the conservation agenda, the heritage most at risk is often that which carries most meaning for local people and traditional visitors. Relating the study to the sustainability dimensions of economic development and environmental protection, the paper questions whether these wider definitions of sustainability can be applied to coastal heritage, especially in a remote region.

ID SERVICES; MODEL
AB Too many promising innovations disappear when project funding ends. As a result, interest in the problem of sustainability has increased markedly in recent years. This article explores this problem in terms of systemic change. Highlighted are basic ideas, phases, stages, steps, and lessons learned related to the planning, implementation, maintenance, and scale-up of school-based innovations. A particular emphasis is on efforts designed to enhance how schools address barriers to learning and teaching. The discussion is framed around the idea that the likelihood of sustaining any new approach is increased if it is integrated into the fabric of existing school improvement efforts.

AB Current forest management guidelines require the extensive use of stand level approaches to minimize impacts on aquatic ecosystems. As forest management practices in Canada evolve from a sustained yield, timber-based focus to a more sustainable approach, the need has been recognized for the addition of landscape or watershed-based management strategies to address the cumulative effects of management practices on aquatic systems. Additional concerns expressed by regulatory agencies have resulted in the need to restrict cumulative harvest rates and monitor harvest levels for a forest management operation in Manitoba. Present riparian management practices and watershed analysis procedures are reviewed for the operations of Louisiana-Pacific Canada in Manitoba. Requirements are outlined for multi-scale indicators and research to support the development of a watershed-based planning approach for use in forest management planning and monitoring. The development of this watershed-based approach is linked to the Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) project.

AB The Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) project was initiated in the western Canadian province of Alberta, the site of some of the most intensive forest activities on the Boreal Plain subregion of the Canadian Boreal Forest, including forestry, oil and gas extraction, and mining. Forest management falls primarily within provincial/territorial jurisdiction in Canada; therefore, we outline the processes for forest management planning and practices at the provincial level. In Alberta, the Ministry of Sustainable Resource Development allocates tenure of forested areas to forest products companies via forest management agreements (FMAs). Conditions for company activities in the FMA area are cooperatively designed and documented in detailed forest management plans. We examine Alberta Government policies with respect to watershed management in forested areas, with an emphasis on aquatic ecosystems. Further, needs for changes to current government policy and practices are discussed, with recognition of the pressures that exist on the regulatory effort.

AB Millar Western Forest Products Ltd. manages a forest in west-central Alberta under a Forest Management Agreement (FMA) with the Government of Alberta. Part of Millar Western's planning process brought researchers together to develop a decision support system (DSS) for forest management planning and monitoring programs. Four modules - timber supply, biodiversity, FIRE, and WATER - were built to evaluate, with the help of indicators of sustainable forest management, current and future forest conditions predicted from computer simulations of alternative management scenarios. In the first round of assessment four management scenarios, distinct by their level of silviculture intensification and by the spatial clearcut layout pattern, were compared. Such comparison has demonstrated that (1) the current forest management scenario improved moose habitat at the expense of timber supply, (2) all scenarios had similar fire risk, (3) generated increases in peak flow and water yield of selected watersheds, and (4) slightly impoverished forest biodiversity. All scenarios were examined in light of a computer-simulated natural disturbance benchmark. This led to landscape design scenarios to reduce fire risk and balance biodiversity indicators with timber supply objectives, one of which was eventually selected for implementation. The company's monitoring and research program is also highly focused on improving DSS modules and the underlying data, hence its association with the Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) project, which considers the effects of forest management on aquatic ecosystem indicators.

TI Environmental sustainability and the Development Facilitation Act in
   South Africa
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The Development Facilitation Act 67 Of 1995 was introduced to expedite land development projects in post-apartheid South Africa. Its primary aim was to overcome conflicting land use planning regulations that existed in various parts of the country. This paper has analysed the provisions made for the incorporation of environmental considerations in the policy, the decision-making process and the implementation of the Act. The principles of the Act support the promotion of sustainable development. In the decision-making process, most of the sustainable development principles, with the exception of that of intra-generational equity, are being applied either implicitly or explicitly. However, it is noted that the term environment is interpreted in a largely biophysical sense, thus possibly marginalising social concerns. Furthermore, there are no provisions in the Act for the enforcement of compliance with the conditions of establishment, thus in its implementation, the principles of sustainable development are being undermined.

TI The WTO and precaution: Sustainable development implications of the WTO
   asbestos dispute
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The meaning and application of the precautionary principle is increasingly being raised in WTO/GATT law. This articles considers recent developments, and since WTO law does not exist in isolation from the existing body of international law, the link between this and other legal systems, especially European treaties and jurisprudence, is briefly explored. The main focus of analysis is the recent WTO Asbestos case. The authors examine the decisions of both the Panel and the Appellate Body, and argue that the Appellate Body's reasoning is more consistent with notions of sustainable development and can be perceived as an implicit recognition of 'precaution' in the decision. The authors then highlight certain other aspects of the case including procedural innovations which might be of particular relevance to a broader developing body of what can be seen as 'international sustainable development law'. They conclude with comments on the need for increased WTO sensitivity for sustainable development goals, and suggest that one way to achieve this is through increased use of precautionary reasoning in dispute settlement cases.

AB The concept of sustainability in forestry has a long tradition in Europe. However, the perception of 'sustainable management of forests' has changed in accordance with the changes in society, which has made growing demands on ecological, economical, and social functions on forests in recent years. Following the so-called 'Helsinki-process', the EU member states have decided on general guidelines for sustainable management and for the conservation of forest biodiversity. Six criteria and 27 descriptive and quantitative indicators have been defined for the assessment and monitoring of sustainable forest management. Criterion no. 4, relating to semi-natural ancient woodland as a potential vector and source of high biodiversity and respective forest policies, provides the central theme for this paper. The paper is focused on the diversity of vascular plants and explores the possibility that isolated recent woodland could contribute to plant species diversity. Measures are suggested for forest management at forest stand and landscape levels which could enhance the diversity of typical forest plants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   resistance; forest management; risk; temperate zone
ID SPRUCE
AB In Europe temperate forests play a prominent role in timber production, nature protection, water conservation, erosion control and recreation. For centuries temperate forests in Europe have been affected by forest devastation and soil degradation. Applying great efforts to eliminate the severe wood shortage of those days, countermeasures were taken during the last 150 years by regenerating and tending highly productive forests. High growth rates and an increasing growing stock of these forests indicate that formerly stated goals have been successfully achieved. Coniferous species were often favoured because they were easy to establish and manage, and gave reason for high volume growth expectations. Today coniferous forests expand far beyond the limits of their natural ranges.
   These changes have been accompanied by a loss of biodiversity, a shift to nonsite adapted tree species and reduce the resistance against storms, snow, ice, droughts, insects and fungi. Some of these hazards were further intensified by the increasing average stand age, as well as in some areas by severe air pollution. Climatic fluctuations, especially changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme warm and dry climatic conditions and of heavy storms, had considerable impact on forest ecosystems.
   The changing demands of today require a widened scope of forest management. Society is asking for sustainable forestry emphasizing biodiversity and naturalistic forest management. It is of great economic and ecological relevance to know on which sites today's forests are most susceptible to climatic and other environmental changes and hazards. In those areas adjustments of management through a conversion the prevailing forests towards more site adapted mixed forests needs to be considered with priority. The high diversity in site conditions, ownership, economic and socio-cultural conditions require strategies adapted to the local and regional needs. Higher resistance of forests will increase economic and social benefits of forests and reduce the risks by maintaining sustainable forestry. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Forest certification - an instrument to promote sustainable forest

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DE biodiversity conservation; criteria and indicators; impact assessment
AB Forest certification was introduced in the early 1990s to address concerns of deforestation and forest degradation and to promote the maintenance of biological diversity, especially in the tropics. Initially pushed by environmental groups, it quickly evolved as a potential instrument to promote sustainable forest management (SFM). To date about 124 million ha or 3.2% of the world's forests have been certified by the different certification schemes created over the last decade.
   Forest certification shares the aim of promoting SFM with another tool, namely criteria and indicators (C&I) for SFM. C&I sets are mainly developed for the national level to describe and monitor status and trends in forests and forest management. They also provide an essential reference basis for forest certification standards, which set performance targets to be applied on a defined area. Progress in developing these two different tools has been significant.
   After 10 years of implementation, it is evident that the original intention to save tropical biodiversity through certification has largely failed to date. Most of certified areas are in the temperate and boreal zone, with Europe as the most important region. Only around ten per cent is located in tropical countries.
   The standards used for issuing certificates upon compliance are diverse, both between certification schemes and within one and the same scheme when applied in different regions. However, they are at least equal to legal requirements and often include elements that set actually higher standards.
   While the quality of actual audits of the standards is of varying quality, there are indications that independent audits are an incentive for improving forest management. As a voluntary market-based tool, forest certification is depending on the ability to cover the costs incurred and thus on often-elusive green consumer sentiment.
   Regardless of many difficulties, forest certification has been very successful in raising awareness and disseminating knowledge on a holistic SFM concept, embracing economic, environmental and social issues, worldwide. It also provides a tool for a range of other applications than assessment of sustainability, such as e.g. verifying carbon sinks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Decisions on appropriate countermeasures in the case of a contamination of large areas due to fallout from a weapon's detonations or a serious reactor or reprocessing plant accident depend on fallout level and the time period required for the exposure levels to fall below a given intervention limit. This is particularly relevant for countermeasures with high costs and substantial consequences to the population involved, such as relocation or soil perturbation. Natural processes which result in a decrease in activity concentrations in foodstuffs and external exposure with time, are least detrimental to the soil among all countermeasures proposed for rehabilitation of contaminated areas. The impact of these natural self-healing effects (soil sustainability) on the temporal activity reduction in foodstuffs, as well as their effect on the time period required for exposure levels to decrease to sufficiently low levels to allow unrestricted re-utilization and re-settlement of the land, are discussed.
   Depending on the type of foodstuff, in Central Europe this temporal decrease follows an effective half life of about 0.25-1.3 y from first to second year after fallout, followed by a decrease in milk with an effective half-life of 1-2 y in the next 7 y and about 5 y thereafter, while in cereals and vegetables in Austria a decrease by 2.3 y and in fruit by 1.3 y over a period of more than a decade is observed. In contrast, the decrease in foodstuffs derived from semi-natural environs is much slower by an effective half-life of roughly 8 y. The time-span for adequate recovery of a contaminated territory, therefore, depends on the fallout level and the radionuclides involved and the contribution of natural and semi-natural derived foodstuffs to the diet. It is shown that for Cs-137 and a typical Central European diet the time span amounts to about 1 y for a deposition of 300 kBq m(-2) and to about 10 y for a deposition of 10,000 kBq m(-2). Thus it is demonstrated that natural restoration effects may contribute significantly to the environmentally safe and sustainable resettlement of an area substantially contaminated with fission products.

AB In 1982, Dr. K. C. Saha, a dermatologist of Calcutta, West Bengal, identified patients with skin lesions from the district of 24 Parganas, leading him and others to search for a cause. The cause was soon identified to be arsenic in drinking water, but even today, 20 years later, large number of people continue to drink arsenic contaminated water and patients are increasing in number. Project Well is a program chosen for implementation in some villages of North 24 Parganas. Arsenic safe drinking water is provided for adopted villages by constructing shallow, concrete dugwells designed to tap the water of the unconfined aquifer, 20-30 feet below ground level, that contains low levels (< 0.05 mg/L) of arsenic in the target region. The traditional dugwell design is modified by use of tube well hand pumps to withdraw water. The project includes community involvement, programs to increase awareness of the need to drink arsenic safe water, and training in monitoring of dugwell water for arsenic and harmful pathogens. Disinfecting of the water and regulating the water hazard diagram are also included in the training program. The plan is to make the system sustainable at the village level using indigenous labor and materials.

AB Yard waste compost provides an organic amendment useful for improving soil structure and nutrient status. The activities of the enzymes hydrolyzing urea (urease) and sucrose (invertase) in the rhizosphere of potato plants were determined under field conditions. Soil urease and invertase activities were monitored in compost amended soil, grass buffer strips, and in adjacent bare soils during 35 d following soil treatment. Soil urease activity was increased by application of yard waste compost compared to untreated soil which provide evidence of increased soil microbial population following application of compost. Some transitional effects on urease activities were observed following Pyrethrins and Neemix-4E application, these effects were neither drastic nor prolonged enough to be considered deleterious to the soil microorganisms and their activities important to soil fertility. No relationship was found between invertase activity and the three management practices or soil organic matter content. It is, suggested that application of botanical insecticides like pyrethrins and Neemix-4E may be useful in delaying urea fertilizer mineralization to maintain N in a form less leachable, so that the duration of N availability to plants is prolonged. The present study may also provide information on urease activity as a sensitive bioindicator of soil quality that reflects the effects of land management on soil quality and may assist land managers in monitoring long-term productivity and sustainability of agricultural lands.

AB This study investigated the benefits of an on-site sustainable solid waste treatment and utilization system for the greenhouse industry. The composts made from greenhouse wastes were tested and found to contain high nutrient values and good physical properties, and could be used as high quality growing media. The finished composts were tested in a greenhouse against the conventional growth media (sawdust) and resulted in a 10% yield increase by using the compost. An economic analysis was conducted to show the economic benefits of on-site composting for a greenhouse operation. Based on a four-hectare tomato or pepper greenhouse, and amortizing the capital equipment over five years, the net annual cost of composting represents a savings of $8,000 annually.

AB Most of the projected global population increases will take place in third world countries that already suffer from water, food, and health problems. Increasingly, the various water uses (municipal, industrial, agricultural) must be coordinated with, and integrated into, the overall water management of the region. Sustainability, public health, environmental protection and economics are key factors. More storage of water behind dams and especially in aquifers via artificial recharge is necessary to save water in times of water surplus for use in times of water shortage. Municipal wastewater can be an important water resource but its use must be carefully planned and regulated to prevent adverse health effects and, in the case of irrigation, undue contamination of groundwater. While almost all liquid fresh water of the planet occurs underground as groundwater, its long-term suitability as a source of water is threatened by non-point source pollution from agriculture and other sources and by aquifer depletion due to groundwater withdrawals in excess of groundwater recharge. In irrigated areas, groundwater levels may have to be controlled with drainage or pumped well systems to prevent water-logging and salinization of soil. Salty drainage waters must then be handled in an ecologically responsible way. Water short countries can save water by importing most of their food and electric power from other countries with more water, so that in essence they also get the water that was necessary to produce these commodities and, hence, is virtually embedded in the commodities. This "virtual" water tends to be a lot cheaper for the receiving country than developing its own water resources. Local water can then be used for purposes with higher social, ecological, or economic returns or saved for the future. Climate changes in response to global warming caused by carbon dioxide emissions are difficult to predict in space and time. Resulting uncertainties require flexible and integrated water management to handle water surpluses, water shortages, and weather extremes. Long-term storage behind dams and in aquifers may be required. Rising sea levels will present problems in coastal areas.

ID BAMBOO
AB Ecological risk assessment using indicators of sustainability offers a framework for the objective analysis of management decisions in complex landscapes. To demonstrate this approach, we examined risks to the Caribbean National Forest. Among the many stressors, invasive species (especially bamboo and Africanized bees) pose the largest potential risk to management goals. Although bamboo is spreading slowly, the risk of colonization is sufficient to require monitoring and research. Africanized bees, on the other hand, should be removed immediately from sensitive areas to increase the nesting success of the endemic but endangered Puerto Rican parrot.

TI Estimation of sustainable yield of some rivers in Trinidad
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Caribbean; water supply; instream flow; low flow; rivers
AB A scenic and mountainous area of ancient tropical rainforest in the Caribbean Island of Trinidad has considerable potential for eco-tourism. However, it does not have significant groundwater resources, and its ecologically sensitive nature precludes the construction of impoundment reservoirs. Therefore, the sustainable yield, i.e., 7-day 20-year low flow (7Q20) minus instream flow, of its rivers is one of the critical factors affecting the area's carrying capacity for eco-tourism. Unfortunately, hydrologic data for the watersheds in this area are either unavailable or insufficient for independently estimating the aforementioned sustainable yield by the conventional methods. Therefore, a hydrologic similarity method was used to obtain 7Q20 of the ungauged rivers. Further, the instream flow was estimated, in the absence of any local criterion, by instream flow incremental methodology. This paper describes the application of these two methodologies and presents the results, which indicated that owing to the presence of a hydraulic threshold for the commencement of habitat stress, the sustainable yield should not exceed 20-30% of 7Q20. It is believed that this technical note would be of interest to practicing hydrologic engineers, whose work may sometimes relate to an area where rainfall and stream flow data are sparse, discontinuous, and nonconcurrent, and the criteria for instream flow are not yet developed.

TI "When the devil turns ... ": The political foundations of independent
   judicial review
SO JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE; GAME
AB An independent judiciary with the power to constrain the executive and legislative branches is commonly thought to be the foundation of government under the rule of law. However, it is not obvious why those with political power would ever tolerate the constraints imposed by an independent court. I offer an explanation for independent judicial review that is based on ongoing political competition between risk-averse parties. An independent judiciary is a mechanism through which these political competitors can enforce mutual restraint. But support for independent judicial review is sustainable only when (1) the political system is sufficiently competitive, (2) judicial doctrine is sufficiently moderate, and (3) parties are both sufficiently risk averse and forward looking. I employ a simple formal model to show how these variables influence the political sustainability of independent judicial review, and I also present the results of a preliminary empirical test that confirms the central hypotheses.

AB The performance of anatase type titanium dioxide (TiO2) encapsulated with styrenic copolymers via the solvent evaporation or suspension polymerization process was investigated as a photocatalyst for the decolourization of methylene blue (MB, 3,4-bis(dimethylamino)-phenothiazine-5-thionium chloride) in the aqueous phase. The TiO2 microcapsules, loaded with 4-8 wt% TiO2, were dispersed in a B aqueous solution containing an adequate amount of hydroperoxide as an oxygen source, and the mixture was exposed to 365 nm UV light. The decolourization of MB proceeded according to the first order of the MB concentration. The apparent rate constant, defined based on the unit weight of loaded TiO2, depended on the initial concentration of MB. The capsule walls, composed of cross-linked and/or uncross-linked poly(styrene-co-2-ethylhexyl acrylate), favoured the adsorption of MB on the capsule surface and promoted the decomposition. The observations of the cross-section of microcapsules by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed similar morphology of microcapsules regardless of preparation method; a thin layer of hydrophilic TiO2 particles being localized near the particle surface. The sustainability of the microcapsules was also proved by doing experiments successively for 7 days. Smaller size microcapsules were favoured for the decomposition of MB, and the rate constant increased with the surface area of microcapsules in unit volume of the reaction mixture. Although large size microcapsules with uncross-linked polymer wall had a disadvantage of breaking under high shear agitation, those prepared with cross-linked polymer wall by suspension polymerization still remained effective after the sustainability test for 7 days.

AB This paper proposes a low cost alternative to the large bailout packages that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has organized to address financial crises. The IMF would act as a lender of last resort. Faced with an unsustainable debt burden, a government would declare default. It would announce negotiations to restructure its debt at a sustainable level and a minimum restructured value of the debt. During the restructuring period, the IMF would provide a cash support bid at a discount to the government's minimum offer. The IMF floor would guarantee liquidity and create a functioning market in the defaulted debt. The proposal would remedy market failure, preclude panic and contagion, and facilitate an orderly debt restructuring. This would be achieved without substantial official funds. Lenders would be forced to bear the risks they undertake thereby reducing moral hazard and future instability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Community participation is believed to hold a number of benefits, including the incorporation of local knowledge in planning, generation of greater support for and sustainability of local actions and being consistent with democratic values. These claimed benefits were examined in upstate New York, where 3-d participatory planning events were convened in each of six communities, focusing on desired changes in the local food system. A variety of qualitative and quantitative methods were used to assess the following: 1) local values, interests and beliefs (viewpoints) related to food and the food system before and after the planning events; 2) fairness and effectiveness in agenda setting; and 3) implementation of actions during the 2 y following the events. Despite marked variation in viewpoints, participants readily agreed on desired changes in the local food system during the events and they considered the process to be a fair and positive experience. However, the action agendas, follow-up actions and changes in viewpoints after the events displayed systematic tendencies to deviate from revealed common interests or interests of disenfranchised participants. This reflected differences in the fairness and effectiveness of participation during and after the events, established agendas and preferences of local institutions and a variety of market and regulatory barriers.

AB The Southeastern Anatolian Project (SAP, Turkish acronym GAP) is the largest irrigation and development project of Turkey covering about two million ha cultivated land. A number of field experiments in the region with different crops including maize, wheat, and cotton, have repeatedly shown that increased applications of phosphorus (P) fertilizers (i.e., from 0 kg P2O5 ha(-1) up to 200 kg P2O5 ha(-1)) do not lead to any effects on crop yield in soils with low plant available P concentration. The aim of the research was to determine the potential effect of indigenous mycorrhiza and selected mycorrhiza species on plant growth and nutrient uptake under sterile and non-sterile soil conditions. The preliminary results led us to study the effect of indigenous mycorrhizae potential on the growth of plants and P nutrition in a representative soil from the GAP under greenhouse conditions. Using inoculation of three different mycorrhizae species (Glomus caledonium, G. etunicatum, and G. mossea) maize plants were grown with increasing P [0 (P1), 25 (P2), 125 (P3) mg Pkg(-1) soil] supply in soils with and without sterilization. At the lowest P supply, shoot dry matter production was significantly depressed. This decreasing effect of low P supply was particularly obvious when soils were sterilized and not inoculated with mycorrhizae. Inoculation of soil with mycorrhizae species significantly increased plant growth and P uptake of plants, especially under low P supply and soil sterilization. In all experiments, plants grown on non-sterile soil grew much better than on sterilized soils. However, mycorrhizal dependencies of plant grow in sterile soil is higher than that in non-sterile soil. Among the mycorrhizae species, G. caledonium was the most effective on plant growth, P uptake and mycorrhizal dependency In low P application, plant roots were strongly infected and consequently increased plant growth, but in high P level application there was a slight reduction in root infection. The results show that mycorrhizal inoculation is an effective practice for improving crop production in P deficient soils. Also there was a potential effect of indigenous mycorrhizal fungi spores in the soil series of the Harran Plain that successfully infected the plant roots. It has been concluded that soil and crop management can help to get maximum benefit from indigenous mycorrhiza for sustainable P management.

AB Soil acidity is one of the limiting factors affecting the production and sustainability of pastures and crops in many parts of the world. An on farm experiment was conducted in Australia to investigate the cultivar variation in alfalfa (lucerne) (Medicago sativa L.) with respect to soil acidity and response to applied lime. The experimental site was a brown sandy clay loam with a soil pH of 4.8 (1 :5 calcium chloride). Ten cultivars (Hunter River, Hunterfield, Sceptre, Aurora, Genesis, Aquarius, Venus, PL90, PL55, and breeding line Y8804) were tested at two levels of lime (0 and 2 t ha(-1)). Lime application significantly increased the root growth, nodulation, leaf retention, leaf to stem ratio, herbage yield, and crude protein content of alfalfa. Liming had a significant effect on elemental composition of alfalfa shoots. Aluminum (M) concentration was reduced from 93 mg kg(-1) DM in nil lime treatment to 45 mg kg(-1) DM in +lime treatment. Similarly, manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) shoot concentrations were reduced from 74 mg kg(-1) DM and 92 mg kg(-1) DM to 59 mg kg(-1) DM and 76 mg kg(-1) DM, respectively Liming significantly improved the calcium (Ca) concentration of shoots, while there was a little effect on phosphorus (P) and zinc (Zn) concentrations of alfalfa shoots. Cultivars had differential response to lime application. Response to lime application was greater in Y8804 and Aurora alfalfa where yield increased by 32% and 31%, while yield increase was 11-22% in other cultivars. Cultivars also differed significantly in root growth, nodulation, leaf drop, leaf to stem ratio, crude protein content, and elemental composition of shoots. Cultivars with better performance in no liming treatment had comparatively lower shoot Al, Mn, and Fe concentrations compared with other cultivars.

AB Low soil organic matter (OM) characterizes most soils of the humid tropics because crop residues are not returned to the field. A two-year (1997-1999) field experiment was carried out in an Ultisol to determine the contribution of crop residue application in sustaining yields of maize (Zea mays L.) and groundnut (Arachis kypogaea) in a crop rotation system. Three management practices were compared, inorganic fertilizer with crop residues (T1, inorganic fertilizer without crop residue (T2) and half dose of inorganic fertilizer with crop residues combined with chicken manure (CM) (T3), in a randomized block design. During five crops cycle of continuous application of crop residues with inorganic fertilizers or combined with CM, 43% of the observed maximum yield of the maize was sustained compared to 21% in plots where crop residues were removed. Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) uptake by the subsequent crops were significantly higher in crop residue treatments whereas phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were not significantly affected by application of crop residues. In the highly weathered soils of the tropics, incorporation of crop residues appeared to be a beneficial management practice for sustaining crop yields.

AB Iron deficiency is estimated to affect over one-half the world population. Improving the nutritional quality of staple food crops through breeding for high bioavailable iron represents a sustainable and cost effective approach to alleviating iron malnutrition. Forty-nine late maturing tropical elite maize varieties were grown in a lattice design with two replications in three locations representing three agroecologies in West and Central Africa to identify varieties with high levels of kernel-Fe. Bioavailable iron was assessed for some varieties selected for high Fe concentration in kernel and improved agronomic traits using an in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model. Significant differences in kernel-Fe and -zinc concentration were observed among varieties (P < 0.001). Kernel-Fe levels ranged from 16.8 to 24.4 mg kg(-1), while kernel-Zn levels ranged from 16.5 to 24.6 mg kg(-1). Environment did not have a significant effect on kernel-iron and -zinc levels, but genotype by environment (G x E) interaction was highly significant. The genetic component accounted for 12% of the total variation in kernel-Fe and 29% for kernel-Zn levels. Kernel-Fe was positively correlated with kernel-Zn (R = 0.51, P < 0.0001). Significant differences in iron bioavailability were detected among selected Fe-rich varieties grown at one location. Mean bioavailable Fe ranged between 30% below to 88% above the reference control variety. The results indicate that genetic differences exist in kernel-Fe and -Zn concentrations and Fe bioavailability These differences may be useful in biofortification intervention programs, but additional research is needed to determine the efficacy of iron-rich Maize varieties in alleviating iron deficiency in humans.

ID ECONOMIC-GROWTH; INFLATION
AB Maastricht-like convergence is well known to be prerequisite for monetary stability and the successful introduction of the euro. The 2% inflation target implicitly assumes that the relation between inflation and "economic performance" in general is nonlinear: there is almost no effect below this threshold, and significant negative effects above the threshold. In other words, the other pressing problem of the European Union (real convergence) depends to a large extent on Maastricht-like, nominal convergence. This paper attempts to test this "Maastricht proposition." Two models are used, a threshold regression (where bootstrap methods have to be used to conduct inference), and a smooth transition model. The findings suggest that the threshold level of inflation is 4.3%, and there is significant evidence of nonlinearity in the inflation-growth nexus. There is negative relationship between inflation and growth for inflation rates above as well below the "threshold" level, but the effect above the "threshold" is almost three times as large. These results give support to EU anti-inflationary policies aiming at obtaining fiscal and monetary stability as a prerequisite for sustainable growth and real convergence.

ID PREVENTION
AB Community readiness is a research-based theory that provides a basic understanding of the intervention process in communities. This theory allows us to accurately describe the developmental level of a community relative to a specific issue or problem. In order to move the community toward implementing and maintaining efforts that are effective and sustainable, community mobilization must be based on involvement of multiple systems and utilization of within-community resources and strengths. Successful local prevention and intervention efforts must be conceived from models that are community-specific, culturally relevant, and consistent with the level of readiness of the community to implement an intervention. The community readiness model is an innovative method for assessing the level of readiness of a community to develop and implement prevention programming. It can be used as both a research tool to assess distribution of levels of readiness across a group of communities or as a tool to guide prevention efforts at the individual level. This tool has proven useful in addressing a gamut of problems ranging from health and nutritional issues to environmental and social issues. The model identifies specific characteristics related to different levels of problem awareness and readiness for change.

DE withholding tax; information exchange
AB This paper considers withholding taxes and information exchange as alternative means to tax international interest income. For each regime, we consider the maximum level of taxation of foreign-source income that can be sustained as the equilibrium of a repeated game. The best regime is the one that brings the level of taxation in the repeated game closest to the cooperative level of interest taxation. Sustainable levels of taxation in either regime depend on the importance of bank profits and on the marginal cost of public funds, among other things. Simulations with the model illustrate the choice between withholding taxes and information exchange. An explicit possibility is the emergence of a mixed regime, with one country imposing a withholding tax and the other country providing information. The basic model is extended to allow for size differences between the two countries and to incorporate a third, outside country. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ground water has increasingly taken its place in the provision of safe, potable supply in the developing world. Large investments have been made in infrastructural development for rural ground water supply schemes, but far too little attention has been given to assess the sustainability of these supplies. Overexploitation of aquifers, evident in failing boreholes and deteriorating water quality, has become a world-wide concern. Developments in physics half a century ago established the basis of isotope hydrology. Radioactive isotopes give information on ground water dynamics and recharge rates whilst non-radioactive - or stable - isotopes indicate origins of ground water and delineate ground water bodies. Environmental isotope hydrology is increasingly seen as a powerful discipline in assessing ground water systems. This is particularly important in developing environments, where historical data is rarely available. Brief examples are presented of isotope applications to collaborative ground water studies conducted at the University of the Witwatersrand. Recharge estimates based on isotope "snapshot" data conform well with results from subsequent long-term water level observations in the Kalahari of Botswana. The importance is demonstrated of irrigation return flow and pollution hazard to the Lomagundi dolomite of Zimbabwe. Isotopes suggest the source of high nitrate concentrations to an important ground water supply in Tanzania. Mechanisms of the release of arsenic into millions of tube wells in Bangladesh are put into perspective. Isotope hydrology as appropriate technology is highlighted in terms of its cost-effectiveness and the investigative empowerment of local investigators.

DE biological control; Aphthona; weeds; invasive species; success;
   integrated pest management
ID EUPHORBIA-ESULA
AB The development of successful regional or national invasive weed control programs is often hampered by the way the problem is approached. Typically weed control programs are developed and evaluated solely from the perspective of the biological sciences. While this is appropriate from a local or landscape perspective, it will probably not produce the desired results when addressing widespread well-established infestations that impact large regions. The "Ecological Area-wide Management (TEAM) of Leafy Spurge" program was the first U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) area wide invasive weed program. The 5-year program, funded by the ARS and conducted cooperatively with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, focused on the control of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) in North Dakota and South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. Now in its final year (2001), the TEAM Leafy Spurge program has made significant progress in controlling leafy spurge, increasing public awareness of the problem and demonstrating the effectiveness of biologically-based integrated pest management. While this is a significant accomplishment, the lessons learned over the course of the project clearly demonstrate that the success of regional weed control programs depends on more than a persistent, marked reduction in the pest population. Effective regional weed control programs need to focus not only on biological issues, but also on the ecological, scientific, economic, social and legal factors that influence the effectiveness of the program. Therefore, the implementation and subsequent evaluation of a weed control program must include all the principal factors that will ultimately determine success and sustainability. This manuscript outlines the history of leafy spurge on the North American continent, the situation currently facing weed managers, and an evaluation of the TEAM Leafy Spurge program's success for each factor listed above. The final analysis indicates that successful biologically-based leafy spurge control is on the horizon, especially when weed managers understand the number of problem areas that must be addressed to achieve a sustained reduction of a weed population. The amount of time it will take to be realized depends on our commitment to solving the problem and our willingness to work together as a cohesive team.

TI Getting from here to there: Evaluating West Virginia's rural
   nonemergency medical transportation program
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB With funding from the 21st Century Challenge Fund, the West Virginia Rural Health Access Program created Transportation for Health, a demonstration project for rural nonemergency medical transportation. The project was implemented in 3 sites around the state, building on existing transportation systems-specifically, a multicounty transit authority, a joint senior center/transit system, and a senior services center. An evaluation of the project was undertaken to answer 3 major questions: (1) Did the project reach the population of people who need transportation assistance? (2) Are users of the transportation project satisfied with the service? (3) Is the program sustainable? Preliminary results from survey data indicate that the answers to questions 1 and 2 are affirmative. A break-even analysis of all 3 sites begins to identify programmatic and policy issues that challenge the likelihood of financial sustainability, including salary expenses, unreimbursed mileage, and reliance on Medicaid reimbursement.

AB This paper examines embeddedness and the turn to quality in agro-food research. It suggests that the notion of embeddedness requires critical scrutiny and that the implications of the turn to quality for the geography of agriculture may not be as radical as some have suggested. The relationship between quality and local embeddedness is explored in some detail drawing on empirical work on food purchases in five rural localities of England and Wales. It is suggested that the patterns of food purchasing revealed, with local food figuring more highly than organic, illustrate a defensive politics of localism rather than a strong turn to quality based around organic and ecological production. Far from heralding an alternative post-global green future, as promoted by a range of proponents of sustainable agriculture, the turn to local food may cover many different forms of agriculture, encompassing a variety of consumer motivations and giving rise to a wide range of politics.

AB Alternative food initiatives are appearing in many places. Observers suggest that they share a political agenda: to oppose the structures that coordinate and globalize the current food system and to create alternative systems of food production that are environmentally sustainable, economically viable, and socially just. This paper examines the potential of these initiatives through the lens of the concepts of 'alternative and oppositional' social movements and 'militant particularism and global ambition' developed by Raymond Williams and David Harvey. The three sections of this paper review (1) the current discussion of common themes and strategies in agrifood initiatives within the academic literature; (2) the history of these initiatives in California; and (3) results of our interviews with 37 current leaders of California organizations. We suggest that further understanding these initiatives, and success in the goals of the initiatives themselves, requires us to look past their similarities to examine their differences. These differences are related to the social forms and relations that have been established in the places from which these initiatives arise. 'Social justice,'. in particular, may be difficult to construct at a 'local' scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a tension regarding the potential of the alternative agro-food movement to create meaningful change. From one perspective, individual and organizational actors working to. change the dominant food system need to be engaged on a daily basis in political and social struggles and accomplish what is presently possible given existing opportunities and barriers. From an alternate view, such pragmatism is woefully inadequate for achieving the complete transformation of the food and agriculture system that many movement actors and academic analysts see as necessary. This paper examines some of the issues underlying this tension. It is argued that the "sustainability" of food and agriculture systems is understandably a contested concept because it inevitably involves both conflicts over values and,uncertainty about outcomes. These same characteristics make democracy the method of choice for the alternative agro-food movement, and this paper discusses the emerging concept of "food democracy" in order to elaborate upon its practical utility with respect to collective action. The existing alternative agro-food movement is the main source of the pressure to democratize the agro-food system. While the movement in the United States (and elsewhere) is very diverse in terms of organizational forms and strategies, there are important opportunities for developing coalitions among various groups. Lastly, food democracy is discussed as a pragmatic method for transforming the agro-food system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB The Florida Department of Education, with CDC funding, designed the Florida Coordinated School Health Program Pilot Schools Project (PSP) to encourage innovative approaches to promote coordinated school health programs (CSHP) in Florida schools. Each of eight pilot schools received $15,000 in projectfunding, three years of technical assistance including on-site and off-site assistance, a project office resource center, mailings of resource materials, needs assessment and evaluation assistance, and three PSP Summer Institutes. Project evaluators created a context evaluation, approaching each school independently as a "case study" to measure the school's progress in meeting goals established at baseline. Data were collected using the How Healthy is Your School? needs assessment instrument, a School Health Portfolio constructed by each school team, a Pilot Schools Project Team Member Survey instrument, midcourse team interviews, final team interviews, and performance indicator data obtained from pilot and control schools. The PSP posed two fundamental questions: "Can financial resources, professional training, and technical assistance enable individual schools to create and sustain a coordinated school health program?" and "What outcomes reasonably can one expect from a coordinated school health program, assuming programs receive adequate support over time?" First, activities at the eight schools confirmed that a coordinated school health programs can be established and sustained. Program strength and sustainability depend on long-term resources, qualified personnel, and administrative support. Second, though coordinated school health programs may improve school performance indicators, the PSP yielded insufficient evidence to support that belief. Future projects should include robust measurement and evaluation designs, thereby producing conclusive evidence about the influence of a coordinated school health program on such outcomes.

DT Article
AB It reviews the development of solar energy science and technology in India during last 40 y to a stage where India has one of the largest R&D and solar technology application program in the world touching every nook and corner of the country. Solar water heaters, box type cookers and home lighting systems using solar PV have become widely available at reasonable costs appropriate to them. Original lacunae of top down planning without participatory decision making of users, subsidy driven programs, lack of monitoring and preventive maintenance and non-application of the solar energy with a view to resource augmentation and equity, are now in the process of being eliminated. Emergence of considerations of pollution free clean development, global climate change and stress on creation of livelihoods vis-a-vis satisfaction of basic needs and requirements of quality in open marketing system rather than hands on indigenisation are the current stream in full force. The real solution will be somewhere in the middle for developing countries, where efficiency per unit cost of devices and systems and least capital cost of creating sustainable livelihoods will define the site specific recipes most effective to each situation. This has yet to happen. A technological shift has been from dreams of complete energy autonomy to hybridization and partial autonomy because, given the requirements of entrenched life styles in rich countries and aspirations of less developed countries, the former was economically not viable. Passive systems of building for climate tempering and solar PV integrated with buildings are taking shape now and will be the mainstream of immediate future. Also, briefly covered are the path breaking scientific advances of photochemical and microbial production of hydrogen, its storage and use in fuel cells which are in their initial stages, but are promising avenues. Since most of these technologies are proprietary, even at the risk of reinventing the wheel. India has to strike its own path. Direct solar, biomass based power generation and wind electric generation are immediate options; solar PV integrated with buildings along with hydrogen based fuel cells (hydrogen,being generated from (wastes/sea water by solar energy) are the solution for the next decade. Considerations of energy equity, security and quality along with non-administered realistic tariffs of oil and electricity provided by conventional means will take care of the economic and ecological options sooner than we expect.

TI The methanol story: A sustainable fuel for the future
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Development of vehicles that could operate on alternative fuels began in earnest as a response to the oil shocks of the 1970s. Of the various choices, methanol appeared to be the best candidate for long-term, widespread replacement of petroleum-based fuels. Initial support by the government was based on the desire for energy security, but the potential for improvement in air quality became an important driver as well. Experimental fleets of dedicated methanol vehicles did well in the field, but the lack of refueling infrastructure led to the development of the flexible fuel vehicle (FFV), a vehicle that could operate on either gasoline or methanol with only one fuel system on board. Legislation was put in place to encourage the auto industry to begin production, which started in 1993 for the M85 FFV at Ford. By the end of the decade, however, full production volumes had been transferred to the E85 FFV (gasoline or ethanol). The technical, economic and political reasons for this shift are emphasised and are discussed below, including visions for the future, and the direct methanol fuel cell.

AB A shallow moderate (M-s = 5.7) but damaging earthquake shook the region of Beni-Ourtilane located about 50 km NW of Setif and 390 km NE of Algiers (Central Eastern Algeria). The main shock caused the death of 2 peoples, injured 50 and caused sustainable damage to about 3000 housing units. The main shock was preceded by 2 foreshocks and followed by many aftershocks which lasted for many days. Analysis of historical seismicity including the localisation of epicenters, the trend of isoseismal maps of some historical events, the localisation of the November 10, 2000 main shock (M-s = 5.7) and the November 16, 2000 aftershock (M-s = 4.5) as well as the shape of the area of maximum intensity of the November 10, 2000 earthquake suggest that the Tachaouaft fault of 20 km of length is the activated geological structure. Although, there is no clear surface breaks associated with this earthquake, the localisation of geological disorders, such as ground fissures, during the Beni-Ourtilane earthquake, which are remarkably located near the fault, may have a tectonic meaning. Geomorphological analysis through Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) allowed us to identify a clear fault scarp related likely to strong earthquakes occurred in the past. Among geomorphological evidences of this active fault there are the uplift and tilt of alluvial terraces on the hanging wall and the diversion of the drainage pattern. Based on the quality of constructions and field observations an intensity I-0 = VII (MSK scale) is attributed to the epicentral area, which is striking NE-SW in agreement with the focal mechanism solution and the seismotectonic observations. In the other hand the amount of damage is due rather to the bad quality of constructions than to the severity of ground motion. The Tachaouaft fault with the Kherrata fault is the main source of seismic hazard in the Babors region.

ID SWINE MANURE APPLICATION; DRY-MATTER; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN
AB Proximity determines the feasibility of using animal manures in cash crop farming systems. However, sustainable farming practices balance nutrient inputs and outputs to minimize the buildup of potentially deleterious levels of soil nutrients. The objectives of our research were to determine the residual effect of dairy (Bos taurus) manure application to corn (Zea mays L.) on subsequent continuous soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] growth and seed yield at different plant densities under previous soil management regimes. The 3-year study was conducted on a Quakertown silt loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludult) at an upland New Jersey location. Soybean was planted at 371, 494, and 618,000 seeds ha(-1) and previous soil management treatments applied to corn from 1995-1998 were a control (no sidedress N or manure), sidedress N, manure, and manure plus sidedress N. Light interception, dry matter, and nitrogen accumulation at R1-R2 were poor predictors of seed yield. Seed yield in manure treatments was 48% greater than non-manure treatments in a dry year, the first residual year after manure application, but was similar or minimally greater in the two years with average precipitation. These data provide additional rationale to follow sustainable practices that distribute manure more evenly across landscapes to minimize buildup of excessive levels of soil nutrients.

ID MODEL
AB Rural livelihood in semiarid Tanzania is centred on subsistence agricultural production under conditions of a stochastic rainfall pattern and highly erodible soils. This paper draws data from 499 smallholder farmers in Dodoma region-central Tanzania, to study their adaptive efforts and the influences on agricultural productivity in this agro-ecological zone. Results show a significant relationship (p = 0.05 and p = 0.01) between variables explaining adaptive efforts and soil erosion. However, most of the variables were not significant in explaining variability in agricultural productivity. Therefore, the paper concludes that smallholders' livelihood strategies in semiarid Tanzania are not sustainable, as they tend to increase environmental decay through erosion without subsequent increase in agriculture productivity.

AB In 1989, 15 fallow species were planted on a degraded Alfisol in southwestern Nigeria, but only Pueraria phaseoloides, Senna siamea, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia leptocarpa and Acacia auriculiformis survived beyond 1993. After clearing different subplots of the fallowed plots in 1993 and 1995, intercropping of cassava + maize was practiced with level (minimum) and mound tillage. Nitrogen fertilizer, between 0 and 60 kg ha(-1), was also applied to subplots of natural regrowth where planted fallows did not survive. Although a maize grain yield of 2.3 t ha(-1) and a cassava root yield of 18.3 t ha(-1) were obtained with level tillage in 1995, grain yield was increased to 2.6 t ha(-1) and cassava yields to about 22 t ha(-1) by mounding and 60 kg N ha(-1) application. Effects of mounding and N application were pronounced in the second and third consecutive years of cropping. Planted tree fallows like S. siamea, A. leptocarpa and L. leucocephala were highly suitable for soil rehabilitation. For sustainable crop production in the second consecutive year of cropping after a 6-year fallow period, mound tillage was recommended while in the third year, mound tillage with 60 kg N ha(-1) was recommended.

ID TILLAGE
AB This study used the results of a 60-year simulation based on data from the Sustainable Agricultural Demonstration site at the USDA, ARS Beltsville Agriculture Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, to analyze tradeoffs between profitability and environmental stewardship. Six grain cropping systems included two no-tillage rotations with recommended fertilizer and herbicide inputs, two no-tillage rotations with winter annual cover crops and reduced herbicide and nitrogen inputs, and two reduced-tillage organic rotations. Economic analysis showed that highest gross margins were attained by a cover crop-based system with zero nitrogen inputs (CCZ). Risk analysis showed that the organic systems had lower profit variability across years and, therefore, would be most attractive to risk averse farmers. Both the cover crop-based systems and organic systems had low erosion risks and no risk of herbicide contamination so there were no profit versus erosion or herbicide tradeoffs amongst these systems. All systems had nitrogen runoff that exceeded threshold levels in at least two-thirds of the simulation years. In addition, systems that were lowest in nitrogen runoff were highest in phosphorus losses. This resulted in tradeoffs for risk neutral farmers between higher profitability along with higher nitrogen runoff for the CCZ system versus lower profitability along with lower nitrogen runoff for the organic systems. In contrast, for risk averse farmers, there would be a tradeoff between lower economic risk along with higher phosphorus loss in the organic systems versus higher economic risk along with lower phosphorus loss for the CCZ system. Thus, control of nutrient losses while maintaining profitable production levels represents a major challenge to the design of sustainable cropping systems.

AB The livestock feed balance of small farms in the Harar Highlands of eastern Ethiopia was studied during 1999-2000. The objective of the study was to examine the livestock feed resource and balance at the smallholder farm level, with the expectation that the outcome would also shed light on the possible use of livestock feed balance as a potential indicator to assess sustainability of Ethiopian small farms. Community level information on farm households was collected using semi-structured key informant interviews and field observations. Community level interviews revealed that farmers considered ability to meet livestock feed demand as one of the most important indicators of sustainability of their farms, and stressed that this ability varies with farms. A well-being instrument was developed on the basis of community level data to rank the households into poor (POR), medium (MDM), and well-to-do (WTD) categories. Detailed characterization of the households in the three categories was carried out by an in-depth case study of individual farms followed by a wider scale formal survey.
   The livestock feed balance was then estimated using dry matter requirement and availability as a proxy indicator. Case study revealed that MDM and WTD did not produce enough feed. Results of the formal survey were similar to the case study. Relative to the requirement, the mean feed balance values varied significantly with well-being categories (P < 0.001), and the mean value of POR (0.39 t DM/year) also differed significantly (P < 0.0 1) from the mean values of MDM (- 1.78 t DM/year) and WTD (- 4.09 t DM/year). POR, MDM and WTD produced on average 132.4%, 50.8% and 44. 1 % of the estimated dry matter feed requirement, respectively. Feed resources outside the farm appeared marginal to fill in the reported deficit in MDM and WTD. Yet livestock on those farms produce and reproduce with the existing feed supply levels, suggesting that the conventional estimation method used for the study could not reflect the reality, at least in MDM and WTD. Much remains to be known to better account the quantity and quality of feed resources both from and outside small farms, and to accurately determine the nutritional requirement of local breeds. As a result, estimating livestock feed balance of tropical small farms remains challenging and its potential use as a quick indicator of sustainability of smallholder tropical mixed farms appears limited.

AB In 1989, 15 fallow species were planted on a degraded Alfisol in southwestern Nigeria, but only Pueraria phaseoloides, Senna siamea, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia leptocarpa and Acacia auriculiformis survived beyond 1993. After clearing different subplots of the fallowed plots in 1993 and 1995, intercropping of cassava + maize was practiced with level (minimum) and mound tillage. Nitrogen fertilizer, between 0 and 60 kg ha(-1), was also applied to subplots of natural regrowth where planted fallows did not survive. Although a maize grain yield of 2.3 t ha(-1) and a cassava root yield of 18.3 t ha(-1) were obtained with level tillage in 1995, grain yield was increased to 2.6 t ha(-1) and cassava yields to about 22 t ha(-1) by mounding and 60 kg N ha(-1) application. Effects of mounding and N application were pronounced in the second and third consecutive years of cropping. Planted tree fallows like S. siamea, A. leptocarpa and L. leucocephala were highly suitable for soil rehabilitation. For sustainable crop production in the second consecutive year of cropping after a 6-year fallow period, mound tillage was recommended while in the third year, mound tillage with 60 kg N ha(-1) was recommended.

   Nigeria: A poultry-food crop integrated farming approach

AB A major reason given for the decline in per capita food production in Nigeria over the last two to three decades is the gradual decline in land productivity. Available information shows that in southern Nigeria, for example, there was recorded a consistent decline in yield per hectare of major food crops between 1995 and 2000. Evidence from the literature suggests that the main reason for this persistent decline in soil productivity is the perpetuation of unsustainable soil management practices by small food crop farmers that dominate the food production landscape in the country. This study therefore sets out to find out whether the adoption of a poultry based integrated food crop production system is economically viable in southern Nigeria. This is predicated by the fact that the environment in the southern part of Nigeria is well adapted for poultry production. Primary data was collected in Edo state, southern Nigeria, through a sample survey using a well structured questionnaire. A total of 94 poultry-based integrating farmers was selected using a combination of stratified and systematic random sampling procedure. A Linear Programming (LP) model was used to analyze and determine the optimal enterprise combination that maximizes the dual objectives subject to the production constraints of the small farms. The result shows that the dual objectives of maximizing Total Gross Margin (TGM) and simultaneously ensuring sustainable soil management practices was possible under full integration of poultry-food crop production. The results of the study suggest that a poultry-based integrated food crop production system, if given more attention by farmers and backed up by policy, may be an acceptable and feasible way of stemming the declining trend in soil productivity in southern Nigeria.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

DT Article

   viability and stability
AB During early 1997, after focus groups, interviews and a mail survey were administered to a random sample of Grand River watershed dairy farmer in the Grand River watershed of southwestern Ontario. This paper Summarizes the main results of the study. We concluded that these farmers have achieved a very good average quality of life. Their farming systems display good productivity, excellent viability and stability and moderate average environmental protection-all important elements of sustainability. This is mainly because they have steady incomes as a result of their supply managed system, excellent cattle genetics, strong family relationships and spirituality. If they had to leave their dairy farms they would miss the open space and country living more than anything else. There is some concern that international free trade agreements may threaten supply management to which the majority attribute their stable and reasonably good incomes. Environmental protection may also be at risk for many dairy farmers. For instance, their present manure management system is a limiting factor preventing as many as a third of them from expanding their herds in addition to such other barriers as the high price that they must pay for the milk quota that they must purchase.

AB The concept of socio-ecological resilience is applied to agricultural systems in general and to the farm level in particular. Resilience has three defining characteristics: the amount of change the system can undergo while maintaining its functions and structures, the degree of self-organization, and the capacity for learning and adaptation. To assess the resilience of a farming system, various elements that can build resilience are identified. Using these elements, the paper assesses organic agriculture using the IFOAM Basic Standard. The analysis shows that organic farming has a number of promising characteristics building resilience. However, when analyzing the current development of organic farming practice in light of the effects of government regulation and market dynamics, there is a danger that this quality is lost. Therefore, conversion alone may not be enough to ensure farm resilience. The ability of organic farming to realize its resilience building potential will depend on the ability of the organic movement to adapt and learn from the current experiences.

AB In 1989, 15 fallow species were planted on a degraded Alfisol in southwestern Nigeria, but only Pueraria phaseoloides, Senna siamea, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia leptocarpa and Acacia auriculiformis survived beyond 1993. After clearing different subplots of the fallowed plots in 1993 and 1995, intercropping of cassava + maize was practiced with level (minimum) and mound tillage. Nitrogen fertilizer, between 0 and 60 kg ha(-1), was also applied to subplots of natural regrowth where planted fallows did not survive. Although a maize grain yield of 2.3 t ha(-1) and a cassava root yield of 18.3 t ha(-1) were obtained with level tillage in 1995, grain yield was increased to 2.6 t ha(-1) and cassava yields to about 22 t ha(-1) by mounding and 60 kg N ha(-1) application. Effects of mounding and N application were pronounced in the second and third consecutive years of cropping. Planted tree fallows like S. siamea, A. leptocarpa and L. leucocephala were highly suitable for soil rehabilitation. For sustainable crop production in the second consecutive year of cropping after a 6-year fallow period, mound tillage was recommended while in the third year, mound tillage with 60 kg N ha(-1) was recommended.

AB We present a compelling rationale for defining agroecology as the ecology of food systems. Our purpose is to provide a framework that will guide research, education, and action in the multiple and interacting facets of an increasingly complex global agriculture and food system. To accomplish such goals, it is essential to build bridges and connections among and beyond our disciplines in production agriculture, as well as beyond the farm gate into the rural landscape and community. Fields of sociology, anthropology, environmental sciences, ethics, and economics are crucial to the mix. They provide additional vantage points from which we can view the food system anew, as well as insights on how to establish valuation criteria beyond neoclassical economics. Examples from Mexico, California, and the Nordic Region are used to illustrate the successful implementation of this educational strategy in universities. Design of individual farms using principles of ecology is expanded to the levels of landscape, community, and bioregion, with emphasis on uniqueness of place and the people and other species that inhabit that place. We conclude that defining agroecology as the ecology of food systems will foster the development of broader interdisciplinary research teams and attractive systems-based courses for tomorrow's best students. In contrast to the narrow focus on crop-soil interactions, this definition will help us raise higher-level research questions whose solutions will advance the development of a sustainable agriculture and food system.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

DE forage legumes; soil organic carbon; exchangeable cations; Nigeria
AB The Nigerian savanna soils are low in fertility, organic matter and cation exchange capacity. The traditional method of improving the fertility and productivity of soils of the savanna is through natural fallowing which typically takes three to five years. The method is no longer suitable for most farmers because of the rapid growth of Population in developing countries and the resulting intensive cultivation of agricultural land. In this study, a short fallow technique was adopted using forage legumes. Selected soil chemical properties were also evaluated. Incorporation of most of the legume residues significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil organic carbon more than control treatment especially when 5.0 t ha(-1) of organic matter is incorporated. The application rate of 5.0 t ha(-1) gave higher soil organic carbon content than the 2.5 t ha(-1) rates. However, the incorporation of maize stover and legume residue resulted in significantly higher soil organic carbon than the initial rate of 5.65 g kg(-1). Exchangeable cations were increased by the legume incorporation more than in the control. The impacts created by legume incorporation were mostly felt at the topsoil (0-15 cm). Adoption of the technology might be hindered by the fact that these legumes do not have immediate food grain benefit like the grain legumes (i.e., cowpea and lablab). The fallow legumes and food crops could be intercropped either simultaneously or in a relay pattern with cereal (maize or sorghum) to improve productivity of the land for sustainable food crop production.

AB In 1989, 15 fallow species were planted on a degraded Alfisol in southwestern Nigeria, but only Pueraria phaseoloides, Senna siamea, Leucaena leucocephala, Acacia leptocarpa and Acacia auriculiformis survived beyond 1993. After clearing different subplots of the fallowed plots in 1993 and 1995, intercropping of cassava + maize was practiced with level (minimum) and mound tillage. Nitrogen fertilizer, between 0 and 60 kg ha(-1), was also applied to subplots of natural regrowth where planted fallows did not survive. Although a maize grain yield of 2.3 t ha(-1) and a cassava root yield of 18.3 t ha(-1) were obtained with level tillage in 1995, grain yield was increased to 2.6 t ha(-1) and cassava yields to about 22 t ha(-1) by mounding and 60 kg N ha(-1) application. Effects of mounding and N application were pronounced in the second and third consecutive years of cropping. Planted tree fallows like S. siamea, A. leptocarpa and L. leucocephala were highly suitable for soil rehabilitation. For sustainable crop production in the second consecutive year of cropping after a 6-year fallow period, mound tillage was recommended while in the third year, mound tillage with 60 kg N ha(-1) was recommended.

AB Changes in the production of major food crops, available calories and protein for human consumption in Sierra Leone over a ten year period were studied. Estimates were made of nutrients taken up by harvested produce and present in crop residues. Plant sources provided 1,840 kcal/caput/day to 2,041 kcal/caput/day accounting for about 96% of total available calories. Rice, maize, millet, sorghum, cassava, sweet potato and groundnut provided a total of 1,084 kcal/caput/day to 1,305 kcal/caput/day. The difference between available calories and the minimum requirement in 1996 was 363 kcal/caput/day. Between 1987 and 1996 available calories from rice declined from 978 kcal/caput/day to 876 kcal/caput/day, while that from cassava increased from 90 kcal/caput/day to 205 kcal/caput/day. Rice was the most important supplier of proteins; it provided 16.4 g/caput/day to 18.9 g/caput/day. The data indicated that large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were removed by the crops from cultivated soils. Use of high yielding cassava and rice varieties with little or no fertilizers is a low input option that would bridge about 94% of the minimum energy gap. To minimize nutrient mining and completely fill the gap, these varieties would have to be used in conjunction with good soil management practices. (C) 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB Organic production systems are possible alternatives to current conventional dryland cropping systems in south western Australia, but they remain largely untested for their impact on crop production and soil fertility. The aims of this study were to compare wheat production levels of organic and conventionally managed fields, and relate outcomes to possible differences in soil fertility. Seven paired sites were compared over three years (1992-1994); the sites were paired to ensure similarity in soil types, crop history before conversion of the organic paddock from conventional to organic fanning, and at most sites, the farm manager of paired fields was the same. In years 1 to 2, there was no difference between the following soil chemical properties of the paired organic and conventionally managed fields: pH, electrical conductivity, mineral nitrogen (ammonium-N and nitrate-N), soil organic C, total P and lactate-extractable-P.
   Compared to the grain yield of the conventionally grown wheat, yield of the organically grown wheat was: increased at one site by 17%; decreased at three sites by an average of 27%, and not changed at another three sites. Several factors were considered to be most likely causes of the grain yield differences between the organic and conventional wheat: delayed sowing, lower nitrogen supply, and lower Colwell-extractable-P of the organic wheat. The key sustainability issue in the organically managed fields was P supply. In the organically managed fields, 3-10 kg P/ha/crop was removed from the wheat field and it is not currently being replaced. This is likely to eventually result in decreases in grain production due to P deficiency.

AB Many attempts, which were aimed at promoting Sustainable Agricultural Systems (SAS) in Sri Lanka failed due to poor acceptance by farmers. This situation still exists in spite of the formidable scientific evidence that supports the physical effectiveness of these systems to solve the respective problems. Factors that lead to poor acceptance of SAS by farmers can be broadly categorized as system specific factors and general factors that affect all systems commonly. This paper argues that although the general factors are less apparent, indirect, and difficult to recognize, they could be more important in Sri Lanka's case as the poor acceptance exists with many systems. The paper briefly discusses five such factors suggesting that major adjustments in the overall agriculture system are inevitable if the benefits of SAS are to be reaped by society. Such adjustments include strengthening of farmer participation at all levels; modification of research and extension systems and changing their priorities; proper land use and planning and screening of existing policies for their inconsistencies. Here, the challenge is to re-orient these policies and institutes to generate appropriate incentives, which will help to promote these systems among farmers. (C) 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

AB Enhancing the long-term sustainability in productivity of crops and cropping systems is directly related to maintenance of an adequate level of soil organic matter. Indian soils contain about 0.1 to 1% organic carbon. The maintenance of soil organic matter in agricultural soils, particularly of semiarid and subtropical regions of India, is generally governed by annual temperature, precipitation and many interacting factors such as soil types, tillage, application of fertilizers, quality and quantity of organics returned to soil, and the method of residue management. In India most residues used are as feed and fuel and one-third of crop residues is used as a source of organic matter. Continuous use of the same crops in the cropping system, unbalanced and inappropriate use of chemical fertilizer, and minimum or no use of organic matter year after year are a major constraints to soil organic carbon accumulation. Alternate land use systems, viz., agroforestry, agro-horticultural, agro-pastoral, and agro-silvipasture are more effective for soil organic matter restoration than monocropping systems. The constraints for organic matter management are reviewed, possible solution are presented, and future research needed are outlined. (C) 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Managed clinical networks (MCNs) are usually built on established groups of health professionals from both acute and primary care sectors. We have used videoconferencing to support the gynaecological oncology MCN in the west of Scotland. Videoconferencing was implemented simultaneously at five sites in 2001 and DICOM image-capture software was added in 2003. Videoconferencing and live PC links allowed the multidisciplinary teams to discuss individual cancer diagnoses without the extensive travelling previously required. Our experience of the implementation suggests that local ownership is crucial. In the present project, each of the stakeholders had an important role in the delivery of a successful system. High-quality project management is required during implementation and for some time thereafter to achieve sustainability.

AB We introduced an email teleneurology service for patients referred to a neurologist by general practitioners. Over 14 months, 76 referrals (of 75 patients) were received. To determine the sustainability of the service, we studied a second cohort of 76 consecutive patients referred after our first study. We also followed up the first cohort of patients to get information on longer-term safety. The second cohort was obtained in one month less than the first, and had similar characteristics in terms of age, sex and the time taken by the neurologist to reply to the general practitioner. It contained fewer patients requiring clinic appointments (34% versus 43%). Fewer patients from the second cohort were referred for second opinions (4 versus 10) and there were no resulting changes in diagnosis. Follow-up of the first cohort from a mean of 6 months to a mean of 23 months led to seven more re-referrals and no additional changes in diagnosis. We conclude that teleneurology by email is sustainable for this group of patients, and confirm that it is safe, effective and efficient.

TI A bit more to it: Scholarly communication forums as socio-technical
   interaction networks
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INFRASTRUCTURE; ECOLOGY
AB In this article, we examine the conceptual models that help us understand the development and sustainability of scholarly and professional communication forums on the Internet, such as conferences, pre-print servers, field-wide data sets, and collaboratories. We first present and document the information processing model that is implicitly advanced in most discussions about scholarly communications -the "Standard Model." Then we present an alternative model, one that considers information technologies as Socio-Technical Interaction Networks (STINs). STIN models provide a richer understanding of human behavior with online scholarly communications forums. They also help to further a more complete understanding of the conditions and activities that support the sustainability of these forums within a field than does the Standard Model. We illustrate the significance of STIN models with examples of scholarly communication forums drawn from the fields of high-energy physics, molecular biology, and information systems. The article also includes a method for modeling electronic forums as STINs.

ID COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGY
AB In knowledge economy, companies and organisations build sustainable competitive advantages not only relying on their internal intellectual capital but also on the intellectual capital of other companies, organisations and institutions and specifically on those of the cluster [ Porter, 1990a], microcluster or territory where the company is located. This kind of intellectual capital, basically external and of a relational nature is one of the main constituents of the networked organisation and ( will be called) from now on Social Capital [Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998] because it is embedded in the social fabric ( texture) of the nearby environment. SCBS ( Social Capital Benchmarking System) is both a new management method and a new management tool, that identifies, audits and benchmarks the resources and capabilities or the social capital, existing in alternative cluster locations that are necessary in order to develop the specific network organisation that each particular business model requires. The system has been successfully piloted in five European enterprises.

AB In recent years, there has been continued interest in prospects for the development and sustainability of both mixed-income and racially diverse communities. We examine an important contributor to racial and economic diversity and segregation-the geographic patterns of homebuyers. In particular, we examine the extent to which neighborhoods within the Chicago metropolitan area have obtained significant levels of income and racial diversity in home buying and maintained such diversity over the 1990s. We analyze the racial and income composition of homebuyers by census tract for two periods: 1993 to 1994 and 1999 to 2000. First, by comparing changes in home buying to 1990 to 2000 changes in cross-sectional census data, we find that changes in home-buying patterns are significant contributors to neighborhood racial change. We then find a significant decline in the proportion of whites buying into neighborhoods where nearly all buyers are white. The policy implications of our findings are described and discussed.

AB In the first half of the 20th century, harbor seal (Phoca vitulina richardsi) numbers were severely reduced in Washington state by a state-financed population control program. Seal numbers began to recover after the cessation of bounties in 1960 and passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) in 1972. From 1978 to 1999, aerial surveys were flown at midday low tides during pupping season to determine the distribution and abundance of harbor seals in Washington. We used exponential and generalized logistic models to examine population trends and size relative to maximum net productivity level (MNPL) and carrying capacity (K. Observed harbor seal abundance has increased 3-fold since 1978, and estimated abundance has increased 7 to 10-fold since 1970. Under National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) management, Washington harbor seals are divided into 2 stocks: coastal and inland waters. The observed population size for 1999 is very close to the predicted K for both stocks. The current management philosophy for marine mammals that assumes a density-dependent response in population growth with MNPL > K/2 is supported by growth of harbor seal stocks in Washington waters.

AB Loss of biodiversity is the single most important threat to the conservation and sustainable use of drylands in northern Ethiopia due to many centuries of cultivation and heavy livestock grazing pressure. The current study assessed the restoration of biodiversity in highly degraded areas in eastern Tigray, northern Ethiopia using area enclosures (AEs). The study assessed whether the differences in biodiversity between AEs and open management schemes and time of land abandonment influenced diversity of plant life forms (i.e. herbs, shrubs and trees). Changes in biodiversity were compared using the state-and-transition model. Management types and time since abandonment (hereafter called age) had a significant effect on herbaceous plant species abundance but not in shrub species, while site factors had a greater effect on diversity of plant life forms in general. Herbaceous species richness increased with age of restoration, reaching a maximum after three years of rest and declined thereafter, most probably as a result of hay harvesting and replacement of annual species by perennial grass species. Tree species richness increased gradually with age of land abandonment up to the maximum age of eight years. Four vegetation states and seven possible transitions that could guide management were identified. The vegetation states differed in terms of diversity of herbs and tree species but not those of shrubs. Promotion of tree species states will require longer periods of rest, while promotion of herbaceous species richness will need shorter periods. The state-and-transitional model could, therefore, be used to guide future management by promoting vegetation states that are desired by land users. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Irrigation developed indigenously has long been practised on the Western rift escarpment of the Kerio Valley in Kenya by the Marakwet people. Outsiders have often remarked on the problem of soil erosion, and suggested that the irrigation practices are unsustainable. This article discusses local and outside perceptions of soil erosion under irrigation, and their implications for assessing the sustainability of indigenous irrigation. It argues that erosion is taking place, but that local farmers do not perceive erosion as such as a critical challenge to their farming activities. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB This is an analysis of the relationships between changes in land use, land cover and socio-economic metabolism in Austria between 1950 and 1995, covering the period during which Austria's agriculture was industrialized. From 1950 to about 1980, Austria mainly strove to achieve self-sufficiency as an agricultural producer. This goal was met in the 1970s, largely through agricultural intensification. Since then, the primary focus of Austrian agricultural policy has been to reduce agricultural overproduction, to preserve the existing farm structure, as well as to keep as large an agricultural area under cultivation as is possible. As a consequence, since the 1980s, yields rose slowly and subsidized fallow covered substantial parts of cropland area. Austria joined the European Union in 1995, after which agricultural policy was, to a large extent, determined by the EU Common Agricultural Policy. From 1950 to 1995 we observe a continuous trend of declining cropland and grassland areas, increases in the areas of built-up and infrastructure land, and a slow increase in forested areas. The segregation of cropland cultivation and livestock husbandry leads to a concentration of cropland in fertile lowlands and of grasslands in the lower alpine regions from which crops are retreating. As a result of livestock being fed increasing amounts of cropland produce and imported protein feedstuffs, there was a disintegration of local nutrient cycles and a rising input of mineral fertilizer. We interpret these changes as a consequence of the massive input of fossil energy into Austria's agricultural system, which allowed a surge in the intensification of transport. We analyze these trends using GIS maps based upon statistic data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphorous (P) is the first non renewable resource which is becoming scarce in less than 100 years. Thus it is vital for sustainable agriculture to develop strategies and measures to close anthropogenic P cycles. In this context agriculture has to strive for a total utilisation of the P employed in production. At a recent crop production level, 560.10(3) t yr(-1) P is removed from German soils by plant products. The paper presents a model to describe the utilisation of fertiliser nutrients with special regard to P. Provided that only water soluble (or in some cases citric acid soluble) P is used on physical, chemical and biological intact soils and within infinite time, a fully utilisation of the P applied can be expected. In organic farming easily soluble P forms are banned, but with phosphates of low solubility which do not enter the site-specific P cycle, even within infinite time a full utilisation can not be expected. Under the restrictions of a balanced fertilisation where fertiliser inputs shall not exceed the amount of P removed, organic fanning easily may drift into nutrient mining, diminishing soil fertiity and sustainability of production. A possible way out of this dilemma offers the concept of "in situ digestion" where low soluble forms of P (rock phosphates or meat/bone ashes) are granulated with elemental sulphur and the release of sulphuric acid during microbial sulfoxidation transforms low into easy soluble P forms. This concept enables the realisation of balanced P fertilisation in organic farming, too.

AB In urbanising landscapes, planning for sustainable biodiversity occurs in a context of multifunctional land use. Important conditions for species persistence are habitat quality, the amount and configuration of habitat and the permeability of the landscape matrix. For planning purposes, these determinants should be integrated into simple indicators for spatial conditions of persistence probability. We propose a framework of three related indices. The cohesion index is based on the ecology of metapopulations in a habitat network. We discuss how an indicator for species persistence in such a network could be developed. To translate this network index into an area index, we propose the concept of spatial cohesion. Habitat cohesion and spatial cohesion are defined and measured for single species or, at best, for species profiles. Since species differ in their perception of the same landscape, different species will rate different values of these indices for the same landscape. Because landscapes are rarely planned for single species, we further propose the index of landscape cohesion, which integrates the spatial cohesion indices of different species. Indices based on these concepts can be built into GIS tools for landscape assessment. We illustrate different applications of these indices, and emphasise the distinction between ecological and political decisions in developing and applying such tools.

AB The historical range of variability (HRV) has been suggested as a coarse filter approach to maintain ecosystem sustainability and resiliency. The historical range of variability in forest age structure for the central eastern Cascade Range in Washington State, USA was developed from historical fire return intervals and the manner in which fire acted as both cyclic and stochastic processes. The proportions of seven forest structural stages calculated through these processes were applied to the area of each forest series within the central eastern Cascades landscape. Early successional forest stages were more common in high elevation forest than low elevation forest. The historical proportion of old growth and late successional forest varied from 38 to 63 percent of the forested landscape. These process-based estimates are consistent with those developed from forest structural information. HRV is a valuable planning tool for ecosystem conservation purposes, but must be applied to real landscapes with consideration of both temporal and spatial scale.

AB This paper describes an ultrasonic on-line sensor for monitoring molten magnesium (Mg). This sensor provides high spatial resolution measurements in molten Mg in a pulse-echo mode. The developed sensor mainly consists of a conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer and a clad buffer rod as a probe. The martensitic stainless steel (JIS type, SUS410) is chosen as material for the buffer rod so that the rod can sustain an adverse condition in molten Mg. The performance of the sensor, the wave propagation characteristic and the rod sustainability for long time operating time, have been evaluated experimentally. The possible reaction between the developed sensor and liquid Mg has been discussed. Based on such preliminary investigation, an experiment in molten Mg at temperature 973 K has been carried out. Ultrasonic signals from a steel object immersed in molten Mg are clearly observed using the developed sensor at 5 MHz.

SO MAN IN INDIA
LA English
DT Article
AB People in the Garhwal Himalayas celebrate a number of religious Yatras (procession), out of which Nanda Raj-Jat is one of the most ancient, important and perhaps the longest one, passing through high altitudes (more than 17,500-ft. amsl). This Yatra is a manifestation of local faith and belief into a close mythological relationship between man, nature, Gods and Goddesses. Apart from being a peculiar tradition, this celebration is a way of paying due regards to the mother nature by the local communities and the practice is maintained by the firm belief and faith in some Superpower that blesses them to sustain life in harsh geo-climatic conditions. The long journey is full of rituals and ceremonies celebrate by the people the journey passes through a number of settlements / villages where apart from the villagers, the village deities too participate in the journey & celebrations. Nanda Raj-Jat apart from religious connotations also provides economic support to the locals. It has a great potential to offer additional livelihood to the rural unemployed youth through eco-tourism, pilgrimage and adventure tourism.

DE assessment model; fishery impact; growth; maximum sustainable yield;

AB In the Pacific, blue marlin are an incidental catch of longline fisheries and an important resource for big game recreational fishing. Over the past two decades, blue marlin assessments by different techniques have yielded results ranging from an indication of declining stock to a state of sustained yield at approximately the maximum average level. Longline fishing practices have changed over the years since the 1950s in response to changes in principal target species and to gear developments. Despite increasingly sophisticated attempts to standardize fishing effort with changing fishing practices, the stock assessments to date are likely confounded to a greater or lesser degree by changes in catchability for blue marlin. Yet, only data from commercial longline fisheries targeting tuna provide sufficient spatial and temporal coverage to allow assessment of this resource. To re-assess the blue marlin stocks in the Pacific and also to assess the efficacy of a habitat-based standardization of longline effort, a collaborative analysis was conducted involving scientists at the National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries, Shimizu, Japan, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, La Jolla, California, and the NOAA Fisheries Honolulu Laboratory, Honolulu, Hawaii. Using MULTIFAN-CL as an assessment tool, there was considerable uncertainty in quantifying the fishing effort levels that would produce a maximum sustainable yield. However, it was found that, at worst, blue marlin in the Pacific are close to a fully exploited state, that is the population and the fishery are somewhere near the top of the yield curve. Furthermore, it was found that effort standardization using a habitat-based model allowed estimation of parameters within reasonable bounds and with reduced confidence intervals about those values.

TI Managing Atlantic marlin as bycatch under ICCAT. The fork in the road:
   recovery or collapse
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT 3rd International Billfish Symposium
CY AUG 19-23, 2001
CL CAIRNS, AUSTRALIA
DE time and area closures
AB Atlantic billfish (marlin, sailfish and spearfish) are managed under the jurisdiction of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Because they are not commonly a target species, most fishing mortality is generated as a function of bycatch in various commercial fisheries. Billfish are very important species for recreational fisheries. The record indicates that ICCAT has placed its greatest emphasis on managing target fish to maximize their catch for 'food purposes' and has not placed the same level of emphasis on maximizing catch for 'other purposes', such as for the benefit of recreational fisheries.
   Stock assessments indicate Atlantic marlin are severely overexploited, with the rates of decline showing no signs of slowing. The primary source of billfish mortality is as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries for tuna and swordfish. Simultaneous fishing mortality rates that will produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for at least one targeted tuna species is near the extinction rate for blue marlin. Failure to significantly reduce fishing mortality on marlin by restraining effort on target species has led to the collapse of both blue and white marlin stocks and, if continued indefinitely, may lead to extinction of either species. Although ICCAT's charter does not prioritize management between different types of fisheries, commercial or recreational, or among different species of fish within its authority, the de facto result of ICCAT's actions to date has relegated billfish to the role of bycatch species. The needs of the directed recreational billfish industry have been largely ignored.
   In the absence of responsible action by ICCAT to reduce fishing mortality on marlin, those concerned with the conservation of billfish will be forced to seek alternative conservation and management assistance through The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and other protected species options. Compatible management solutions now must be identified and implemented by ICCAT if diverse fishing interests are to coexist and the stocks are to return to MSY. Time and area closures and live releases, coupled with some restraints on targeted effort, may offer a solution most acceptable to all fishing interests.

AB Much is known in very broad terms about the distribution of deep-sea fishes, but information on fine-scale habitat selection and behaviour in the largest living space on earth is still rare. Based on video sequences from 4 dives performed with the manned submersible 'Nautile' at depths between 400 and 2000 in in the Bay of Biscay, NE Atlantic, we studied the behaviour of co-occurring slope-dwelling deep-sea fishes. Five different habitats were identified according to depth range or topographical and hydrological characteristics. For each fish species or genus that could be identified, estimates of absolute abundance were provided. The most frequently occurring species, round-nose grenadier Coryphaenoides rupestris, blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus, bluemouth Helicolenus dactylopterus dactylopterus, orange roughy Hoplostethus atlanticus, North Atlantic codling Lepidion eques, greater forkbeard Phycis blennoides, and northern cutthroat eel Synapho-branchus kaupi were quantitatively compared with respect to the relative frequencies of disturbance responses to the submersible, locomotion behaviour, and vertical positioning above the bottom. Clear variations in behaviour and abundance among species and habitats were found, reflecting both species-specific and flexible adjustment to small-scale spatial and temporal variability on the Bay of Biscay continental slope. These results have important implications for the development of sustainable deep-water fisheries management.

AB The main purpose of this study is to show how the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methodology can be applied to prepare and facilitate desired changes which the fishery sector with its stakeholders face. This is shown by an application of the AHP methodology in the shrimp fishery sector in Trinidad and Tobago. Moreover, the AHP is assessed for its capacity to support decision-making in countries which are initiating or continuing transition to more responsible and sustainable fisheries management. The AHP was found to be an "empowering, educating, focusing, facilitating and quantifying tool", with potential to more generally support fisheries management also in the future.

AB The article analyses trade and investment effects on Pacific island marine resources. Increasing fishing effort and new technology appears to be depleting a major tuna species. There are also repercussions of globalisation on the sustainability of vital inshore marine resources. If the incidence of El Nino events increases as a result of global warming then the national economies of some small island states will be impacted. In the long-term an ocean level rise will put small island and low atoll nations at risk. The article concludes by suggesting roles for aid in mitigating globalisation impacts.

AB The purpose of this investigation is to study structure, evolution and present ecological state of background and anthropogenically modified landscapes of the Abrau Peninsula. This region has been recommended as one of the main conservation sites on the Russian Black Sea coast due to its relatively low anthropogenic transformation and its historical importance. The ecological situation is aggravated today by the construction of a pipe-line and oil terminal near Novorossiysk and by an increase in unregulated recreation activity within the peninsula's narrow coastal zone. A special landscape-ecological map has been compiled for the model area. All ecosystems shown on the map can be grouped into four main categories based on changes of landscape structure resulting from direct impact of human activity and indirect impact mainly from chemical pollution. Ecosystems exhibiting a high degree of transformation are more typical for regions characterized by settlements, vineyards and the coastal recreation zone. Ecosystems with moderate changes also exist in the coastal area, including, for example, some unique ecosystems with pine-tree forests, pistachio-juniper and juniper open-lands. Nearly 50% of pine-tree (Pinus pithyusa) forests are in the fourth and fifth stages of recreation degradation. Some protection measures are suggested to maintain biodiversity and sustainable development of these coastal landscapes and to improve their current condition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Marine fish farming is an important commercial practice in Hong Kong. Marine fish farms located in eutrophic coastal waters often face the threat of severe dissolved oxygen depletion associated with algal blooms and red tides. On the other hand, mariculture activities also contribute to pollution. The sustainable management of mariculture requires proper siting of the fish farms and stocking density control. Both of these are related to the carrying capacity of the water body concerned, which is mainly governed by its flushing characteristics. A simple method to determine the carrying capacity of a fish farm has been developed by using three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic modelling and its effective coupling with a diagenetic water quality model.
   A systematic methodology using numerical tracer experiments has been developed to compute the tidal flushing in a fish farm. The flushing time is determined from the results of a numerical tracer experiment using robust 3D hydrodynamic and mass transport models. A unit tracer concentration is initially prescribed inside the region of interest and zero elsewhere; the subsequent mass transport and the mass removal process are then tracked. The fish farms are usually situated in well-sheltered shallow embayments and may not connect directly to the open water. It is found that it is necessary to define both "local" and "system-wide" flushing times to represent the effectiveness of the mass exchange with the surrounding water body and the open sea respectively. A diagenetic water quality model simulating the sediment-water-pollutant interaction is employed to address the response of the water column and the benthic layer to pollution discharges. With the flushing rate reliably computed, the carrying capacity of the fish farm can be determined in terms of key water quality parameters: chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, organic nitrogen and potential lowest dissolved oxygen level on a day of negligible photosynthetic production. The predictions are well-supported by field data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE sustainable development; integrated water resources management; decision
   support system
AB Over recent decades, population expansion, deforestation, land conversion, urbanisation, intense fisheries and industrialisation have produced massive changes in the Laguna de Bay catchment, Philippines. The resulting problems include rapid siltation of the lake, eutrophication, inputs of toxics, flooding problems and loss of biodiversity. Rational and systematic resolution of conflicting water use and water allocation interests is now urgently needed in order to ensure sustainable use of the water resources. With respect to the competing and conflicting pressures on the water resources, the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) needs to achieve comprehensive management and development of the area. In view of these problems and needs, the Government of the Netherlands was funding a two-year project entitled 'Sustainable Development of the Laguna de Bay Environment'.
   A comprehensive tool has been developed to support decision-making at catchment level. This consists of an ArcView GIS-database linked to a state-of-the-art modelling suite, including hydrological and waste load models for the catchment area and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model (Delft3D) linked to a habitat evaluation module for the lake. In addition, MS Office based tools to support a stakeholder analysis and financial and economic assessments have been developed. The project also focused on technical studies relating to dredging, drinking water supply and infrastructure works. These aimed to produce technically and economically feasible solutions to water quantity and quality problems. The paper also presents the findings of a study on the development of polder islands in the Laguna de Bay, addressing the water quantity and quality problems and focusing on the application of the decision support system.

AB The Gulf of Guinea is situated in the narrow protrusion of eastern Equatorial Atlantic between latitudes 2degreesS and 5degreesN and longitudes 8degreesW to 12degreesE, spanning a coastline length of approximately 130 nautical miles. The dominant feature of this shallow ocean off the coast of countries in Western Africa is the Guinea Current. The distinctive bathymetry, hydrography, productivity and trophodynamics of this shallow ocean qualify it as a large marine ecosystem (LME) and is indeed recognized as the number 28 of the 64 delineated LMEs globally. This area is one of the world's productive marine areas that is rich in fishery resources, oil and gas reserves, precious minerals and an important global reservoir of marine biological diversity. Unfortunately, pollution from residential and industrial sources has affected the waters of the Gulf of Guinea resulting in habitat degradation, loss of biological diversity and productivity, and degenerating human health. In reversing this trend of marine environmental degradation, the countries of the region adopted an integrated and holistic approach using the LME concept to sustainably manage the environmental and living resources of the region. The concept is predicated on the fact that marine environmental pollution and living resources respect no political or geographical boundaries and so require a holistic and regional approach for its management. The Gulf of Guinea countries through the Global Environment facility funded regional/communal project on water pollution control and biodiversity conservation achieved a paradigm shift in living resources and environmental management in the region using the LME concept.

   Sundarbans; India; environmental education; public awareness
AB The Indian Sundarbans, a diversified coastal wetland on the southern fringe of the State of West Bengal, harbors a luxuriant biodiversity and acts as a potential refuge of living marine resources. Girdled with thick mangrove foliage, this estuarine delta system offers an excellent nursery ground for most of the brackishwater finfish and shellfish. Since supply of hatchery-produced tiger prawn seed (Penaeus monodon) is highly inadequate in West Bengal, the aquaculture farms of this region largely depend on the supply from natural resources. Being motivated by a regular cash income, the majority of coastal people from Sundarbans have adopted prawn seed collection as their profession almost throughout the year as an important source of earning. The users are neither trained nor guided at any stage from collection to marketing and are fully dependent on traditional methods. They first sort out the tiger prawn seeds (mainly the postlarval stage PL 20) accounting only 0.25-0.27% of the total catch and thereafter the major portion of the haul are thrown away on the beach flats or the tidal mudflats. This wasted by-catch contains the juveniles of economic and uneconomic varieties of finfish and shellfish along with a bulk of holoplankters and meroplankters (non-target species). This practice causes several ecological and occupational consequences, namely, (i) the huge destruction of the pelagic biota that can lead to severe stock depletion as well as hamper the energy transference through the marine ecosystem food webs; (ii) constant dragging of nets along the coast and tidal creeks paves the way for soil erosion, uprooting the mangrove seedlings and saltmarsh vegetation; (iii) the water quality is deteriorating in the catchment areas due to mud erosion and (iv) due to constant contact with the seawater, the collectors are affected with waterborne diseases, skin infections, reproductive tract disease in women and many other contagious diseases.
   This paper, in addition to identifying the challenge to environmental quality and resource abundance, emphasizes the need for grass-root public education so that local people come to understand, support and implement sustainable resource conservation and environmental protection activities now and in the future. As a follow-up course of action, the authors have initiated a general awareness program for developing consciousness among the coastal people regarding proper use of natural resources. Initiatives are taken for educating coastal people by holding workshops and seminars with the use of educational resource materials. Exclusive awareness camps and grass root level training for coastal people are also being proposed as a future course of action by means of exhibitions, audiovisuals etc. It is proposed that local government bodies come forward to mitigate this problem with scientific and rational approaches and to take proper actions towards conservation.

DE UNESCO; awareness building; Asia-Pacific; world heritage site; biosphere

AB UNESCO is one of the specialized agencies under the United Nations charged with the advancement and improvement of education, social and natural sciences, culture and communication. This global mandate translates into programmes in the field tailored to the member states' specific requirements that build on the full breadth of expertise available in UNESCO.
   Environmental awareness building is an integral component of many of UNESCO's programmes. This paper describes how UNESCO addresses the need for awareness building in a variety of settings under different programmes and sectors.
   A first example is taken from the work of the education sector, which aims at introducing innovative learning methods and curricula that change or cultivate the perspective of people of all ages on sustainable development.
   The second example is taken from the Man and Biosphere Programme. The Biosphere Reserve concept has had a long history within UNESCO and is increasingly applied to protected areas in the coastal zone. Notable examples are Ranong Biosphere Reserve in Thailand, Can Gio Biosphere Reserve in Vietnam and the Island of Palawan in the Philippines. The concept is currently experiencing a revival as more and more countries realize the importance of striking a balance between human development and strict conservation.
   Many people know about UNESCO through the so-called World Heritage Sites. These are sites that are recognized by the world community as particular monuments, either natural or cultural, that warrant preservation for the whole of mankind. In the Asia-Pacific region, there are quite a number of coastal and marine sites that have been designated as natural world heritage sites, e.g. Halong Bay in Vietnam, the Komodo marine national park, Indonesia, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, East-Rennell Island in the Solomon Islands, and Tubbataha Reef in the Philippines.
   The need for a cross-sectoral approach is evident under the so-called Coastal Zone and Small Islands endeavour, which aims at assisting Member States towards environmentally sound, socially equitable and culturally appropriate development in coastal regions and in small islands. Four examples of current pilot projects (Surin Island, Thailand, Jakarta Bay, Indonesia, Upolo Island, Samoa and Ulugan Bay, the Philippines) are highlighted.
   Each setting and each audience requires a different strategy. UNESCO's strength is to learn from all these experiences and make such new insights universally available and to put novel concepts into practice. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The problem of determining whether the biodiversity of an impacted muddy seabed is recovering can be resolved by drawing on a concept termed "sustainable ecological succession". At a site impacted by discharge of mine tailings, a suite of similar to6 primary opportunist species (mostly polychaete worms) had started to sustain itself within 1-2 years after discharge ceased (1995), within the mix of 100+ other species which were not sustaining themselves. The start of a sustaining ecological succession is easily measurable by repeat surveys, and requires only the services of one taxonomic identifier to demonstrate the consistent presence and numbers of a limited range of species. At the assessed site, by 2000, some secondary opportunist species had entered the succession, and the species richness of the impacted area had come to equal that of the reference areas.

AB Improved maize yields under low nitrogen (N) fertility is desired for both low-input production systems and also for judicious application of fertilizer nitrogen for a sustainable and environment friendly production systems, A key question in breeding for tolerance to low-N fertility is to what extent the performance of maize hybrids can be predicted on the basis of performance of their inbred lines under low-N supply. Past studies showed varied degree of correlations between line and hybrid performance under low-N fertility, ranging front weak to fairly strong relationship. We attempted to examine the impact of low-N supply on relationship between morpho-physiological traits and grain yield measured on inbred parents, all advance generation lines, and their single cross progenies. Reactions of various morpho-physiological traits, except days to anthesis (male flowering), differ significantly at low- and optimal level of N-fertility. superiority of hybrid progenies over parental lines declined under low-N stress, which indicates that hybrids were comparatively more affected than lines due to low-N supply. Data on individual contributions of heterosis and performance of mid-parent showed that per se performance of lines was relatively more important factor in determining the hybrid performance under both the levels of N-supply. Correlations between various secondary traits and grain yield under both low and optimal-N fertility were moderate to strong in case of both parental lines and hybrids. However, it was comparatively stronger in case of hybrid progenies under low-N stress. Correlations between morpho-physiological traits of lines and hybrids, except for car rots, were fairly strong and significant under both the level of N supply. The relationship between grain yield of mid-parent and hybrids was comparatively stronger under low-N fertility. Our findings suggest that performance of hybrid progenies under low-N fertility can be predicted to some extent on the basis of advance generation elite inbred parents with proven performance across N-supply.

AB Tropical highland cereal cropping systems face shortages of nitrogen fertilizers, Which reduce Yields. Intercropping cereals with food or green manure legumes is recommended for enhancing the supply of nitrogen to the cereal. However, Most studies Oil the benefits of intercropping legumes with cereals are reported from the drier regions and those too with only food legumes. A field study was undertaken for three consecutive years to ascertain the impact of intercropping maize (Zea mays L) With either a food legume (Phaseolus beans - Phaseolus vulgaris L) or a green manure (sunhemp) - (Crotolaria juncea L.) in a rainfed minor season of the humid tropics. The legumes Were intercropped with maize at the Onset of rains and the biomass incorporated after the harvest of pools (beans) or at lowering (sunhemp), which corresponded to the time of silking in maize. After the harvest Of maize, the plots were planted with I monocrop of maize in the major season. The same treatments were planted in the same plots in the following minor season. This process was repeated over three years to encompass three minor seasons.
   Intercropping Of legumes increased germination of the cereal Over the seasons. More importantly, the incorporation Of the legume residues increased maize Shoot biomass over time. Yields of maize intercropped with beans were similar to the monoculture, in the first season and were significantly higher in the third season. Intercropping with Crotolaria produced lower yields than the monocultures, but the differences reduced significantly cover dine. Incorporation of the legumes reduced the nitrogen Use efficiency, thus illustrating a lower mining effect, in contrast to the maize monoculture, which had a higher nitrogen Uptake. Hence, the use of a green manure, especially, short-term food legumes such as beans, which provides an economic harvest, is a viable alternative to monocropping systems of maize commonly adopted in the minor seasons Of the humid tropics, When evapotransipiration exceeds rainfall. The prospects of producing maize in these minor seasons while developing sustainable systems over time is presented on the basis of this three-year field study.

AB BACKGROUND. In developing a conceptual framework for the design of a national quality measurement and reporting system (NQMRS), the Strategic Framework Board (SFB) recommends that such a system be built on a strong evidence base.
   OBJECTIVES. To identify critical gaps in the evidence needed for a fully functional NQMRS and to recommend a starting point for the development of a research agenda.
   RESEARCH DESIGN. Selective review of literature in quality of care measurement and reporting and identification of strategic issues that must be addressed.
   FINDINGS. There is some limited evidence that measurement and reporting can improve quality. Substantial advances have been made in the science of measurement and reporting but important gaps remain, specifically in (1) measurement methods and tools, (2) uses of quality performance data, (3) organizational and cultural factors, (4) information and informatics, and (5) impact evaluation/research.
   CONCLUSIONS. To achieve a sustainable research agenda, three strategic issues will have to be addressed: (1) the policy rationale for the research agenda, (2) adequate levels of public-sector funding, and (3) sustainability in a rapidly changing environment.

TI Reflective critique and collaborative practice in evaluation: promoting
   change in medical education
SO MEDICAL TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
AB The School of Medicine at the University of Tasmania has recently begun to implement a process of curriculum evaluation, which aims to reflect contemporary best practice in evaluation in tertiary pedagogy and medical education. Best practice must m-commodate a broadening interest in cooperative and col(aborative evaluation strategies among stakeholders, advances in applied qualitative educational research and recognition that critical reflection on practice is the cornerstone of professional education. This paper reports a recent evaluation strategy in a specific yearlong unit in the second year of a six-year undergraduate medical degree. The paper begins by presenting the context; it then discusses and rationalises the evaluation strategy and presents findings. The paper concludes by arguing that curriculum evaluation as best practice must be reflective, informed by the scholarship of medical education, and internalized as a dynamic process that can promote sustainable change and improvement in medical curricula. Such an approach will contribute to an undergraduate medical curriculum that prepares students for the demands and complexities of medical practice.

TI A definition of "sustainability" based on entropy production by matter
   and energy
SO METALL
LA English

CT Recycling Recovery Re-integration (R 02)
CY FEB, 2002
CL GENEVA, SWITZERLAND
AB Entropy is the quantitative measure for any type of disorder - of energy, matter, information, but also in the structure of economical or legal systems, and social behaviour. Sustainability implies minimising the increase of certain aspects of entropy, or even locally reducing it. Sustainable behaviour or development is therefore related to entropy efficiency (second law efficiency).
   This in turn is useful for the analysis and evaluation of natural or technological life cycles. The latter deal with the transformation of matter, starting with the (primary) raw material and ending with scrap from which, hopefully, secondary raw material is obtained. Purpose of the six stage transformation of matter is the production of useful goods and services for mankind. For a meaningful analysis entropy balances have to be summed up for the individual stages. Energy balances are not sufficient for a critical analysis and comparison, for example of sources for renewable energy, or beverage containers, because a dispersion of matter is not included.
   A phenomenon which is counteracting sustainability is the general tendency (second law) of nature and technology to increase entropy production, for example by growth of the human population, by air plane traffic, or by mass production of goods of lesser usefulness and durability. The entropy production and consequently sustainable development is controlled by physical properties. The upper limits of its rate are, however, to a very large extent at the discretion of mankind.
   The concept of sustainability based on the rate of entropy production appears to be useful as foundation for a science of recycling as well as for an environmental ethics.

TI Rethinking the nation-state from the frontier
SO MILLENNIUM-JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The former frontiers of the European empires, and the British Empire in particular, pose significant challenges for the study of the nation-state. I argue that countries such as Sudan and Somalia are not simply struggling to be states (the 'failed state' thesis), but are struggling with the very concept of statehood as understood in the contemporary world. This concept views the state as a hermetically sealed geographic container in which sovereign power is exercised by an extensive central government. Stable administration and sustainable development in,frontier regions - generally agreed to be a precondition for improved global security as well as desirable on humanitarian grounds - may require moving beyond this. view and rethinking the preconditions for successful state-building. Ideas of radical decentralisation, confederation and porous borders may provide an opportunity for exploring not just new modes of governance on the frontier but the applicability of such thinking to the state system more broadly.

AB Rural space in Austria's Spatial Development Concept 2001.
   The work process for the third Austrian Spatial Development Concept ("OREK") concerning rural development was based on an "incentive paper" presenting actual problems of spatial structures, targets of spatial planning and possibilities for their realisation. At first the study discusses goals and tasks concerning rural space "post Cork" (and since November 14, 2003 "post Salzburg") and elaborates the actual spectrum of rural interests in the light of basic principles of modern development planning. In that context, it does not suffice to consider "sustainability" and "multifunctionality", both of which are well-known catchwords in development policy. The actual difficulties and obstacles of spatial planning in rural areas form the central part of the study. They result from a polymorphic structural dilemma and manifest themselves in various fields of conflict due to manifold sharply divers interests. Moreover the paper is dealing with more concrete conceptions and planning examples for rural areas. Whether existential and developmental problems of rural areas can be solved - and if so, for how long time - or not is a question to be answered in different ways by idealists and realists.

AB The conservation and utilization of biological diversity requires comprehensive knowledge of the biodiversity with respect to their quality and distribution so as to strike a balance between usage and renewal patterns. Increased anthropogenic interventions into. the natural landscape have carved out separate niche in the biosphere by modifying the ecosystems drastically. In the process we have been loosing biodivenity at faster rate than expected. Hence, sustainable management of our biological resources has become key issue for survival of planet earth. Space has provided holistic view to the planet earth. The satellite remote sensing has enabled to map and monitor vegetation resources in varying scale and time. The geographic information system enables to organize the data sets for analysis and decision making process. India has Made significant efforts to build state of art satellite systems and develop applications to manage the natural resources.' Forest vegetation mapping and biodiversity characterisation at landscape level using satellite remote sensing technology is already an operational tool. Under a national scientific initiative India has developed comprehensive data base on vegetation types, fragmentation, disturbance regimes and biological richness at landscape level in the important ecoregions of the country. This has been achieved by integrating the geospatial information on biological, physical, environmental, social and knowledge base. Remote sensing from space has facilitated systematic and hierarchical approach of biodiversity assessment and its monitoring. Hence biodiversity conservation strategy must include the information for defining the action.

ID ARDECHE RIVER; EVENTS
AB Interdisciplinary frameworks for studying natural hazards and their temporal trends have an important potential in data generation for risk assessment, land use planning, and therefore the sustainable management of resources. This paper focuses on the adjustments required because of the wide variety of scientific fields involved in the reconstruction and characterisation of flood events for the past 1000 years. The aim of this paper is to describe various methodological aspects of the study of flood events in their historical dimension, including the critical evaluation of old documentary and instrumental sources, flood-event classification and hydraulic modelling, and homogeneity and quality control tests. Standardized criteria for flood classification have been defined and applied to the Isere and Drac floods in France, from 1600 to 1950, and to the Ter, the Llobregat and the Segre floods, in Spain, from 1300 to 1980.
   The analysis on the Drac and Isere data series from 1600 to the present day showed that extraordinary and catastrophic floods were not distributed uniformly in time. However, the largest floods (general catastrophic floods) were homogeneously distributed in time within the period 1600-1900. No major flood occurred during the 20th century in these rivers. From 1300 to the present day, no homogeneous behaviour was observed for extraordinary floods in the Spanish rivers. The largest floods were uniformly distributed in time within the period 1300-1900, for the Segre and Ter rivers.

AB The Earth Simulator, developed by the Japanese government's initiative "Earth Simulator Project," is a highly parallel vector supercomputer system that consists of 640 processor nodes and interconnection network. The processor node is a shared memory parallel vector supercomputer, in which 8 vector processors that can deliver 8GFLOPS are tightly connected to a shared memory with a peak performance of 64GFLOPS. The interconnection network is a huge non-blocking crossbar switch linking 640 processor nodes and supports for global addressing and synchronization. The aggregate peak vector performance of the Earth Simulator is 40TFLOPS, and the intercommunication bandwidth between every two processor nodes is 12.3GB/s in each direction. The aggregate switching capacity of the interconnection network is 7.87TB/s. To realize a high-performance and high-efficiency computer system, three architectural features are applied in the Earth Simulator; vector processor, shared-memory and high-bandwidth non-blocking interconnection crossbar network. The Earth Simulator achieved 35.86TFLOPS, or 87.5% of peak performance of the system, in LINPACK benchmark, and has been proven as the most powerful supercomputer in the world. It also achieved 26.58TFLOPS, or 64.9% of peak performance of the system, for a global atmospheric circulation model with the spectral method. This record-breaking sustained performance makes this innovative system a very effective scientific tool for providing solutions to the sustainable development of humankind and its symbiosis with the planet earth.

AB Now that the nuclear generation industry is competing in the open market, many of us speak about potential conflicts between nuclear safety and cost reduction. This article describes EDF's cur-rent situation and point of view in this regard. To ensure sustainable nuclear power plant operations, competitiveness and excellence in safety are the two key conditions. A "cost-killing" approach can be used to achieve short-term profits in areas that do not affect nuclear safety such as improved reactor performance, improved fuel burn-up or outage scheduling. The quality-based management approach is the driving force behind overall performance, from nuclear safety, radiation protection and environment to generation costs. In the long term, plant life extension is also an efficient way to make money. The independent control system set up at every level of the company is an effective mechanism to deal with the potential safety and competitiveness conflicts.

AB Born in the midst of the 1973 oil crisis around European electricity consumers and one producer, EURODIF has become a major international nuclear fuel enrichment actor. Throughout the last 20 years, its gaseous diffusion enrichment plant (GDP) has been improved and optimized. Its flexibility is a unique asset, allowing the best use of the newly deregulated electricity market, for the benefit of its customers. Competitiveness, high safety standards and environmental excellence augur well for a reliable and sustainable future. This future will include a technological transition at some moment before the 2015 horizon. The progressive transition from gaseous diffusion to modern centrifuge is being planned, while making the best use of the existing Georges Besse diffusion plant, fit to serve well beyond the coming ten years, during which worldwide customers will benefit from EURODIF reliability, flexibility and large capacity. With and beyond gaseous diffusion, Cogema/EURODIF will remain a sustainable long-term supplier of enrichment services in the developing electro-nuclear industry.

AB Considering constrained dynamical systems characterized by a differential inclusion x' is an element of F(x), we are interested in studying the situation where, for various reasons, the state leaves the constrain domain K either because the initial position does not belong to the Viability Kernel of K for F or it belongs to a "sustainable or tolerable" but not "comfortable" domain. This question appears in numerous models in Social Sciences or in Genetics as well as for controlling security in Automatics and Robotics, like Aircraft landing, rolling and taking off. After recalling basic concepts in Viability Theory and using hybrid calculus, we show how to evaluate and manage crisis in general cases.

AB Appropriate evaluation of phosphorus (P) availability in soil is a prerequisite for ensuring the productivity and long-term sustainable management of agroecosystems. Fifteen soils presently under grassland were collected from different areas of New Zealand and soil P availability was assessed by isotopic exchange kinetics (IEK) and related to P forms obtained by chemical fractionation (sequential extraction). Concentrations of total P determined in the 15 soils ranged from 375 to 2607 mg kg(-1) (mean 1104 mg kg(-1)). Mean concentrations of inorganic P (Pi) extracted by sequential extraction with ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide (first), hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (second) were 1.2, 41, 205, 113 and 23 mg kg(-1), respectively. Mean concentrations of organic P (Po) extracted by sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide (first) and sodium hydroxide (second) were 133, 417 and 105 mg kg(-1), respectively. Similarly, results from IEK analysis showed that the intensity (water soluble Pi (Cp)), capacity (R/r(1) and n), and quantity (E value, isotopically exchangeable P pools (E-1 (min), E-1 (min-24 h), E-24 (h-3) (m), E (>) (3 m))) factors varied markedly amongst soils. Thus Cp concentrations ranged from 0.02-1.90 mg L-1, while concentrations of Pi determined in the E-1 (min), E-1 (mm-24), E-24 (h-3 m), E->3 (m) pools were 2-29 (mean 10), 10-321 (76), 11-745 (152), and 8-498 (177) mg kg(-1), respectively. The corresponding values for R/r(1) and n were 1.0-17.7 (mean 4.5) and 0.10-0.50 (mean 0.37), respectively. Regression analysis revealed that Cp concentrations were exponentially and inversely proportional to R/r(1) n and P sorption index (PSI) (R-2 = 0.806 (P < 0.01), 0.852 (P < 0.01) and 0.660 (P < 0.01), respectively). Cluster analysis identified two broad groups of soils, namely those with low P availability (mean Cp 0.11 mg L-1, E-1 (min) Pi 5 mg kg(-1), R/r(1) 3.9, n 0.44), and those with high P availability (mean Cp 1.33 mg L-1, E, min Pi 20 mg kg(-1), R/r(1) 1.21, n 0.16). Correlation analysis indicated that E-1 (min) Pi was significantly correlated with bicarbonate extractable Pi (BPi, R-2 = 0.37, P < 0.05) and the sum of ammonium chloride extractable Pi (APi) and BPi (R-2 = 0.38, P < 0.05). However, the concentration of Pi in the E-1 (min) pool was generally lower than the sum of APi and BPi. Sodium hydroxide extractable Pi (N(1)Pi) was significantly correlated with the sum of the E-1 (min), E1 min-24 (h), E-24 (h-3) (m) Pi pools (R-2 = 0.974, P < 0.01), indicating that N(1)Pi fraction could be considered as representing potentially available soil P for pasture species over a growing season.

TI Sustainability of wilderness sea kayaking in the Bay of Fundy, Canada
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A study was undertaken to investigate the potential long-term sustainability of sea kayaking in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. The biological and physical state of the environment of four islands frequently visited by sea kayakers was measured in spring, summer, and fall, 1997. Information was also collected on the quality of kayakers' wilderness experience, and whether encounters with other groups of people or the quality of the environment affected that experience.
   The kayakers' impact on the bio-physical states of the islands was found to be minimal. Few impacts were recorded, and most of these were in areas that were frequently and readily modified by waves and tides. All respondents indicated that their wilderness experience was good to excellent, with 97% indicating a very good to excellent experience. More than 80% of respondents indicated that the quality of the natural environment had either a positive or very positive impact on their wilderness experience. Nearly half (43%) of respondents indicated that encounters with other groups of people had a negative or very negative effect on their wilderness experience.
   Recommendations have been developed for the management of islands in maritime environments with the goal of long-term sustainability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Ecological performance indicators in the North Sea: development and
   application
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Different signals of distress from the North-Sea ecosystems started a discussion on the protection of the ecosystem at the third North Sea, Ministers Conference in 1990. This was followed by a number of workshops on ecological indicators under the auspices of the North Sea Task Force and the Oslo and Paris Commissions (OSPAR). In 1997 the member countries around the North Sea agreed to develop and apply an ecosystem's approach in the management programs for both the North Sea fisheries and the marine environment. Following this agreement the identification of the ecological qualities objectives for the North Sea ecosystem started. Further work in this direction has lead to the setting up of various national projects geared towards creating a better understanding of the North Sea ecosystem.
   In, the Netherlands, two departments (Water management and Nature and fisheries management) from the Ministry of Transport, Public works and Water Management (V&W) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Fisheries Management (LNV) agreed to integrate their policies for the management of the Netherlands section of the North Sea. The results from these projects (started in 1996) should enable the policy makers and managers to formulate policies that could lead to the creation of a balance between the effects of human activities and the preservation of the natural qualities of the North Sea ecosystem.
   One of the projects is strictly designed to develop ecological indicators for the Dutch part of the North Sea. These indicators are based on various monitoring data and related in one way or another with human activities. In this way it is possible to evaluate the effects of human impacts on the ecosystem. Long-term changes in the ecological performance of the ecosystem can be elucidated by the use of the ecological indicators. Thereby making it possible for the policy makers and the managers of the NCP to evaluate the effects of their policies and management recommendations on the quality of the ecosystem.
   This paper describes the process and the steps taken by the authorities in the countries around the North Sea to develop a set of ecological indicators for the management of the North Sea ecosystem. Focus will be made on the efforts made in the Netherlands to develop indicators that did provide the basis for the development of Water and Nature conservation policies and new management strategies for maintaining the sustainable use of the Dutch section of the North Sea.

TI Frameworks and indicators for assessing progress in integrated coastal
   management initiatives
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The fundamental purpose of all integrated coastal management (ICM) initiatives is to maintain, restore or improve specified qualities of coastal ecosystems and their associated human societies. A defining feature of ICM is that it addresses needs for both development and conservation in geographically specific places-be they a single community, an estuary or the coast of an entire nation. The times required to achieve these fundamental goals at significant spatial scales far exceed those of the usual 4-6-year project, the dominant ICM modality, in developing nations. This paper offers two simple, but elastic frameworks for assessing progress over the extended time periods involved. The first is the four Orders of Outcomes that group together the sequences of institutional, behavioral and social/environmental changes that can lead to more sustainable forms of coastal development. The second framework is a version of the more familiar ICM policy cycle. These conceptually simple frameworks are making-it possible to unbundle and organize into consistent formats the usually implicit assumptions that underpin project and program designs and then group activities and outcomes along a critical path that leads-or is presumed to lead-to the desired outcomes. Each step in the ICM policy cycle and each Order of Outcomes suggest the indicators by which progress and learning can be assessed. The application of these frameworks to a diversity of ICM initiatives is proving, useful in assessing progress across portfolios of. ICM initiatives, extracting good practices and teasing out how different governance contexts effect the forces that shape the evolution, of ICM initiatives. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Integrated coastal zone management using the ecosystems approach, some
   perspectives in Malaysia
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB An effective assessment of functions, goods and services of coastal ecosystems requires commitment from the various stakeholders and an integrated approach in the management of the ecosystem. Malaysia has made commitments through its policies, the latest being the Eighth Malaysia Plan, for 2001-2005 ("8th MP"), which is the first phase implementation of the Third Outline Perspective Plan ("OPP3"), charting the development of the nation for the first decade in the 21st Century. The pledge to develop an Integrated Coastal Zone Management Policy ("ICZM") is being carried out to reconcile conflicting uses and ensure sustainability of coastal resources, plus identify and provide for uniformity and minimum standards to be adopted in Malaysia. These policy instruments (e.g. OPP3, 8th MP, Draft ICZM, National Policy on Biodiversity) will set the objectives and direction that will allow for formal instruments of implementation of strategies and plans envisaged to take place, besides setting the stage for the various stakeholders and outlining responsibilities and commitments. It will also allow for disciplines and findings be it in science, socio-economic and humanities to interface with policies and its instruments of implementation, especially when put into the context of the ecosystems approach.

TI Changes in fisheries management in Mexico: Effects of increasing
   scientific input and public participation
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article, we analyze a change in the role of federal institutions in charge of managing Mexican fisheries during the mid-1990s. During 30 years, the fishery policy in Mexico began by promoting an accelerated fishing effort. This worked through 1981, when the country recorded its highest landings (1.6 million metric tons), but landings have not increased subsequently whereas the number of fishermen has continued to increase. In 1995, the federal administration acknowledged the problems: biological over-exploitation; over-capitalization; monopoly in commercialization; failures in loan payments; failures in controlling effort; obsolete vessels and equipment; and social conflicts for the resources. In an attempt to resolve some of these problems, the administration implemented structural changes in management, science and enforcement institutions. This arrangement established goals and introduced instruments in fisheries management: it determined the biological status of most of the fisheries; applied the precautionary approach for those fully exploited or over-exploited fisheries; gave scientific advice an important role in decision making; and involved the users in decision making. This article evaluates these changes in management policy by document review, participation and interviewing management and scientists who participated in this process. We analyze, in particular, the use of science-based categorization of fisheries status, and the introduction of public participation. The interview data demonstrate that sustainable Mexican fisheries require an evolution to a more public participatory policy, in order to strengthen local institutions and fishermen over federal institutions, which should lead to a redefinition of regulation of fisheries resources.

TI Social-ecological feedback links for ecosystem management: a case study
   of fisheries in the Central Baltic Sea archipelago
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID COASTAL MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; FISH; COMANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION;

AB In this paper, we address the implications of changing social-ecological feedback links for a sustainable management of coastal regions applying an ecosystem management perspective. This case study focuses on user patterns of fish resources in the Central Baltic Sea archipelago consisting of three sub-regions: Stockholm archipelago, Sweden, the Angstromland islands and the archipelago of SW Finland. The transition from a region, mainly relying on a mixture of local natural resources towards a region more dominated by the recreational demands of nearby large urban areas, has altered user patterns of fish resources. This transition has partly followed different pathways in the three sub-regions depending on how socio-economic driving forces have been manifested in management actions. Nevertheless, functioning ecosystems are still the basis for the delivery of ecosystem services and a living archipelago system. The significance of capturing and (re)building feedback links into management regarding knowledge on ecosystem services for a sustainable ecosystem management is discussed.

TI Public perceptions and attitudes towards a forthcoming managed
   realignment scheme: Freiston Shore, Lincolnshire, UK
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MARSH
AB Managed realignment is viewed as a sustainable flood defence strategy by practitioners as it provides environmental and economic benefits in light of potential global climate change. However, in many cases social barriers are in existence, with public perception and attitudes towards this approach less than favourable, as there is always resistance in surrendering land to the sea. Freiston Shore managed realignment scheme is the second of three on-going studies that aim to detect the drivers surrounding public acceptance of managed realignment and confidence in the Environment Agency, the lead agency for managed realignment in the UK. This research presents the hypothesis that local residents will be more accepting of a fully established scheme (since it will have been in the public domain for longer), rather than at its inception or during its construction. Findings from the Freiston scheme showed that the majority of residents supported the managed realignment scheme at its current construction phase, although two main barriers were identified as suppressing public acceptance. These are public confidence in the Environment Agency and public understanding of coastal defence and managed realignment issues. This investigation recommends that local community engagement activities are effective means of addressing such deficiencies whilst providing the education necessary for understanding the requirements and limitations of managed realignment. However, such participation activities should be tailored for the needs of individual target audiences. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coastal and ocean environments worldwide are coming under increasing pressure from resource development. In some cases, integrated coastal zone management programs have been successfully adopted. However, with the collapse of offshore fisheries and competition among industries for use of the seabed, many maritime countries are recognizing that more data are needed to support the sustainable management of offshore resources. Developments in multibeam mapping technology, in concert with traditional geoscience survey techniques, now provide the capability to image the sea floor in high resolution. Examples from the Canadian Atlantic continental margin are used to demonstrate the application of high-resolution sea floor mapping techniques to develop data bases and maps; these maps are fundamental information for the future management of offshore resources.

ID BEACH MORPHODYNAMICS; SELF-IDENTITY; SENSITIVITY
AB In the area of a coastal fishing village on the mangrove peninsula of Braganca, State of Para, North Brazil, coastal changes were observed by a beach profile monitoring programme between 1997 and 2001. The assessment allowed a subdivision of the region into four small coastal cells (1-3 km), partly exhibiting heavy erosion. A number of related socio-economic problems, such as loss of alternative income sources caused by the locally unpredictable erosion patterns were identified in three separate village sections. This results in a year-round dependence on seasonally low fishery incomes and increases the risk of poverty. Since limited options for action are available to the local population, different social groups have evolved different land use patterns, which in turn influence local coastal morphodynamics. Not only the hydrodynamic signature, but also, the socio-economic organisation of a coastal community and the co-evolutionary path between these two variables thus indicate the state of a coastal system and the most promising policy actions towards sustainable coastal management.

AB Synthesis and New Conception of North Sea Research (SYCON) is the title of a German project carried out from 1998-2000 under the leadership of Hamburg University(1). It was accompanied by an international advisory board and covered North Sea issues as well as the general challenges to shelf sea research and sustainable management under global change. Particular emphasis was placed on the interdisciplinary analysis of comprehensive areas of knowledge: the data situation, understanding of processes, model development, instruments and methods, understanding of the system. Based on this, perspectives for future North Sea research were developed. The project produced a synthesis report, eleven monodisciplinary reports and an illustrated brochure for the general public (see Annex 1, this paper, p. 258).

AB Processing of oil shale in Estonia was started in the 1920s. Since 1924 to the present time the technology of processing large-particle oil shale in vertical retorts with gaseous heat carrier, and since 1980 that of processing fine-grained oil shale with solid heat carrier are in operation.
   To assess the quality of oil shale the standard Fischer assay method (heating in aluminum retort to temperatures 500-520degreesC) is used For oil shales of all deposits of the world at this temperature the thermal decomposition of organic matter is completed, but practically no decomposition of the mineral portion of oil shale takes place.
   At commercial realization of oil shale processing the yield and the quality of products depend on many factors: oil shale particle size, methods of heat input, kind of heat carrier and its temperature, duration of retorting, and also on secondary processes which proceed inside the oil shale particle and in the interparticle space, and others. The comparison of various known technologies for processing oil shales is made, and a possible theoretical foundation of process features is given. An estimation of the impact of the process on the environment is also discussed.
   As a result directions for the further development of existing technologies are given.

TI New directions for shale oil: Path to a secure new oil supply well into

SO OIL SHALE

CT 2nd International Symposium on Oil Shale
CY NOV 18-21, 2002
CL TALLINN, ESTONIA
AB Australia has enjoyed near self-sufficiency in crude oil production since the late 1960s but has declined to 80-90% in recent years. This is expected to drop to below 50% of demand by 2019-2020. Southern Pacific Petroleum NL is pioneering the development of breakthrough technology to unlock oil from Australia's largest oil resource, with 17.3 billion barrels of oil shale held in ten deposits along the coast of Central Queensland, Australia. These deposits could support production of more than one million barrels of oil per day, helping to secure oil self-sufficiency for Australia and meet part of a growing oil demand in Asia.
   The company spent more than A $150 million on research and development before embarking on a demonstration plant to produce oil commercially. It is the depth of this research and its application that has provided a sound basis for the development of a new industry that can help fuel the growing demand for oil in the transportation sector in a way that is environmentally responsible. The company's initial operations at the Stuart deposit, located 15 km north of Gladstone, Central Queensland, is the start of a multi-stage risk-managed approach to developing a shale oil industry using the first-of-a-kind Alberta Taciuk Processor (ATP) technology.
   Stage 1, a 4,500-bpsd (barrels per stream day) demonstration-scale plant, is a 75:1 scale-up of a successful laboratory pilot plant developed to process oil sands in Canada. The Stage 1 plant was constructed in 1997-1999 and has produced over 500,000 barrels of oil to date. A great deal of operating data has been captured and the plant has been able to run in excess of 52 days continuously at peak rates up to 84% of capacity. A current capital program will push both throughput and availability to design rates over the next year.
   The Stage 2 plant, with a capacity of approximately 15,000 pbsd, will share services and infrastructure with the Stage I plant.
   This is projected to lead into a commercial plant ultimately producing up to 200,000 bpsd of light sweet crude equivalent, based on multiple commercial ATP units. At this rate, Stuart could offset current oil imports to Australia and meet one quarter of the current Australian demand for crude oil. The full commercial plant would be supplied by oil shale from the Stuart Resource for more than 30 years.
   The raw oil produced in the Stage 1 ATP from the Stuart deposit has an API gravity of 42degrees. As the raw oil is a product of pyrolysis, it requires on site treatment to stabilize it and to reduce nitrogen and sulphur levels to best meet refiners' needs.
   In Stage 1, the naphtha/kerosene fractions are hydrotreated to produce an ultra low-sulphur 'water-white' product, which can be readily used to make gasoline and jet fuel. Shale oil has been certified as a feedstock for jet fuel production by the world's leading accreditation agencies. A long-term contract has been signed for the sale of naphtha to Mobil Oil Australia. The second product, light fuel oil, is sold into the Singapore fuel oil market as a blending stock.
   The successful performance of the ATP at the Stuart Stage I plant under sustained operations has now demonstrated its technical viability, economic potential and environmental sustainability. Oil from shale is Australia's emerging new clean-energy industry.

CY NOV 18-21, 2002
CL TALLINN, ESTONIA
AB Production of oil shale-based electricity covers Estonian electricity consumption and enables also to export electricity. Oil shale-based electricity production is by now competitive on the electricity market of the Baltic States and of the neighboring EU Member States. However, production of oil shale-based electricity has low energy efficiency, demands large investments for renovation and has high environmental risks. Taxation of environmental damage will be more severe in the future, lowering the competitiveness of oil shale-based electricity. Therefore, the key issue of sustainable development of Estonian energy sector is reduction of the environmental damage of the oil shale-based electricity production, or reduction of the share of oil shale in the energy balance at the expense of other energy resources, especially renewable energy.

AB In an earlier study we examined the available evidence on the Edelman Prize finalist applications 1989-1998. This study concluded that 13 of the 42 private sector applications provide examples of strategic operations research (SOR) when SOR is defined as operations research that creates a sustain-able competitive. advantage. In a follow-up study we tested our classifications, gathering longitudinal information on the continued success, of the Edelman applications. We contacted people who were familiar with all the private sector applications that were Edelman finalists 198914096 and had at least five years of history since the competition. We describe the post-Edelman history of these applications and use this data to reassess their strategic role. We found that the longitudinal data provides evidence to support our original classification, but also suggests that several additional applications were more strategic than was originally apparent. We conclude that almost 60% (20 of 34) of these applications created a sustainable competitive advantage for their firms and provide examples of SOR.

AB We consider a discrete-time modelling of renewable resources, which regenerate after a delay once harvested. We study the qualitative behaviour of harvesting policies, which are optimal with respect to a discounted utility function over infinite horizon. Using Bellman's equation, we derive analytically conditions under which two types of policies (greedy and sustainable) are optimal, depending on the discount rate and the marginal utility. For this particular class of problems, we show also that the greedy policy is attractive in a certain sense. The techniques of proof lie on concavity, comparison of value functions and Lyapunov-like functions. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Captive breeding programmes for the Asian elephant Elephas maximus have failed to establish self-sustaining zoo populations. Birth rates are low and calf mortality rates are high. The zoo population is widely dispersed, with few animals being moved on breeding loan. New techniques may increase birth rates but current predictions suggest demographic extinction within 50 years. It would be difficult to justify importing elephants from sustainable zoo reserves in Asia to participate in ex situ breeding programmes where reproductive success is low. Zoos should either urgently regroup animals to form breeding units, or accept that Asian elephants will die out in zoos and that funds should be diverted to in situ conservation projects.

TI An escalating trade in orchid tubers across Tanzania's Southern
   Highlands: assessment, dynamics and conservation implications
SO ORYX
LA English
DT Article
DE CITES; orchids; Southern Highlands; Tanzania; trade; Zambia
AB Kinaka or Chikanda has been eaten by people in parts of Zambia, northern Malawi and south-western Tanzania for hundreds of years. Prepared from the boiled root tubers of terrestrial orchids, and principally from species of the genera Disa, Habenaria and Satyrium, it was formerly a traditional village delicacy and did not pose a threat to orchid populations. However, the past decade has witnessed a dramatic rise in demand in Zambia, particularly in urban areas. This has triggered a burgeoning commercial market and has now prompted traders to seek tubers from Tanzania's Southern Highlands, an important centre of endemism for upland species of orchid. The resulting cross-border trade, its dynamics and the implications for Tanzanian orchids are reported here for the first time. Whilst all orchid species are in CITES Appendix II, collectors are currently harvesting between 2.2 and 4.1 million tubers per year for export to, and consumption in, neighbouring Zambia. As many as 85 species may be at risk from this trade, and there is evidence that large areas in Ufipa, Mbeya and Kipengere have already been stripped of their orchids. A decline in traditional Tanzanian consumption of Kinaka seems to be having little or no impact on harvesting volumes. Orchid collection across the Southern Highlands is now escalating at a rate that may be far from sustainable. The consequences for Tanzanian biodiversity and for one of Africa's most important areas for orchids are profound.

AB Knowledge of conflicts between people and protected areas is required for the design of sustainable conservation strategies for the management of most protected areas. This study identifies the causes of conflicts between local people and the Benoue Wildlife Conservation Area (BWCA), which includes the Benoue National Park, in northern Cameroon. Informal interviews and questionnaires were administered to 114 households in three communities, and to 17 Park staff and seven professional hunting guides. Crop damage affected 86% of the surveyed households, with 31% of crop income lost on average, and with the damage varying significantly between communities. Elephants, baboons, patas monkeys, warthogs and green parrots accounted for 97% of crop damage, with the staple foods maize and millet being most affected. Of the respondents, 28% experienced livestock depredation, with 18% of livestock income lost on average. The civet cat was the main predator. The involvement of local people in illegal activities, their lack of access to natural resources, and damage by wildlife were identified as principal causes of conflicts. Local people, park staff and professional hunting guides had diverse and differing perceptions about the causes of the conflicts, and made various suggestions for reduction of wildlife damage including animal scaring and controlled shooting. We conclude that, under current wildlife policy, conflict between people and BWCA is difficult to resolve. To reduce conflicts and promote sustainable conservation, we suggest co-management of wildlife involving all stakeholders, establishment of crop damage control teams, and promotion of tangible benefits to local people. There may be a requirement for site-specificity in management strategies.

TI Condebelt press drying and sustainable paper cycle
SO PAPERI JA PUU-PAPER AND TIMBER
LA English
DT Article
AB The Condebelt process is based on the condensing belt principle and it is a very promising method, offering several advantages over conventional cylinder drying. At the moment, it is best suited to board grades, but it has also a considerable potential with paper grades. In this process drying shrinkage of the web is eliminated, and even stiff fibers can effectively be plasticized and bonded to each other. Compared to cylinder drying, this results in improved strength properties, especially in the cross-machine direction. This drying process offers opportunities for lowering the grammage of board, reducing the weight of corrugated boxes, increasing the use of recycled furnishes and high-yield pulps. The disintegration of condensing belt dried board needs slightly more energy than cylinder-dried board. However, the recyclability of the board is good, especially when the re-made web is dried using the condensing belt process. The deterioration of board properties after multiple recycling and condensing belt drying is quite moderate. This shows that condensation belt drying can form part of a ecologically sustainable paper cycle.

TI Germany: Modernising the left by stealth
SO PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB The structural crisis of the German economy faces the parties of the left with a three-fold challenge. Programmatically they have to reconcile liberalising economic reform with the principles of social justice and environmental sustainability that motivate left politics. This means an electoral reorientation away from traditional voting groups, towards more reform-minded constituencies. Endowing party leaderships with the strategic flexibility to execute these manoeuvres may entail relinquishing long cherished organisational principles. This article examines the readiness of left parties in Germany to embrace these reform agendas. Whilst eschewing a decisive breach with programmatic tradition, both the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Alliance 90/the Greens are nevertheless absorbing the liberal agenda. Both parties display signs of gradual organisational metamorphosis. The electoral profile of the SPD, is slowly but unmistakably shifting. Almost imperceptibly, it is concluded, the parties of the German left are undergoing a process of modernisation by stealth.

AB In Peruvian Amazonia, cropping techniques manipulating the biological processes of soil fertility have been tested to increase productivity and sustainability of crops. Special attention was paid to earthworms since their communities are dominant in natural ecosystems and severely depleted in cultivated soils, and also because their populations can be manipulated. The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of the endogeic earthworm Pontoscolex corethrurus on soil organic matter dynamics, by comparing treatments with and without earthworms. Carbon dynamics is described using particle-size fractionation and in situ natural isotopic labelling (carbon 13) obtained by shift of C3 to C4 vegetation.
   After 6 years of maize cultivation, the organic carbon stock of the 0-10 cm layer decreased respectively by 4 and 27% in the control and the earthworm inoculated treatments. For the inoculated treatment this decrease mainly occurred in the large particle size (plant residues). Seventy % of the carbon derived from forest was lost during 6 years in the 2000-200 pm fractions in the inoculated treatment and 19 % in the control. However, the incorporation of carbon derived from maize in soil, especially in the large particle fractions (>50 mum), was lower in the earthworm inoculated treatment. Accordingly, the proportions of carbon derived from forest and from maize were the same in the two treatments. Thus, the main effect of earthworm inoculation was a more important mineralisation of the carbon derived from forest and maize, especially in the large particle size fractions (>50 mum).

AB Recent studies of Swietenia macrophylla King argue that natural regeneration of this highly valued tree is episodic and occurs only after infrequent catastrophic disturbance. An analysis of 14 population size-distributions in natural forests shows that population structure varies across this species' range. In forests that are in successional transition from open deciduous forest to evergreen forest there is often prolific regeneration. We show that in this type of forest in southern Para (Brazil) patches of even-sized trees are small. Large-scale disturbance may be necessary for regeneration only in evergreen forests where little light penetrates through the canopy. The transition zone between evergreen and deciduous forest in Para is moving south, and we propose that mahogany populations to the north are in the process of competitive exclusion. Sustainable harvesting of mahogany must take account of the successional stage of the forest.

AB Four field trials were conducted, from 1995 to 1997, with the objective of studying the response of four upland cultivars to foliar fungicide application in relation to panicle blast control, grain yield and sustainability. Differential disease control and yield response of cultivars to fungicide treatment were obtained. Losses in grain yield of cultivars IAC 202, Caiapo, Rio Paranaiba and Araguaia due to panicle blast were 44.8%, 27.4%, 24.4% and 18.2%, respectively Two applications of tricyclazole or benomyl controlled particle blast, as indicated by lower values of disease progress curve and relative panicle blast severity, and increased grain yield of the cultivar IAC 202. The losses in 100 panicle grain weight and grain yield were significantly reduced by 22.3% and 25.1% in IAC 202 and 23.6% and 20.5% in Caiapo, respectively, with two sprays of tricyclazole. Sustainable value index for yield was maximum with two applications of tricyclazole (0.59), followed by one application at booting (0.46) and at heading (0.40) in cultivar IAC 202. Results showed no yield response of the cultivars Rio Paranaiba and Araguaia to fungicide applications for panicle blast control.

ID TECHNOLOGY; ECONOMICS; ADOPTION; COSTS
AB The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) responds to requests by the Department of Health for guidance on the use of selected new and established technologies in the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales. This paper asks whether the NICE methodological guidelines help NHS decision makers meet the objectives of maximum health improvements from NHS resources and an equitable availability of technologies. The analytical basis of the guidelines is a comparison of the costs and consequences of new and existing methods of dealing with particular conditions using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We explain why information on the costs and consequences of a particular technology in isolation is insufficient to address issues of efficiency of resource use. We argue that to increase efficiency, decision makers need information on opportunity costs. We show that in the absence of such information decision makers cannot identify the efficient use of resources. Finally we argue that economics provides valid methods for identifying the maximisation of health improvements for a given allocation of resources and we describe an alternative practical approach to this problem. Drawing on the experience of Ontario, Canada where an approach similar to that proposed by NICE has been in use for almost a decade, and recent reports about the consequences of NICE decisions to date, we conclude that instead of increasing the efficiency or equity of the use of NHS resources, NICE methodological guidelines may lead to: (i) uncontrolled increases in NHS expenditures without evidence of any increase in total health improvements; (ii) increased inequities in the availability of services; and (iii) concerns about the sustainability of public funding for new technologies.

AB Of the four tested sweet potato cultivars having different features in growth and yield, cv. Koganesengan (KOG) was sustainable in photosynthetic activity through young to aged leaves under drought. One of the causes for this phenomenon may be stomatal conductance (g(s)) of this cultivar that was relatively high in both aged and drought-imposed leaves. In these leaves the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was low and the quantum yield of photosystem 2 (Phi(e)) was high, compared to those of the other cultivars. This helps to prevent excessive accumulation of chemical energy in leaves and a decrease in photoinhibition damage to the photosynthetic function, by which KOG sustains a relatively high photosynthetic activity under the drought and alleviates functional deterioration caused by leaf age.

TI The water value-flow concept
SO PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
LA English
DT Article
AB The value of water is a key issue in managing water resources in an efficient, equitable and sustainable way. Efforts to assess the value of water are often not linked to the properties of the natural water system, which makes it difficult to analyse upstream-downstream dependency. In order to account for the cyclic nature of water in the assessment of water value, Chapagain [Exploring methods to assess the value of water: a case study on the Zambezi basin. Value of Water Research Report Series No. 1, IHE Delft, The Netherlands, 2000] and Hoekstra et al. [Water value flows: a case study on the Zambezi basin. Value of Water Research Report Series No. 2, IHE Delft, The Netherlands, 2000] have introduced the 'value-flow concept'. This concept aims to provide the missing link between water valuation and hydrology. The hypothesis is that the full value of a water particle depends on the path it follows within the hydrological cycle and the values generated along this path. The full value of a water particle in a certain spot at a certain point in time is supposed to be the sum of its in situ value and all values that will be generated along its path later. It follows that all values generated by water can ultimately be attributed to rain. This simple concept implies that there is a direct analogy between the flow of water and the flow of values, with one crucial difference. Water values flow backward in time and in a direction opposite to that of the water. In other words, the value-flow attributes local water values to the upstream water flows within the natural system.
   This paper puts the value-flow concept in a proper mathematical model that is able to attribute the value of water produced in a certain place and at a certain time to the source of that water. Three models are considered in a progressive manner, to arrive at a generic form of the value-flow concept. The first two models were developed and used by Chapagain and Hoekstra et al. Here a third model is introduced, in order to properly account for the dynamic nature of the hydrological cycle. It is shown that this third model is the most generic one, able to correctly describe the flow of values in a dynamic water system. The parameterisation of the model is based on the hydrological characteristics of the water system. Further analysis of the value-flow concept addresses the way in which return flows generate a multiplier effect on the value of water. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The MULINO project (MULti-sectoral, Integrated and Operational decision support system (DSS) for sustainable use of water resources at the catchment scale), funded by the Environment and Climate Programme of the European Union (EU), aims to support the scientific basis for integrated water management. The purpose of the project is to provide a tool to improve the integrated management of water resources at the catchment scale, based on the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD).
   This paper presents the methodology aspects of the project. The design of the MULINO_DSS is based on the European Environment Agency DPSIR framework of environmental cause-effect relationships. D represents the driving forces, P, the pressures on the environment caused by human activities, S, the state of the environment, I, the impact on the environment and R, the human activities and desirable societal responses. This DPSIR chain provides the end-user of the DSS with an integrated view of complex, interacting issues.
   The first step in the MULINO project has been the analysis of local decision networks and the identification of an end-user to whom the DSS will be delivered. The importance of this step is illustrated by the results of the analysis for the Belgian case study: the Walloon part of the Dyle river catchment. The design of the DSS is made more complicated in this catchment by the fragmented nature of water management decision making. However, to overcome this problem, the design of the DSS was targeted at the river contract (RC) of the catchment. The coordinator of the RC is a focal point for a range of end-users and stakeholders with responsibility for water management in this catchment. This organisational structure was originally put in place to find a consensus when solving conflicting water management issues. Thus, the concept for the DSS development and delivery fits with the participatory approach principle of the WFD and builds on existing local networks of integrated water management.

AB As a contribution to understanding the interaction between the factors which influence desertification, a decision support system. (DSS) is developed for the 1700-km(2) Agri basin in southern Italy. This integrates the SHETRAN physically based hydrological and sediment yield model, a simple socio-economic model (in which farmers select those crops which give the highest income relative to cost of production), a database (containing climate, physical and socio-economic data according to a range of future scenarios) and existing desertification management experience into a single tool to aid decision-making in desertification mitigation. It provides a means of examining the effect of climate change and land management on desertification, allowing for feedback between the physical conditions and land use as determined by farmer decisions and government or EU agricultural policy (especially crop subsidies). Typical issues which the DSS can address include: what are the desertification consequences of specified climate scenarios, within a context of fixed agricultural policy?; and, given a climate scenario, is a specified land use or agricultural policy sustainable?

AB The GLOWA-initiative (Global Change of the water cycle), funded by the German Ministry of Research and Education (BMBF), has been established to address the manifold consequences of Global Change on regional water resources in a variety of catchment areas with different natural and cultural characteristics. Within this framework, the GLOWA-Danube project is dealing with the Upper Danube watershed as a representative mesoscale test site (similar to75.000 km(2)) for mountain-foreland regions in the temperate mid-latitudes. The principle objective is to identify, examine and develop new techniques of coupled distributed modelling for the integration of natural and socio-economic sciences. The transdisciplinary research in GLOWA-Danube develops an integrated decision support system, called DANUBIA, to investigate the sustainability of future water use. GLOWA-Danube, which is scheduled for a. total run-time of eight years to operationally implement and establish DANUBIA, comprises a university-based network of experts with water-related competence in the fields of engineering, natural and social sciences. Co-operation with a network of stakeholders in water resources management of the Upper Danube catchment ensures that practical issues and future problems in the water sector of the region can be addressed.
   In order to synthesize a common understanding between the project partners, a standardized notation of parameters and functions and a platform-independent structure of computational methods and interfaces has been established, by making use of the unified modelling language, an industry standard for the structuring and co-ordination of large projects in software development [Booch et al., The Unified Modelling Language User Guide, Addison-Wesley, Reading, 1999]. DANUBIA is object-oriented, spatially distributed and raster-based at its core. It applies the concept of "proxels" (process pixels) as its basic objects, which have different dimensions depending on the viewing scale and connect to their environment through fluxes. The presented paper excerpts the hydrological view point of GLOWA-Danube, its approach of model coupling and network-based communication, and object-oriented techniques to simulate physical processes and interactions at the land surface. The mechanisms and technologies applied to communicate data and model parameters across the typical discipline borders are demonstrated from the perspective of the Landsurface object. It comprises the capabilities of interdependent expert models for energy exchange at various surface types, snowmelt, soil water movement, runoff formation and plant growth in a distributed Java-based modelling environment using the remote method invocation [Pitt et al., Java.rmi: The Remote Method Invocation Guide, Addison Wesley Professional, Reading, 2001, p. 320]. The presented text summarizes the GLOWA-Danube concept and shows the state of an implemented DANUBIA prototype after completion of the first project-year (2001). (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ephemeral rivers are located in the world's drylands where aridity and climate variability are key environmental determinants. The Kuiseb River is one of two diversely developed ephemeral rivers in western-central Namibia. From up to down stream, freehold-tenure farmers, a national park, communal farmers and the port and municipality of Walvis Bay all derive water from this source. Upstream farmers impound surface water during brief rainfall periods while remaining stakeholders' abstract water from the alluvial aquifer. The draft Water Resources Management Act for Namibia devotes one chapter to basin management committees as mechanisms to ensure more equitable, efficient and effective sharing of water resources and their benefits. Two pilot committees are being established in Namibia, one of which is in the Kuiseb basin. The Environmental Learning and Action in the Kuiseb project, implemented by the Desert Research Foundation of Namibia in close consultation with Namibia's Water Resources Management Review with funding from the European Union, has brought all stakeholders together. The Department of Water Affairs, Nam-Water and the Gobabeb Training and Research Centre are contributing information to enhance understanding of the river's functions and services provided. All stakeholders are sharing information concerning their needs, expectations and contributions toward integrated management of the Kuiseb. After negotiation for one-and-a-half years, a formal committee is established and mechanisms for its functioning and sustainability are being identified. The main benefit to date is the dialogue, good will and interest that have been established amongst the stakeholders. If the momentum is maintained, this will lead to a new, more integrated approach to resource management in the entire basin. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Irangi Hills in the semiarid central Tanzania are known for their severe land degradation, particularly through soil erosion. This study aims at investigating the dynamics in the local resource management and adaptive farming strategies. A combination of conventional survey methods, participatory analysis, soil description and aerial photo interpretations were used in the analysis of spatial and temporal land-use patterns. Results from the study showed that farmers utilised all possible niches in the landscape with the agricultural practices varying considerably, depending on spatial variations in soil conditions, water availability and retention capacity of the soil. The hard clayey soils were often ploughed at the end of the rainy season, before the soil dried out, to facilitate timeliness of planting in the following growing season, and to enhance water infiltration at the onset of the rainy season. Seasonally waterlogged soils were intensively cultivated and planted late during the growing season, with crops maturing only from groundwater resource. To make effective use of available groundwater resources during the dry season, the droughty and often infertile sands in ephemeral watercourses are used for growing vegetables or sugarcane in sunken holes without additional fertilisers/manure. This suggests that the crops grown obtain sufficient nutrients only from groundwater resources. However, the sustainability of cultivation in these ephemeral waterways is still questionable.

AB This paper explores possibilities for achieving 'wise use', defined as the sustainable utilisation of resources of the Okavango Delta system, within the framework of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. The paper argues that while the Ramsar Convention's wise use strategic plan forms an important basis for collective action toward sustainably managing the Okavango River Basin as a whole, there are numerous barriers to success, the most important of which is the abiding behaviour of the region's state-makers in defense of sovereignty and pursuit of narrow national interest. In spite of this formidable barrier to success, the paper highlights a number of on-going multilateral activities that may serve to further the aims of wise use of the Okavango River Basin system. It also provides a number of practical suggestions for furthering progressive frameworks of action. The paper is based on a close reading of published and unpublished written materials and the findings of a number of open-ended interviews conducted with stakeholders active in the Okavango River Basin.

DE natural groundwater recharge; sustainable water use
AB This paper focuses on balancing groundwater recharge and abstraction rates as a mechanism of ensuring sustainability of groundwater use. It uses a case study which was done in the Kizinga catchment area where its recharge rates were evaluated and then compared to that of abstraction. The study area is drained by river Kizinga having its upper reaches in Pugu and Kisarawe hills with a total surface area of 191 km2. Determination of groundwater recharge rates gave a mean value of 52.8 mm/year which is equivalent to 10.1 x 10(6) m(3)/year indicating that, 4.7% of the long term mean annual precipitation of 1124 rum ends up as groundwater recharge. Borehole yields was 3.4 x 10(6) m(3)/year by the year 1997. Two years later the total yield tripled to 9.1 x 10(6) m(3)/year which is an increase of about 179% of groundwater production. Based on the study findings, it is therefore suggested that proper management of groundwater utilization be established to balance recharge with discharge. This will ensure that groundwater abstraction is done sustainably and thus avoid negative consequences resulting from groundwater depletion. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The semi-arid savannah environment (SASE) of sub-Saharan Africa are characterized by low erratic rainfall which result to high risk of droughts, intra-seasonal dry spells and frequent food insecurity. The main occupation is subsistence small-scale rainfed agriculture and livestock production, which normally compete for the limited water resources. The main challenges to improving the livelihoods of the small-scale farmers are how to upgrade rainfed agriculture to improve rural livelihoods and conserve nature, and upgrade upstream landuse in balance with water needs for human and ecosystems downstream. There is an increased interest in opportunities of improving rainfed agriculture through adoption of rainwater harvesting (RWH) technologies. However, there is inadequate knowledge on hydrological impacts and limits of up-scaling rainwater harvesting at a river basin scale. Rainwater harvesting has a potential of addressing spatial and temporal water scarcity for domestic, crop production, livestock development, environmental management and overall water resources management is SASE. However, this potential has not been exploited despite the occurrence of persistent low agricultural production and food shortage in sub-Saharan Africa. The need to quantify this perceived potential and related hydrological impacts on a river basin led to the on-going research project titled "hydrological impacts of up-scaling RWH on upper Ewaso Ng'iro river basin water resources management". It is envisaged that the study will contribute to formulation of sustainable RWH up-scaling strategies to enhance food production and hydro-ecological balance in semi-arid savannahs of Africa. This paper presents the preliminary findings of the study mainly focusing on assessment of the potential of RWH technologies for improving food and water availability especially in semi-arid regions of eastern Africa. This was achieved by evaluating six RWH case studies selected from four countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda). Despite the success of a number of RWH systems, the rate of adoption is still low, hence making their impacts marginal. Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap on the limits of up-scaling RWH in a river basin, which the other components of the study will address. The assessment of the hydrological impact of up-scaling RWH technologies is expected to provide answers to the question, what is the limit of up-scaling rainwater harvesting in a river basin?

AB Effective and sustainable management of water resources is vital for ensuring sustainable development. However, efforts of water resource management seem to demonstrate inappropriate practices, especially when compared to water consumption trends in developing countries in general, and sub-Saharan Africa in particular. Being a major and vital ingredient to human kind, water resources influence all sectors. However, there have been increased problems over time that subject water resources to a number of crisis and pressures. Poor water resources management have stimulated and sustained a number of problems related to health, socioeconomic and environment, which need to be solved. These problems are accelerated and magnified by the countries', communities' and individuals' struggles for economic and social development as many development initiatives are affected by water availability and vice versa. Integrated water resources management (IWRM), is a process, a change, and an approach that mainstream water resource use and management into the national economic in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. This paper analyses the importance of community participation in the process of IWRM. The paper describes reasons that justify the need for an IWRM approach and explains the rationale for community participation. Successful cases in community involvement have been cited from different areas to demonstrate the importance of IWRM. The paper concludes that the public/ community involvement is crucial for a successful and sustainable water resource management. It has been emphasized that natural resources management related policies including water requires the use of knowledge, experience and opinions of local communities who are the key stakeholders in resource conservation. This could be ensured through public/community participation. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the past 50 years, changes in the intersectoral water use in the Rufiji Basin have been enormous. A growing human population, migration and increasing demands in the basin have culminated this change. The basin, however, still lack an appropriate integrated management approach. This has resulted into inter-institutional conflicts, ineffectiveness, gaps in management imperatives and duplication of efforts. This paper reviews the existing institutional linkages identifies the gap and proposes an appropriate institutional framework which involve questions of institutional arrangements and the assignment of responsibilities among various levels of development, ensures stakeholders participation, accommodates adaptive change and remain self sustainable. The basic argument of this paper is that water management issue is both a question of developing stakeholders' participation and transferring state's competence to water user associations. Such an endeavour requires a complete and complex institutional framework, which would define clearly the role and rule of each stakeholder in water resource management. The paper further argues that; in Tanzania, the institutions that are involved in water management are loosely connected and lack basic coordination and are often at the periphery of the water management agenda-divorced from the water management programs; the predominance of isolated institutions locked up in narrowly defined activities with no interactive learning process will continue to hamper national aspirations to manage water; and that to change this situation will require innovative reforms in national institutions and institutional learning.

AB Water resources management in Lake Manyara sub-basin is an issue of very high significance as the sub-basin hosts a number of national and global assets of great socio-cultural, ecological and economic values. The sub-basin comprise of a Biosphere Reserve with boosting tourism from Lake Manyara National Park with a variety of wildlife population, large livestock population and highly fertile land for agricultural production. The prevailing system of uncoordinated water resources management in the sub-basin cannot sustain the ever increasing water needs of the various expanding sectors, therefore a strategy must be sought to integrate the various sectoral needs against the available water resources in order to attain both economic and ecological sustainability. Through participatory approach with the stakeholders, the study has established key issues, demonstrated considerable experience in water resources management in the sub-basin including existence of water boards, water committees in some districts as well as land resources management practices However, a number of constraints were noted which inhibit sustainable water resources management including ignorance of water policies, conflicting sectoral policies, lack of coordination between sectors, high in migration rates into the basin, heavy in migration of livestock, conflicts between sectors, poor land use resulting in soil erosion and sedimentation, lack of comprehensive data base on water resources and water needs for : domestic, tourism, livestock, irrigation, wild life and environmental flows. As a way forward it was recommended that a basin wide legally mandated body (involving all levels) be established to oversee water use in the sub-basin. Other strategies include capacity building of stakeholders on water natural resources management policies, water rights and enforcement of laws. This progress report paper highlights the wealth of knowledge that stakeholders possess on water resources management and using that platform develop a participatory Integrated water resources management where roles and responsibilities are ironed out.

AB This paper focuses on irrigation, water management, and development in Chitsungo ward in the Zambezi valley. The paper is an analysis of how the Dande irrigation project, which is mid-way under construction, has and is perceived to affect the local people. As such it centers on how the potential beneficiaries of the scheme are trying to adapt the project to their life world. This analysis therefore looks into why and how new patterns of relationships shape themselves around crucial resources such as water and land. The contention throughout the paper is that the project structure and organization have not only to be feasible from the technical point of view but also must be sustainable in socio-economic and institutional terms. I argue in the paper that consistent with national policies, interventions must be formulated to enhance cost recovery and cost efficiency while at the same time addressing key institutional issues such as leadership legitimacy, regulations and legislation, responsibility and accountability, and requisite skills within which beneficiary participation is enhanced. It is against this background that water management comes as a central and potentially explosive issue in irrigation management. For practical purposes of policy-making, planning and implementing a people-friendly irrigation project, this paper highlights some of the overlooked cultural and social processes of change, together with the consequences and outcomes of such interventions.

AB Most vital surface water bodies in developing countries are under serious threat of degradation resulting from constant discharge of polluted effluents stemming from industrial, agricultural, mining and domestic/sewage activities. The most affected river systems are those traversing cities and towns in urban areas. The Kafue River in Zambia is one such river system that is threatened with serious degradation and probable loss of biodiversity. Kafue River cuts across the country in a North-South direction, stretches for about 1576 kin before draining into the Zambezi River. It covers an area of 152,000 km(2) and generates a mean annual runoff of 350 m(3)/s which represents about 12% of the Zambezi's mean annual runoff at the confluence [Water Resources Development and Vector-borne Diseases in Zambia: Report of a National Seminar held at Kafue Gorge, Zambia, WHO, Geneva, 1995]. The area coverage of the Kafue River Basin (KRB) is approximately 20% of Zambia's land area (743,000 km(2)) and approximately 17% of the Zambezi Basin [Water Resources Use in the Zambezi Basin: Proceedings of a Workshop held at Kasane, Botswana, IUCN, 1993]. More than half of Zambia's population live in the KRB, of which about 65% are in urban while 35% are in rural areas. Over the years, however, the Kafue River has been receiving all sorts of pollutant and effluents from all sectors of economical development in Zambia that include mining, industrial and agricultural. The continuous discharge of pollutants into the Kafue river has led to the deterioration of the river water quality. The consequences have been heightened eutrophic conditions, increased heavy metal concentration in the river sediments and aquatic life, increased suspended solids, etc. leading to proliferation of Salvinia molesta in some sections of the river, decreased fish catch and fish size and objectionable taste of the Kafue River water. Fishermen along the Chanyanya-Kafue Gorge stretch of the Kafue River have complained about the alleged loss of taste and the decrease in both the fish catch and size in these areas of the Kafue River. The communities along the same stretch have also complained about the objectionable taste of the river water [Report of the Proceedings of the First Multi-sectoral Workshop on the Effects of Environmental Pollution and Degradation on the Kafue River Basin (KRB) on the Community in the Kafue Town Area, AREZ, 2001]. This paper reviews the water quality of the Kafue River resulting from anthropogenic activities and proposes the framework for the sustainable management of river water quality.

AB Human health and development are threatened in many parts. of the world either from lack of water or poor water quality. Human development has partially contributed to water quality deterioration. In Tanzania, for instance, rapid population growth that caused expansion of agricultural activities, livestock keeping, deforestation, biomass burning and human settlement have exerted pressures within the Lake Victoria Basin. These developments have led to land degradation and increased levels of pollution mainly from non-point sources. The Governments of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda initiated the program of Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project, (LVEMP), in 1994 to rehabilitate the Lake Ecosystem through restoration and conservation of biodiversity in the lake as well as within the catchment. This paper presents the five years (1997-2002) experience of LVEMP in Tanzania on the issues of water quality; focusing on water pollution, water quality monitoring and LVEMP strategies to accomplish water quality management in the Lake Zone (Kagera, Mara and Mwanza regions). The findings show that non-point source pollution from agricultural practices; as well as unplanned urban settlements contribute more to siltation and eutrophication of the of Lake Victoria than that from point source pollution. Recommendations for water quality management and sustainability are presented. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID ZIMBABWE
AB Sustainable use of water resources requires the integration of demand management with source quality management. The City of Harare is a case in point, where wastewater and runoff from the city flow into its reservoirs. Little has yet been established on the quality of runoff from home industries in the high-density urban environment. In Harare, most of these are located close to streams draining into the city's reservoirs. The impact of runoff from different land uses on water quality in a tributary of the Marimba River, Kuwadzana high-density suburb, Harare, was assessed. The water quality from two sub-catchments, one of which contained home industries and residential areas and the other, which contained residential areas only, was compared over the 2001-2002 rainy season. It was found that phosphate (1.08 mg/l), TKN (3.2 mg/l), ammonia (1.14 mg/1), faecal coliforms (1000/100 ml), iron (6.9 mg/ l), and lead (0.53 mg/l) were the major water quality pollutants. The SCS-SA model was used to estimate the runoff in different sampling points. Pollution loads for certain parameters were, on average, four times higher in the sub-catchment containing home industries (287 kg total phosphates, 319 kg TKN nitrate, 115 kg ammonia, 744 kg iron and 41 kg lead), than in the sub-catchment containing residential areas only (74kg total phosphates, 50 kg TKN nitrate, 21 kg ammonia, 138 kg iron and 12 kg lead). This is due to the higher runoff volumes from the area containing the home industries, while the pollution concentrations at both representative points where not statistically different. Accordingly, it is recommended that the City authorities should reassess current practice and make provision for sewer and drainage systems and adequate disposal of solid and hazardous wastes in areas zoned for home industries and to improve the solid waste management in high-density areas. Efforts should be made to control the storage of materials and scrap in these areas. Most importantly, the City should reconsider the current practice of zoning home industries close to streams.

AB Sustainability is one of the main goals to achieve in order to guarantee a future for future generations and requires, among other issues, the recourse to renewable energy sources and the minimization of waste production. These two issues are contemporarily achieved when converting waste and residual biomass into energy.
   This paper presents an innovative concept for energy conversion of the abovementioned residual fuels; it combines a rotary-kiln pyrolyser, where the residual energy sources are converted into a medium lower heating value (LHV) syngas, with a gas turbine that produces energy, and also provides waste heat to maintain the endothermic pyrolysis reaction. Byproducts of the reaction include char and tars that have an interesting energetic content and may also be used to provide supplementary heat to the process.
   Through software modelling the paper analyses the influence on performance of main thermodynamic parameters, showing the possibilities of reaching an optimum for different working conditions that are characteristic of different sizes of gas turbines. This is interesting both for medium-to-big size power plants, where the IPRP efficiency is comparable to a grate-based incinerator, but at lower investment costs, and in the micro-small scale, for which there is no available technology on the market.

DE organization design (OD); lean thinking; high-reliability theory (HRT)
AB This paper illustrates how recent tragedies have been shown to be threatening to the medium-term sustainability of organizations designed and developed solely on the basis of short-term efficiency gain. Over the past 30 years, Western organizations have institutionalized this emphasis on efficiencies through the implementation of Japanese management philosophies, such as lean thinking. This situation has assisted the removal of vital adaptive and responsive,capacity or 'organizational slack' necessary for organizations that need-to contend with complex and dynamic environments. The authors argue for the need to Challenge managerial mindsets and re-engage a purpose and organizational configuration. In pluralist metaperspective both at the level of strategic purpose and organizational configuration. In particular, it suggests that, in addition to the efficiency model, a: complementary and to some extent alternative set of 'high-reliability' organization (HRO) design principles are required. They focus on the notion of creating an HRO that privileges integrity in the achievement of medium- and long. term goals over short-term efficiency gains. Integrating both 'lean thinking' and 'high-reliability' principles is a requirement for post-modern managers operating in their roles as organizational engineers, if mission accomplishment is to be realized.

AB While lean principles (developed by Womack and Jones) have been applied successfully to manufacturing and operations processes in many companies their application to engineering or new product introduction processes has been lacking. This paper introduces the principles of 'lean engineering' through some simple definitions, based on the original lean principles, and by describing applications of those principles in the aerospace industry via three case studies. The three case studies demonstrated the application of lean at three different levels of 'process' hierarchy, a detailed design activity level, a project management level and a design strategy level. The study concluded that while the application of lean principles in aerospace engineering processes (within new product introduction) is feasible for both large and small companies, the presence of a coherent and sustainable methodology was missing, as well as proper application of supporting management tools and technology.

AB To change the negative effect of traffic increase and to diminish noxious pollutant emission and environmentally harmful consequences of the car's life cycle, innovative tools and radically changed approaches are needed. The present proposal of assessing the car and its environmentally related technological and functional factors as part of the entire mobility production process shows the applicability of ISO 14001 standards to the entire car process and could be a concrete aid to reaching the current European and international objectives and strongly encouraging environmentally friendly car design, manufacturing and lifestyles. The car influences the environment during every stage of its life cycle. This paper analyses and demonstrates the real possibility of certifying, through ISO 14001 standards, instead of an industrial site or organization, a car process. The car process is the part of the mobility production process implemented in car use. Environmental management systems (EMSs) have been developed to improve the environmental performance of organizations towards the diffusion of sustainability in industrial production. The ISO 14000 series of international standards are the most important reference for eco-management of any type of organization. The two target groups involved in the car process environmental certification procedures set are manufacturers/suppliers on the one hand, interested in environmentally compatible new markets and products, and clients/users on the other hand, interested in testing benefits and problems of the EMS set-up and general environmental sustainability behaviours. The car model analysed for the case study application is the Toyota Prius, from the environmental point of view one of the best on the market, precursor model of the next-generation electric hybrid vehicles.

DE environment; population; transport trends; pollution; energy; railways
AB A combination of a rapidly increasing world population and an increasing energy-intensive lifestyle has led to doubts about the sufficiency of natural resources. The waste products of these economic activities have become large enough to change the climate of the globe. The demand for transport is characterized by an exponential increase and a tendency to choose faster modes. These facts give rise to concerns about the sustainability of present transport practices.
   While railways presently offer significant environmental advantages over other modes of transport, particularly the car, in many areas the gap is closing quickly. Cars are much safer, more energy efficient and less polluting than a decade ago. Trains in the future will have to contend with reducing hydrocarbon fuel supplies and much stricter legislation limiting emissions, particularly diesel particulates. Because the energy environmental performance of trains depends on the passenger load factor, the areas in which railways excel are high-speed intercity and commuting. Both these activities are well served by electric traction.
   With very few exceptions railway companies have not yet responded to significant environmental challenges. The oft-stated complacent view, that railways are environmentally superior to other modes of transport, fails to recognize that the competition is rapidly eroding their lead.

AB In the transportation sector, the search for cost reduction has led to the introduction of composite materials. This paper focuses on filament wound containers made of natural fibres and rubber. These containers show great potential for application in developing countries, where usage of locally grown materials is often justified considering the high prices and mediocre quality of the locally available synthetic fibres, if already available. Where containers reinforced with synthetic fibres will not be able to compete with existing steel containers, which are often imported, the ones made of sustainable natural fibres show great potential. The cost reduction is primarily based on the philosophy of making use of the local situation: local manufacturing of locally designed products with locally grown materials for transportation of local consumables for the local market. In this article, the integrated design procedure of a natural fibre wound container taking these local aspects into account is discussed. A feasibility study on such a container for the Vietnamese market is described, showing significant improvements in economy and sustainability.

TI Integrated economic and environmental planning in Asia: a review of
   progress and proposals for policy reform
SO PROGRESS IN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Governments and development specialists in Asia are publicly committed to the sustainable development concept. However, there is little evidence that Asian nations are making real progress towards sustainable development, despite signing global and regional agreements on the environment, establishing new environmental agencies, preparing national sustainable development plans, and requiring environmental impact assessments for development projects.
   This article identifies a missing link in the nested hierarchy of sustainable development plans in Asia, which may be one of the reasons why intentions at the national level are not being translated into sustainable development at the local level (where the social-economic-environmental interactions are most commonly realized). This missing link is integrated economic-cum-environmental (E-c-E) planning at the sub-national level.
   The article investigates five case studies of integrated E-c-E planning at the sub-national level, through a process of collaborative action research and the case study method. Findings from the case studies are combined with qualitative data from an analysis of success factors and constraints from the literature on sustainable development planning at other levels (from global to project) and other regions, using an iterative process of pattern matching.
   The results of this analysis are used to derive a checklist and decision trees to guide development specialists in deciding whether to proceed with an integrated E-c-E planning study at the subnational level in Asia. The article also shows how to improve the design of integrated E-c-E studies to increase the probability of successful outcomes. The probable resource implications of these changes are discussed. The article concludes that an improved approach to integrated E-c-E planning at the sub-national level may play a pivotal role in the hierarchy of planning and thus assist in leading Asian nations towards sustainable development, and provides some ideas for further application and investigation.

TI Transport policy and health inequalities: a health impact assessment of
   Edinburgh's transport policy
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article

ID RESIDENTS; MORTALITY
AB Health impact assessment (HIA) can be used to examine the relationships between inequalities and health. This HIA of Edinburgh's transport policy demonstrates how HIA can examine how different transport policies can affect different population groupings to varying degrees.
   In this case, Edinburgh's economy is based on tourism, financial. services and Government bodies. These need a good transport infrastructure, which maintains a vibrant city centre. A transport policy that promotes walking, cycling and public transport supports this and is also good for health.
   The HIA suggested that greater spend on public transport and supporting sustainable modes of transport was beneficial. to health, and offered scope to reduce inequalities. This message was understood by the City Council and influenced the development of the city's transport and land-use strategies. The paper discusses how HIA can influence public policy.

SO PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS

DT Article
AB As the HIV epidemic has changed nationally, the parallel change in the Southern states has been a disproportionate increase in HIV infection among people of color and among women. Due to the limited and disjointed health care and social service resources in rural marginalized groups have difficulty in accessing appropriate care and services to address their HIV infection seamlessly and with continuity. To ameliorate the limitations in the health care infrastructure, the North Carolina Services Integration Project collaborated with North Carolina medical and social service providers and state agencies to create a sustainable and replicable model of integrated care for HIV-positive, geographically dispersed residents.

AB Adopting the perspective of human health risk assessment, an interdisciplinary research group has been investigating since 1998 the quality of mussels and oysters cultivated in coastal zones of Santa Catarina State. Evaluation of physico-chemical parameters considered relevant in measuring the degree of eutrophication showed values compatible with the dynamics of well balanced environmental systems. Concentrations of metallic and semi-metallic elements in seawater and bivalves were found to be similar to or lower than those found in Chile, Greenland and the USA. Further investigations focusing upon sediments will provide new and useful data for the management of sustainable mariculture strategies in Brazil.

AB New technologies are having a widespread impact on new product development (NPD) projects. In the telecommunication industry, companies. are forced to integrate 'old' and 'new' ways of working with the utilization of unknown technologies. There is an emerging need to develop sustainable work systems. This paper investigates the complex relationship between NPD and the sustainability of the work systems in which it is organized. A proposed framework for analysis is followed by an examination of a specific NPD project at Ericsson.

   ground-based monitoring and pastoral culture in Central Australia
SO RANGELAND JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE range condition; monitoring; range policy; participatory management;
   local knowledge
AB Ground-based monitoring of rangeland condition is common in Australian pastoral administration systems. In the Northern Territory (NT), such monitoring is officially seen as a key plank of sustainable pastoral land use. In the NT and elsewhere, these monitoring schemes have sought to increase participation by pastoralists. Involvement of pastoralists in monitoring is theoretically an educative process that will cause pastoralists to more critically examine their management practices. Critical perspectives on the relationship between rangelands science/extension and pastoralist knowledge systems and concerns, however, suggest that pastoralists' reception of such monitoring schemes will be influenced by a range of social contexts, including the character of pastoralist environmental knowledge. Fieldwork with pastoralists in Central Australia shows that the process by which pastoral environmental knowledge develops has rich experiential, historical and social dimensions. These contexts play a role in framing pastoral environmental knowledge and in shaping pastoralists' interpretations of environmental events and information from other parties. Pastoralists will assess information from monitoring in light of these contexts. The nature of the ground-based monitoring scheme is such that the very environmental knowledge that it seeks to reform may in fact be confirmed or otherwise interact with pastoral knowledge in unanticipated ways. Lack of systematic evaluation of the scheme and of pastoral environmental knowledge, however, precludes definitive judgements at this stage. The apparently central role of monitoring in NT pastoral land administration, however, suggests that the assumptions underlying the scheme and its implementation be reassessed.

ID MANAGEMENT; AUSTRALIA; QUEENSLAND; CATTLE
AB The pastoral industry in northern Australia has been relatively stable over the past 100 years and has persisted despite a variable climate, uncertain markets and variable prices. However, change is occurring at a rapid pace and to stay economically viable and environmentally sustainable in the future the pastoral industry must deal proactively with the continuous cost-price squeeze and growing environmental awareness in society at large We contend that controlling these factors involves targeted intensification of effort to minimise costs, maximise opportunities to improve productivity, and demonstrated environmental standards to increase product value, building on the most effective use of new communications technologies, a better integration with the values of other inhabitants of the region, and processes from continuous learning. Pastoralists will also need to be ever vigilant about external drivers of change, over which they have no control, and be prepared to adapt early to cope with these external influences.

TI Global influences on rangelands of Australia
SO RANGELAND JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE global; rangelands; sustainability; multi-functionality; markets; trade
AB Globalisation is a key pressure affecting the current and future use of the rangelands of Australia. While primary producers often perceive an insatiable demand for food as a guarantee of business success, declining population growth rates and high levels of productivity improvement in world food production are reducing the importance of food and fibre from the rangelands. This, combined with significant changes in consumer demands, is driving rangeland producers to meet market specifications for quality, safety, animal welfare and sustainability.
   Sustainability is a particular challenge with the rangelands certain to be affected by global warming and the politics and strategies required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Currently the rangelands produce a higher proportion of greenhouse gases compared with their contribution to the economy. However, they also provide an opportunity for carbon sequestration.
   While international trade liberalisation has been of advantage to the grazing industries in the rangelands, increased global awareness of the Australian rangelands, facilitated by the communications revolution, is encouraging alternative uses including tourism, existence value and other conservation and biodiversity management uses. The growing concept of multi-functionality will also impact on the rangelands as international government programs continue to encourage non-commercial, surplus production of food.
   These influences are forcing major changes in the way land is used and what it produces.

CY SEP, 2002
CL KALGOORLIE, AUSTRALIA
SP Australian Rangeland Soc
AB Australian rangelands have been perceived as supporting mainly a pastoral economy for more than 150 years. This perception originated from colonial expansion in a frontier economy, with State and Commonwealth institutions established to support rangeland pastoralism. As Australia's economy shifts in focus towards sustainable development within a free and unprotected market, a new economic and social paradigm is needed for the rangelands. This is essential for strengthening regional economies in the rangelands that can survive in a globalised economy, preservation of environmental values in Australian rangelands, development of new land-use opportunities, as well as to facilitate a dignified change for those enterprises that are increasingly marginalised from the mainstream Australian and global economies. This paper explores the significance of rangelands in the Australian economy at national and regional scales, and the significance of grazing in the rangeland economy. It then considers how the grazing industry should be viewed within an alternative economic and social paradigm for rangelands in the 21(st) century-a paradigm that focuses on regional instead of sectoral economic opportunities and constraints.

AB There has been substantial loss of biodiversity in the Australian rangelands, and evidence suggests that the attrition is continuing. We argue that rangeland users should be more aware of, and concerned about, this problem: that we are sullying an international asset; that we are undermining the basis of a major rangeland industry, tourism; that we are sabotaging the potential for the development of alternative rangeland uses (most notably sustainable use of native wildlife); that such losses provide evidence that we are poor managers; that such losses diminish our lives; that such losses indicate that at least some of our environments are operating at reduced functionality; and that such losses take away or reduce important and wide-ranging environmental services.
   This loss is due to a complex array of factors, each affecting different components of biodiversity in different ways. Our responses are generally poorly coordinated across rangeland jurisdictions, and there is uncertainty about responsibilities across different land tenures. Given the diffuse but pervasive nature of the problem and the generally poorly coordinated and non-strategic current response, we suggest that biodiversity conservation needs to be far more clearly and systematically operationalised, that a clear goal for biodiversity conservation in the rangelands (maintenance of viable populations of all native species of plants and animals at appropriate spatial and temporal scales) needs to be developed, and that, from this, the community needs to set explicit targets relating to this goal, at continental, jurisdiction, regional and property scales. While we recognise that our existing knowledge base is imperfect, such limitation should not delay the implementation of these steps. We consider that there is sufficient management expertise to realise a rangeland biodiversity goal. However, there are two more serious impediments in achieving the goal: current lack of resources and of societal agreement.

AB In order to be preferred land-users of the Australian rangelands, mining operations should legacy net environmental, social and economic benefits in the regions that they operate. The positive and negative environmental implications of the Olympic Dam mine in and South Australia are compared in this study. Criteria assessed include the relative area of affected versus improved landscape, environmental research, pest control and the facilitation of proactive conservation and sustainable diversification outcomes. A call is made for consistent treatment of potential environmental impacts across all rangeland users and the adoption of biodiversity trading to improve regional conservation outcomes. A challenge is issued to miners and other rangeland land-users to demonstrate that, like bilbies, their net environmental effects are beneficial.

SO RANGELAND JOURNAL

DT Article
DE land use change; pastoralism; rangelands; sustainability
AB The importance, use and management of Australia's grazed rangelands are being questioned. Financial returns from pastoralism have declined for some and there is increasing interest in alternative land uses. There are also concerns for the protection of natural resources and the conservation of biodiversity. As a result many rangeland users and residents consider that the pastoral rangelands are at a point when substantial and radical change in the way they are used, administered and managed must be implemented. One perspective on the future values the rangelands for all natural resource values that provide sustainable incomes for its residents, strives for more integrated natural resource management, involves the development of more tightly integrated regional economies, and facilitates an increased influence of local communities in guiding land use in their regions. These changes offer many opportunities for individual sectors and for cross-sectoral benefits, cooperation and integration. They offer truly complementary options for future use, although there are still likely to be conflicts over land use. To realise these opportunities will require legislative reform, improved knowledge and skills in pastoralists, legislators and advisers, and better planning processes that engage all stakeholders, set appropriate targets, have land capability as a basis for land use decisions and provide for satisfactory conflict resolution. An understanding of the ecological and economic implications of a new mix of land uses is also required.

AB The aim of the MMiSS project is the construction of a multimedia Internet-based adaptive educational system. Its content will initially cover a curriculum in the area of Safe and Secure Systems. Traditional teaching materials (slides, handouts, annotated course material, assignments, and so on) are to be converted into a new hypermedia format, integrated with tool interactions for formally developing correct software; they will be suitable for learning on campus and distance learning, as well as interactive, supervised, or co-operative self-study. To ensure "sustainable development", i.e. continuous long-term usability of the contents, coherence and consistency are especially emphasised, through extensive semantic linking of teaching elements and a particular version and configuration management, based on experience in formal software development and associated support tools.

AB We present a Unified Authority File for Names for use with the FAO Catalogue. This authority file will include all authorized forms of names, and can be used for highly precise resource discovery, as well as for record sharing. Other approaches of creating unified authority files are discussed. A major advantage of our proposal lies in the ease and sustainability of sharing records across authority files. The public would benefit from the Unified Authority File with its possibilities for cross-collection searching, and metadata creators would also have a greater possibility to utilize bibliographic records from other collections. A case study describes the treatment and use of corporate body names used in the catalogue of The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

AB The article presents an economic analysis of Libre software and of its sustainability as a new economic model for software. We underline the role of Libre software development communities and analyze incentives for both kernel and obscure developers. We emphasize the role of the so-called 'public' licenses to provide an appropriate institutional framework. We show that several features of Libre software also allow it to improve faster than proprietary software, and therefore to achieve strong market performance when competing against existing standards, even when proprietary software producers react. We illustrate our point using a simple local and global interaction model to study the technological competition between Linux and Windows on the server operating system (OS) market. We finally argue that if sufficient initial momentum could be created through public intervention Libre software could turn from a fad into an efficient economic institution to correct inefficiencies due to network externalities.

ID SOLID-WASTE
AB This paper intends to set out clearly defined criteria for evaluating sustainability in solid waste management and have them illustrated by a modern Chinese city-Hong Kong. Following a thorough literature review, four evaluative criteria are derived: environmental desirability, economic optimization, social acceptability and equity and administrative diligence. These four criteria are then applied in the context of Hong Kong for the evaluation of the management performance of construction and demolition waste, clinical waste and chemical waste. Although the need to attain sustainability is compelling in Hong Kong, our analysis shows that the management of construction and demolition waste, clinical waste and chemical waste has failed in almost all the sustainability criteria. In terms of controlling the environmental impact from waste management, only end of pipe treatment is adequately delivered but preventive waste management programs are far from adequate. In terms of waste management economics, economic incentives have yet to be instituted for most waste generators. Thus, the present levels of waste generation in Hong Kong far exceed social and economic optimal. Furthermore, although Hong Kong has been commended by having an efficient government, the ability of the government to induce environmentally responsible behavior from private waste generators is weak and thus failing the administrative diligence criterion as well. In the management of the three types of waste, the welfare of future generations is often sacrificed for the narrower, sectoral or district community interests. The myopic environmental welfare view in the Hong Kong community is a logical result of the minimal effort devoted to build up social capital stock and environmental citizenship culture.

DE anaerobic and aerobic system; rubber-based processing; rock bed
   filtration; water conservation and reuse
AB After Malaysia, Thailand is the world second largest exporter of natural rubber. However, the processing of natural rubber prior to manufacture into rubber products requires excessive use of groundwater for its operation and discharges considerable quantities of wastewater. Overexploitation of groundwater from aquifer creates a serious threat to the source of potable water supply. Therefore, there is much need to develop sustainable practices for the improvement of in-plant wastewater control and recycling management. The overall water balance for the whole factory shows that 70% of the wastewater is generated from the washing process and ends up in the wastewater treatment plant. With the aim to reduce raw water consumption and amount of wastewater discharge to a nearby river, the concepts of water conservation and wastewater reuse are incorporated as a package of the improved wastewater treatment system. For water reuse purpose, an activated sludge plant coupled with anaerobic and aerobic systems is recommended to upgrade the existing wastewater treatment system. By employing rock bed filtration for polishing effluent of treatment plant, raw water consumption is reduced by 69% and achieves a 77% reduction in the water discharged to the river.

AB In this paper I analyze the relationship between fiscal policy, aggregate public sector debt sustainability, and debt relief I develop a methodology to compute the fiscal policy path that is compatible with aggregate debt sustainability in the post-HIPC era. The model explicitly considers the role of domestic debt and quantifies the extent to which future debt sustainability depends on the availability of concessional loans at subsidized interest rates. The working of the model is illustrated for the case of Nicaragua, a country that in 2002 had one of the highest net present value of public external debt to GDP ratios.

AB This study estimates the equilibrium real and nominal exchange rates for five Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. A new approach is adopted, which combines the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) with the behavioural equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) methodology. In a VAR-based 3-equation cointegration system, we estimate structural equations for internal and external balances and link them to the real exchange rate. The estimated misalignment is used to derive equilibrium nominal exchange rates. The sustainability of an ERM-II-type exchange rate regime is investigated on ex post data, and the credibility problem of fixing the currencies of CEE countries vis-a-vis the single European currency is analysed.

AB Concern for the sustainability of spiny lobster (Decapoda: Palinuridae) fisheries has created significant interest in their aquaculture. However, attempts to culture spiny lobsters from eggs to puerulus have been largely unsuccessful, hampered by provision of unsuitable diets during the long phyllosoma larval phase. This review summarizes the current understanding of phyllosoma feeding and digestive biology, and collates the findings of previous culture trials. It draws attention to gaps in our knowledge and suggests avenues for future research aimed at bridging these gaps. Finally, it makes recommendations for Culture diets based on our current understanding. Problems associated with the provision of live feeds such as Artemia salina (e.g., bacterial contamination) suggest that formulated diets may be most appropriate. An improved understanding of the feeding behavior, natural dietary preferences, nutritional profiles, and digestive capabilities of phyllosoma will identify the size, texture, and nutritional characteristics of a suitable formulated diet. Based on recent morphological and behavioral evidence presented in this review, soft, possibly microencapsulated diets (gelatin/alginate coated) appear to be the most promising formulated diet for early stage larvae, followed by fleshier prey (such as fish larvae) in later stages.

ID RAIN-FOREST PECCARIES
AB The use of automatic feed barrel with grain corn as a methodology to mark, recapture and management of white-lipped pecaries (Tayassu pecari) reintroduced on a Savanna area located at Mato Grosso do Sul State was tested. Using this technique we could compare the weight gain managing animals on extensive (freedom on the area) and semi-extensive systems (restricted to a 15ha area), and examine reproductive biology aspects of this specie. The management of white-lipped peccaries on the extensive system provided a greater weight gain to the animals. The automatic feed barrel with grain corn showed to be efficient to attract and aggregate the white-lipped peccaries but also provided supplemental energy. Using the mark and recapture method we could note that this animals reproduce all over the year, breeding 1,57 pig-lets/female/parturition, with the proportion between sex of 50%. Gross productivity was 1,4 and gross fecundity = 0,4. The adoption of extensive systems to manage white-lipped peccaries could be a solution to sustainable exploration of this specie at places where this resource is explored as a subsistence source through illegal hunting.

TI Implementation, sustainability, and scaling up of social-emotional and
   academic innovations in public schools
SO SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID FULL-SERVICE SCHOOLS; PREVENTION PROGRAMS; SETTINGS; INTERVENTION;
   IMPROVEMENT; PSYCHOLOGY; FRAMEWORK; REFORM
AB Many attempts at bringing successful educational programs and products "to scale" as part of school reform, particularly in urban districts, have been disappointing. Based on the experiences of the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) and reviews of literature addressing implementation failures, observations about failures to "scale up" are presented. These include persistent structural features in educational settings that are too often unrecognized, the perpetuation of a narrow and decontextualized "programs and packages" perspective, poor management of time and other resources, and inadequate attention to characteristics of the adults who must carry out planned reforms. Several assumptions essential for success are identified, including the need to incorporate social and emotional learning as an integral part of academics and the ways in which diversity provides an ever-changing context for implementation. Concluding thoughts center around three points: the need to prepare professionals with the array of skills needed to lead efforts at scaling up school reform, the importance of an action-research perspective, and the need to better document the stories of educational innovation and scaling up efforts so that contextual details can enrich an understanding of what is required for success.

DT Article
ID INNER-CITY CHILDREN; CARE; INVOLVEMENT; BEHAVIOR
AB A program of research related to school-based models for urban children's mental health is described, with a particular focus on improving access to services, promoting children's functioning, and providing for program sustainability. The first study in this series responded to the urgent need to engage more families in mental health services, and results showed dramatically greater involvement of parents in school-based services relative to clinic-based services. To enhance teacher collaboration, the second study involved training teacher key opinion leaders (KOL) on selected classroom practices for children with ADHD. Classroom teachers with support from the KOL teachers reported significantly higher use of these practices compared to teachers receiving no KOL support. The third study is, part of a recent collaboration with the Illinois Office of Mental Health and the Chicago Public Schools, and employs a multitiered approach to service delivery, including the involvement of influential parents and teachers in the provision of mental health services. Future directions for mental health practice and research are described.

AB We proposed a novel method to fabricate nano/micro-scaled patterns of thin films and successfully fabricated patterns of anatase TiO2 thin films in an aqueous solution at 50 degrees C. The patterned self-assembled monolayer (SAM) having octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) regions and silanol regions was immersed in a solution containing a Ti precursor and subjected to ultrasonication for several hours. The difference in adhesion of thin films on substrates was employed for the site-selective elimination method. Heterogeneously nucleated TiO2 and homogeneously nucleated TiO2 particles adhering to the OTS-SAM could be easily eliminated from the substrate by ultrasonication, whereas those on silanol groups maintained their adhesion during the immersion period. TiO2 can form chemical bonds such as Ti-O-Si with silanol groups, but cannot form them with octadecyl groups, resulting in the difference in adhesion, which is the essence of the site-selectivity of this method. The site-selective elimination method can be applied to fabricate nano/micro-scaled patterns in the solution by the immersion of the substrate that has regions on which depositions adhere strongly and regions on which depositions adhere weakly, enabling elimination by treatment such as ultrasonication.

AB The Chinese coastal regions are the high risk areas of natural disasters for their low land and weak and sensitive eco-evironment. The relative sea-level rising (RSLR), resulting from the piling of global sea-level rising and regional land subsidence, is to speed up in the 21st century. Certainly the RSLR will exacerbate the land submerging, the disaster from storm-tide and flood-waterlogging and the water shortage, and then affect urban withstanding function, construction safety and eco-resources. According to sustainable development theory, the sustainable utilization of resources and environment and sustainable development of economy and society can both be effectively achieved in coastal regions of China in the 21st century only by the implementation of controlling discharge of greenhouse gas, optimal exploitation of and artificial recharge of groundwater, systematic control of land subsidence, higher design standards for tide and flood control engineering, improving urban anti-disaster ability, a study on strategy and policy for RSLR and establishment of forecast and pre-warning institution.

ID TAVERNIERA-ABYSSINICA; DORMANCY
AB Taverniera abyssinica A. Rich. is an endemic and threatened medicinal plant species in Ethiopia. However, there is no any attempt to investigate the germination behavior of the seed for sustainable utilization and conservation of the species. This investigation was therefore designed to study the factors affecting germination of the seeds. Effects of storage durations (2, 8, 14, or 20 months), storage conditions (room temperature or refrigeration), pod developmental stages (green, brownish-green or brown) and treatment methods: mechanical, hot water under 30degreesC-90degreesC temperature regime, and acid (sulphuric, nitric and hydrochloric acids) on percentage germination of T abyssinica seeds were investigated. The findings indicated that seeds from brownish-green and brown pods germinated successfully (98% - 100%) and could be stored for at least 20 months in dry condition under 2degreesC-20degreesC without loss of viability. However, the seeds of T. abyssinica required pre-germination treatment. Mechanical or 98% sulphuric acid treatment for 10-40 minutes improved germination from 8% (control) to over 98%. Hot water (70degreesC) treatment for one hour also improved germination to 54%. Mechanical seed scarification is the most promising approach to overcome seed coat dormancy provided that cheap, safe, efficient and easily applicable devices are developed.

AB Throughout history, there have been many cases referring to the misuse of the power by one of the state's power institution. Most frequently there were the armed forces, which as the strongest power instrument dislocated from control. Modern era brought gradual strengthening of the next power institution such as police, intelligence services or internal security agencies. The parallel process to this strengthening was the increasing threat of abusing of the stressed institutions. The violent overthrow of the government is the extreme demonstration of the power instruments interference in the state functioning. There are also other more typical cases, such as influencing political life, discrimination of the internal opponents, or pursuing particular financial or economic gains. The dominant role of some of those institutions in political system lead to societal decline and to the spread of negative characteristics like corruption and clientelism.
   A precondition of the democratic system and for market economy functioning is democratic control and public oversight of the state's power institutions. The first key task of those mechanisms is to prevent manipulating with power instruments by political groups, which are trying to promote their own interests. The second key task is to prevent potential abuse of those institutions by their own members or by their command officers. On the basis of the mentioned facts, the civil society and the democratic state are creating a complex of formal relations and informal rules with the aim to ensure the accountable and transparent functioning of the whole power apparatus. In traditional democracies and in the countries undergoing democratic transformation process, one rule is valid - the mechanisms of the political control and public oversight over the armed forces, police, intelligence services and internal security agencies are the precondition for effective state governance, and for sustainable development of civic society.
   The formation of these mechanisms is shaping by historical experiences with civil-military relations. Even if the character of political systems and of the society structure did change in the course of history, the main problem stays unchangeable. It is the issue of how to include the armed forces into the society in order not to be the latent threat (in the form of the misuse of their power potential on illegitimate political or individual aims). The theory of the civil - military relations deals with the main principles of the balance between the armed forces efficiency and its subordination to the democratic control and civil/public oversight. This process has been evolving for the past five decades. This balance depends on the harmonisation of the prerequisites, with the aim to create accountability of the armed forces towards political authority and transparency towards the public. Equal aim is to retain the efficiency of the armed forces.
   In the course of the past six years this conception was stared to be applied also on the other power institutions, and not only on armed forces. It is the natural reflection, since the beginning of the 21st century carry over the same challenge as in the past - to ensure political control and public oversight on power apparatus of the state. There was developed the new concept of "Security Sector" to deal with these issues. Because the actors involved in delivering security services and the relationship between them vary from country to country, there is not a universally applicable definition of the security sector. The security sector consists of the following elements: Forces authorised to use force (armed forces, police, intelligence services, internal security agencies etc.), Security management and oversight bodies (governmental and parliamentarian, civil society actors, media, etc.), Justice and law enforcement institutions, Non-statutory security forces (private security companies, guerrilla armies, etc.)
   The process of security sector reform involves three broad challenges. The first challenge is to ensure the proper location of security activities within a constitutional framework defined by law and to develop security policies and instruments to implement them. The second challenge is to build the capacity of policy makers to effectively assess the nature of security threats and to design strategic response supportive of wider national goals. The third challenge is to strengthen mechanisms for ensuring security sector accountability by enabling the state and non-state actors responsible for monitoring security policy and enforcing the law to fulfil their functions effectively.

AB Fundamental challenges in engineering of large-scale multi-agent systems involve qualitative requirements from, e.g., ambient intelligence and network-centric operations. We claim that we can. meet these challenges if we model our multi-agent systems using models of evolutionary aspects of living systems. In current methodologies of multi-agent systems the notion of system evolution is only implicitly addressed, i.e., only closed patterns of interaction are considered, as origin of dynamic system behaviour. In this paper we argue that service discovery and conjunction, by means of open patterns of interaction, are the basic tools for sustainable system behaviour. In effect, we introduce a framework for sustainable information ecosystems. Consequently, we describe basic principles of our methodology as well as a couple of applications illustrating our basic ideas. The applications coexist on our supporting agent society platform SOLACE and their respective behaviour is, visualized using our system analysis tool DISCERN. The paper is concluded with a summary and a number of open research issues in the area.

AB Solar (photovoltaic) powered water pumping has the potential to bring sustainable supplies of potable water to millions of people in developing Countries. Unfortunately, in many cases the application of the pump technology ignores the sociological and economic needs of the users, leading to lack of maintenance, inappropriate financing schemes, inadequate system management and. ultimately, failure of the pump. This paper investigates some of the issues involved in solar water pumping projects, describes the positive and negative effects that they can have on the community and, in proposing an entirely new type of pump. considers what steps could be taken to ensure future sustainability.

TI Some consequences from the thermodynamics of the synthesis of solar
   fuels
SO SOLAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This report derives thermodynamic relations that give information on questions of interest like the sustainability of the energy system, the accounting of their external costs or the harmonization between renewable energies and fossil fuels. Three important consequences of this work are, on the one hand, the existence of objective conditioners that help to the preselection of fuel candidates to be burned or solar synthesized in a certain location; for sustainability, the best fuel to be burned is carbon, whereas the one to be solar synthesized is hydrogen. On the other hand, the processing of the cycle of fuels replaced by solar synthesis, which takes place without chemical or mechanical environmental impacts, whereas the net environmental thermal impact (avoided environmental heating) is equal to the produced net work (null in the worse of the cases). Finally, the fuel replacement by solar synthesis allows to establish objective criteria of valuation of the external costs of the fossil fuel combustion. The integrating consideration between fuels suitable for their solar synthesis or for their combustion (each one of them depending on the climatic characteristics of the location, reason why they do not have to be the same) suggests the use of the fuel more suitable for solar synthesis as a chemical contribution for the replacement of the most advisable fuel for its final consumption; this consideration supposes the establishment of a parallelism between the previous results, consequence exclusively of Thermodynamics, and the corresponding ones to the biological photosynthesis, according to Biochemistry.

ID LIFE-SUPPORT
AB Sustainability is one of the most important criteria in the creation and evaluation of human life support systems intended for use during long space flights. The common feature of biological and physicochemical life support systems is that basically they are both catalytic. But there are two fundamental properties distinguishing biological systems: 1) they are auto-catalytic: their catalysts - enzymes of protein nature - are continuously reproduced when the system functions; 2) the program of every process performed by enzymes and the program of their reproduction are inherent in the biological system itself - in the totality of genomes of the species involved in the functioning of the ecosystem. Actually, one cell with the genome capable of the phenotypic realization is enough for the self-restoration of the function performed by the cells of this species in the ecosystem. The continuous microalgal culture of Chlorella vulgaris was taken to investigate quantitatively the process of self-restoration in unicellular algae population. Based on the data obtained, we proposed a mathematical model of the restoration process in a cell population that has suffered an acute radiation damage. (C) 2003 COSPAR.

AB The parallels between the challenges facing bioregenerative life support in artificial closed ecological systems and those in our global biosphere are striking. At the scale of the current global technosphere and expanding human population, it is increasingly obvious that the biosphere can no longer safely buffer and absorb technogenic and anthropogenic pollutants. The loss of biodiversity, reliance on non-renewable natural resources, and conversion of once wild ecosystems for human use with attendant desertification/soil erosion, has led to a shift of consciousness and the widespread call for sustainability of human activities. For researchers working on bioregenerative life support in closed systems, the small volumes and faster cycling times than in the Earth's biosphere make it starkly clear that systems must be designed to ensure renewal of water and atmosphere, nutrient recycling, production of healthy food, and safe environmental methods of maintaining technical systems. The development of technical systems that can be fully integrated and supportive of living systems is a harbinger of new perspectives as well as technologies in the global environment. In addition, closed system bioregenerative life support offers opportunities for public education and consciousness changing of how to live with our global biosphere. (C) 2003 COSPAR.

AB An experimental model of a biological life support system was used to evaluate qualitative and quantitative parameters of the internal mass exchange. The photosynthesizing unit included the higher plant component (wheat and radish), and the heterotrophic unit consisted of a soil-like substrate, California worms, mushrooms and microbial microflora. The gas mass exchange involved evolution of oxygen by the photosynthesizing component and its uptake by the heterotroph component along with the formation and maintaining of the SLS structure, growth of mushrooms and California worms, human respiration, and some other processes. Human presence in the system in the form of "virtual human" that at regular intervals took part in the respirative gas exchange during the experiment. Experimental data demonstrated good oxygen/carbon dioxide balance, and the closure of the cycles of these gases was almost complete. The water cycle was nearly 100% closed. The main components in the water mass exchange were transpiration water and the watering solution with mineral elements. Human consumption of the edible plant biomass (grains and roots) was simulated by processing these products by a unique physicochemical method of oxidizing them to inorganic mineral compounds, which were then returned into the system and fully assimilated by the plants. The oxidation was achieved by "wet combustion" of organic biomass, using hydrogen peroxide following a special procedure, which does not require high temperature and pressure. Hydrogen peroxide is produced from the water inside the system. The closure of the cycle was estimated for individual elements and compounds. Stoichiometric proportions are given for the main components included in the experimental model of the system. Approaches to the mathematical modeling of the cycling processes are discussed, using the data of the experimental model. Nitrogen, as a representative of biogenic elements, shows an almost 100% closure of the cycle inside the system, The proposed experimental model of a biological system is discussed as a candidate for potential application in the investigations aimed at creating ecosystems with largely closed cycles of the internal mass exchange. The formation and maintenance of sustainable cycling of vitally important chemical elements and compounds in biological life support systems (BLSS) is an extremely pressing problem. To attain the stable functioning of biological life support systems (BLSS) and to maintain a high degree of closure of material cycles in them, it is essential to understand the character of mass exchange processes and stoichiometric proportions of the initial and synthesized components of the system.

AB There is a significant need for capacity building in the interdisciplinary area of land management, especially in developing countries and countries in transition, to deal with the complex issues of building efficient land information systems and sustainable institutional infrastructures.
   Capacity building in land management is not only a question of establishing a sufficient technological level or sufficient economic resources. It is mainly a question of understanding the interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral nature of land administration systems, and understanding the need for human resource development in this area. Furthermore, capacity building should ensure that the focus is on building sound institutions and good governance rather than just high-level IT-inftastructures.
   This overall approach to capacity building in land management is used for implementing a new land policy reform in Malawi. ne paper presents the new decentralized land policy developed as a response to the current land related problems in Malawi. The deficit in terms of qualified personnel is remarkable and calls for immediate action. An integrated curriculum is developed to provide the necessary skilled technicians and professionals for implementing the new land policy. The curriculum combines the diploma and the bachelor level and it combines the key areas of land surveying, land management and physical planning.

AB A lack of understanding of the waste flow of durable goods complicates decision-making efforts that will increase sustainability. To address this problem, the modeling of the waste flow of durable goods is considered. Televisions are used to illustrate the requirements for forecasting and the magnitude of the associated uncertainty of the waste flow for a durable good that is impacted by technological change and/or unpredictability in field life. This example is timely due to disposal laws affecting cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and the emergence of alternate technology trajectories for televisions. The findings suggest that the reuse of lead-bearing CRT glass is worthwhile, even though flat panel TV technology will eliminate this controversial waste stream. The findings also indicate the implications of forecasting durable waste flows for decisions regarding policy, business models, required infrastructure and supply chain management.

AB India is one of the 12 mega diversity countries in the world so it has a vital stake in conservation and sustainable utilization of its biodiversity resources. Plant secondary metabolites have been of interest to man for a long time due to their pharmacological relevance. With this in view, the bark powder of Acacia auriculiformis, A. nilotica, Juglans regia, and the fruit powder of Terminalia bellerica, T chebula, Emblica officinalis, and a combination drug "Triphala," which are known to be rich in polyphenols, were tested for their antimutagenic activities. Antimutagenic activities of the extracts were estimated by employing the plate incorporation Ames Salmonella histidine reversion assay by using the frame shift mutagen tester strain TA98 and base pair substitution strain TA100 against direct acting mutagens (NPD, sodium azide), and the S9-dependent mutagen 2-aminofluorene(2AF). Acetone extracts of all the plants exhibited significant antimutagenic activities among the other extracts tested, but an acetone extract of Acacia nilotica showed a marked anti-mutagent effect. Furthermore, it was more effective against indirect acting mutagen, 2AF, in both TA98 and TA100 tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium than against the direct acting mutagens. The results indicate that an acetone extract of bark and fruit of the medicinal plants under study harbors constituents with promising antimutagenic/anticarcinogenic potential that could be investigated further.

AB By means of two program examples the equipment, the computer literacy as well as the time and financial frame are discussed, which are necessary to develop a computer based learning-program. The program was developed only by veterinarians without help of specialized computer personnel. One of the programs was created at the Institute for Gross Anatomy ("Fore leg of the dog - an interactive atlas"), the other at the Clinic for Veterinary Gynecology and Obstetrics ("The estrus cycle of the bitch"). Besides comments on the necessary hard- and software components, the advantages of the authoring system in comparison to the Source codes are shown. The authoring system (ToolBook) could also be utilized efficiently by "unskilled" programmers. For the creation of pictures, sound and video sequences the digital recording technique proved to be better then the analogue processing. Our experiences led to the conclusion that it is possible to produce financially and personnel sustainable computer based learning-programs on institute and clinic level, without help from computer programmers which are positively accepted by the students. In our opinion programs about special themes with adapted contents have considerable advantages for the veterinarian continuing education.

ID POWER
AB This paper shows how the control over land and resources in rural Thailand in the present phase of globalisation is a struggle between economic, social and political powers at the global, national and local level. Ever since Thailand was integrated into the world market by signing the Bowring Treaty in 1855 and especially after it embarked on rapid development in the late 1950s economic growth has changed the rural (and urban) landscapes. Since the mid 1980s, export-oriented manufacturing industry has led Thailand into the present phase of globalisation by further liberalising its economy and increasingly leaving natural resources open to be exploited. Two socio-political tendencies have been competing in influencing territorialisation of rural Thailand. However, decentralisation and devolution of power promote local institutions that emphasise various degrees of self-reliance and sustainable utilisation of natural resources opposed to further liberalisation on the world market as promoted by national and transnational businesses and global institutions like the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. Territorialisation of rural Thailand and management of local natural, resources is therefore contested space where institutions at the local level operate in a contextual framework of policies formulated at the global level and implemented through national government agencies. The conflicts inherent in the multi-layered process of local territorialisation are blurred by the different institutions at different geographical levels having different perceptions of the environment. Political ecology or political environmental geography - promoted by a 'counter-coalition' of potentially like-minded actors operates on various levels in developing alternative territorialisation premised on socially just and sustainable livelihoods. Such approaches, it is proposed, are crucial to the study of local development in the context of globalisation.

ID ECONOMIC-IMPACTS; LAND-USE; INFRASTRUCTURE; URBAN
AB This paper focuses on the role of transportation infrastructure in freight accessibility from a sustainable and multi-modal perspective. Several accessibility measures are applied separately yet simultaneously to water, rail and road transportation systems. It appears that the transportation system is structuring the Belgian space geographically and topographically (inertia of space due to transportation infrastructure), but that economic activities are less associated with transportation systems than with the population. This means that either economic activities are footloose, or that there is a major discrepancy between transportation infrastructure and economic locations. Land-use planners should be aware of this when making decisions about the mobility of the future.

TI Valid and reliable measurements for sustainable non-financial reporting
SO TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS EXCELLENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The discrepancy between the high importance of intangibles and the general inability to measure and account for these types of assets constitutes a growing challenge for business and society, in particular within the framework of Non-Financial Reporting. Traditional financial reporting typically does not provide good predictions of future financial performance. The malfunctioning of risk capital markets partly depends on the lack of reliable information on intangibles. Thus, measurements of intangibles must be significantly improved. The information on intangibles needs to be based on the right measurements, it needs to be comparable (i.e. based on common guidelines, or even standards), and it needs to be verifiable and understood by the users. This paper reviews the situation with reference to measuring intangibles for non-financial reporting. It comments on various related research projects and R&D activities initiated by accounting organizations. It emphasizes the possible importance of various Best Practice measurement programs, such as ACSI and EPSI Rating. Finally, it identifies a number of requirements to be fulfilled to achieve and operationalize the relevance and reliability of stakeholder measurement.

AB The South Downs in southern England have been farmed for 5000 years: the initial loess cover is now a thin, stony remnant as a result of erosion. During the 1980s, field monitoring of erosion events in an area of 36 km(2) showed that average rates of erosion are low (0.5-5.0 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)), but that occasional storms result in losses of over 200 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) on individual fields. On soils that are only 15 cm thick, such rates pose a threat to future farming. Almost all recent erosion has been on fields of winter cereals, which are bare in the wet autumn period. Of greater significance in the short term are the effects of soil-laden runoff (or muddy floods) on urban areas. Flood damage to property has been a regular event since the conversion of this area to winter cereals in the 1970s. Soil conservation measures have been negligible and flood protection has consisted mainly of engineering works and limited land-use change at sites where property damage has occurred. Conversion to grass under the Set Aside, and an Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) scheme, could be an effective soil conservation and flood protection approach. In the longer term, increasing stoniness of soils, the economic incentives for arable farming in marginal areas, and the success of legal proceedings relating to flood damage, will determine the future of erosion on the South Downs. Current farming systems clearly are unsustainable and would become more so under future climates without substantial site-targeted land use change.

AB According to Bruno Latour, the imposition of crude classificatory schemes onto complex entities has two main effects: firstly, the classifications lead social actors to sift the world into the schemes' simple categories; secondly, underlying relations subvert the schemes' functioning, resulting in the production of transgressive 'hybrids'. Thus, classification and relation interact and this interaction shapes both the practice of classification and the world that is classified. In this paper, we examine the interaction between a scheme of spatial classification and the spaces that are enrolled within the scheme. We show that a division between urban and rural areas was put in place in post-war England in order to protect a 'vulnerable' rural nature from urban advance. However, as soon as it was imposed, this division was transgressed by complex socio-economic processes. We assess the response to this transgression by considering the activities of the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE), an environmental group that played some considerable part in constructing the urban-rural divide in the first place. We show that the CPRE has responded to the 'paradox of preservationism by placing urban-rural divisions in the context of 'ecological' relationships. We illustrate this 'ecologization' of the modernist divide using the example of housing and we argue that the CPRE's ecological approach illustrates how a new alignment between 'urban' and 'rural' may herald a new and more sophisticated form of spatial classification.

AB The 'success' of sustainability is often premised on public participation and consensus among members of diverse communities. An analysis of two experiments in participatory governance in Tasmania underpinned by explicit commitments to sustainability and by tacit investments in deliberative democracy allows detailed reflection on claims about the efficacy of deliberative democracy, and encourages speculation about whether and to what extent an alternative model of agonistic pluralism may better accommodate conflicts in communities wrestling with resource use and distribution.

AB A description is given of a methodology for estimating transit walk accessibility at the home end of transit trips and for forecasting transit walk accessibility at the home end for a future year, given forecast population and employment data, transit route information, and type of street configuration. The methodology for estimating transit walk accessibility overcomes the problems associated with natural and man-made barriers such as water bodies and community walls and the problem of uneven distribution of population. A comparison of the results with those from the traditional buffer method, as well as with network ratio methods that consider actual walk distance along streets, showed that both the buffer method and network ratio methods tended to overestimate transit walk accessibility. Regression analysis also showed that the new transit walk accessibility measure was a stronger predictor of transit use than that produced using the buffer method. The methodologies may be applied to transit planning, urban design for sustainable development, and long-range transit demand modeling.

AB In most cities of the developing world road-based public transport (i.e., buses, paratransit, jitneys, etc.) is the primary mode of motorized travel. Varying degrees of regulation control its provision; regulation is sometimes the role of government, private organizations, or the operators themselves. Many characteristics of developing world cities and travel markets influence the implementation and performance of regulatory schemes for public transportation. By exploring these factors and the spectrum of regulatory options, it is possible to suggest a methodology framework to make regulation and competition of public transportation services more effective and sustainable. This methodology attempts to capture local conditions, priorities, implementation issues, and sustainability strategies for developing regulatory schemes. Research concludes with suggested practices and strategies to increase the acceptance and sustainability of regulations by maximizing the potential benefits and minimizing the negative impacts.

AB An effective and sustainable transport system has been devised to meet public transport demand. Urban light transport (ULTra) is an innovative form of personal rapid transit. In contrast to other forms of public transport, there is no waiting, stopping, or transferring. In many situations, the new system can offer better transport than available by other means. ULTra has been designed to demanding sustainability requirements. Typically, ULTra reduces energy use and emissions by a factor of three compared with existing transport systems and also complements those systems. By providing a network link to major rail and bus stations, ULTra can make current transport services more attractive to passengers. The new system is also well suited for other major activity centers such as airports. In essence, ULTra replaces the old mass transit paradigm for transport with a new paradigm based on just-in-time transit. ULTra is now undergoing engineering development funded by the U.K. Department for Transport on a 1-km test track in Cardiff, Wales. The Cardiff County Council has received funding commitments by the National Assembly of Wales that could lead to system implementation by 2005. The system offers a new approach to public transport, with a real prospect of significant gains in effectiveness and sustainability.

AB Mobility Management Strategies for the Next Decades (MOST) was the largest European-funded project in the field of mobility management (MM). It is a 3-year research and demonstration project. MM has been applied and tested by more than 30 demonstrators in 13 European countries, and its impacts have been evaluated. MM is an innovative, demand-oriented approach to provide for a sustainable transportation system. It is based on information, coordination, and motivation and complements traditional (infrastructural) transport planning. In comparison with transport demand management, which focuses mainly on the way to work and the formation of car- and vanpools, MM is broader and is applied to manifold target groups. In MOST this is reflected in the six thematic, fields of the demonstrations: educational institutions, tourism, health institutions, site development, temporary sites and events, and mobility centers and consulting. MOST provides evidence for the wide applicability of MM to very different thematic fields and target groups. Already in the short term, MM raises the quality of offered mobility-related services, improves accessibility, fosters changes in attitudes, and influences modal choice toward more sustainable modes. MM can often be started by implementing temporary services that, due to their success, become long-term institutions. The complexity of MOST contributed to the ability to generalize from the results and recommendations, hence preparing the way for future standardization and an increase in the quality of transportation systems.

AB Global Environment Facility (GEF) support for World Bank sustainable transport activities is described. An overview is presented of current GEF strategy for sustainable transport, which reflects a shift beyond individual technology interventions toward broader objectives, including modal shift, demand management, and land use planning. Ongoing GEF projects that exemplify this shift are reviewed by examining projects in Latin America and Asia whose aim is improving public transport, nonmotorized programs, and institutional capacity related to sustainable transport. The major lessons that can be drawn from these projects, most of which are still at an early stage, is that local authorities are often enthusiastic about getting involved in programs that simultaneously address key transportation concerns in their cities (such as access, safety, congestion, local air quality) and result in less overall energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Much can be achieved as long as project communications and promotion are addressed and carefully targeted at decision makers and potential beneficiaries.

AB Most of the world's population and economic growth is occurring in the developing countries (DC) of the Asia-Pacific region. DCs will experience most of the world's urban growth. Motor vehicles are growing at two to three times the population rate. Road safety and congestion are major concerns. As a consequence, DCs now face alarming urban road transport challenges, which are expected to continue for some years. The supply of transport services has not matched the increased demand, because of insufficient infrastructure development. No comprehensive strategy exists to address the safety and efficiency of the urban transport system. A review is presented of the development of an integrated road safety strategy to address such key concerns as the need to establish a national road safety council, transport data system, and road safety monitoring and enforcement system. An urban road transport strategy is introduced that has been developed to address the overall transport problem, including assessment, objectives, and implementation. The strategy encompasses a wide range of issues, in a comprehensive framework, to create a competitive and sustainable approach to address problems, improve institutional capacity, optimize resource use, and link the road system to community benefits and expectations. Government leadership and sponsor involvement are addressed.

AB Planning for sustainable development requires models that can represent the effects of land use and transportation policies on economic welfare, social equity, and the natural environment. Various urban models and geographic information system impact models have been in development for use in the Sacramento, California, region for several years. A comprehensive set of models is proposed. With the improvement of the urban economic model and the addition of a model for real-time scenario generation and evaluation, it is thought that a full suite of models exists for comprehensive regional planning. All the models are free, public license models, appropriate for application in large metropolitan planning organizations and other regional agencies.

AB The state of Florida has been experiencing an explosion of growth, and it is one of the fastest growing states in the country. While the state has been in the forefront of growth management initiatives, the results have been less than satisfactory. The state recognized the need to integrate land use planning efforts with transportation planning efforts. Legislation was passed that allows the formation of multimodal transportation districts, which focus on appropriate land use mixes and densities that would enhance the use of transportation modes other than the automobile. There are several key elements in the evaluation of these districts, using both land use analysis and the recently adopted multimodal level-of-service performance measures. To validate these evaluation techniques, especially focusing on the level-of-service performance measures, several case studies were undertaken. The guidelines for the formation of a multimodal transportation district provide local governments with a template for enhancing existing and new development. These guidelines also provide a blueprint for sustainable growth and the promotion and development of livable communities through the integration of transportation, land use, and urban design.

AB This paper examines two land developments in the cities of Freiburg (Germany) and Chula Vista (California) with the purpose of comparing their transportation and land use planning institutions, processes, and actions for the importance placed on achieving sustainability. Planning practitioners in both places are committed to concepts of sustainability, but their respective attempts to achieve sustainability differ dramatically. Freiburg is pursuing relatively high density land development in conjunction with transit service, while Chula Vista is pursuing relatively low-density, auto-oriented land development patterns.

AB The crucial dependence on intermodal transport of an open island economy, where almost all external trade passes through the seaports, is examined. The rapid growth of the Irish economy puts great strains on the transport supply chains, particularly in the vicinity of the principal seaport in Dublin, where major congestion occurs. This adversely affects the competitiveness of small and medium-sized exporting companies. Increasing prosperity has resulted in an explosion in the numbers of private cars, which puts great strain on an inadequate internal infrastructure. A review of Irish ports confirms that congestion on the access routes to the Dublin port is the major bottleneck in the long transport chains for exporters. Relief from the freight traffic transiting the city center must await the completion of a dedicated port access tunnel, and interim solutions are needed. In the case of food exporters, globalization, the power of the retail conglomerates, and peripheral location demand a high level of supply chain efficiencies. A survey of export transport chains for selected products shows that transit costs can be a significant proportion of the total consignment value. At the level of the indigenous companies, supply chain management capabilities are shown to be below an acceptable standard in two-thirds of the firms surveyed. Possible solutions for facilitation of freight access in the vicinity of the port and for introduction of more sustainable solutions for goods deliveries in the historic city center are explored. Measures that can be taken to improve the logistics management capabilities in companies are also described.

ID THERAPY; LESSONS; TRENDS
AB The number of countries implementing directly observed therapy short-course (DOTS) has grown rapidly in the past decade and more than 10 million patients have now been treated under DOTS. While global case detection rates increased slightly, from 35% to 40% between 1995 and 2000, the proportion attributable to DOTS grew from less than one-third to more than two-thirds. DOTS is replacing inferior treatment but still treating fewer than 40% of estimated new TB cases. Misconceptions threaten to undermine continued success in tuberculosis control. The first misconception is that treatment observation is unnecessary. Treatment observation needs to be made more patient-friendly, but must not be abandoned. The second misconception is that health care reform will strengthen tuberculosis control. TB control is essentially a management problem. Greater accountability of governments, donors and providers is essential. A third misconception is to focus on treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) cases without addressing the root causes of MDRTB. While it is important, on a clinical basis and epidemiologically in some contexts, to care optimally for patients with MDRTB, it is more important to address the cause of MDRTB and to fix the program generating MDRTB. The fourth misconception is an inordinate concern for sustainability. Delaying assistance will make implementation and sustainability in the future more difficult. Tuberculosis control is remarkably inexpensive and cost-effective, but efforts will fait unless programs have the ability to hire staff, purchase supplies, and contract for services efficiently. Critical issues for the future of tuberculosis control are sustained funding, technical rigor, and good management. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Setting: High tuberculosis (TB) prevalence countries, where National TB programmes (NTPs) need to ensure widespread access to effective treatment. Objective: To review possible ways in which communities can contribute to TB control and to describe the project "Community TB Care in Africa". Design: A review of the literature on community contribution to TB control and a progress report on the project "Community TB Care in Africa". Results: Eight district-based projects in six countries (Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia) participated in the overall "Community TB care in Africa" project. District TB programmes offering patients the choice of community or health facility treatment supervision generally performed effectively, with satisfactory rates of treatment success. Average health system and patient and family costs were lower in comparison with controls. Conclusion: Investigators formulated policy recommendations. NTPs should: (1) extend TB care to the community to improve access; (2) identify suitable community TB treatment supporters in consultation with the community; (3) ensure that effective systems extend into the community for recording and reporting, and for supply of anti-TB drugs; (4) monitor community contribution to TB care using standard indicators; (5) develop costed plans for expansion of the community approach. Ministries of Health should: (1) ensure adequate financing; (2) coordinate the efforts of NTPs, donors and NGOs to ensure sustainability; (3) consider opportunities for collaboration between NTPs and HIV/AIDS programmes.

TI New realism and local realities: Local transport planning in Leicester
   and Cambridgeshire
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, we seek to contribute to the debate concerning the emergence of a 'new realism' in transport planning in the UK, through an examination of the development of Local Transport Plans. After describing the background to these policy changes, we consider how one central tenet of the new realism-the need to manage demand-is taking shape within the local transport planning process in Cambridgeshire and Leicester. We argue that although a 'climate of desperation' exists in each case over levels of traffic growth and their associated impacts, policy learning and change have been confined to a 'weak' interpretation of new realism where transport planning remains effectively subservient to prevailing local notions of how economic competitiveness ought to be promoted. In conclusion, we argue that this poses fundamental challenges for national government's transport and sustainable development policies.

AB Background and Objectives Therapy with recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) for haemophiliacs with inhibitors still has some unresolved problems, such as the requirement for frequent infusions of rFVIIa every 2-3 h to sustain haemostatic activity for an extended time-period and that the therapeutic dose of rFVIIa is not always predictable. In the present study, we searched for an effective combination of plasma-derived FVIIa with other blood coagulation factors, and demonstrated that a therapeutic approach combining plasma-derived FVIIa and Factor X (FX) was more useful for treating haemophiliacs with inhibitors than FVIIa alone.
   Materials and Methods The haemostatic effects of FVIIa and FX were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro experiments we assessed the following: the ability to enhance the thrombin generation rate in a reconstituted blood coagulation model without Factor VIII (FVIII) or Factor IX (FIX); the ability to correct the activated partial prothrombin time (APTT) of FVIII-depleted plasma or FIX-depleted plasma; and the ability to correct the clotting time of haemophilia-like whole blood using thromboelastography (TEG). In in vivo experiments, the haemostatic activity of the combination treatment of FVIIa and FX was determined by measuring the bleeding time and TEG using a monkey haemophilia B model produced by the injection of anti-human FIX polyclonal antibodies. The degree of thrombogenicity of the combination was evaluated using the rabbit stasis model.
   Results The addition of FX to FVIIa dramatically enhanced the thrombin generation rate in the reconstituted blood coagulation model and corrected the prolonged APTTs of FVIII- and FIX-depleted plasmas to levels achieved by the replacement therapies. In contrast, the addition of prothrombin to FVIIa did not show such enhancing activity. Furthermore, FVIIa-induced whole blood clotting times in the FVIII- and FIX-inhibited states were also shortened by the addition of FX in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, the co-administration of FVIIa (80 mug/kg) and FX (800 mug/kg) in a monkey haemophilia B model resulted in a more robust and persistent haemostatic effect on the secondary bleeding time and whole-blood clotting time of TEG than that of FVIIa alone. The results of rabbit stasis tests for evaluating the risk of thrombogenicity showed that the combination of FVIIa and FX was less thrombogenic than FEIBA(R).
   Conclusions The present study demonstrated that the combination of FVIIa and FX appeared to have a higher and more sustainable haemostatic potential than FVIIa alone, and less thrombogenicity than FEIBA(R). A therapeutic approach combining FVIIa and FX could be a promising and novel approach to compensate for the disadvantages of rFVIIa and FEIBA(R) for haemophiliacs with inhibitors.

AB Lab-scale tests were set up to. investigate different options for achieving sustainability by reducing long-term landfill emissions. The options which have been studied and compared with the traditional anaerobic landfill for unprocessed refuse. were: mechanical-biological pretreatment, landfill aeration with forced and with natural advective air flow (semi-aerobic), flushing. Combination of different options have been experimented. The combination of mechanical-biological Pretreatment, Aeration by the semi-aerobic method and Flushing (PAF model) seems to synergize the advantages of the individual options. The research is ongoing and further studies are necessary in order. to assess the full-scale applicability of the model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There have been growing concerns over the negative effect of pesticide usage on human health and environmental sustainability. It has been found out that atrazine, a widely used herbicide, threatens ecosystems. Its residues after application can be discharged into water bodies, and thus contaminate surface water and pose risks to public health. An integrated modelling system was developed to estimate atrazine losses through surface runoff. This model includes a distributed hydrological model, a pesticide adsorption model, relational databases, and a geographic information system. The proposed model can simulate atrazine losses due to runoff through the consideration of emission, degradation, adsorption, and movement of atrazine in dissolved and adsorbed phases at the top soil layer. A case study was carried out in the Auglaize-Blanchard Watershed. A comparison between observed and predicted data during May 1997 to April 1998 was conducted. The correlation coefficients are over 0.9 and the statistical significance level was approximately 5%, indicating a reasonable prediction accuracy. The modelling results provide useful decision support for water quality management.

ID WATER
AB Wetlands are in use as adjuncts to wastewater treatment lagoons at many north temperate locations. Performance data for 21 systems show median removals of 67, 61, 61, 48 and 99.8% for TSS, BOD, NH4-N, TP and fecal coliforms, respectively. Hydraulic loading rates range from 0.14 to 55 cm/d, areas from 0.02 to 200 ha, and latitudes from 30 to 54degreesN. Calibrations of first order models with temperature dependence show that rate constants vary from seasonal dependence at low loadings to temperature dependence at high loadings for ammonia. Phosphorus rate constants display seasonal, not temperature effects. BOD and TSS are not affected by season. Wetland rate constants are larger than those for lagoons for all constituents. The optimal winter operating strategy, if hydraulics allow, is partial storage during frozen months, coupled with winter use of the wetlands. The use of FWS wetlands for polishing lagoon effluents is cost effective when land availability is not drastically constrained. Many systems have been in operation long enough to demonstrate sustainable long-term performance. Infiltration beds are potentially a valuable addition to ponds and wetlands.

AB Wastewater treatment was primarily implemented to enhance urban hygiene. Treatment methods were improved to ensure environmental protection by nutrient removal processes. In this way, energy is consumed and resources like potentially useful minerals and drinking water are disposed of. An integrated management of assets, including drinking water, surface water, energy and nutrients would be required to make wastewater management more sustainable. Exergy analysis provides a good method to quantify different resources, e.g. utilisable energy and nutrients. Dilution is never a solution for pollution. Waste streams should best be managed to prevent dilution of resources. Wastewater and sanitation are not intrinsically linked. Source separation technology seems to be the most promising concept to realise a major breakthrough in wastewater treatment. Research on unit processes, such as struvite recovery and treatment of ammonium rich streams, also shows promising results. In many cases, nutrient removal and recovery can be combined, with possibilities for a gradual change from one system to another.

AB Globally we are faced with billions of people without access to safe water and adequate sanitation. These are generally located in developing communities. Even in developed communities the current large scale systems for supplying water, collecting wastewater and treating it are not environmentally sustainable, because it is difficult to close the cycle of water and nutrients. This paper discusses the advantages of small scale water and wastewater systems in overcoming the difficulties in providing water and wastewater systems in developing communities and in achieving sustainability in both developed and developing communities. Particular attention is given to technology and technology choice, even though technology alone does not provide the complete answer. Disadvantages of small scale systems and how they may be overcome are discussed.

AB The South East of England has one of the fastest growing and economically active populations in Europe, with associated significant pressures from development, particularly housing and transport. Sustainable water management has been identified as a major issue for future development of the region. The South East England Regional Assembly and the Environment Agency have carried out a study to investigate the potential constraints that flood risk, water resources, and water quality may pose on development. The study aims to improve understanding in order to inform the revision of regional planning polices and suggest practical guidance for local authorities to implement such policies. Wide technical consultation was carried out with the Environment Agency, local planning authorities and development agencies. Threshold Assessment was investigated as a technique to assess the potential impacts on the environment of various levels of forecast growth within selected parts of the region. Initial results indicate the need for more strategic and better integrated planning which recognises environmental and development boundaries.

AB The Emscher system, with its open wastewater drains, has been undergoing reconstruction since 1990. The watercourses, now relieved of the burden of wastewater, are being reconstituted as close to nature as possible. An important precondition, for which naturally orientated rainwater management concepts must be implemented in this densely populated region, is a homogenized run-off. Emschergenossenschaft has in recent years provided financial and conceptual support for the CO implementation of such changes. Present-day experience demonstrates that disconnection of 10% of impervious areas within the next fifteen years is a realistic target and consequently the aim for next year's 8 work. As detailed studies using precipitation run-off models document, this will decisively improve the flood V and minimum water situations of the small tributary watercourses in particular, which is important regarding the aims of the EU WFD.

ID TRANSITION
AB We studied acceptance of a urine-based fertilizer product using a mail survey of 467 Swiss farmers. We distinguished among four production types: organic or IP farming, and with or without vegetable production. Considering that the idea of urine-based fertilizers is new, acceptance among the answering farmers was surprisingly high, with 57% explicitly stating that they thought it was a good or very good idea, and 42% willing to purchase such a product. The farmers of different production types did not differ strongly in their attitude towards urine-based fertilizers. Especially IF and vegetable farmers, who purchased additional fertilizers anyway, seem willing to accept urine-based fertilizers, hereby preferring a grainy, odorless ammonium nitrate fertilizer. Absolutely essential is a hazard-free product: 30% of all farmers had concerns regarding micropollutants. Based on fertilizer data, we demonstrate an existing demand for the nutrients N, P, and K in Switzerland, which could be partially substituted by a recycled urine product. Finally, we discuss methodological requirements of social science surveys. To obtain representative data on an entire population in a mail survey, multiple contacts with respondents are necessary. We argue that information and participation of stakeholders at an early stage is essential for successful technology transfer.

AB The Shawan River will be the focal point in the development of the Panyu District, the southern-most district of Guangzhou City in the Guangdong Province of South China. In this research, through the use of two scenarios, the future water quality of the Shawan River was predicted with relation to changes in the water quantity utilized to fuel industrial and domestic development. The worst-case scenario used, simulated the situation if no wastewater treatment was employed, and the best-case scenario simulated the situation if 90% of the pollution load was removed. The period of simulation was for the years 2020 and 2050. Three flowrates were used in the evaluation, those of: the 90% probability of the month of lowest flow (37.2 m(3)/s); and the range of flowrates within the low flow period, that is, the dry season from November to February (307 and 432 m(3)/s). Subsequently, two countermeasures (industrial and domestic water savings) - sustainable initiatives - were nested within the two scenarios to ascertain improvements in water quality as a direct result of reduction in water quantity used. The industrial water saving countermeasure showed the greatest improvement in water quality. For the 90% probability of lowest flow for the worst-case scenario, this countermeasure equated to a 63% decrease in BOD. For the low flow period flowrates the background concentration of pollutants was more influential than improvements imparted by the countermeasures to the future predicted water quality. It was recommended that industrial countermeasures be used that take into account water saving, water recycling, the use of brackish water for cooling, and the implementation of economic pricing initiatives. Also that inter-district governmental policy initiatives be introduced to prevent upstream pollution from influencing downstream proposals, further enhancing sustainable water management of the Shawan River.

AB The technology of urine separation and the recycling of anthropogenic nutrients as fertilizer in agriculture are considered as major innovations to improve the sustainability of today's urban wastewater management. The acceptance of consumers will be key for the introduction of the new technology. Citizens will have to make important decisions in their role as tenants and owners of houses and as consumers buying products fertilized with urine. Consumer attitudes towards the new technology were explored in a number of citizen focus groups in Switzerland. Focus groups are deliberate, moderated group discussions with informed citizens on a certain topic. The information was provided by a computer based information system specifically designed for this purpose. The acceptance of individual citizens for the new technology proved to be quite high. The majority of the citizens expressed their willingness to move into an apartment with NoMix toilets and to buy food fertilized with urine. However, they were not willing to accept additional financial costs or efforts. Arguments related to long-term sustainability (closing nutrient cycles) were of less importance than arguments that relate directly to the effects of micropollutants on human and ecosystem health. For the introduction of the new technology on a wide scale it will thus be crucial to explore the fate and effects of micropollutants.

AB Wastewater treatment facilities produce large amounts of sludge, which is a pollutant to the environment if not properly managed. Among the three most common methods (landfills, land application, incineration) of sludge disposal, thermophilic digestion to produce Class-A biosolids for land application is recognized as the most cost-effective, environmentally sustainable option. Full-scale experience revealed that thermophilically digested biosolids consumed a higher dosage of chemicals for conditioning and dewatering than conventionally (mesophilically) digested biosolids. This paper presents findings of a recent study to investigate how major operational parameters affect dewatering properties of thermophilically digested biosolids, and to search for the inter-relationship between digestion, characteristics of digested biosolids, and dewatering properties of thermophilic biosolids. Experimental work was carried out using bench-scale aerobic digesters. This study found that feed sludge composition has a significant effect on dewaterability. A higher content of secondary sludge resulted in poorer dewaterability in undigested and digested sludge. Dewatering properties are sensitive to a temperature effect. Such an effect is physical-chemical in nature. Excessive high shear results in significant deterioration in dewaterability. Thermophilic digestion resulted in a substantial increase in ammonia and phosphate concentrations, but these two factors seem to not have much impact on dewaterability. Instead, cellular biopolymers have a significant role in affecting dewatering properties of thermophilically digested biosolids.

AB The aim of the study was to determine if an increased use of local land-based snow deposits would be more sustainable than the use of a central snow deposit. The study focused on transport related emissions, costs for transporting the snow, technical attendance, local effects, public acceptance, land use, effects on the recipient environmental control and potential for accidents. General information was obtained from an inventory regarding snow handling that was made in 14, geographically spread, Swedish municipalities during 2001. The comparison of costs for transporting snow and transport-related emissions was based on information gathered from the municipality of Lulea. The study showed that using local land-based snow deposits would decrease traffic-related emissions such as CO2, CO and NOx by 40% annually and would decrease the annual cost for transporting snow by nearly 80%. On the other hand local snow deposits may lead to an increased risk of accidents and to negative local effects such as delayed growing season, flooding and drainage problems. Available land for local snow deposits in the cities is hard to find, and is usually expensive. Therefore a combination of local and central snow deposits is likely to be the most realistic option.

AB Water problems have to be solved in an integrated way, and sustainability has become a major issue. For this reason, developing more sustainable wastewater treatment processes is needed. New discoveries and good understanding on microbial conversions of nitrogen and phosphorus make more sustainable processes possible. New options for decentralized sustainable sanitation are generally compared to conventional sewage systems, we think that for a proper comparison also innovative centralized treatment schemes should be evaluated. In this article, a more sustainable WWTP is proposed for municipal wastewater treatment, mainly based on the principles of denitrifying dephosphatation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX). The proposed system consists of a first stage of the A/B process in which maximal sludge production is achieved. In this way, COD is regained as sludge for methanation. The following BCFS(R) and CANON processes can remove N and P with minimal or no COD need. As a potential fertiliser, struvite can easily be removed from the sludge water by adding magnesium compounds. A case study is done on the basis of the mass balance over the proposed plant. The effluent from the system has a good quality to be recycled. This could also make a contribution to meeting the world's water needs and lessening the impact on the world's water environment. Since all the separate units are already applied or tested on pilot-scale, no problems for technical implementation are foreseen.

ID NUTRIENT REMOVAL PROCESSES
AB Wastewater treatment should not only be concerned with urban hygiene and environmental protection, but development of a sustainable society must also be considered. This implies a minimisation of the energy demand and potential recovery of finite minerals. Urine contains 80% of the nitrogen (N) and 45% of the phosphorus (P) in wastewater. Separate collection and treatment would improve effluent quality and save energy in centralised biological nutrient removal (BNR). BNR processes are not optimal to treat water with very low N concentration resulting from separate urine collection. Relying on nutrient removal through sludge production, methanation of the sludge, subsequent nutrient removal from the digestion effluent results in optimised and more sustainable wastewater treatment. This paper quantitatively evaluates this option and discusses the potential.

ID FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; REGION
AB Information on the magnitude and variability of flow regimes at the river reach scale is a central component of most aspects of water resource and water quality management. However, many decisions are made within catchments for which there are no measured flow data. To meet this challenge, a suite of modelling techniques to assist in the estimation of natural and artificially influenced river-flows at ungauged sites has been developed. This paper summarises these models and how they are incorporated within the GIS framework of the Low Flows 2000 software package. The paper will also describe the implementation of Low Flows 2000 within England and Wales by the Environment Agency, and the use of the system in supporting the implementation of the Environment Agency's Catchment Abstraction Management Strategy. This strategy is focused on the delivery of sustainable abstraction licensing and will contribute to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive within England and Wales.

ID BIOSOLIDS
AB Organic waste management is a growing issue due to the unsustainable practices of its disposal. Sewage treatment plants are designed to treat wastewater to produce a safe effluent. However, one of the by-products, the sewage sludge which is disposed off in landfill or used as fertilizer in agricultural operation is high in pathogens. Sustainability can be achieved by Vermicomposting of organic matter which involves accelerated cycling of nutrients though a closed cycle whereby waste products are put to productive end use. Vermicomposting and vermifiltration are natural waste management processes relying on the use of worms to convert organic wastes to stable soil enriching compounds. Domestic wastewater management can be accommodated through these processes in a sustainable manner. A considerable reduction in pathogens has been noticed in the end product to a level that it can be safely applied to land. This paper provides an overview of the system characteristics of management systems utilising vermiculture, to manage wastewater. The process can be used in a small scale for household waste treatment to rural or urban waste management.

AB Intermittent infiltration of wastewater through a non saturated sand bed is an extensive treatment process aimed at eliminating organic pollution, oxidizing ammonia and removing pathogens. A 1 D numerical model, IPOX, has been worked out to simulate the transfer and oxidation of dissolved organic matter and nitrogen in unsaturated sand beds. IPOX was calibrated after real scale tests performed in Spain and Burkina Faso. Simulations allowed us to point out the influence of (i) kinetics on oxidation performances and (ii) biomass development on the process sustainability. These results brought a new light on the sizing and operation of infiltration percolation and soil aquifer treatment (SAT) plants.

AB This paper has been motivated by a desire to put some numbers beside the label of sustainability as is currently applied to water related issues. Of particular interest is a general estimate of the water balance and environmental flows during the time intervals before Aboriginal arrival, when the land was being managed in an environmentally sustainable manner by the Aboriginals, and most recently following European settlement. This will be considered in an Australia-wide context, because the continent is geographically diverse, being mostly arid desert, with limited areas of fertile soils. Climate variation ranging from a hot tropical north to a cool temperate south will also be discussed. Attention will be given to the major factors that have influenced the water balance, including the extinction of Australian megafauna, the effects of "fire-stick" farming and the clearance of land for European agriculture with its consequences. It is hoped that the findings will increase our understanding of Australian water resources, and promote a greater appreciation of the fragility of this ancient landscape on which we dwell.

AB Nutrients are a limited resource and call for management. A sustainable nutrient management strategy reintegrates nutrients in the environment without accumulating harmful substances above an acceptable level. In this study a methodology to assess the environmental compatibility was developed. For this assessment both the (i) enrichment of pollutants in the soils and (ii) the area specific nutrient demand of the crops were taken into account. The method considers, that products applied on soils also contain stable substances, and as a consequence the accumulation of pollutants diminishes. Additionally, it is considered, that increasing substance concentrations in the soil will lead to an increase of substance flows out of the soil by percolation, plant-removal (and erosion). In practice long term management strategies are restricted by the time span considered, the accepted accumulation of substances, the plants real needs and legal constraints. The rating of various goods can be made with the ratio of the added nutrients, considering the pollution criteria, the legal constraints and the plants real needs.

AB The Babon River lies over three regions, i.e. Semarang District where the upstream is located while downstream it passes through Semarang Municipality and Demak District. This river has been used for many purposes by the neighbouring communities (e.g. water source, canal disposal, mining, etc). Thereafter many transboundary environmental problems have arisen here. The environmental management strategy (using a top-down approach) such as Program Kali Bersih (Clean River Program) on Babon River, which had been implemented by the Bapedalda of Semarang Municipality, is not successfully achieving the targets. In the past, most policies were formulated based on top-down orientation. Hence, the communities' participation was not paid enough attention. Co-management is a participative-management approach to empower the stakeholders (related parties) to achieve a certain goal. This study seeks answers to the research questions: (1) whether the co-management approach has good prospects for managing the Babon River; and (2) what kinds of strategy should be formulated to empower the stakeholders to manage the Babon River in the study area.
   The study employed a multistage sampling method to select the location of the study areas and key-persons sample. Rowosari, Penggaron Kidul and Karangtoro were selected to represent the upstream, middle stream and downstream areas, respectively. The descriptive statistics method had been used to describe the significance of river resource attributes' characters. Institutional analysis approach, introduced by Pomeroy and Williams, was adopted with necessary modification in this study.
   The results showed that the level of participation of the community in the three segments of the Babon River is different. The prospects for the co-management approach to manage the river resource in the study area are fairly good and in the upstream area are better than in the other two segments. The level of participation is far from complete; nevertheless the response from society towards development is quite good. There are five significant attributes in Babon River, which affect the community participation in river management, namely: (1) intensity of resource commercialisation; formal education of the community; and dependency of the community toward the resources, resource products distribution and resource damage. These variables could influence the pattern of participation of the community in the study area. The other stakeholders such as industrial or plant owners, academics, and the related institutions have not been explored in detail in this study.
   The co-management model that has been developed in this study has the prospect of encouraging the community and other stakeholders' empowerment in economic activities, natural resource conservation, and environmental law enforcement, as part of achieving the ultimate goal of sustainable environmental management.

ID SYSTEM
AB Highways have a long-term impact on the environment, therefore a sustainable approach to their design is vital. In the spring of 2001 a pilot constructed wetland (CW) system was set up at a section of the northeast-southwest motorway in Slovenia. It was designed for a critical flow of 11.75 l/s for 0.75 ha of catchment area. It consisted of a sedimentation basin covering an area of 36 m(2) and a CW of 85 m(2). The CW was filled with sand media and planted with reeds. Performance efficiency of the system was evaluated from summer to autumn 2001. Some of the physical and chemical parameters monitored varied noticeably. Removal efficiency was 69% for suspended solids, 97% for settleable solids, 51% for COD, 11% for BOD5 and 80% for Fe. Heavy metals such as Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni and Pb were below limited level at the inflow with reduction efficiency in the system of over 90%. Concentrations of N and P showed a limited level of nutrients for biological processes. Results of the study suggest that CW could be an alternative for highway runoff treatment. Further long-term investigations are needed to provide more data on their proper design.

AB A study was carried out in Zimbabwe to evaluate the performance of duckweed ponds as an option for treating and reusing wastewater in small, decentralised communities. The study focused on nitrogen and phosphorus removal, operational problems, and duckweed application. Two full-scale trial plants at Nemanwa and Gutu-Mupandawana growth points were used. Sewage samples were collected and analysed monthly from September 2000 to August 2001 for NO3, NH4-, TKN, TP, COD, and other field measurements. The duckweed was harvested daily and fed to chickens. The Nemanwa plant had high nutrient levels due to nil outflows caused by water rationing in the area. The Gutu effluent had averages of 38.7 +/- 23.1 mg/I TN and 7.5 +/- 2.4 mg/I TP which are above the respective Zimbabwean standards of 10 mg/I TN and 1 mg/I TP. COD removal efficiency at Gutu was poor at 45%. The performance of Gutu and Nemanwa. plants suffered from inappropriate design especially pond depth and short-circuiting. The duckweed died off in the November-January period, this being attributed to excessive levels of ammonia. It was concluded that the duckweed pond systems would offer a good alternative for managing and reusing wastewater at community level provided due regard is paid to appropriate design criteria.

ID SOLUBILITY
AB Sulphide precipitation of heavy metal containing wastewaters results in low effluent concentrations. However, sulphide precipitation is not widely applied in practice because the dosing of sulphide cannot adequately be controlled. A new process was developed where the combination of a sulphide-selective electrode (pS-electrode) and pH electrode controls the sulphide addition. Precipitation experiments were performed on a laboratory-scale in batch and continuous reactor systems with synthetic wastewaters containing Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb or Zn. The response of the pS-electrode during precipitation was unique for each heavy metal and was directly related to the solubility product of the corresponding metal sulphide. The metals were removed to levels <0.05 mg.l(-1) at pH 6:0 by sulphide precipitation while maintaining a total sulphide concentration <0.02 mg.l(-1). By the control of pS at different levels and keeping the pH constant at 6.0, the metals in solutions of both Cu and Zn could be precipitated selectively from solution in a batch and. continuous reactors. The use of a membrane reactor in combination with control of pH and pS offers a simple, cheap, efficient and sustainable technique with respect to obtaining very low effluent concentrations and selective removal of metals as pure metal sulphides which can be reused.

AB The aim of this study was to formulate an integrated wastewater management model for Harare, Zimbabwe, based on current thinking. This implies that wastewater is treated/disposed of as close to the source of generation as possible. Resource recovery and reuse in a local thriving urban agriculture are integrated into this model. Intervention strategies were considered for controlling water, nitrogen and phosphorus flows to the lake. In the formulation of strategies, Harare was divided into five major operational areas of high-, medium-, and low-density residential areas, and also commercial and industrial areas. Specific options were then considered to suit landuse, development constraints and socio-economic status for each area, within the overall criteria of limiting nutrient inflows into the downstream Lake Chivero. Flexible. and differential solutions were developed in relation to built environment, population density, composition of users, ownership, future environmental demands, and technical, environmental, hygienic, social and organisational factors. Options considered include source control by the users (residents, industries, etc.), using various strategies like implementation of toilets with source separation, and natural methods of wastewater treatment. Other possible strategies are invoking better behaviour through fees and information, incentives for cleaner production, and user responsibility through education, legislative changes and stricter controls over industry.

DE integrated planning; urban water; water conservation and recycling
AB The demands on governments and local authorities, are changing in response to community expectations for environmentally sustainable outcomes. To reverse declining water quality in rivers and ensure sustainable use in the 21 st century, the State Government in New South Wales has introduced a package of Water Reforms. The introduction of integrated water, sewerage and drainage planning is one of the Water Reform initiatives. Traditionally, government and local authorities have managed their water supply, sewerage and stormwater drainage systems as separate entities. Integrated urban water planning is a structured planning process to evaluate concurrently the opportunities to improve the management of water, sewerage and drainage services within an urban area in ways which are consistent with broader catchment and river management objectives. The New South Wales Department of Land & Water Conservation (DLWC) has developed an integrated urban water planning process through a number of recent pilot studies. The process links urban water management objectives to overall catchment and river management objectives. DLWC is currently developing a set of guidelines for integrated urban water plans. DLWC has developed the Integrated Urban Water Planning methodology through three pilot studies in the New South Wales towns of Finley, Goulburn and Bombala. The pilot studies have shown that an integrated approach to water, sewerage and stormwater planning can identify opportunities that are not apparent when separate strategies are developed for each service. The result is better-integrated, more sustainable solutions, and substantial cost savings for local communities.

AB This paper presents the argument that the environmental, social and economic benefits of decentralised systems are such that they should present a serious alternative to centralised systems in existing and future planned urban developments. It will be shown that the combination of technical, social and regulatory factors that influenced the popularity of centralised systems has altered, and that decentralised systems should now be considered as well. The environmental, social and economic advantages and disadvantages of several sustainable watercycle case studies are examined and compared with centralised systems. The studies examined will go from large scale down to designs suitable for typical residential houses on standard urban blocks.

AB National goals regarding sustainable development from the Swedish government were decisive in the planning process when the newly built city district Western Harbour was established in the city of Malmo, Sweden. A systems analysis was used as a tool for evaluating different collection and treatment systems. This type of analysis does not include more subjective factors such as acceptance of organic fertilisers based on human waste and user acceptance of collection schemes. These aspects, however, will often determine the success of a technical solution. When the system for collection and treatment of solid organic waste and wastewater was designed, both subjective and objective factors were considered. This meant that a centralised solution for wastewater treatment was selected. In order to facilitate a more sustainable solution for sludge management a treatment process with recovery of phosphorus will have to be introduced. Organic waste is sorted out and treated in an anaerobic digestion process. Source sorting of solid organic waste has been difficult to implement in Sweden due to inadequate sorting discipline. As a consequence two relatively new systems are tested in the area. A comprehensive evaluation will be carried out during a period of two years.

DE drying problem of sea; subsequencies; sustainable development
AB Until 1960 the Aral Sea was considered the 4th largest lake in the world by surface area. The Aral Sea has two main inflows - the Amudarya and Syrdarya rivers with about 30 tributaries. From early 1960s because of extensive water use - unreturned withdrawal of water for irrigation and consequent drying up of many tributaries before reaching the main rivers - the water level in the Aral Sea began falling very rapidly. In 1965 the Aral Sea received about 56 cubic km of fresh water yearly, but this number fell to zero by the early 1980s.
   By 1990 the level of the Aral Sea water fell by more than 17 m, the volume of water decreased by 75%, the salinity of seawater increased up to 30 g/l, and the surface area of the sea reduced from 66,400 sq. km to 31,500 sq. km.
   The ecological situation in Aral Sea zone has became very dramatic. It has led to the changing of climate in the region, irrigated soils becoming deserts, deterioration of underground and surface water quality, reducing of available water for domestic and agricultural needs, loss of Aral Sea fishing and transportation importance, numerous other problems and finally put the health of present and future generations under threat.
   This situation not only does not promote further development of the economy of the region, but has also caused damage with irreparable negative consequences. The fact is that the basis of the regional economy is fishing and other associated businesses. Since Uzbekistan is most agricultural country its economy has serious complications. In order to prevent further deepening of this catastrophe and to improve the present situation in this area the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan has developed a series of measures: in particular it developed efficient water use schemes, changing the cotton situation (that during the Soviet period was grown as monoculture) by planting less water-consuming varieties, reviewing using of fertilizers in agriculture etc. The Aral Sea drought became an international disaster. World Bank, UNESCO, BMBF and others attacked the problem to protect the Aral Sea.

DE policy; public participation, stakeholders, water management
AB Stakeholder involvement in water management is widely recognized as an important component of the design and implementation of sustainable water management initiatives. Despite this, there remains a deep-rooted resistance to the widespread implementation of programs to prioritize such involvement (as witnessed by, for example, the low priority given to the public involvement element of the European Union Water Framework Directive).
   This paper addresses the issue of stakeholder involvement by first confronting the fact that it is not a water issue, per se. Such diverse fields as economics, agriculture, public health, pollution prevention, business and education have also identified stakeholder involvement as a difficult but necessary component of successful action in their fields. For the water sector, the issue of stakeholder involvement as either a necessity for sustainable water management, or a luxury to be used to complement traditional approaches, is discussed.

DE Melbourne; water recycling
AB Melbourne Water has adopted a challenging target of recycling 20 per cent of treated effluent from Melbourne's two major sewerage treatment plants by 2010. This target was adopted in response to key drivers for water recycling in the Melbourne region such as: strong support for conserving water resources and protecting marine environments; acknowledgment of recycled water as a valuable resource; greater emphasis on environmental issues and sustainable management principles; and opportunities to increase demand for recycled water through effective planning mechanisms. Issues that must be effectively addressed to meet the target include: managing public perceptions of recycled water; health and environmental concerns; lack of consensus among government agencies; high up-front costs of infrastructure; and prices of other sources of water supply not currently true coated. Melbourne Water has identified the following factors as critical in determining the success of recycling strategy: ability to demonstrate that water recycling will be important in terms of long term water cycle management; effective stakeholder consultation; gaining government support; establishing long-term, guaranteed markets for recycled water; implementing well planned, large scale recycling schemes; ability to provide a product that meets customer needs; regulatory approval; and implementation of a system that is economically viable. Water recycling initiatives are being investigated on household, local and regional levels. Over 10 proposals that will contribute to the 20 per cent recycled water target from the regional treatment plants are under various stages of development. Melbourne Water's commitment to recycling within a total water cycle management context is a vital component of this major new initiative for Melbourne and is crucial for a sustainable future.

DE septic tanks; small communities; sustainability
AB Connection to centralised regional sewage systems has been too expensive for small-dispersed communities, and these townships have traditionally been serviced by on-site septic tank systems. The conventional on-site system in Australia has consisted of an anaerobic holding tank followed by adsorption trenches. This technique relies heavily on the uptake of nutrients by plants for effective removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the effluent, and is very seasonal in its efficiency. Hence, as these small communities have grown in size, the environmental effects of the septic tank discharges have become a problem. In locations throughout Australia, such as rural Victoria and along the Hawkesbury-Nepean River, septic tanks are being replaced with the transport of sewage to regional treatment plants. For some isolated communities, this can mean spending $20,000-$40,000/household, as opposed to more common connection prices of $7,000/household. This paper explores some alternative options that might be suitable for these small communities, and attempts to identify solutions that provide acceptable environmental outcomes at lower cost. The types of alternative systems that are assessed in the paper include local treatment systems, separate blackwater and greywater collection and treatment systems both with and without non-potable water recycling, a small township scale treatment plant compared to either existing septic tank systems or pumping to a remote regional treatment facility. The work demonstrated the benefits of a scenario analysis approach for the assessment of a range of alternative systems. It demonstrated that some of the alternatives systems can achieve better than 90% reductions in the discharge of nutrients to the environment at significantly lower cost than removing the wastewater to a remote regional treatment plant. These concepts allow wastewater to be retained within a community allowing for local reuse of treated effluent.

DE development; planning; regionalisation; stormwater; sustainability; WSUD
AB Impacts from urban stormwater runoff on receiving environments have been well documented, particularly through specific regional scientific studies. Using various local government planning and management elements, urban developments in Brisbane City are now able to address stormwater management in an increasingly holistic context. One key initiative includes facilitating Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) components within an Integrated Water Management Strategy that looks at policy formation, planning strategies, design option, community marketing and acceptance, maintenance programs and finally evaluation of various WSUD approaches. These can include the use of Natural Channel Designs, grassed swales, bio-filtration systems, porous pavements and roofwater tanks in several economic combinations. By linking with the Cooperative Research Centre for Catchment Hydrology, Brisbane City Council has influenced the design of WSUD planning tools and benefited the city with academic inputs into extensive evaluation programs. As well, it has also contributed to the Cooperative Research Centre's research outcomes. These evaluation programs are increasingly providing better understanding of various stormwater quality best management practices throughout Australia. As part of the overall implementation process; active involvement by a range of stakeholders has been crucial. These stakeholders have included internal planning, development assessment and design staff, external consultants, developers, and other local and state government agencies. The latter two groups are assisting in the important task of regionalisation of Brisbane City Council's policies and guidelines. Implementation of WSUD initiatives and stormwater re-use strategies under Council's new "Integrated Water Management" agenda are showing some excellent results, suggesting that sustainable urban development is no longer like the search for the Holy Grail.

AB Integration means different things to different people and as a consequence appears to only partially deliver on promised outcomes. For effective integrated water cycle management these outcomes should include improved water use efficiency, less waste, environmental sustainability, and provide secure and reliable supply to meet social and economic needs. The objective of integration is the management and combination of all these outcomes as part of a whole, so as to provide better outcomes than would be expected by managing the parts independently. Integration is also a consequence of the Water Reforms embarked on by the NSW State Government in 1995. The key goals of the reforms are clean and healthy rivers and groundwaters, and the establishment of more secure water entitlements for users. They are also essential for meeting the Council of Australian Government (COAG) water management strategies. The policies and guidelines that formed the NSW Water Reforms were the basis of the Water Management Act 2000 (NSW) (WMA) which is the legislative framework for water management in NSW. The NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation has developed an approach to integrated water cycle management for rural centres in NSW based on a catchment and policy-context. This approach includes consideration of catchment wide needs and issues, environmental sustain-ability, government policy and community objectives in the development of an integrated water cycle plan. The approach provides for a transparent assessment of priorities and how to deal with them, and while specific to urban centres, could easily be expanded for use in the management of the whole of the catchment water cycle: Integration of the water cycle is expected to offer benefits to the local environment, community and economy. For instance, any unused proportion of an urban centre's water entitlement, or an offset against this entitlement created through returned flows (such as via good quality sewage effluent discharge to a river), can provide a surplus which is available to be traded on an annual basis. Further, improved demand management within an urban centre can be expected to result in a reduction in abstraction against the licence entitlement. This may result in the increased availability of in-stream water for environmental or other purposes and is expected to increase the economic value of returned water. Improved water use efficiencies are also-expected to result in reduced capital works (and their associated costs) as the efficiency of service delivery and resource use improves. In this paper an example of the application of this process is provided and the outcomes discussed.

AB In the wastewater industry, decision-makers lack access to an environmental tool that can assist in further informing the non-financial analysis of a system. Such a tool should incorporate impacts beyond the effluent quality and look at the supporting processes of a plant as well as plant specific operations. Life Cycle Assessment can provide the means to fill a gap in pertinent information towards more sustainable decision-making. The project "Best Practice LCA in the Wastewater Industry" is commissioned by the CRC for Waste Management and Pollution Control at UNSW with representatives from Sydney Water Corporation (SWC), NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation and the NSW Department of Public Works. Two case studies were researched to provide a post-implementation review of changes in wastewater treatment.
   Case study 1: The conversion from chlorine gas to hypochlorite and UV disinfection has been completed for several inland wastewater plants at SWC. A review of operational data for each of the options has been incorporated into an LCA of each technology. Under efficient dosing conditions, disinfection with the hypochlorite system has the minimum environmental impact.
   Case study 2 deals with the conversion from anaerobic to aerobic digestion. Aerobic digestion minimises release of nutrients into a sidestream to be further treated in the plant. However conversion results in more biosolids production and higher electricity requirements. This study includes a consideration of the environmental impacts of biosolids production and application. On the basis of the extended system boundary including consideration of reflux composition, energy requirements and biosolids quality to potentially offset fertiliser production, anaerobic digestion performs best in 6 out of 9 impact categories.
   These results suggest that environmental LCA has a role in informing decision-making on unit process and treatment train selection by quantifying aspects on non-financial criteria. Also, improvement potentials are foreshadowed but not detailed.

AB Organic loads have been significantly reduced in nightsoil plants along with the employment of sewage treatment plants. Nightsoil consisting of 10% septage and showing higher ratios of alkalinity and carbon to nitrogen helped nitrification and denitrification for those combined plants with weak piggery waste. However, alkalinity and carbon addition was necessary with the weak nightsoil consisting of 80% septage when the combined influent was less than 21 g/L COD. The piggery waste could be applied at a rate of 0.5 kgTKN/oxic m(3)/d, but the organic load should be limited to 0.7 kgCOD/m(3)/d with strong piggery waste during summer in order not to exceed the reactor temperature higher than 35 C.

AB The controversial topic of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) in aquatic environments is of international and Australian significance with the need for sustainable management of water resources increasing. The issues have been highlighted on the major continents of Europe and North America but so far have received less,attention in Australia. A major source of these compounds has been identified as sewage effluent, which is treated prior to release to the environment with a primary focus on pathogen and nutrient removal. Sewage effluent is a complex mixture, which can contain many organic and inorganic compounds some of which may remain after treatment processes. More recently, technologies such as ozonation, UV treatment and advanced filtration have improved the quality of effluent discharged to the environment but there are still unresolved issues relating to poorly understood chemistries relating to EDCs in effluent discharges and the possible impacts in aquatic environments and to human health.
   This paper reports on an investigation of the removal from sewage effluent of selected chemicals that are known or suspected environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) by sand filtration, ozonation and UV treatment at the Landsborough Water Reclamation Plant in Queensland, Australia. Compounds detected in the raw effluent included pesticides, herbicides, some heavy metals and the human hormones 17bestradiol and estrone. Most of these were removed by the advanced treatments at the water reclamation plant, with only trace concentrations of some compounds present in the final effluent. Removal of toxicants by a:free water surface wetland is also reported on. Some of the constraint's of direct chemical measurements are discussed and some solutions proposed.

AB The search for sustainable ways of living has necessitated a new look at the way in which water services are provided. The new paradigm includes whole-system perspectives for each of the primary criteria groups: social, environmental and economic. Whilst Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) techniques have been used successfully for products, they are much less used to assess processes. Nonetheless there is much to learn from the use of LCA for a much wider range of applications. An application is described whereby LCA has been used to determine energy, mass flows and environmental impacts for a number of sewer-related options for handling sewer solids, using the SimaPro software. This work has been part of a wider study to provide enhanced decision support systems for water utilities.

AB There-is a need to create a balance between development and conservation in order to find a way to mitigate the conflicting interests of water for society, the environment and the economy. Apart from finding a solution to this there is a need to get the message across to the decision makers. How do we make good ideas permeate policy and translate into concrete programs? The Young Water Professionals gave their view through presentations and discussions. It was argued that the answer was not to be found only in environmental science but also in the political and social arena. It was argued that the sanctioned discourse is a powerful force in water allocation and management. How can a balance be struck? Many argued for a unique design of a policy for the whole catchment, acknowledging ecology and existing institutions. Furthermore, many argued in favor of building on existing institutions and steward groups for sustainability and increase their adaptive capacity.

AB Environmental laws define the scarcity of environmental resources as they affect the factor endowment of a country and therefore its position in the international division of labour There is now also a general agreement that applying the 'polluter pays" principle should solve environmental problems. As the burden of abatement increases, as measured by the ratio of abatement expenditure to sales, there is definitely an incentive for firms to either invest in cleaner technology or more efficient abatement technology. There is also evidence that taxes and charges, designed to internalise externalities, can actually affect trade.
   It is interesting to know if the developing countries face particular market access problems in the face of stringent environmental standards and regulations. While it is true that stringent measures impose market accees restrictions and cause limitations on competitiveness, this much more widely felt by the developing countries because of lack of infrastructure and monitoring facilities, limited technology choices, inadequate access to environment-friendly raw materials, lack of complete information, presence of small-scale exporters and emergence of environmental standards in sectors of export interest to developing countries. The small and medium enterprises often divert sales either to the domestic market or to external markets where environmental requirements are less stringent, in order to save on their posts.
   In developing countries, 80% of the tanning industry is comprised of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) processing raw to semi-finished leather, usually less than 2 tons per day. In Europe and other developed countries the SMEs in the leather sector have vanished due to strict environmental legislation and this will likely occur in developing countries also. The environmental legislation has not always been practical either because the laws are too ambitious or unrealistic in certain parameters, or because they have lacked effective instrumentation and institutional support. Some environmental regulations have not succeeded as they do not match the technical requirements and economic reality of the country or region, or because they do not take the institutional capabilities of the society that has to implement them into consideration. For the survival and sustenance of the SMEs in the leather industry, if may be a viable alternative to carry out the tanning process in a decentralized fashion such that the raw to semi-finished process is carried out in the large scale sector while the semi-finished to finished process could either be reserved or open to competition as per the countries' requirements. But the issue of concern is whether it is fair that the raw to semi:finished tanning process, containing 70% of the pollution discharge should be undertaken by developing countries alone, especially if it is at the cost of their survival! However, the game analysed in the paper reveals that tanning units in developing countries would prefer to comply with the regulations and stay in the industry, the alternatives being to collude or to compete!.

AB In the UK, the recycling of sewage sludge to land is expected to double by 2006 but the security of this route is threatened by environmental concerns and health scares. Strategic investment is needed to ensure sustainable and secure sludge recycling outlets. At present, the security of this landbank for sludge recycling is determined by legislation relating to nutrient rather than potentially toxic elements (PTEs) applications to land - especially the environmental risk linked to soil phosphorus (P) saturation.
   We believe that not all land has an equal risk of contributing nutrients derived from applications to land to receiving waters. We are currently investigating whether it is possible to minimise nutrient loss by applying sludge to land outside Critical Source Areas (CSAs) regardless of soil P Index status. Research is underway to develop a predictive and spatially-sensitive, semi-distributed model of critical thresholds for sludge application that goes beyond traditional 'end-of-pipe" or "edge-of-field" modelling, to include hydrological flow paths and delivery mechanisms to receiving waters from non-point sources at the catchment scale.

AB A field study was conducted during 1999, 2000, and 2001 at Stoneville, MS, on a Dundee silty clay loam to determine the impact of a rye cover crop with one or two postemergence (POST) herbicide applications on weed control, yield, and net return in narrow-row glyphosate-resistant, glufosinate-resistant, and conventional soybean systems. Cover crop systems included no-cover crop conventional tillage (CT), no-cover crop no-tillage (NT), and rye NT, all with early POST (EPOST), EPOST followed by late POST (LPOST), and no-herbicide weed management. Weed control and net return among glyphosate-resistant, glufosinate-resistant, and conventional soybean systems were similar. One POST ($111/ha) application of herbicides was more profitable than two POST ($79/ba) applications regardless of soybean cultivar and cover crop system. Rye residue reduced total weed density by 9 and 27% and biomass by 19 and 38% compared with no-cover crop CT and NT, respectively. In the rye cover crop, input costs were higher because of the additional cost of seed, planting, and rye desiccation. The additional cost resulted in a lower net return with the rye cover crop ($29/ha) compared with the no-cover crop CT ($84/ha) or NT ($87/ha) system, even though soybean yield in the rye cover crop system was comparable to that from the no-cover crop CT and NT systems. These results showed that because of additional cost, rye cover crop-based soybean production was less profitable compared with existing no-cover crop-based production systems.

AB Research into foreign aid has mostly focused on its ability to affect economic (i.e., GDP per capita) growth. Conclusions have been mixed. I consider aid's effectiveness differently: by its ability to improve quality of life. I find that, though aid does not affect quality of life in the aggregate, it is effective when combined with democracy, and ineffective (and possibly harmful) in autocracies. The results suggest that aid would be more effective if it were combined with efforts to encourage democratization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB What social arrangements stop deforestation? This paper chronicles the sociological factors underlying the rapid establishment, in 14 months, of a community-owned protected forest in Ecuador. Methods developed by the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI). research program provide a stakeholder analysis related to trends in deforestation. Interviews, community meetings, and informal discussions provide data on attitudes of local people during and after establishment of the forest preserve. Knowledge and resources external to the community motivated local people to preserve a cloud forest, but local institutions and communal land tenure were critical for the rapid establishment of the protected area.

TI Rethinking recent democratization - Lessons from the postcommunist
   experience
SO WORLD POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This study compares democratization in the postcommunist region (or the twenty-seven countries that emerged from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe) in order to evaluate some of the assumptions and arguments in the literature on recent democratization in southern Europe and Latin America. Five conclusions are drawn, all of which challenge the received wisdom about democratization in southern Europe and Latin America. First, the uncertainty surrounding the postcommunist transitions to democracy varied significantly. This influenced, in turn, the strategies of transition and their payoffs. This also meant that the most successful transitions in the postcommunist context involved a sharp break with the old order. Second, popular mobilization often functioned to support the democratic project. Third, nationalist mobilization was also helpful, though this depended upon whether it began with the breakdown of authoritarian rule or had a longer history-with the latter compromising the democratic project. Fourth, if the timing of nationalist mobilization was critical for the success of democratization in those cases where such mobilization occurred, then the strength of the opposition was the key factor in the remaining cases. Finally, while democratic consolidation necessarily enhances the prospects for democratic sustainability, the failure to consolidate democracy does not necessarily threaten the continuation of democratic rule. Indeed, as in the Russian case, such a failure may prolong democratic rule. This suggests, in turn, that a key distinction must be made between the optimal conditions for democratization and optimal strategies.

ID CONSERVATION; VALIDATION; AGE
AB Management of captive populations relies on a complex synthesis of genetic and demographic analyses to guide populations toward sustainability. Demographic analyses of captive populations currently utilize age-based matrix projections to predict a population's trajectory. An alternate approach is to use a stage-based, system dynamics model for captive systems. Such models can more easily incorporate complex captive systems in which population dynamics are dependent on a combination of management and a species' biology. By linking these two areas, population managers can gain a more accurate understanding of how management decisions impact captive populations and which aspects of a species' demography should be of special concern in the future. We present a general stage-based system dynamics model that has been developed for use with captive populations. The utility of the model is then illustrated by applying it to three captive bear populations: spectacled bears (Tremarctos ornatus), sloth bears (Melursus ursinus), and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus).

AB The population of great hornbills (Buceros bicornis) in the United States is rapidly aging, and captive breeding efforts have not met population managers' expectations for a sustainable captive group. Little is known about the reproductive physiology of these birds. This study reports the first data on the reproductive endocrinology of the great hornbill. The hormone profiles of the only pair of these birds that hatched a chick in the 1999-2000 breeding season are compared to the profiles of six other pairs of hornbills, from different institutions in the United States, that did not reproduce successfully that season. The study investigates the estradiol, corticosterone, and testosterone profiles of these seven pairs of birds, establishing a base of knowledge from which endocrine data may be used to improve the success of captive breeding programs. The estradiol profiles from this study indicate a difference in hormonal patterns between laying and non-laying female great hornbills. Egg-laying females had significantly higher estradiol concentrations during the breeding season than the non-laying females (P<0.003). Testosterone concentrations of the males were not significantly different between the mates of egg-laying and non-egg-laying females. The corticosterone concentrations tended to be lower in the females that laid eggs vs. the non-egg-laying group. The males of the egg-laying pairs showed a significantly lower (P<0.036) corticosterone concentration than the non-egg-laying male pairs. This, combined with the extremely low corticosterone levels (compared to the other birds in the study) of the pair of hornbills that hatched a chick in the 1999-2000 breeding season, suggests that adrenal activity may play a role in the reproductive failure of some captive great hornbills.

TI Adverse effect of waterlogging and soil salinity on crop and land
   productivity in northwest region of Haryana, India
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE sodicity; waterlogging; degradation; salinity; sustainability
ID SALT
AB In the irrigated areas of semi-arid regions, especially in northwest India, a considerable recharge to the groundwater leads to waterlogging and secondary salinization. In several sub-areas groundwater is mined, water tables fall, and salts are added to the root zone because a high proportion of irrigation water is derived from pumped groundwater of poor quality. Out of 1 million hectares of irrigation induced waterlogged saline area in northwest India, approximately half a million hectares are in the state of Haryana. Taking a homogenous physical environment as a starting point, the way and the extent to which farmers' activities will affect the salinity and sodicity situation depend on farming and irrigation practices. In the past, soil salinity was mainly associated with high groundwater tables, which bring salts into the root zone through capillary rise when water is pumped. But nowadays, increasing exploitation of groundwater for irrigation purposes has led to declining groundwater tables and a threat of sodification and salinization due to use of poor quality groundwater. Farmers in northwest India are facing a situation in which they have to deal with salt volumes that are harmful for water uptake of crops. They are also facing the problem of sodicity, which has an adverse effect on the physical structure of the soil, causing problems of water intake, transfer and aeration. To mitigate the adverse effect of soil salinity on crop yield, the farmers irrigate frequently, either mixing canal water and groundwater,.or alternately using canal water and groundwater. Due to differences in environmental parameters in the farming systems, such as groundwater quality, soil types and uneven distribution of irrigation water, income losses to the farming community are not uniform. This paper highlights the economic loss due to environmental degradation through the twin problems of waterlogging and soil salinity, which threaten the sustainability of agricultural production in Haryana state. Our analysis shows that the net present value of the damage due to waterlogging and salinity in Haryana is about Rs. 23,900/ha (in 1998-1999 constant prices). The estimated potential annual loss is about Rs. 1669 million (about US$ 37 million) from the waterlogged saline area. The major finding of the paper is that intensification per se is not the root cause of land degradation, but rather the policy environment that encouraged inappropriate land use and injudicious input use, especially excessive irrigation. Trade policies, output price policies and input subsidies all have contributed to the degradation of agricultural land. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ultraluminous X-ray objects (ULXs) are off-nucleus point sources with L-X = 10(39)-10(41) ergs s(-1), but the nature 39 of such systems is largely unidentified. Here we report a 2.1 hr period observed in a Chandra ACIS observation for ULX M51 X-7, which is located on the edge of a young star cluster in the star-forming region in a spiral arm. In two ACIS observations separated by 1 yr, the ULX changed from a high-hard to a low-soft spectral state, in contrast to most Galactic low-mass X-ray binaries. On the basis of its period and spectral behaviors, we suggest that this ULX is a low-mass X-ray binary system, with a dwarf companion of 0.2-0.3 M. and a compact accretor, either a neutron star or a black hole, whose mass is not well constrained. Relativistic beaming effects are likely involved to produce the observed high X-ray luminosities, given its low accretion rate as inferred from a sustainable accretion scenario via Roche lobe overflow.

AB This work presents a specific stock-effort dynamic model. The stock corresponds to two fish populations growing and moving between two fishing zones, on which they are harvested by two different fleets. The effort represents the number of fishing vessels of the two fleets which operate on the two fishing zones. The bioeconomical model is a set of four ordinary differential equations governing the stocks and the fishing efforts in the two fishing areas. Fish migration, as well as vessels displacements, between the two zones are assumed to take place at a faster time scale than the variation of the stocks and the changes of fleets sizes, respectively. The vessels movements between the two fishing areas are assumed to be stock dependent, i.e. the larger the stock density is in a zone the more vessels tends to remain in it. The global fish stock and the total number of vessels keep constant at the fast time scale. This property enables, via aggregation methods, the reduction of the system dimension in order to proceed to its qualitative analysis. Under some assumptions, we obtain either a stable equilibrium or a stable limit cycle which involves large cyclic variations of the total fish stock and fishing effort. Finally, we introduce a control parameter to maintain the system at a sustainable equilibrium and thus avoiding the important fluctuations founded otherwise. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

   societal constraints on environmental action drawing on Luhmann's social
   theory
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING

AB We draw upon Luhmann's social theory to suggest a framework for quantitative modeling of coupled natural/human systems that may be useful in simulating the effect of societal constraints on environmental action. We (1) provide a brief summary of the key aspects of Luhmann's social theory, (2) develop a quantitative model based on this theory and evaluate model sensitivity to changes in parameters representing important aspects of the theory, (3) propose a structural linkage between the social model and biophysical models, and (4) link the social model to a simple ecological model to simulate societal constraints on environmental action. The model consists of six submodels, each representing one of the six subsystems of modern society identified by Luhmann: economy, politics, law, religion, science, and education. State variables within each submodel represent either active entities that randomly exchange units of information daily or repositories of inactive information. The. daily probability that inactive information becomes active increases, and the probability that active information becomes inactive decreases, as the strength of the subsystem increases. Strength is determined by the relative distribution of active information units among the state variables, with maximum strength attained with uniform distribution. Communication among the six subsystems depends on the relative strengths of the subsystems and the frequency with which they resonate with other subsystems. Subsystems communicate externally at the following frequencies: politics once-yearly, economics and education once every 3 months, legal once a month, and religion and science once daily. We investigated model behavior by running a series of replicate stochastic simulations and monitoring system and subsystem strength and robustness and over a period of 10 years. The simulated society was both stable and robust. Both stability and robustness of subsystems were inversely related to the, frequency of communication with other subsystems, and both strength and robustness were more variable for subsystems with higher external communication frequencies. System strength and robustness were most sensitive to changes in factors affecting the. resonance among subsystems. Subsystems open to communication with others on a daily basis (religion and science) exhibited more frequent occurrence of extinction than did subsystems open to external communication less frequently. We explored the model's usefulness in simulating societal constraints on environmental action by coupling it to a simple ecological model that simulates use of a common forage resource. We coupled the models by linking the economic, political, and legal subsystems of society to the environment via a community of resource managers composed of six pairs of ranchers, with each pair sharing a common forage resource. We structured the linkages of the economic and political subsystems with the environment to represent the Prisoner's Dilemma; and the linkages between the legal subsystem and the environment to represent the concept of mutual coercion. We ran two series of simulations in which we 'unlinked' and then 're-linked' the environment to the legal subsystem. Results from the first series of simulations demonstrated the classic ecological tragedy of the commons. Results from the second series of simulations demonstrated the effect of periodically imposed (by mutual coercion) legal restrictions on stocking rates, which allowed recovery of forage resources and supported sustainable profits for ranchers.
   We also examined the sensitivity of simulation results to changes in the values of key parameters affecting the dynamics of premises as they are communicated between the environment and society and among the subsystems of society. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Information system utilization in supply chain integration efforts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper investigates a set of advisable strategies for information systems utilization in supply chain integration initiatives. Through an analysis of structural relationships among the ways in which information systems are utilized for supply chain integration-i.e. Infrastructural Support, Value Creation Management, Logistical Operations-and supply chain management performance, we argue that there might be a recommended sequence in using information systems for supply chain integration. Tests of hypotheses relating to information systems utilization using empirical data from manufacturing firms indicate that, as the stage of integration moves from independent operation to internal and on to external integration, the focus of information systems utilization should shift from infrastructural support to value creation management and logistical operations, and this change of IS utilization focus can lead to sustainable competitiveness.

TI Carbon sequestration estimates for forestry options under different
   land-use scenarios in India
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Land resources have been under tremendous pressure since the very beginning of civilization for food and forest products. For better land-use management, these resources must be used sustainably and in accordance with the demands of the masses. To manage the land resources effectively and for future food security we need to find out the demands and potential of our land. In this study, a comparative estimate of land-use And carbon sequestration potential of different forestry options has been done for India. This has been done using the Land Use and Carbon Sequestration (LUCS) model. This model systematically incorporates Indian agricultural and forest statistics with geographical and demographic data. Besides this, various pressures exerted on land-use system due to,the existing growth rates of population, fuelwood requirements, export of agricultural commodities and probable transfer of lands from one category to the other, are also considered here. Three scenarios (LUCS-I, LUCS-II and LUCS-III) are generated with different land-use options following the demands and present land-use pattern prevailing in the country. The scenario LUCS-I puts maximum amount of land into the forestry sector and is an economically feasible scenario. The scenario LUCS-II is a 'business as usual' scenario, as it is projected according to the current five-year plan. The scenario LUCS-III puts maximum amount of land in the plantations category and is a potential scenario. These scenarios were generated for a time period of fifty years starting from the year 2000. The LUCS model estimates the amount of carbon sequestered by approximating land-use and relative biomass changes in the landscape over time. The amount of carbon sequestered in scenario LUCS-III is estimated to be 6.937 billion tonnes, which is the highest among those sequestered in all the three scenarios. According to this scenario, the carbon sequestered in aboveground vegetation of India will be more than double by the year 2050.

TI Land use dynamics in the semi-arid region of Brazil (Quixaba, PE):
   characterization by principal component analysis (PCA)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING

ID REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; MANAGEMENT; TIME
AB The changes caused by the pressure of human occupation can be observed by non-sustainable land use forms, in the Brazilian semi-arid region. The multitemporal analysis of changes in the caatinga land cover provides sufficient information about the dynamics of this typical land use. Within this frame, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied in combination with field survey data, which permitted estimation of point samples of new recovery/degradation. The area selected for this study is located in the central-southern semi-arid section of Pernambuco State, north-cast Brazil. It covers an area of about 190 km(2) and is located between geographical coordinates 8degrees 00' to 8degrees 07'S and 39degrees 45' to 39degrees 53'W. Five classes of changed and unchanged multitemporal effects were discriminated. The results of this study were evaluated using combined Geographical Information System (GIS) and field survey techniques. This work was less time-consuming and economically significant for the time period 1983-96. An alternative PCA method was proposed based on the analysis of the results and errors in a confusion matrix. This alternative method is based on the controlled rotative analogy of the PCA transformation, where a smaller angle of rotation was applied.

AB [1] We used a dynamic, long-term mass balance approach to track cumulative carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) losses to fire in boreal Manitoba over the 6500 years since deglaciation. Estimated C losses to decomposition and fire, combined with measurements of N pools in mature and burned forest floors, suggest that loss of N by combustion has likely resulted in a long-term loss that exceeds the amount of N stored in soil today by 2 to 3 times. These estimates imply that biological N fixation rates could be as high as 5 to 10 times atmospheric deposition rates in boreal regions. At the site scale, the amount of N lost is due to N content of fuels, which varies by stand type and fire severity, which in turn vary with climate and fire dynamics. The interplay of fire frequency, fire severity, and N partitioning during regrowth are important for understanding rates and sustainability of nutrient and carbon cycling over millenia and over broad regions.

AB The risk of contamination of drinking water supplies with microbial pathogens is minimised by modern approaches to water management, but continues to be the major public health concern.
   Chemical contaminants usually pose little health risk except at very high levels, but debate continues over the potential adverse health effects of low-level, chronic exposure to compounds such as disinfection byproducts.
   Recreational water contact can be associated with adverse health outcomes either from microbial infections or exposure to cyanobacterial toxins.
   Environmental issues such as increasing salinity and global warming are likely to affect the sustainability of our current drinking water supplies and increase the threat of waterborne disease outbreaks.
   New technologies, use of alternative water sources, such as rainwater tanks, water reuse and restrictions will undoubtedly be part of the solution to our diminishing water resources, but have the potential to introduce new health threats.

TI Trade and competitiveness of African economies in the 21st century
SO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT 1998 Project LINK-Meeting
CY SEP 14-18, 1998
CL RIO JANEIRO, BRAZIL
AB One of the major challenges that may be confronting sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies(1) in the 21st century is that of a changing North-South trading structure. An earlier study (Olofin, 1995), tried to show that close to the turn of the century, the SSA countries remained the only group of countries whose exports were predominantly primary products, complemented by trade in manufactured imports. In virtually every other region of the world, this pattern of trade had changed to a more competitive one. Most other nations had moved progressively away from primary exports to manufactured exports of the labour intensive type, and subsequently to more resource intensive manufactures. The single major development that has reshaped the terrain for global trade, and which will significantly influence the course of trade and international competitiveness in the 21st century, is the Uruguay Round (UR) negotiations. It produced the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the subsequent World Trade Organization (WTO) treaty. Various analyses have shown (Sorsa, 1997) that the overall impact of UR trade liberalization on SSA countries may be quite insignificant at least in the short run. This is primarily because many of the provisions of the resulting WTO treaty do not cover the bulk of African trade, especially in respect of their exports. However, there is hardly any doubt that the GATT 1994/WTO treaty and its provisions would define the stage for global competition in production and trade in the 21st century. If SSA countries are not to be marginalized in the scheme of things over the medium to longer term, they will of necessity have to respond, if not to the immediate effects of the treaty on trade and competitiveness, at least to its longer-term ramifications. The resulting patterns of trade and competitiveness are likely to have far-reaching effects on the prospects for evolving a viable strategy for sustainable growth and development in these countries. The primary objective in this paper, therefore, is first to examine some of the implications of the outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations for the external trade of sub-Saharan African countries as a bloc: Secondly, to identify some of the major obstacles to their competitiveness; and thirdly as a consequence, to be able to arrive at some form of research agenda, that should engage the attention of researchers and policy-makers alike within the region in the near to medium term. This is crucial, if appropriate policies are to emerge towards addressing the growing concerns on African marginalization in the face of increasing globalization.

We studied agricultural production systems in three agro-ecozones of Burkina Faso to establish: (1) farmer interest in and ability to use forecasts; (2) forecast information farmers request; (3) lead-time required for greatest forecast value; (4) needs for forecast dissemination, interpretation, and application; and (5) possible strategies for using climate forecasts to improve crop production and resource management. The three agro-ecozones studied were a cotton-based system in the relatively high rainfall Sudan area of southwest Burkina Faso; a sorghum and millet based system in the low rainfall central plateau; and a cattle-based system in the very low rainfall Sahel area in the north. Potential value of forecasts to farmers differed among the three zones, with greatest apparent value to farmers of the central plateau and least apparent value to cattle herders of the Sahel. While farmers in all three agro-ecozones expressed a strong interest in receiving seasonal precipitation forecasts, they were much more interested in receiving forecasts of when the rains would start and end, and whether there would be interruptions in rains. Our results suggest that if seasonal precipitation forecasts are disseminated, they should be a part of an extension package that includes discussion of the probabilistic nature of the forecasts, potential response strategies, and risk management. Furthermore, farmers may need greater access to basic agricultural technologies, such as plows, new crop varieties, and fertilizers, before they can benefit fully from precipitation forecasts.

AB A study using a participatory research approach and simple field techniques found significant differences in agroecological resistance between plots on "conventional" and "sustainable" farms in Nicaragua after Hurricane Mitch. On average, agroecological plots on sustainable farms had more topsoil, higher field moisture, more vegetation, less erosion and lower economic losses after the hurricane than control plots on conventional farms. The differences in favor of agroecological plots tended to increase with increasing levels of storm, intensity, increasing slope and years under agroecological practices, though the patterns of resistance suggested complex interactions and thresholds. For some indicators agroecological resistance collapsed under extreme stress.
   With the help of 19 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and 45 fanner-technician teams, 833 farmers measured key agroecological indicators on 880 plots paired under the same topographical conditions. These paired observations covered 181 communities of smallholders from southern to northern Nicaragua. The broad geographical coverage took into account the diversity of ecological conditions, a variety of practices common to sustainable agriculture in Nicaragua, and moderate, high and extreme levels of hurricane impact. This coverage, and the massive mobilization of farmer-technician field research teams, was made possible by the existence of the Movimiento Campesino a Campesino (MCAC) (farmer-to-farmer movement), a widespread smallholders' network for sustainable land management.
   An approach for measuring agroecological resistance is introduced, and it is suggested that comparatively higher levels of agroecological resistance are an indication of lower vulnerability and higher sustainability. However, the effectiveness of practices appears to be bounded by a combination of steep slopes, maintenance and design of soil conservation structures, and extremely high storm intensity.
   The study concludes that the participatory research can contribute significantly to the monitoring and development of sustainable land management systems (SLM) among smallholders, and recommends a sustainable, participatory approach to agricultural reconstruction following natural disasters.

AB An increasing variety of evaluation methods is being proposed to address the question of the environmental impacts of agriculture. This paper compares and analyses 12 indicator-based approaches to assessing environmental impact at the farm level, in order to propose a set of guidelines for the evaluation or development of such methods. These methods take into account a number of environmental objectives (e.g. soil erosion, water quality). A set of indicators is used to quantify the degree to which these objectives are attained. A total of 26 objectives were taken into account by one or several of the methods. A great diversity in breadth of analysis exists: the number of objectives considered per method varies from 2 to 13. Indicator-based methods for environmental evaluation at the farm level should take into account a range of objectives covering both local and global effects. Indicators based on the environmental effects of farmer practices are preferable to indicators based on farmer practices as the link with the objective is direct and the choice of means is left to the farmer. Indicators based on farmer practices cost less in data collection but do not allow an actual evaluation of environmental impact. Indicators allowing expression of impacts both per unit surface and per unit product are preferable. Indicators producing output in the form of values are preferred to indicators producing scores. If possible, science-based threshold values should be defined for indicators. The method should be validated with respect to (a) the appropriateness of its set of objectives relative to its purpose and (b) its indicators. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Populations of foliar insect pests and natural enemies were monitored in vegetable production systems incorporating varying degrees of sustainable practices in Fletcher, NC, USA. Two types of tillage (conventional plow and disk, strip-tillage), two input approaches (chemically-based, biologically-based) and two cropping schedules (continuous tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), 3-year rotation of corn (Zea mays L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and tomato) were employed from 1995 to 1998. Tomato pest pressure was relatively low in all years, resulting in a limited impact of production systems on potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) (Homoptera: Aphididae), and its associated parasitoids and predators. Thrips (Frankliniella spp. (Thysanoptera)) populations were significantly higher in the biological input treatments in 3 of 4 years. Lepidopterous (primarily Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)) damage on tomato was significantly higher in biological treatments in all years, damage by thrips and pentatomids (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) increasing each year in the continuous tomato crop schedule. Most insect populations were significantly influenced by type of insecticide input or ground cover. Few population measurements were affected by tillage type. Foliar insect problems in commercial vegetable production may be associated predominantly with insecticide input (i.e. more damage with biologically based insecticides) and use of intercropping (i.e. more damage in systems with living mulch); however, the long term effects of tillage and crop rotation remain to be seen.

AB Populations of epigeal arthropods were monitored in vegetable production systems under varying degrees of sustainable agricultural practices in Fletcher, NC (USA). Two tillage types (conventional plow and disk, strip-tillage (ST)), two input approaches (chemically based, biologically based) and two cropping schedules (continuous tomato Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., 3-year rotation of sweet corn [Zea mays L.]/cabbage [Brassica oleracea L.], cucumber [Cucumis sativus L.]/cabbage and tomato) were employed from 1995-1998. A second study with tomatoes was performed in 1997-1998 to separate effects of pesticide use, intercropping and herbicide application. Pitfall traps (48-h sample period) were used at similar to25-day intervals to monitor relative activity of carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), staphylinid (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) beetles and lycosid spiders (Araneidae: Lycosidae). Carabids and lycosids appeared to be more active in systems with ground cover. Trap catches of carabid species were not significantly affected by insecticide input, but trap catches of lycosids were lower in plots with conventional insecticide use. No consistent effect of tillage was found over time, although Scarites spp. were more active in minimally disturbed habitats in 1998. Two distinct patterns of seasonal activity were observed for carabid beetles and lycosid spiders. Ground cover generally enhanced abundance of carabids and lycosids, while tillage type, pesticide use and crop rotation had different effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable land-use evaluation in agricultural systems needs to accommodate the landscape mosaic. Landscape characteristics, together with data gathered by fanners, were used to classify farms according to a scale related to sustainable land-use. The value of this scale as a tool enabling land managers to use information recorded by farmers and to diagnose land-use sustainability as a means of improving their land-management strategies was evaluated. Sustainability values were not related to any landscape in particular; farms with high sustainability could be found adjacent to farms with low sustainability. This indicates two important facts. First, differing management alternatives were mainly controlled by human decisions that in some way disregarded the ecological systems where the farms were located. Second, the observed variability demonstrates that there is room for improvement, especially by reducing inputs, without harming stability or productivity. An examination of the effect of incoming technologies on sustainability suggests other variables that could be considered in the calculation of farm sustainability indexes, such as those reflecting crop water-use efficiency, soil physical and biological characteristics, biological indicators of wildlife status, and intensification of grazing or harvesting of biomass for human and animal use.

AB Grasslands comprise approximately 40% of the world's terrestrial. surface. Consequently, grassland ecosystems are a significant component of the global carbon cycle. In order to better understand how grazing affects the carbon cycle of grasslands, this study measured CO2 exchange rate (CER) and soil respiration rate (SRR) on 130 ha pastures with a 56-year-history of heavy (60% removal) and light (20% removal) grazing, and their accompanying 0.8 ha exclosures, on the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado, USA. A CER chamber that covered I m 2 of native grassland was used on five plots in each of the four areas. Mid-day CER and SRR were measured during the growing seasons of 1995-1997, along with green vegetation index (GVI, similar to leaf area index) and plant species composition.
   When averaged over each growing season, there was no significant difference in CER of grazed pastures versus exclosures. However, there were seasonal differences in CER, which varied over the 3 years. Differences in CER between grazed pastures and exclosures were not related to GVI, which rarely differed between treatments. Grazing treatment differences in CER were driven by climate variability and species composition differences resulting from long-term grazing and exclusion from grazing. Exclosures had more cool-season (C-3) grasses and forbs than grazed plots, which contained more warm-season (C-4) grasses (primarily Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag. Ex Steud.). The somewhat unique, cool spring of 1995 was favorable to cool-season plant metabolism and resulted in higher CER in exclosures compared with grazed pastures. Warm, dry conditions in spring of 1996 favored warm-season species, resulting in higher CER in the heavily-grazed pasture. In 1997, there was little difference in CER between grazed pastures and exclosures. There were very few sampling dates when SRR was different in grazed pastures and exclosures. This study suggests that these intensities of cattle grazing do not alter the photosynthetic and soil respiration components of the carbon cycle of the US shortgrass prairie. It appears that cattle grazing can be a sustainable component of managing this ecosystem for maximum global carbon sequestration. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

TI The simplification of traditional vineyard based agroforests in
   northwestern Portugal: some ecological implications
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
LA English

DE diseases; insect pests; traditional agriculture; vineyard
AB In northwestern Portugal, peasants have developed complex vineyard (Vitis vinifera) systems comprising agroforests composed of host trees, vines, annual crops and in some cases animals. Until recently these vineyards suffered very few pest problems and received relatively low pesticide loads. In the last few years, new policy and market forces have prompted the conversion of many of these systems to monoculture thereby decreasing the biodiversity inherent to traditional vineyards. Many scientists are concerned that with accelerating rates of vineyard simplification insect pest and disease problems may increase due to lack of habitat and resources for natural enemies or to a concentration of preferred host plants for specific pathogens and herbivores. During the growing seasons of 1997 and 1999 we conducted several farm surveys of traditional agroforestry and modernized, monoculture farms. We conducted field measurements to elucidate trends in insect pest and disease incidence in both types of vineyards. Our surveys revealed that monoculture vineyards exhibited lower number of species of predators and parasites and correspondingly higher densities of two grape herbivores (Lobesia botrana and Empoasca vitis) than diverse vineyard agroforests. Botrytis bunch rot seemed more prevalent in the monoculture systems, which also received increased fungicide applications when compared to the traditional vineyards. Although preliminary, our studies suggest that new vineyard designs may be more productive, but such gains occur at the expense of biodiversity and agricultural sustainability, reflected on higher pest vulnerability. Further agroecological studies are needed to account for the full ecological costs of the modernization of traditional vineyard agroforests.

AB Objective: To present a multi-centre study that analyses the socioeconomic, cultural and political contexts that give rise to population mobility, and its relationship to vulnerability to sexually transmitted infections (STI)/HIV/AIDS, in order to provide information that can be used to design appropriate and focused interventions.
   Methods: In each of 11 transit stations (border towns, port cities, areas where mobile populations congregate) in Central America and Mexico, a household survey of the local population was conducted to analyse demographic, socioeconomic characteristics, and information known and opinions held about HIV/AIDS and mobile populations. In-depth interviews with key informants, community members and mobile populations were held to ascertain knowledge about prevention and transmission of STI/HIV/AIDS. Likewise, an ethnographic study was undertaken to identify interactions between local and mobile populations.
   Results: The transit stations share low educational levels among the local population, few public services, repeated human rights violations, violence, poverty and corrupt authorities. Within this social context, transactional sex, sex for survival, rape and non-professional commercial sex happen in conditions that increase the risk of the transmission of STI/HIV, such as infrequent condom use. Migrant women and sex workers are particularly vulnerable in this context. A wide gap exists between information about STI/HIV transmission and reported prevention practices.
   Conclusion: Given the conditions that exist in these transit stations, interventions should be multisectoral, sustainable, and should defend the human rights of various groups, including women and people living with HIV/AIDS. (C) 2002 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.

   PATTERNS
AB Fishery resources are a vital source of food and make valuable economic contributions to the local communities involved in fishery activities along the 850 km stretch of the Tanzania coastline and numerous islands. Small-scale artisanal fishery accounts for the majority of fish catch produced by more than 43 000 fishermen in the country, mainly operating in shallow waters within the continental shelf, using traditional fishing vessels including small boats, dhows, canoes, outrigger canoes and dinghys. Various fishing techniques are applied using uncomplicated passive fishing gears such as basket traps, fence traps, nets as well as different hook and line techniques. Species composition and size of the fish varies with gear type and location. More than 500 species of fish are utilized for food with reef fishes being the most important category including emperors, snappers, sweetlips, parrotfish, surgeonfish, rabbitfish, groupers and goatfish. Most of the fish products are used for subsistence purposes. However, some are exported. Destructive fishing methods such as drag nets and dynamite fishing pose a serious problem as they destroy important habitats for fish and other organisms, and there is a long-term trend of overharvested fishery resources. However, fishing pressure varies within the country as fishery resources are utilized in a sustainable manner in some areas. For this report more than 340 references about Tanzanian fishery and fish ecology were covered. There are many gaps in terms of information needed for successful fishery management regarding both basic and applied research. Most research results have been presented as grey literature (57%) with limited distribution; only one-fifth were scientific publications in international journals.

ID SHRIMP; ENVIRONMENT; LIMITATIONS; MANAGEMENT
AB This paper reviews the experience and status of coastal aquaculture of seaweeds, mollusks, fish and crustaceans in eastern Africa and the islands of the western Indian Ocean. In many respects, coastal aquaculture is still in its infancy in the region, and there is a pressing need to formulate development strategies aimed at improving the income and assuring the availability of affordable protein to coastal communities. This paper also draws from positive and negative experiences in other parts of the world. The requirements of feed and fry, and the conversion of mangroves are used to illustrate how some aquaculture activities constitute a net loss to global seafood production. The paper presents both general and specific sustainability guidelines based on the acknowledgement of aquaculture as an ecological process. It is concluded that without clear recognition of its dependence on natural ecosystems, the aquaculture industry is unlikely to develop to its full potential in the region.

ID GROWTH; CITIES
AB Factors that affect self-sustainability of regional economic development are defined and analyzed in this paper. Extensive empirical testing shows that at the county level, the size of the regional economy and agglomeration effects are less important than its regional multiplier and its export base. Because the classic export-base model fails specification tests when estimated at the county level, a modified export-base model accounting for spatial effects is developed and analyzed. To validate the proposed spatial export-base model, a practical procedure for estimating parameters of the model is also developed and utilized in an empirical study. The paper concludes with a brief review of the applicability of the modified export-base model to the analysis of the selfsustainability of regional economics, its limitations, and its policy implications. In particular, it is suggested that regional economic development policies should focus on promoting patterns of self-reinforcing regional growth rather than on maintaining unsustainable economic initiatives. It is also demonstrated that the size of a county's economy is not directly related to its self-sustainability and growth rates.

AB Floating layers of polystyrene beads suffocate mosquito larvae and pupae and inhibit egg laying. The layers are very durable in breeding sites with water contained within walls, as in wet pit latrines and soakage pits. In some areas such pits constitute an important breeding site for Culex quinquefasciatus. Trials have been conducted in communities in Zanzibar, Tanzania, and in Tamil Nadu, India, where such mosquito populations were the vectors of Wuchereria bancrofti. In each case, treatment of all the pits with polystyrene beads was integrated with mass treatment of the people with antifilarial drugs - in Zanzibar in 1988 with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and in India in the 1990s with DEC plus ivermectin. The results were compared with those in communities with the mass drug treatment alone and with control communities with neither treatment. The polystyrene-bead treatments greatly and sustainably reduced the vector populations. Comparison of the communities after drug treatment ceased showed that this form of vector control contributed markedly to the prevention of a resurgence of filarial infection. Where Cx. quinquefasciatus breeding in pits form a major component of the vector population, use of polystyrene-bead layers could assist considerably in the process of eliminating lymphatic filariasis by mass drug administration.

ID HUMAN APPROPRIATION; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PRODUCTS
AB The concept of viability envelopes (physical, chemical, biological levels) is developed as well as the general consequences and conditions to put in place a global and local sustainable development as defined by official institutions. The three logics and associated regulation processes that define a viable relation-space are presented. Some sentinel variables are proposed. There are, for example, the population life expectancy (PLE) and net photosynthetic production (NPP) on a soil or a sea of ecological quality, as well as the mean temperature and atmospheric CO2 variation velocities. These elementary indicators permit us to follow and evaluate the degree of interaction between human oxygen respiration and energetic consumption with the photosynthetic oxygen production by green plants, as well as the correlation with the thermic and greenhouse effect. The increase or decrease of PLE and NPP as well as the phase-space evolution of the thermic and CO2 pattern can give us a precocious information, for the near future, on the sense of sustainability (positive or negative way) provoked by a socio-economic pattern and energetic choice. A cybernetical model is presented as well as different ways of positive adaptation and management.

AB Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) of the southern Beaufort Sea population, distributed from approximately Icy Cape, west of Point Barrow, Alaska, to Pearce Point, east of Paulatuk in Canada, are harvested by hunters from both countries. In Canada, quotas to control polar bear hunting have been in place, with periodic modifications, since 1968. In Alaska, passage of the United States Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 banned polarbear hunting unless done by Alaska Natives for subsistence. However, the MMPA placed no restrictions on numbers or composition of the subsistence hunt, leaving open the potential for an overharvest with no possible legal management response until the population was declared depleted. Recognizing that as a threat to the conservation of the shared polar bear population, the Inuvialuit Game Council from Canada and the North Slope Borough from Alaska negotiated and signed a user-to-user agreement, the Polar Bear Management Agreement for the Southern Beaufort Sea, in 1988. We reviewed the functioning of the agreement through its first 10 years and concluded that, overall, it has been successful because both the total harvest and the proportion of females in the harvest have been contained within sustainable limits. However, harvest monitoring needs to be improved in Alaska, and awareness of the need to prevent overharvest of females needs to be increased in both countries. This agreement is a useful model for other user-to-user conservation agreements.

AB The World Summit on Sustainable Development (26 August-4 September 2002), held in Johannesburg on the tenth anniversary of the first Earth Summit, provides the opportunity to reflect on the meaning of the sustainable development concept. This paper uses the case study of the Russian Federation to explore the relationship between official interpretations of sustainable development and alternative understandings concerned with the betterment of humankind, which draw on Russia's cultural and scientific heritage. It is suggested that there is much to be gained from reopening the sustainable development debate to incorporate such cultural particularities, both at the national and international levels.

TI Nuclear power in the United States of America and in Europe - a market
   survey from a vendor's point of view
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB A world population continuing to grow must be provided with sufficient energy supplies at acceptable prices and so as to affect the environment and the climate as little as possible. A growing energy requirement can be met sustainably by a diversified energy mix. Globally, there is a reassessment of nuclear power. Under aspects of the economy, protection of the environment and the climate, geological availability, and geopolitics, nuclear power will make valuable contributions to a solution.
   In the United States, the use of nuclear power has become attractive again in the course of deregulation and as a result of massive increases in plant availability. The nuclear power plants currently in operation offer a promising outlook for the future, also because of the current price increases for natural gas.
   As a consequence of the Green Paper by the EU Commission on the continuity of supply, nuclear power is being reassessed also in Europe. As a result of deregulation of the electricity market, efforts have been made to increase the competitiveness of existing generating capacities. In accordance with changed market conditions, producers have adapted to the requirements of the market by establishing strategic partnerships.
   The envisaged construction of a nuclear power plant in Finland shows that also new nuclear power plants can be attractive in deregulated European markets and that, e.g., also the problems of spent fuel and waste management can be solved if the political will exists to do so.
   In Germany, on the other hand, the political framework conditions for nuclear power continue to be difficult. Unless Germany is willing to fall behind internationally in power generation, all available types of power generation will have to be advanced and combined into a mix serving future needs also in this country. There must be no disruption of technological know-how. Nuclear power must be an important option kept open under reasonable political boundary conditions.

TI Indicators for assessing the safety level of nuclear power plants
SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB Since the political opening of the states of Central and Eastern Europe roughly one decade ago, Western industrialized countries in particular have been striving to achieve sustainable improvements in the safety of nuclear reactors in those countries. One objective of these efforts is to ensure a high level of nuclear safety and safety culture in line with worldwide endeavors. The enlargement of the European Union in the very near future offers an opportunity for reaching this goal in the participating countries.
   Existing international framework agreements refer to the appropriate safety guidelines. At EU level, the harmonization of nuclear safety standards has been an important topic for years, with specific constructive activities being initiated, e.g., by the industry and by regulatory authorities. Uniform safety standards should not be the basis of proven reviews conducted by the national licensing and supervisory authorities. The objective should be the development of key requirements as framework conditions, irrespective of their practical implementation. They could be applied to any nuclear power plant in an accession country, but likewise to plants in member states, in order to provide an overview of the current safety status of a nuclear power plant and the rules by which it is run. As deriving uniform safety standards is a very expensive and lengthy procedure, the approach shown here identifies six main areas of review for light water reactors (safety systems; integrity of the safety barriers;, risk assessment; radiation exposure of the plant personnel and the environment; plant operations management; plant safety) and the associated safety indicators, with reference criteria formulated as concretely as possible.
   This proposal also lends itself to international individual evaluations of safety levels and could facilitate the review process already under way for the EU candidate countries.

TI Procedural and system-orientated strategies for reducing emissions in
   livestock production
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
ID PIG MANURE; BUILDINGS; AMMONIA; QUALITY
AB In the efforts to reduce the emissions from livestock production various competing strategies exist with respect to effectiveness, practicability and sustainability. In conventional livestock production the emphasis lies on strategies covering a range of procedures aimed at reducing the application of home-grown and imported nutrients in down-stream stages of the processing chain. In contrast, the system-orientated approach used in organic livestock production is based on the principle of avoidance. This implies that hazardous means of production will not be employed, and that nutrient input into farms will be drastically reduced by purposeful cutting back of resources.
   The opportunities for reducing emissions by specific feeding and other procedural measures are clearly limited in alternative animal husbandry in comparison to conventional livestock production practices. On the other hand, at farm level, the quantities of substances in circulation, due to the drastic restrictions on nutrient imports and a system-orientated reorganisation of the farm, have sunk to a clearly lower level than on comparative conventional farms. A comparison of the various approaches leads to the working hypothesis that, as far as the farm as a whole and unit animal production are concerned, the level of pollution caused by emissions from alternative farming lies below that arising from conventional production. Moreover, the systematic approach offers the prerequisite for a high degree of effectiveness in the application of internal and external farm resources, and is thus an economical and sustainable method for the creation of animal products. At the same time, however, it also involves drops in productive performance and animal-related productivity.
   The complex interactions between the different groups of substances, the constantly varying environment in which animals are reared, and the considerable fluctuation found in the quantities of substances in circulation mean that any quantification of the emissions emanating from animal husbandry must of necessity be only very approximate. Any assessment of the efficiency of individual measures or specific rearing systems can only be of limited scope, and the resulting data can scarcely be considered valid, if the farm context is left out of consideration. In view of the future challenges facing farm policy in the sphere of environmental protection, it must be concluded that greater attention will have to be afforded to the systematic approach, taken in conjunction with specific procedural measures and the development of methods for weighing up the relative factors in an interdisciplinary and farm context.

AB We discuss a paradigm for informed ecosystem management that provides a quantitative and rigorous foundation for informing conservation decisions and sustainable ecosystem management. Information pyramids incorporate conceptual and technological advances in ecosystem depiction and provide a framework for the integration and generalization of raw data into forms that are spatially extensive and at the appropriate level of generalization for a particular use. The basic tenets of the pyramid are: (1) Higher levels of the pyramid are entirely derived from a foundation of underlying data. (2) The process of generalization and integration upward should be objective and explicit. (3) Pyramids for different purposes often overlap, with common data and common methods for integration. (4) All levels of the pyramid should be developed together, including base data, methods and kinds of integration, and algorithms for using the information for planning and decision-making. Information pyramids are a powerful approach to organizing research science, and provide a mechanism by which research, data collection, storage and generalization can be focused on conservation outcomes. Common data and methods lead to increased efficiency, while also allowing for separate disciplines and programs. A case study of an integrated pyramid from New Zealand is discussed, which illustrates the characteristics of information pyramids. Components of this pyramid are discussed that provide examples of integration and generalization at various levels of the pyramid, from base data, to derived data, to spatial predictions and classifications, to a method of integrating this information into conservation decisions.

A recent example occurred when glyphosate, a herbicide used to control the highly invasive weed, bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata), accidentally drifted over a small population of an endangered shrub, Pimelea spicata. Following concerns that the affected population would not recover and, thereby, cause the local extinction of P. spicata, we conducted a series of glasshouse and field experiments to explore the impacts of glyphosate on this endangered species. Seedlings and young plants of P. spicata, in which the tap root was undeveloped, were killed by a single application of glyphosate. Older plants with a well developed tap root also died back initially, but about 50% of individuals re-sprouted. This re-growth was associated with a significant decrease in tap root diameter, implying that further disturbance, including repeated treatment with glyphosate, would kill plants by impairing their potential for recovery. Unlike some sclerophyllous native shrubs, the tolerance of P. spicata to glyphosate was limited, even when its growth was slowed artificially by limiting water availability. Winter applications of glyphosate to manage infestations of bitou bush will impact adversely on populations of P. spicata and may also affect the other rare and endangered species whose survival is threatened by this species, even though some natives are unaffected by the herbicide. Protecting native biodiversity from bitou bush will involve sustainable weed management that minimises impacts on non-target native species. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

DE cultural landscape; prognosis; interdisciplinarity; scenarios
AB Considering opinion polls, cultural landscape is one of the main reasons to be proud of Austria. Despite of this fact and the pressure on landscape, no cultural landscape prognosis is available. This might be due to complexity of cultural landscape and the absence of spatial, sectoral and disciplinary responsibility for landscape issues. Nevertheless in the light of sustainable development prognosis of cultural landscape is recommended. But the choice of methods should be adopted to the need of communication and motivation of inter- and transdisciplinary partners.. This could be ensured by scenario techniques, visualization and narrative forms. Essential is the integration in real decision making and planning procedures. In this context, landscape prognosis can be an excellent tool for inter- and transdisciplinarity.

AB The environmental histories of three Austrian villages were investigated over an extended time period, from the medieval land clearing to the present. Theoretical considerations on social metabolism and colonization of nature were used as a common starting point. The interdisciplinary investigation was based on a threepartite model of the interaction of population, production system and the local agro-ecological system. From the broad range of results, the medieval land clearance, land taxes in the 19(th) century and the demographic transition on the local level are presented briefly. The relevance for regional sustainable development is discussed.

AB We discuss theoretical issues related to sets of sustainability indicators. We propose that sustainable development can only be observed by analyzing the interrelation between socioeconomic and natural systems which have to be conceptualized as autopoietic and interacting systems. In order to be able to observe this interaction process between socioeconomic and natural systems, a set of sustainability indicators must, at least, comprise four different types of indicators: (1) socioeconomic driving forces, (2) pressures on the environment, (3) state of the environment and (4) feedbacks of environmental change on society. Society-nature Interrelations are conceptualized using two basic notions: (1) socioeconomic metabolism and (2) colonization of natural processes.

AB The paper presents research on landscape perception and imagery within the research program on sustainable development of Austrian cultural landscapes. Images of the landscape form an important part of the collective memory and identity of people. Historically and today we know of a multitude of ways to perceive of landscapes. Sustainable development on the regional level is based on communication between experts and the public. Both this kind of communication and the inter-expert-processes needed in the respective research are hampered by a lack of reflection of guiding images of landscapes. Picture postcards are used as an example to discuss the formation of landscape images and their consequences. Implications for interdisciplinary research are shown by means of an example from conservation biology.

AB Significant advancements in Earth observation are expected to come about by developing more systematic capabilities for assimilating remote sensing observations and in situ measurements for use in models, at relevant scales, to generate geophysical and biospheric information products. This paper provides an overview of the role of in situ sensing in the context of integrated Earth sensing. It also defines a framework for taking advantage of intelligent sensorwebs based on the converging technologies of microsensors, computers, and wireless telecommunications in support of critical activities such as the monitoring of remote environments, risk assessment and hazard mapping, and renewable resource information management. The knowledge gleaned from integrated Earth sensing has the potential to empower managers and decision makers to act on critical climate, sustainable development, natural resource, and environmental issues.

AB This review paper first discusses the needs for fundamental changes in the energy system for major efficiency improvements in terms of global resource limitation and sustainable development. Major improvement in energy efficiency of electric power plants and transportation vehicles is needed to enable the world to meet the energy demands at lower rate of energy consumption with corresponding reduction in pollutant and CO2 emissions. A brief overview will then be given on principle and advantages of different types of low-temperature and high-temperature fuel cells. Fuel cells are intrinsically much more energy-efficient, and could achieve as high as 70-80% system efficiency (including heat utilization) in electric power plants using solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC, versus the current efficiency of 30-37% via combustion), and 40-50% efficiency for transportation using proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) or solid oxide fuel cells (versus the current efficiency of 20-35% with internal combustion (IC) engines). The technical discussions will focus on fuel processing for fuel cell applications in the 21st century. The strategies and options of fuel processors depend on the type of fuel cells and applications. Among the low-temperature fuel cells, proton-exchange membrane fuel cells require H-2 as the fuel and thus nearly CO-free and sulfur-free gas feed must be produced from fuel processor. High-temperature fuel cells such as solid oxide fuel cells can use both CO and H2 as fuel, and thus fuel processing can be achieved in less steps. Hydrocarbon fuels and alcohol fuels can both be used as fuels for reforming on-site or on-board. Alcohol fuels have the advantages of being ultra-clean and sulfur-free and can be reformed at lower temperatures, but hydrocarbon fuels have the advantages of existing infrastructure of production and distribution and higher energy density. Further research and development on fuel processing are necessary for improved energy efficiency and reduced size of fuel processor. More effective ways for on-site or on-board deep removal of sulfur before and after fuel reforming, and more energy-efficient and stable catalysts and processes for reforming hydrocarbon fuels are necessary for both high-temperature and low-temperature fuel cells. In addition, more active and robust (non-pyrophoric) catalysts for water-gas-shift (WGS) reactions, more selective and active catalysts for preferential CO oxidation at lower temperature, more CO-tolerant anode catalysts would contribute significantly to development and implementation of low-temperature fuel cells, particularly proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. In addition, more work is required in the area of electrode catalysis.

DE water resources; sustainable utilization; countermeasures
AB According to the theory of sustainable development, the current situation and existent problems of the exploitation of water resources were analyzed in this paper. The results show that the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources is continually aggravating, water pollution is increasingly serious, water environment is worse, the over-extraction area of the underground water is expanding and water crisis stands out gradually, so it is imperative under the situation to actualize the sustainable exploitation strategies of water resources. It is necessary for sustainable utilizing water resources to introduce the model of sustainable utilization of water resources -the model of wealth transferring between the generations of water resources, establish water-saving society system and water market, form technology systems, management systems and evaluation systems for many sorts of water resources, improve the utilization ratio of water resources, transform waste water into resources and maintain and restore the water space of water environment.
