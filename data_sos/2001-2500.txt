AB The aim is to compare the diversity of the understory in Quercus pyrenaica communities according to the type of human intervention (grazing, obtaining wood or firewood, forest fires). This interaction results in a modification of the characteristics of the arboreal layer and shrub cover. Four types of oak communities were selected, each with five replicates: communities with a high density of shrubby oak (oak shrublands), open woodlands ("dehesas"), mature oak woods with abundant woody biomass in the understory and mature oak woods with little woody biomass in the understory. In each study site, we quantified the size of the trees (height, trunk perimeter and crown diameter) and their density, woody cover in the understory and species richness as well as diversity using the Shannon index, on both a small scale (per m(2)) and for the total of each community. A clear difference was observed between the dehesas and the oak shrublands, the two community types with higher human intervention (the dehesas, with sustainable use for grazing and the oak shrublands, the most degraded due to repeated fires), in the principal components analysis carried out with these variables. The other two community types, considered more mature forests, presented an intermediate location on the principal components analysis. However, there was no clear relationship between the different community types and the diversity values. No differences were observed in total species richness, except that the number of annuals being significantly higher in the dehesas. Nor was it possible to detect any differences using the Shannon index, except for the oak shrublands which, although with a great variability among them, had a lower mean diversity than the other community types. The distance between trees was positively correlated to diversity, measured using the Shannon index, and to annual species richness and negatively correlated to woody cover in the understory. The variability in the distance between trees (associated with clumped distributions) was positively correlated to spatial heterogeneity, measured as S-beta. The size of the trees had very little correlation to species diversity. As a whole, the results obtained show the difficulty involved in making generalised conclusions on the effects of disturbances on plant diversity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The productive potential of plantations together with the expansion of the pulp and paper industry in the region prompted a broadly based program of research and development in southern pine plantation establishment and management. The first major research contribution to pine plantation forestry in the South was the USDA-Forest Service Publication, Agricultural Monograph No. 18, Planting the Southern Pines by P.C. Wakeley. This publication summarized 30 years of research by Wakeley and his colleagues at the Southern Forest Experiment Station and served as a road map for essentially every agency and organization, public and private that wished to establish and manage plantations of southern pine. In 195 1, the Texas Forest Service and Texas A&M University established the first southern pine tree improvement program. This program not only introduced a new area of forest research in the South, it established a new way to conduct research through the creation of a forest industry-university-government research cooperative. The passage of the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Research Act of 1962 greatly expanded the forestry research potential at state universities and soon thereafter a number of cooperatives were formed in pine tree improvement, forest fertilization, competing vegetation management, forest biology, nursery management, growth and yield, hardwood tree improvement, and hardwood silviculture. These cooperative endeavors fostered creativity and innovation and provided a network for the rapid testing and dissemination of ideas and discoveries. Naturally regenerated second growth stands of southern pine typically had a mean annual increment of 23 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1). Today, operational plantations of genetically improved loblolly pine with basic site preparation will produce 9-12 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) over a 25-year rotation while experimental plantations with complete competition control and annual fertilization have achieved mean annual increments as high as 34 in 3 ha(-1) year(-1) by age 12 years. In 1999, planted forests accounted for only 11% of the South's total growing-stock volume, but contributed 41% of the softwood net annual growth and 29% of the softwood harvest. These figures are forecast to increase during the first half of the 21st century. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The long-term soil productivity (LTSP) study was initiated to examine the effect of soil porosity and organic matter (OM) levels on net primary productivity (NPP). The study design calls for three levels of OM removal (bole, whole tree and whole tree plus forest floor) and three levels of compaction (none, moderate and severe) being imposed on harvested sites prior to planting. Additionally, the effect of understory control on NPP was examined as a split-plot treatment. The study has been installed on 62 sites covering a range of climates, soil types and tree species across the United States and Canada. The inclusion of 46 closely related affiliated sites has created the world's largest coordinated research network devoted to investigating the relationship between land management and sustainable forest productivity. In the forefront of the LTSP network are the installations in North Carolina (NC) and Louisiana (LA) which focus on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) growth. The rapid growth at these sites has resulted in the trees reaching crown closure much earlier than any other LTSP installation. Consequently, these sites may provide the earliest glimpse as to the treatment effects on NPP. Tenth year data from these sites show that large OM removals and severe soil compaction (main treatments) had no significant (alpha <= 0.1) effect on stand volume but control of the understory (split-plot treatment) resulted in greater stand volume compared to plots with no understory control. Plots ameliorated by a one-time fertilizer addition (NC and LA) and bedding (NC only) resulted in small (+8 and -8% for NC and LA, respectively) to large (+69 and +15% for NC and LA, respectively) changes in mean stand volume compared to the experimental plots. Although there were no main treatment effects on stand volume, extractable soil phosphorus in NC and LA were reduced with increasing OM removal. The reduction of extractable soil phosphorus with increasing OM removal on these already phosphorus deficient sites may affect tree growth in the future but have not yet translated to stand volume differences over 10 years.

AB Southern forests produce multiple products and services including timber, wildlife habitat, species bio- and genetic diversity, water quality and control, waste remediation, recreation, and carbon sequestration. All of these benefits must be produced in a sustainable manner to meet today's societal needs without compromising future needs. A forest site is productive to the extent that it provides some level of one or more of these products and services. Historically, site productivity research emphasized biomass production and did not directly address the forest's capability for producing other products and services. However, past and on-going site productivity research has greatly increased our understanding of those soil and site properties and processes that influence forest development, and those that are influenced by management. Directing forest site productivity research toward understanding how site processes control both timber and non-timber benefits on all southern forest lands can help us develop the management strategies necessary to produce multiple products and services concomitantly with timber production.

AB Changes in the climatic conditions during the Late Quaternary and Holocene greatly impacted the hydrology and geochemical evolution of groundwaters in the Great Lakes region. Increased hydraulic gradients from melting of kilometer-thick Pleistocene ice sheets reorganized regional-scale groundwater flow in Paleozoic aquifers in underlying intracratonic basins. Here, we present new elemental and isotopic analyses of 134 groundwaters from Silurian-Devonian carbonate and overlying glacial drift aquifers, along the margins of the Illinois and Michigan basins, to evaluate the paleohydrology, age distribution, and geochemical evolution of confined aquifer systems. This study significantly extends the spatial coverage of previously published groundwaters in carbonate and drift aquifers across the Midcontinent region, and extends into deeper portions of the Illinois and Michigan basins, focused on the freshwater-saline water mixing zones. In addition, the hydrogeochemical data from Silurian-Devonian aquifers were integrated with deeper basinal fluids, and brines in Upper Devonian black shales and underlying Cambrian-Ordovician aquifers to reveal a regionally extensive recharge system of Pleistocene-age waters in glaciated sedimentary basins. Elemental and isotope geochemistry of confined groundwaters in Silurian-Devonian carbonate and glacial drift aquifers show that they have been extensively altered by incongruent dissolution of carbonate minerals, dissolution of halite and anhydrite, cation exchange, microbial processes, and mixing with basinal brines. Carbon isotope values of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) range from -10 to -2 parts per thousand, Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios range from 0.7080 to 0.7090, and delta S-34-SO4 values range from +10 to 30 parts per thousand. A few waters have elevated delta C-13 DIC values (> 15 parts per thousand) from microbial methanogenesis in adjacent organic-rich Upper Devonian shales. Radiocarbon ages and delta O-18 and delta D values of confined groundwaters indicate they originated as subglacial recharge beneath the Laurentide Ice Sheet (14-50 ka BP, -15 to -13 parts per thousand delta O-18). These paleowaters are isolated from shallow flow systems in overlying glacial drift aquifers by lake-bed clays and/or shales. The presence of isotopically depleted waters in Paleozoic aquifers at relatively shallow depths illustrates the importance of continental glaciation on regional-scale groundwater flow. Modern groundwater flow in the Great Lakes region is primarily restricted to shallow unconfined glacial drift aquifers. Recharge waters in Silurian-Devonian and unconfined drift aquifers have delta O-18 values within the range of Holocene precipitation: -11 to -8 parts per thousand and -7 to -4.5 parts per thousand for northern Michigan and northern Indiana/Ohio, respectively. Carbon and Sr isotope systematics indicate shallow groundwaters evolved through congruent dissolution of carbonate minerals under open and closed system conditions (delta C-13(DIC) = -14.7 to -11.1 parts per thousand, and Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7080-0.7103). The distinct elemental and isotope geochemistry of Pleistocene- versus Holocene-age waters further confirms that surficial flow systems are out of contact with the deeper basinal-scale flow systems.
   These results provide improved understanding of the effects of past climate change on groundwater flow and geochemical processes, which are important for determining the sustainability of present-day water resources and stablity of saline fluids in sedimentary basins.

AB Oil epoxies can be used as plasticizers in the processing of hard polymers. For this purpose dehydrated castor oil epoxv (DCOE), a product from sustainable resource, has bean chosen for blending with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to investigate the compatibility of this blend pair. Blends of DCOE/PMMA were prepared in the weight ratios 80/20, 60/40, 40/60, and 20/80 through solution method by mixing in dimethylsulphoxide. Freestanding films of the blend were cast and the miscibility of the two components was investigated by viscosity and ultrasonic measurements, which provided valuable information on the degree of compatibility of the pairs of blends in Solution. The compatibility was also examined by differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. All the studies revealed that DCOE was immiscible with PMMA. However, the appearance and texture of the films were not found to show any visible change over several months, which indicates stability of this blend system. 0 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background: Unwanted pesticides in developing countries are major environmental health threats. This study followed-up a previous audit of unwanted and obsolete pesticides on farms in a rural district of South Africa six years after a National Retrieval Project (NPR) was undertaken.
   Methods: A descriptive survey of 37 farms that had been in possession of unwanted pesticides in a 1995 survey and a purposive sample of 34 neighbouring farms, was carried out. The survey data included farm details; details of unwanted pesticide stocks, volumes of empty containers and safety and hygiene of pesticide stores. In addition, management was asked if they had been informed about and participated in the 1997 NPR and similarly whether they were aware of the retrieval planned by the African Stockpiles Programme (ASP).
   Results: Forty (56%) farms were in possession of obsolete pesticides of which 24 (59%) were farms that had unwanted stocks in the previous survey. There were more than 9 tonnes of these pesticides, 50% more than in the previous survey, including 20 chemicals banned, withdrawn or restricted in South Africa or classified as WHO Class I toxicity. Over 2800 kg of pesticides (30%) were not identifiable. None of the farms participated in the NPR, although 47 knew of the initiative. Only six farmers (9%) knew of the ASP initiative.
   Fifty-nine farms (83%) had empty containers on the premises. Most pesticide stores (67%) had floors contaminated with chemicals.
   Conclusion: The survey found that despite the NPR, the problem of unwanted pesticides in the study area and probably throughout South Africa has deteriorated. National and international policies should control the problem at source and encourage more sustainable agriculture. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB This paper aims at the methodology for the optimum design of an industrial solvent purification process, where pervaporation was involved as an energetically and environmental sustainable technology. Using a simplified mathematical model to describe the separation process, the optimization problem focused on the minimization of the membrane area (main capital cost of this technology) needed to reach the desired purification level. Formulated as an NLP to minimize the total cost of the process, subjected to design specifications, the optimization problem was solved by GAMS modeling equation system. The use of nonconvex equations together with the influence of hydrodynamics over the membrane performance, required a different approach to the optimal solution of the proposed objective function. The method was illustrated with examples of the determination of the minimum area needed to reach a final water content in the solvent, proving to be a useful tool in the scale-up process.

TI Impacts of the 2004 tsunami on groundwater resources in Sri Lanka
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID POROUS-MEDIA; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; FLOW
AB The 26 December 2004 tsunami caused widespread destruction and contamination of coastal aquifers across southern Asia. Seawater filled domestic open dug wells and also entered the aquifers via direct infiltration during the first flooding waves and later as ponded seawater infiltrated through the permeable sands that are typical of coastal aquifers. In Sri Lanka alone, it is estimated that over 40,000 drinking water wells were either destroyed or contaminated. From February through September 2005, a team of United States, Sri Lankan, and Danish water resource scientists and engineers surveyed the coastal groundwater resources of Sri Lanka to develop an understanding of the impacts of the tsunami and to provide recommendations for the future of coastal water resources in south Asia. In the tsunami-affected areas, seawater was found to have infiltrated and mixed with fresh groundwater lenses as indicated by the elevated groundwater salinity levels. Seawater infiltrated through the shallow vadose zone as well as entered aquifers directly through flooded open wells. Our preliminary transport analysis demonstrates that the intruded seawater has vertically mixed in the aquifers because of both forced and free convection. Widespread pumping of wells to remove seawater was effective in some areas, but overpumping has led to upconing of the saltwater interface and rising salinity. We estimate that groundwater recharge from several monsoon seasons will reduce salinity of many sandy Sri Lankan coastal aquifers. However, the continued sustainability of these small and fragile aquifers for potable water will be difficult because of the rapid growth of human activities that results in more intensive groundwater pumping and increased pollution. Long-term sustainability of coastal aquifers is also impacted by the decrease in sand replenishment of the beaches due to sand mining and erosion.

AB Australian rice growers are under considerable pressure to increase water use efficiency to remain profitable and avoid soil salinisation. In particular, profitability is threatened by decreasing water availability and certainty of supply and by increasing water price, as a result of environmental and National Competition Policy agendas.
   Field irrigation water productivity has more than doubled in the past 20 years from ail average of around 0.34 g paddy rice per kg water to around 0.77 g ka(-1), largely due to increased yield from the development and adoption of improved varieties and management strategies, and to a lesser degree due to the introduction of rice water use and soil suitability policies.
   Future increases in rice field water productivity will come front greater yields through breeding for increased cold tolerance, precision agriculture and improved crop establishment, and from reduced water use due to reduced duration of ponding. A key challenge of the next decade will be to increase cold tolerance to the extent that deep water ponding for low temperature protection is no longer required, possibly allowing it complete shift away from ponded Culture and reducing irrigation water requirement.
   While increasing the water productivity of rice is important, water productivity and profitability of the entire cropping system is of ultimate importance. Growing winter crops after rice and permanent bed systems offer potential benefits of increased productivity of crops traditionally grown in rotation with rice and increased cropping diversity and flexibility. Irrigation water productivity is also being improved through on-farm and regional technologies such as on-farm recycling systems and automatic data acquisition and control systems in irrigation supply systems.
   To increase water use efficiency and achieve sustainability of rice-based farming systems in Australia, irrigation communities are implementing a range of on-farm and regional technologies and policies. An integrated approach is required to evaluate options, prioritise investments, maximise economic returns, guide policy and balance the environmental demands of river ecosystems with the needs of irrigated agriculture and its dependent regional communities. Significant progress is being made, through the development and application of farm and irrigation area hydrologic models linked with production models and economics, combined with strong stakeholder participation. The progress in integrating science, people and policy makers was recognised in 2002 by the award of the first "Reference" catchment status to the lower Murrumbidgee catchment, 'it major Australian rice-growing region, under the UNESCO/WMO HELP (Hydrology for Environment, Life and Policy) program.

AB Brazilian savannas or "cerrados", which cover an area of 200 million ha, possess a high potential for agricultural production. Upland rice has been used as a pioneer crop to open these areas for cultivation, and covered an area of more than 4.5 million ha during the 1970s and 1980s. The cultivars used in this system were tall, japonica types, with good tolerance to drought stress and a traditional bold grain type. Subsequently, the shift of rice to more favorable production zones and a change in consumer grain preference has required the development of a new class of aerobic rice cultivars. These were derived from crosses between upland and lowland cultivars, and they combine adaptation to unflooded (aerobic) soils with responsiveness to applied inputs. Crop financing policies take into consideration the climatic risk for different savannah micro-regions, which has been established using water balance models and GIS. Research recommendations have been developed to minimize climatic risk through appropriate date of planting and choice of variety. New varieties, japonica x indica derivatives, with improved plant type and duration and with desirable grain appearance and cooking behavior, provide an economically attractive option for farmers in stable cropping systems. Such varieties have been adopted by fanners both as a regular component of grain cropping systems and as a crop to assist in renewal of degraded pasture. These aerobic rice systems help meet national demand for rice without the levels of water use and investment in infrastructure required for irrigated lowland rice production. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Temporal changes in the scores of selected soil fertility indices were studied over six years in three different cases of organic crop rotation located in southern, eastern and central Norway. The cropping history and the initial scores of fertility indices prior to conversion to organic cropping differed between the sites. Crop yields, regarded as an overall, integrating fertility indicator, were in all rotations highly variable with few consistent temporal trends following the first year after conversion. On the site in eastern Norway, where conversion followed several years of all-arable crop rotations, earthworm number and biomass and soil physical properties improved, whereas the system was apparently degrading with regard to P and K trade balances and contents in soil. On the other two sites, the picture was less clear. On the southern site, which had a relatively fertile soil before conversion, the contents of soil organic matter and K decreased during the six-year period, but the scores of other fertility indices showed no trends. On the site in central Norway, there were positive trends for earthworm-related indices such as worm biomass and tubular biopores, and negative trends for soil porosity. The results, especially those from the eastern site, illustrate the general difficulty in drawing conclusions about overall fertility or sustainability when partial indicators show divergent trends. Consequently, the study gave no unambiguous support to the initial working hypothesis that organic farming increases inherent overall soil fertility, but rather showed that the effect varied among indicators and depended on status of the cases at conversion. It is concluded that indicators are probably better used as tools to learn about and improve system components than as absolute measures of sustainability.

AB Results for 1998-2004 are reported from four long-term (25-28 years) tillage trials, comparing conventional autumn ploughing with reduced tillage, normally spring harrowing only. Plant residues were retained during the period studied. The weather was somewhat wetter than the 1961-1990 normal. Results with reduced tillage were mostly similar to those seen in earlier trial periods. In Trial 1, mean grain yield was 95% with spring harrowing only versus autumn ploughing, 96% when harrowing in autumn was performed as well and 97% when the soil was ploughed every third year. In Trial 2 positive crop rotation effects were found both with and without ploughing, and reduced tillage gave 5% lower grain yield also in this trial. In Trial 3, tillage system did not affect yields of cereals grown in rotation with potatoes, but reduced tillage gave 12% lower potato yield than ploughing. Little difference in response to N fertilizer was found. In Trial 4, reduced tillage on large-scale (0.7 ha) plots gave 11% lower grain yields than annual ploughing, partly due to shallow sowing depth. No long-term trend in yield responses to tillage was discernible in any trial, and between-year variability was similar with both ploughing and reduced tillage. Percentage yields with reduced tillage relative to annual ploughing correlated positively with rainfall in May and with mean air temperature in August. It is concluded that the reduced tillage systems studied are sustainable in terms of productivity, relative to labour, machinery and energy inputs. Likely benefits of such systems include higher levels of organic matter and aggregate stability in surface soil horizons, but a disadvantage is the need for frequent herbicide use to control perennial weeds.

AB The recovery and recycling of phosphorous from effluents and wastewaters is one of the objectives of the modern environmental chemistry, this environmental concern has given rise to a new technological approach that permits the phosphorous recovery from the wastewaters to produce a high quality commercial fertilizer: Struvite, MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O. This process permits the sustainable management of this natural and no renewable resource (phosphate) and on the other hand avoids natural water pollution problems, improving the aquatic ecosystem quality.
   This paper, describes the very first experimental results after the planning of an exhaustive study for the determination of the principal thermodynamic parameters that determine the process feasibility for the struvite production using the Ion Exchange Isothermal Supersaturation Technique (IXISS).

AB This article examines the incidence of and reasons for multiple-job holding in the context of rural communities where multiple-job holding is viewed as an important means of promoting community sustainability. Drawing upon a unique data set of a relatively homogeneous population living in an isolated area on the west coast of Scotland, where employment opportunities are limited, dual-job holding is investigated within the fisheries and aquaculture occupations. Evidence is found that the hours constraints motive for multiple-job holding better explains multiple-job-holding behavior among employed rural workers in aquaculture than among self-employed fishermen, and that educational attainment has a positive impact on the incidence of multiple-job holding.

AB Changes in rural areas, such as depopulation and land abandonment, but also intensification and loss of biodiversity, usually proceed very slowly yet are often irreversible. A scenario study (called EURURALIS) was carried out by Wageningen University and Research Centre in combination with the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (MNP) to stimulate the strategic discussion among both national policy makers and policy makers at the European Union level on the future of Europe's rural areas and the role of policy instruments. After a review of previous scenario studies, the choice was made to elaborate strategic scenarios. built on a 2 x 2 matrix, where the axes represent the most critical uncertainties. The four scenarios were structured along two axes: (1) ranging from increasing globalisation to a world of regional economic and Cultural blocks and (2) ranging from a future of lean governments to a future with ambitious government regulation. The storylines were inspired by earlier work such as the emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (SRES), the GEO-3 scenarios and scenarios of the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB). The current scenario study includes the 25 EU member states and had a time horizon up to 2030. The scenarios were quantified with a chain of models, ranging from global models to a spatially explicit model, which simulated land use on a 1 km x 1 km grid for the whole EU. The scenarios and their outcomes are presented by means of a CD. This paper describes the steps taken. proceeding from the general aim of the study on to the scenario set-up and then to the actual storylines and quantification of the scenarios. The outcomes of the scenarios are presented in three other articles in this issue. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Terrestrial ecosystems provide a number of vital services for people and society, such as biodiversity, food. fibre, water resources, carbon sequestration, and recreation. The future capability of ecosystems to provide these services is determined by changes in socio-economic characteristics, land use, biodiversity, atmospheric composition and climate. Most published impact assessments do not address the vulnerability of the human-environment system under such environmental change. They cannot answer important multidisciplinary policy relevant questions Such as: which are the main regions or sectors that are vulnerable to global change? How do the vulnerabilities of two regions compare? Which scenario is the least, or most, harmful for a given region or sector?
   The ATEAM project (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) uses a new approach to ecosystem assessment by integrating the potential impacts in a vulnerability assessment, which can help answer multidisciplinary questions, such as those listed above. This paper presents the vulnerability assessment of the ATEAM land use scenarios. The 14 land use types, discussed in detail by Rounsevell et al. (this volume), can be related to a range of ecosystem services. For instance, forest area is associated with wood production and designated land with outdoor recreation. Directly applying the vulnerability methodology to the land use change scenarios helps in understanding land use change impacts across the European environment. Scatter plots summarising impacts per principal European Environmental Zone (EnZ) help in interpreting how the impacts of the scenarios differ between ecosystem services and the European environments.
   While there is considerable heterogeneity in both the potential impacts of global changes, and the adaptive capacity to cope with these impacts, this assessment shows that southern Europe in particular will be vulnerable to land use change. Projected economic growth increases adaptive capacity, but is also associated with the most negative potential impacts. The potential impacts of more environmentally oriented developments are smaller, indicating an important role for both policy and society in determining eventual residual impacts.

LA English
DT Article
AB Large-scale innovative, integrated, multifaceted adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) interventions are urgently needed in sub-Saharan Africa. Implementation through schools and health facilities may maximize intervention coverage and sustainability, however the impact of the use of these structures on intervention content and delivery is not well documented. This paper describes the rationale and design of a large-scale multifaceted ASRH intervention, which was developed and evaluated over three years in rural communities in Mwanza Region, North West Tanzania. The intervention comprised community mobilization, participatory reproductive health education in primary schools, youth-friendly reproductive health services and community-based condom provision for youth. We examine the effect of socioeconomic, cultural and infrastructural factors on intervention content and implementation. This paper demonstrates the means by which such interventions can be feasibly and sustainably implemented to a high standard through existing government health and school structures. However, the use of these structures involves compromise on some key aspects of intervention design and requires the development of complementary strategies to access out-of-school youth and the wider community.

AB During 2 years (2001-2003), we performed seasonal aerial surveys in the central Spanish Mediterranean following the transect line methodology in order to determine the abundance and distribution patterns of loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta. We surveyed a total of 16 700 km, accounting for 770 turtle sightings. Loggerhead turtles were present with high abundance all year round. No seasonal differences in abundance were found, except in spring 2001, where the density of turtles was higher than in the other seasons. Our results show that the Western Mediterranean is not a 'summer' feeding area as proposed previously, as a high number of turtles are present throughout the year. The average surface density of turtles in the whole study area was 0.21 turtles km(-2) [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-0.25], and the mean abundance was 6653 turtles (95% CI: 5514-8027). The data relate to the number of turtles on the surface only, as diving turtles escape observation. Correcting our estimations of diving behaviour data in the area, the absolute abundance was 18 954 turtles (95% CI: 6679-53 786). Bearing in mind that around 25 000 loggerheads are caught per year in the Spanish Mediterranean, our results indicate that accidental captures seem to be a significant threat for this species, and conservation measures have to be implemented to avoid a non-sustainable situation.

AB Application and development of muscle powered cardiac assist devices is limited by the ability to predict the sustainable power output of in situ conditioned muscle under the expected loading conditions and geometrical constraints. Empirical definition of the sustained power limits and representative models of the bounding conditions where continuous power can be obtained are needed for device design and optimization. The latissimus dorsi muscles of four goats were chronically conditioned for 11 weeks with an implanted myostimulator. The ability to sustain power under isotonic conditions was evaluated across a range of contraction durations (100-600 ms) and rates (10-120 contractions/min). Muscles were characterized both biomechanically and myothermically to develop and evaluate three increasingly complex empirically-based models of metabolic utilization per contraction based on (1) the duty cycle, (2) a linear function of activation time, and (3) a multivariate-derived function of contraction duration, muscle load, and shortening distance. A clearly defined boundary for sustainable stimulation conditions was observed and was best represented by the linear metabolic model. These data provide both an empirical measure of chronically sustainable muscle power and predictive metabolic models that may be used to optimize the power harnessed for skeletal muscle actuated devices.

TI Impact of different moderator ratios with light and heavy water cooled
   reactors in equilibrium states
SO ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FUEL-CYCLES; PWR
AB As an issue of sustainable development in the world, energy sustainability using nuclear energy may be possible using several different ways such as increasing breeding capability of the reactors and optimizing the fuel utilization using spent fuel after reprocessing as well as exploring additional nuclear resources from sea water. In this present study the characteristics of light and heavy water cooled reactors for different moderator ratios in equilibrium states have been investigated. The moderator to fuel ratio (MFR) is varied from 0.1 to 4.0. Four fuel cycle schemes are evaluated in order to investigate the effect of heavy metal (HM) recycling. A calculation method for determining the required uranium enrichment for criticality of the systems has been developed by coupling the equilibrium fuel cycle burn-up calculation and cell calculation of SRAC 2000 code using nuclear data library from the JENDL 3.2. The results show a thermal spectrum peak appears for light water coolant and no thermal peak for heavy water coolant along the MFR (0.1 <= MFR <= 4.0). The plutonium quality can be reduced effectively by increasing the MFR and number of recycled HM. Considering the effect of increasing number of recycled HM, it is also effective to reduce the uranium utilization and to increase the conversion ratio. trans-Plutonium production such as americium (Am) and curium (Cm) productions are smaller for heavy water coolant than light water coolant. The light water coolant shows the feasibility of breeding when HM is recycled with reducing the MFR. Wider feasible area of breeding has been obtained when light water coolant is replaced by heavy water coolant. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ETHICS
AB Public health practitioners interested in supporting consumers to make healthy, sustainable food choices need to understand consumer motivations to reduce food system risk. Increasingly food technologies that have enhanced access to food supply are being recognised as also impacting on the sustainability of the food system. This study explored the actions taken by Australian participants in response to their concerns about perceived food related threats to health and environment. Variance in willingness to act is analysed within the context of environmental and ecological citizenship, and a continuum describes the range of positions held. From the outset some participants self-identified as environmentally concerned and proactive, while others indicated a secondary interest in the environment. The catalyst for action for the majority was the priority of individual health and such self-interest can be a powerful motivator for change. Others related health to the environment and described efforts to minimise individual impact. Equally important for action to occur is being at a stage in life where other demands do not compete for the time and energy necessary to take citizenship actions. These results provide insight into the support that public health practitioners can offer to consumers who wish to make sustainable food choices. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The well-documented decline of the Pinus palustris ecosystem has resulted from several anthropogenic influences, such as forest clearing (e.g. pine plantation forestry, agriculture) and urban development, both of which are closely related to increases in human populations. Other impacts have arisen from alterations in disturbance regimes responsible for maintaining the structure and function of these ecosystems. Restoration and management of degraded pine savanna ecosystems is critical. Identification of ecological processes that determine the structure and function of the intact system are important because successful restoration efforts should be based on sound scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce this special issue on the ecology, conservation, and restoration of the Pinus palustris ecosystem. Some global climate change scenarios have suggested that future changes may occur that alter frequency and severity of disturbances such as fires and hurricanes. Such changes may have large effects on pine stands, and ultimately entire Pinus palustris savanna ecosystems, thus presenting further challenges to their sustainable management.

AB Question: Do case studies from silvicultural and restoration studies and applied conservation management in second-growth Pinus palustris stands provide unique insights for conservation models?
   Methods: A review of management paradigms that conserve the high biological diversity and rare species, drawn from characteristics in both second-growth and old-growth stands, is presented for fire-maintained Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) forests.
   Results: A common assumption that old-growth stands provide the primary information for the development of conservation management strategies de-emphasizes lessons learned from second-growth and restoration studies. Primary conservation management goals for the Pinus palustris ecosystem include the perpetual regeneration of the fire-maintained forest and conservation of the characteristically high biological diversity and rare species. Several attributes, such as a sustained population of Picoides borealis (red-cockaded woodpecker), Aristida stricta (wiregrass)-dominated ground cover, and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones, can predict a diverse and ecologically functional ecosystem. Such indicators are linked to critical structural and functional features of the system and reflect previous land management histories that suggest sustainable approaches.
   Conclusions: A traditional definition of 'old-growth' relying on overstorey may be limited in describing important features of healthy, diverse Pinus palustris ecosystems. Some characteristics are significantly more important for maintenance of diversity than age of the trees and these features may be present in old- or second-growth forests. We advocate that the management history, structural characteristics and landscape context of stands that harbour desirable conservation attributes (red-cockaded woodpeckers, wiregrass, gopher tortoises and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones) can be used as indicators to identify important conservation and forest management principles.

AB Question: Does understorey richness, cover and biomass change during succession in abandoned Castor canadensis impoundments of riparian Nothofagus forests?
   Location: Magellanic Nothofagus forests at Tierra del Fuego National Park (54 degrees 50'32.4" S, 68 degrees 32'11.5" W), Argentina.
   Methods: Five meadows of different time since abandonment (1, 5, 6, 9 and 20 years ago) and two controls (pure N. pumilio and mixed N. pumilio - N. betuloides forests) were sampled. Understorey variables (species richness, cover and biomass) in beaver meadows were measured at eight plots, as well as sapling and seedlings age and height. In control treatments, ten plots on each forest type characterized forest structure.
   Results: Beavers alter vegetation dynamics, modifying biomass and composition of the original forest communities. Richness, cover and biomass were significantly modified when compared to the original understorey. Ferns are the most affected group, while grasses became more abundant. Many species established in the impacted sectors, which did not grow in primary forests. Trees did not regenerate in impacted areas for long periods, and many understorey original species are missing. Nothofagus forests are not adapted to support a long-term beaver impact.
   Conclusions: Beavers modify the original ecosystem from closed forest to a grass- and sedge-dominated meadow, due to the lack of adaptive regeneration strategies in the Nothofagus forests. The maintenance of the present level of the beaver population is not sustainable over time, due to utilized and impacted tree biomass which could not be replaced by the natural dynamics of the forest ecosystem.

AB 1. The existence of perceived ecological impacts and development of adaptive management solutions to mitigate these problems are important issues in sustainable aquaculture. This paper examines the general impacts of two newly established trial longline installations on the infauna in Twofold Bay, a large, coastal embayment in south-east Australia.
   2. We hypothesized that the physical presence of these longline installations and the biological activities of the mussels they supported would result in temporal changes in densities of infaunal taxa below installations differing from those at undisturbed control sites. We also predicted different patterns of variability in infauna between longline and control sites from before to after the longlines were stocked. These hypotheses were tested by using a beyond-BACI sampling design and asymmetrical analyses of variance to compare changes in densities of taxa at several different spatial scales below the proposed longline sites with those at two adjacent control sites, before and after the longlines were stocked.
   3. After 18 months of longline operations, there was no evidence of any impact on total number of taxa, nor densities of individual taxa. Short-term temporal trends in densities in plots at control sites from April to May 2001 were often as different from each other as from those at the longline site. This indicates that densities of taxa at the farm site were within the range typically found at undisturbed sites, so there were no ecological impacts from the farm.
   4. These results do not concur with previous studies on impact of mussel farming in semi-enclosed coastal waters. Differences in location, scale of production, duration of operation and assimilative capacity of the environment probably contributed to this discrepancy. The infauna in Twofold Bay either do not respond to this form of disturbance or have not yet been exposed to disturbance of a sufficient magnitude, or for a sufficient period of time, to elicit a detectable response. Better definition of the potential ecological impacts associated with aquaculture, plus their scale and magnitude in different environments is needed to design experiments and monitoring programmes to detect specific impacts. This activity can only be considered sustainable once we know that these impacts are localized, reversible and short-term. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Four different methods to account for complex relationships between regional and local viability/sustainability and vulnerability have been investigated. The ecological footprint technique, emergy analysis, natural capital evaluation and compensation areas methods are used to infer and synthesize different sustainability/viability aspects of the Swiss territory. The results of this study and assay suggest coherency and complementarity of the multiple methodology used. Furthermore, bio-geographical, bio-physical and economic particularities of Switzerland, that differ largely from canton to canton, determine an important variation of local sustainability levels and capacity of response to climate forcing in action. We thus propose next to a general Swiss approach of sustainability, a subsequent differential treatment of cantons, based on spatial inequalities that are linked to primary physical, biological and economical structures and potentials. Despite of a unifying, global and federal approach, the implementation of sustainability measures and laws should be afterwards modulated in the case of each canton, by accounting for all these physical, biological, and anthropogenic disparities (equity treatment).

AB Despite the important roles played by insects in most ecosystems, surprisingly little is known about how anthropogenic pollutants or their mixtures interact to affect insect populations. The independent and joint actions of selenate and methylmercury on a ubiquitous insect detritivore, Megaselia scalaris (Loew), were determined in this study. Ovipositing females did not distinguish between untreated food sources and those contaminated with toxic concentrations of selenate, methylmercury, or both chemicals in combination. Even at the highest concentrations of pollutants, no negative effects were observed for the egg stage. However, larval survival was significantly decreased and development significantly prolonged by selenate and methylmercury individually at low or intermediate ecologically relevant treatment levels. Potentiation was strongly evident because mixtures containing concentrations as little as only 1% of the respective individual median lethal tolerances (LC(50)s) caused significantly more mortality and delayed larval development than would be expected from the responses selenate and methylmercury elicit individually. However, survival and pupal development was not affected at any rate tested. Female fecundity was significantly decreased by methylmercury but not by selenate or mixture treatments. The relative toxicity to M. scalaris of each of the individual and joint treatments was selenate (LC50 = 260 mu g/g) < methylmercury (LC50 = 22 mu g/g) < the mixture at approximately 5% of the LC50 concentration of each of the components (12 mu g/g selenate plus 1.0 mu g/g methylmercury). The increased mortality and delayed larval development within sites contaminated by selenate, methylmercury, or combination of the two have substantial implications for the ecology, population dynamics, and sustainability of M. scalaris populations. If these results can be extrapolated to other arthropod detritivores, ecosystem food-web function may be substantially affected.

TI Uranium, a factor limiting nuclear energy?
SO ATW-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUCLEAR POWER
LA German
DT Article
AB Nuclear power has been back as a topic of public debate since early this year. A special subject under discussion is the extension of nuclear power plant life. Hardly had it been on the agenda, when interested par-ties announced that this step was impossible because uranium reserves were no longer sufficient. A variety of terms are being used in this discussion without their meaning being taken into account: stocks, resources, and reserves.
   To clarify the situation, this article outlines important aspects of short and long term uranium supplies, and analyzes their meaning. Here are some of the most important issues under consideration:
   For what period of time is there really enough uranium?
   Is uranium becoming the limiting factor in the use of nuclear power?
   Is uranium really a "sustainable" energy resource?
   Will higher prices extend the range?
   What is the influence of the price of uranium on the cost of electricity generation?
   Among other results, it is found that comprehensive sources of low-price uranium and nuclear fuels are, or can be made, available worldwide. Consequently, the "range" is beyond the time frames currently mentioned, also as a function of technological factors, i.e. reaching several hundred years. It is also important to note that nuclear power
   ensures greater independence of volatile imported sources,
   guarantees reliably low electricity prices,
   has a huge potential of environmental protection, and
   is a clean source of energy.

AB Myoporum platycarpum R. Br. (Myoporaceae) is widely distributed through semi-arid New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria, where it occurs as an upper-storey dominant or co-dominant tree over chenopod shrublands. Previous studies have concluded that the seedlings and juveniles of many shrubs and trees, including M. platycarpum, are selectively grazed by sheep and rabbits, which threatens their long-term survival in rangelands. The aim of this study was to assess the survivorship of M. platycarpum seedlings grazed by sheep and rabbits in a rangeland setting. Seedlings of M. platycarpum were raised in the greenhouse and planted in the field and individually fenced to allow or prevent access by various herbivores. Over 1 year, the frequency of grazing and size of canopy was recorded. A flexible mixed model incorporating cubic smoothing splines was used to describe the relationship between change in canopy volume over time, fixed effects (exclosure type, time, rainfall and egesta weights) and random variability among plants, replicates and sites. The mixed models showed that there were no significant differences in canopy volume over time between sheep and rabbit-proof exclosures, indicating that rabbits were not significantly affecting the seedlings, browsing only five of those available to them, of which three survived. Large herbivores (sheep and/or kangaroos) grazed un-caged seedlings, resulting in significantly smaller canopy volumes, and higher death rates (80%). Although supplementary irrigation was applied, background losses due to desiccation in caged seedlings were up to 50%.

AB The sound and sustainable cultivation of the soil across generations is the farmer's aim and the reason behind the Soil Protection Act. Agricultural equipment and procedures have been developed to serve this purpose. Designed for productive efficiency, this equipment is very heavy and may cause damage to the soil. Several publications focus on this risk and ask for load restrictions. It therefore seemed appropriate to take a broad approach and practically examine whether and how far these concerns are justified and can be proven empirically. For this purpose, 17 areas with different types of production were monitored. Sub-areas cultivated in a regular way as well as frequently used tramlines and headlands were analysed selectively and comprehensively. The results were compared with wasteland - as something other than the agronomic optimum. As measuring scale for compaction, optimum and damage threshold are defined with the help of own data.
   Tramlines, which are primarily compacted in the topsoil, turned out to be problematic. At sensitive locations there was deeper compaction, but only sporadically below the damage threshold.
   The headlands, and there again especially the tramlines, are significantly affected as they are used frequently year after year. However, the conventionally cultivated areas are neither detrimentally compacted in the topsoil nor in the subsoil. Only the sensitive sandy soils are compacted along the tractor tyre tracks.
   Possible influences from cultivation can hardly be proven. Only few areas have developed a plough sole, although not a distinct one. This is the result of modem tyre equipment and changing working depths. Soil functions did not seem to differ between conventional or organic farms. Farms with row crops, often criticised for their high degree of mechanisation, do not differ from those without row crops. Consequently, the thesis that the soil is compacted cannot be proved.
   Additionally, the current results are compared with those of 1986/87. In those days, the trends and the differences between wasteland, field, tramlines and headland were similar. The differences between now and then are within the scattering range of the readings.
   In conclusion, it cannot be stated generally that mechanisation has led to a higher compaction of the soil. Thus, these empirical findings deviate from the relevant literature since studies in agricultural engineering are carried out on concrete objects under on-the-job conditions. The present thesis does not deal with extreme cases but with a wide spectrum of common cultivation practices.

AB So far, the promotion of organic farming through additional premiums, as well as the coupling of direct payments with environmental standards for all agricultural enterprises (cross-compliance), has not been based on scientifically based indicator values. It is proposed that this should be done by means of a cost-benefit-analysis, taking into account both economic and environmental criteria. Economic incentives for conversion to organic fanning and environmentally sound fanning practices should be highest in regions where conventional intensive agriculture causes significant environmental damage without providing significantly higher yield levels than organic farming. In contrast, incentives for conversion should be lower in areas which are not environmentally sensitive, but promote significantly higher yield levels under conventional than under organic fanning practices.
   The protection of biotic resources has already been incorporated into the regional planning targets in some German federal states ("Priority areas for nature protection"). Extending this concept to the agricultural sector, "priority areas for organic farming" can be formulated which aim primarily at the protection of abiotic resources.
   The application of this concept has been demonstrated by linking scientific data from test farms under different soil, climatic and management conditions with statistical data on soil fertility, livestock density and land use within the entire state. It could be demonstrated that a conversion of specialized dairy farms on sandy soils from highly intensive conventional practices to organic standards significantly reduced nitrate inputs into groundwater with only a slight reduction in forage yields. In contrast, nitrate leaching in both conventional and organic arable farming was low on loamy soils which are predestined for arable crop production. but grain yields were by far lower in organic farming.

AB Large-scale changes in land use are occurring in many tropical regions, with significant impacts on nitrogen and phosphorus biogeochemistry. In this study we examine the relationships between land use, anthropogenic nutrient inputs, and riverine nutrient exports in a major agricultural watershed of the Pacific coast of South America, the Guayas River basin of Ecuador. We present comprehensive nutrient budgets for nitrogen (N) and phosphorous ( P) for the Guayas River basin and 10 sub-watersheds. We quantify the four major anthropogenic nutrient fluxes into and out of the region: N and P fertilizer application, N fixation by leguminous crops, net import/export of N and P in agricultural products ( food and feed), and atmospheric deposition. We also estimate inputs of N from biologically fixation in forests and of P from weathering sources in soils and bedrock. The sum of these sources represents net inputs of N and P to each watershed region. Overall, synthetic fertilizers are the largest input to the Guayas Basin for N (53%) and P (57%), and the largest outputs are N and P in crops. Losses of N and P in river export account for 14-38% of total N and P inputs, and there is significant accumulation of N and P, or unmeasured forms of N and P export, in most of the sub-basins. Nutrient balances are indicative of the sustainability of land use practices in a region, where a negative balance of N or P indicates nutrient depletion and subsequent loss of soil fertility, yield, and economic viability. Although the nutrient balance of the entire Guayas Basin is positive, there are negative or near zero balances in two sub-watersheds with extensive banana, coffee and permanent crops. In these basins, degradation of soil quality may be occurring due to these net nutrient losses. Our data show that nutrients are leaving the basin primarily as export crops, with riverine losses of nutrients smaller than crop exports. Nonetheless, there is a direct relationship between nutrient inputs and river outputs, suggesting that agricultural management practices in the basin may have direct impacts on N and P delivery to the highly productive Guayas estuary.

AB The current program of vicuna conservation includes their live-capture for wool harvest in the Andes Region in northern Chile. Here, we describe studies that assess the impacts on the species of different variables relating to the capture process. The immediate physical and physiological effects on vicuna of contrasting capture methods, chase distances and restraint were measured.
   Comparisons between two methods of capture showed that cortisol concentrations were higher in animals herded using vehicles alone compared to those herded using a combination of vehicles and local people on foot. Blood glucose levels, heart rate and respiratory rate showed an immediate but ephemeral response to herding into a corral. The range of distances over which animals were herded caused less noticeable changes in blood and physical parameters. The most marked changes were associated with restraint, during which there were significant increases in creatin kinase, packed cell volume and rectal temperature. The implications of changes in these parameters on vicuna welfare and conservation are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A plant- and crop-based renewable plastic, poly-lactic acid (PLA), is receiving attention as a new material for a sustainable society in place of petroleum-based plastics. We constructed a metabolically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae that has both pyruvate decarboxylase genes (PDC1 and PDC5) disrupted in the genetic background to express two copies of the bovine L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) gene. With this recombinant, the yield of lactate was 82.3g/liter, up to 81.5% of the glucose being transformed into lactic acid on neutralizing cultivation, although pdc1 pdc5 double disruption led to ineffective decreases in cell growth and fermentation speed. This strain showed lactate productivity improvement as much as 1.5 times higher than the previous strain. This production yield is the highest value for a lactic acid-producing yeast yet reported.

DT Article

   Gaza Strip; Palestine
AB In the last decade, the Gaza Strip witnessed a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of building construction associated with the political development in the aftermath of Oslo Agreement. Towers (buildings composed of more than five floors) were, for the first time being built in the region in its modern history. Environmental conditions have deteriorating weathering impacts on the buildings of about 40 years old. This article aims at investigating such impacts and their features as well as the different types of weathering on the buildings. Chemical, mechanical and biological parameters of weathering were reported to work together in the old buildings. Differential weathering was also reported in some buildings either within the stone itself or the cementing material between the stone blocks. The geographic location along the coast is believed to speed up the weathering process as aerosols and rainwater contain high chloride content, which in turn reacts with the stone components. Baladi stones show higher resistance to weathering than the Israeli stone-type. Weathering rate was calculated and found to have an average of about 0.1 cm per annum. Some measures are taken to protect the buildings from the weathering attack; these include 2-3 layers (about 1 cult thick each) of plastering for about 1 m of the lower part of the external walls of the buildings. These measures are not commonly applied, and if so, they show several types of weathering. Taking protective measures is a necessary step for better sustainable management of the aggregate resources in the Gaza Strip. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this short overview paper is to set out the basic meaning of the concept of sustainable development and the challenges it poses for society. The paper also explores the complexities that surround attempts to operationalize sustainability principles. What decision-makers at various levels in society require is a decision support system that includes methods and techniques capable of measuring sustainable development progress ( or the lack of it). However, because sustainability itself is a multifaceted concept and process, a range of often divergent perspectives (worldviews) may all be judged relevant to the translation of the ideas into practice. The as yet unanswered question is how can decision-makers be offered a comprehensive yet consistent and coherent package of decision-making aids in order to facilitate the sustainability transition.

AB The paper reflects on the analysis of the UK construction industry in the Pearce Report of 2003. It outlines the economist's approach to sustainability, which, to date, has been mainly applied at the national economy level. That approach rests on the perception that human well-being is determined by wealth, or assets. Wealth needs to be interpreted broadly and reference is made to the growing literature that measures the asset base of a nation. The paper asks how far the asset-based approach can be applied to the sectoral level of an industry. While sustainability, and sustainable development, have broadly been assumed to be 'good things', the paper raises some challenges to an unquestioning belief in the notions of sustainability as guides to policy. By and large, however, using the asset-based approach is seen to provide real insights into the functioning of the construction sector and its broader role in social and economic development.

AB The UK construction labour process rests on casual self-employment, output-based pay, rigid trade divisions, low levels of training, and a sharp divide between operative and professional/technical skills. Skill shortages beset the industry and their solution focuses not on employment regulation and a comprehensive industry-wide training scheme, but on importing the necessary skilled labour. It is demonstrated how qualitatively differently construction labour is valued in the UK compared with other leading European countries. These rely on higher skill levels, based on knowledge gained through the training process and on a more stable and collectively negotiated structure of training provision and employment. In the UK, in contrast, labour is not valued according to the knowledge it incorporates but according to an individual's ability to fulfil the task in hand. Training is geared to meeting individual employers' immediate needs; qualifications are not a prerequisite for entry; and labour is rewarded for its product not for its potential. The key features of the UK system that give rise to concern are identified. The ways the UK system needs to change are outlined in order to accommodate sustainable development of the construction process.

AB Chapter 7 of the Pearce Report (2003) elaborates succinctly on the role that technical progress should fulfil within a construction sector committed to the sustainable generation of social and economic value. Caught between technological macro-analysis and policy-steering objectives, and possibly overwhelmed by the difficulty of treating the subject within the limited scope of the report and time available, the chapter offers a few aggregate industrial data and some commendable, albeit generic, recommendations about innovation. Yet, as part of work conceived under the aegis of a strategic and development initiative, the chapter underplays the opportunity of highlighting two issues that have and should condition the policy debate on construction innovation in the future. The first issue is concerned with the project-based nature of the sector and its consequent ability to spur or thwart change. The second involves the definition or indication of practical institutional strategies that can trigger the changes foreseen or promoted within such a context. Based on this critique, a rationale is developed in the present paper for the strategic creation of technical progress by drawing attention to two specific elements: (1) the cost-benefit equation in the generation of new knowledge, and (2) the possible qualitative distribution of research investment opportunities in the industry. It is shown that although construction-related innovation and project-based innovation are naturally connected, a critical difference exists between the two. For the latter to develop and have an impact on the industry, both political support and wilful patronage are required.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The Social and Economic Value of Construction (2003), also known as the Pearce Report after its author, has been extensively discussed in the UK, but has not yet attracted the attention of the European construction industry and the wider international research and development community. The international significance of the Pearce Report is that it provides a general methodology that differs substantially from other attempts to describe the construction industry and its contribution to sustainable development. Using capital theory, it provides a conceptual framework for relating the different dimensions of value (or wealth) as ecological (physical), economic, social and cultural capitals; it explores how these dimensions interact; and it examines the possibilities of substituting one capital for another. The Pearce Report also stresses the importance of maintaining and improving value over time in the sense of a sustainable development. This Forum discusses the theoretical framework, compares this with other approaches within the European Union, considers these aspects mainly in the field of social, human and cultural capital, and proposes additional research directions that should be tackled internationally.

AB A broad range of fisheries-management approaches has been used around the world with varying degrees of success. The Fifth International Mote Symposium focused on contrasting strategies and contexts associated with successful experiences with others associated with management failures. A number of general principles for successful fisheries management emerged. These principles emphasize the need to address the causes of management failures directly by creating institutional structures that provide incentives to stop the race for fish and to increase responsibility and accountability of all stakeholders-fishers, scientists, and managers.

AB Many of Alaska's salmon fisheries are models of biological success, with management structures that have maintained biomass, stock diversity, and biological yield. At the same time the fisheries face severe challenges due to low product price, and have been declared formal "economic" disasters by state and federal agencies in recent years. From many perspectives, these fisheries are in crisis. I explore how the governance system for Alaska's Bristol Bay fishery has led to biological success and economic failure. I review a range of alternative governance structures, in place or being considered, that might provide for social and economic sustainability. I also demonstrate that the basic biological principal that has guided management, maximum sustainable yield, is a serious impediment to social and economic sustainability.

   PREDATION
AB Chilean benthic fisheries involve thousands of artisanal fishers, about 50 target species (most significantly loco, Concholepas concholepas (Bruguiere)), and a coastline spanning 38 latitudinal degrees. An overfishing crisis led to a closure of the loco fishery (1989-1992), and to the incorporation of territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFS) into fisheries legislation. Organizations of artisanal fishers are entitled to co-manage parcels of seabed with the state. We used old and new data on the loco fishery of Region IV (the cradle of the system) to investigate the performance of TURFs, which presently encompass 36% of the prime habitat that contributed close to 82% of historical yield. Abundance within TURFS and legal catch are stabilized, the fishery looks orderly, and perception of TURFS is generally positive. The system is dual, however, and at least half of the catch is illegal, originating from background areas outside the TURFS. Corrective action requires incentives that would eliminate the illegal catch, increase fishermen's participation, and provide simple feedback decision rules driven by data and more flexibility allowing fishermen to experiment and diversify activities. Attention is needed to biological processes at scales that transcend the boundaries of locally managed TURFS and to values and priorities other than biological sustainability that may be of societal significance.

AB We answer four questions about tuna management in the eastern Pacific Ocean: What are the management objectives? Are they reasonable? Can we determine whether they have been achieved? Have they been achieved? There are explicit, over-arching management objectives including keeping populations at levels that will permit maximum sustainable yields, consideration of the precautionary approach, and consideration of ecosystem consequences, but although reasonable, these objectives are vague from a stock-assessment perspective. Objectives of individual participants are unlikely to be the same and collectively make achieving the overarching objectives more difficult. For data-rich stocks, we can determine whether the yield-based objectives have been achieved, but even these results have alternative interpretations. Unfortunately, when data are limited, the management objectives cannot be evaluated. In the eastern Pacific, species differ in achievement of objectives. Yield-based objectives are probably being achieved for yellowfin tuna-yields may increase if effort is reallocated among fishing methods-whereas for bigeye tuna, biomass levels are falling below that necessary for maximum sustainable yield. For skipjack, although the population level is healthy, restrictions designed to protect bigeye and yellowfin tuna prevent fishermen from achieving maximum sustainable yield. By-catch of other species in the tuna fisheries is a management concern.

AB In a series of synoptic research cruises including 4000 research dives, we surveyed reef-fish populations and habitats before and 3 yrs after 2001 implementation of no-take marine reserves covering approximately 566 km(2) in the Dry Tortugas, Florida. Species richness and composition of 267 fishes remained stable between 1999-2000 and 2004 within the overall survey domain. Reef-fish biodiversity was highest in the more rugose habitats. Domain-wide abundances of several exploited and nonexploited species increased; no declines were detected. In the Tortugas Bank reserve, we found significantly greater abundances and shifts in length composition toward a higher proportion of exploited-phase animals in 2004 than in 1999-2000 for some species. Consistent with marine reserve theory, we detected no declines in exploited species in the reserve, whereas we detected both increases and declines in nontarget species, but the increases in exploited populations may also have been influenced by factors other than protected status. Although the recovery process is still in an early stage, our results after 3 yrs are encouraging and suggest that no-take marine reserves, in conjunction with traditional management, can help build sustainable fisheries while protecting the Florida Keys coral-reef ecosystem.

ID FISHERIES-MANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; SYSTEMS; ISSUES
AB Many ecosystem-based terms have been generated to promote more holistic approaches to the management of natural resources. Within Australia, despite the progress made toward applying these concepts to fisheries management, the multitude of terms has often caused stakeholder confusion. A national workshop concluded that ecologically sustainable development (ESD; known elsewhere as sustainable development) should be the overall goal for government and that the other terms discussed (ecosystem-based management, ecosystem-based fisheries management, etc.) described strategies that should be used by various agencies and industry sectors to work toward this goal. All ecosystem-based approaches can cover the direct and indirect environmental impacts, social and economic outcomes, and governance systems associated with an activity. The main difference among them is the scope of the regions and activities covered and therefore the breadth of issues to be managed. A hierarchy of ESD-related frameworks and tools, designed to operate at a number of levels (the individual fisher, local and multiregional management agencies), is described, and the elements needed for their implementation (correct scope, transparency, inclusiveness, measurable objectives) are discussed. These results from Australia should be directly relevant to the implementation of ecosystem-based approaches in other locations.

TI The pricing and procurement of antiretroviral drugs: an observational
   study of data from the Global Fund
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The Purchase price report released in August 2004 by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund) was the first publication of a significant amount of real transaction purchase data for antiretrovirals (ARVs). We did an observational study of the ARV transaction data in the Purchase price report to examine the procurement behaviour of principal recipients of Global Fund grants in developing countries. We found that, with a few exceptions for specific products (e.g. lamivudine) and regions (e.g. eastern Europe), prices in low-income countries were broadly consistent or lower than the lowest differential prices quoted by the research and development sector of the pharmaceutical industry. In lower middle-income countries, prices were more varied and in several instances (lopinavir/ritonavir, didanosine, and zidovudine/lamivudine) were very high compared with the per capita income of the country. In all low- and lower middle-income countries, ARV prices were still significantly high given limited local purchasing power and economic strength, thus reaffirming the need for donor support to achieve rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy. However, the price of ARVs will have to decrease to render scale-up financially sustainable for donors and eventually for governments themselves. An important first step in reducing prices will be to make available in the public domain as much ARV transaction data as possible to provide a factual basis for discussions on pricing. The price of ARVs has considerable implications for the sustainability of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) treatment in the developing world.

DE Burkina Faso; cotton; mechanization; intensification; sustainable
   development
AB Cotton production in Burkina Faso depends on international markets where it competes with other production areas. It provides 550,000 producers, concentrated in western provinces, with income that, although fluctuating and sometimes late, nonetheless allows them to acquire agricultural equipment and animals and thus differentiate their techniques from those of traditional farmers. Intensification of cultivation, with draught animals or even mechanized tillage and external input, reduces work time and increases productivity per worker - for food production as well as cotton. The ensuing extension of usable framland that ensues can prejudice fallows and erodible land even further from the village center, increasing path density and causing reorganization of communal territories, the positive effects of cotton cultivation are not limited to agricultural activities but improve the lives of the farmers, who can make enough money for their expenses, planned and unplanned. It also stimulates other economic sectors in these regions. Nonetheless, misuse of semi-intensive farming techniques promotes pluvial erosion and runoff and calls into question the sustainability of local cultivation.

AB To ensure food production appropriate for poulation requirements, in terms of quantity. quality, and the health security, while respecting the principles of sustainable development for the planet, crop protection, which today remains principally agrochemical, must change or it will aggravate an already disquieting economc and balance sheet. The alternative proposed at the end of the 1960s - the concept of integrated pest management - has been successful only in the most critical situations: fruit orchards and greenhouses. The transgenic solution, adopted several years ago in large fields, increases the risk of resistance phenomena but does allow a substantial reduction in chemical treatments, subject, however, to control of the proliferation of pests until then of secondary importance. Attention today focuses on the spatio-temporal aspects of the management of both harmful and useful populations, in particular by devoloping and managing their vegetation habitats. Accordingly, the consistency of agroecological actions by agronomists and crop protection specialists is decisive: preventive solutions are essential, at the scale of entire fields and at the scale of larger land units, including uncultivated areas. Priority must be accorded to balanced and sustainable functioning of agroecosystems. The adoption of this new strategy by practitioners involves an important break with traditional techniques and requires a marked change in mentalities.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB The Canadian construction industry has sustained a healthy growth rate over the last 10 years. This could make the Canadian market attractive to foreign competitors. Moreover, Canadian companies possess enough expertise and resources to be able to effectively compete in the global market. This highlights the increased importance of developing marketing strategies for Canadian companies. This research study provides an understanding of how Toronto construction companies evaluate market attractiveness and company competitiveness. Such evaluation is the first step towards building effective marketing strategies. The research included an analysis of the main indicators of the Toronto market over the last 10 years and one-on-one interviews with 39 experts. The research deployed the analytical hierarchy process to identify the most important factors that can be used for measuring company competitiveness and market attractiveness. The most important factors that influence company competitiveness include customer satisfaction, cost efficiency, and safety record. Factors with the highest impact on market attractiveness are sustainable profitability (return on investment), supply of finance, and overall economic conditions.

AB The concession period is one of the most important issues to be addressed in private sector provision of public works and services through concession arrangements as it, to some extent, demarcates the rights and responsibilities between public and private sectors in a project's life cycle, and it is also critical to the project's sustainable development. This paper proposes a methodology for the determination of an appropriate length of the concession based on a win-win principle for parties involved and exercises simulation techniques in measuring and evaluating construction and economic uncertainties and risks. A case study of a hypothetical infrastructure project is provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology, mathematical model, and simulation techniques.

AB We studied the linear home range and seasonal movements of Podocnemis sextuberculata from September 1996 to December 1998 in the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve located in the middle Solim (o) over tilde es River, near Tefe, Amazonas, Brazil. We collected data on turtle movements and home range through mark and recapture and radiotelemetry, focusing on seasonal differences between periods of high and low water levels. Based on radiotelemetry of 6 females in the Jaraua River system, linear home range varied from 16.52 to 44.5 km. Nesting migrations from the Jaraua to the beaches of the Japura River averaged 18.04 km. Males did not move significantly between captures. For conservation purposes, it is of critical importance to protect both the canals that the turtles use to travel between the lakes and the river as well as the deep holes in the river where mature turtles congregate during the dry season.

AB An effective adsorbent for the ethylene/ethane separation has been prepared by the dispersion of CuCl in large NaX crystals. The results from the thermo, gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicate a maximal dispersion capacity of 36 wt% of CuCl for the NaX crystals. Single component isotherms of ethane and ethylene on CuCl/NaX show that the CuCl containing adsorbents are highly favourable to the olefin, which is ascribed to the strong interaction due to the formation of pi-complexes between ethylene and CuCl. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate that CuCl/NaX can be used as an effective adsorbent for the separation of ethylene and. ethane mixtures and would allow the use of more sustainable processes.

AB Membrane operations are an interesting answer to the necessity of a Sustainable industrial growth. The possibility to rationalize an important petrochemical cycle by introducing membrane processes was investigated in the case of the ethylene production. The potentialities of catalytic membrane reactors (MRs) were analysed. coupling an exergetic analysis with the Process Intensification logic. Considering ethylene production by a catalytic process (ethane oxidative dehydro-g-enation). the introduction of a MR with a membrane (oxygen conducting membrane which selectively transports oxygen) for the oxygen separate feeding was considered. Moreover, the integration of a gas separation membrane system with the traditional reactor was proposed. The MR ethylene production process. compared to the TR one, achieves essential targets as the improved safety. the reduction of plant complexity, energy and exergy savings. increased flexibility as well as synergetic effects.

AB Recently, two papers presented by Ortigoso et al. [Phis. Rev. Lett. 93 (2004) 073001 and Phys. Rev. A 72 (2005) 053401] develop a novel strategy in which the best sustainable molecular alignment/orientation has been achieved. We intend to analyse the dynamic mechanisms, including those Ortigoso et al. have not clarified.

AB Land-use and land-cover change, human activity that results in altered land-use systems and surface features, defines the environmental and socioeconomic sustainability of communities around the globe. It is a key response to global environmental change in addition to being both a key cause and medium of this change. This article examines an application of the Southern Yucatdn Peninsular Region Integrated Assessment (SYPRIA), a scenario-based spatially explicit model designed to examine and project land use in Mexico. SYPRIA combines Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with agent-based modeling, cellular modeling, and genetic programming. The application examined here explores the effects on land-use and land-cover projections of scenarios that rely on varying assumptions pertaining to population growth, land-use trends, role of agrarian technology, and effects of resource institutions. This work also highlights the importance of understanding the many factors influencing land use, particularly population, different production systems, and the contextual nature of resource institutions in determining the nature of land use.

TI Targeting research for poverty reduction in marginal areas of rural
   Syria
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB Agricultural research in marginal dry areas can contribute to reducing poverty through the development of technological, institutional and policy options for poor farmers. Such research should address diversified opportunities and development pathways. This article analyses the diversity of livelihood strategies of rural people living in the Khanasser Valley in northwestern Syria, an area that is typical of marginal drylands. It proposes an operational classification of households based on their different livelihood strategies, applying an integrated methodology within a Sustainable Livelihoods framework. Households are classified into three clusters: agriculturists, labourers and pastoralists. The article examines the diversity of livelihoods involved, and considers where and how research should be directed to have greatest impact on poverty. Given that rural households are not homogeneous but dynamic entities, with diverse assets, capabilities and opportunities, the definition of household typologies can help to target development research. The article concludes that while agriculturists benefit most, poor labourers with enough land can also gain from pro-poor agricultural research. The poorest households with little land, and pastoralists, benefit little or only indirectly.

TI Post-normal science in practice: A Q study of the potential for
   sustainable forestry in Washington State, USA
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

ID ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS; PERSPECTIVES; MANAGEMENT; VALUATION; VALUES
AB Some ecological economists have advocated participatory decision methods, in which people act as citizens rather than consumers, as an epistemologically preferable alternative to a price-based valuation approach for determining the disposition of ecosystems. Q method is a research technique advocated by proponents of discursive democracy to assess the self described attitudes of participants in discourse around a particular topic. Techniques that attempt to discern public values around ecological systems without imposing contrived (e.g. only monetary) or unintentionally biased frameworks can be seen as advancing ecological economics as a post-normal science. Understanding the attitudes of groups involved in conflict over ecosystem use is crucial for designing policies that have a chance of being implemented, as well as being equitable and sustainable. Thus, the use of Q method is an essential step for supporting successful public participation in decisions affecting ecosystem sustainability. This paper reports the results of a Q study designed to ascertain: (1) the potential to find a common basis for cooperation among groups with a long history of conflict over forest management issues in the Pacific Northwest of the United States; and (2) the extent to which current science pertaining to sustainable forest ecosystem management is commonly understood among these same actors. Participants were asked to rank 64 statements about forest management in the region, including definitions of sustainable forestry, on a scale of +4 (strongly agree) to - 4 (strongly disagree). Thirty people with a wide variety of backgrounds and experience with forest issues performed this "Q sort' and then were interviewed to provide context. for their answers. The individual Q sorts were correlated and factor analyzed to derive ideal discourse types. Three distinct discourses about sustainable forestry emerged from the factor analysis. Results indicate a strong desire across stakeholder groups to engage in participatory decision-making with people from all sides of the issues. There also appears to be a lack of consensus about the exact meaning of sustainable forestry and a lack of familiarity with scientific concepts of ecosystem resilience among some groups. Recommendations for additional ways in which Q method can be applied by ecological economists as a practical means of advancing the field as a post-normal science are described in the concluding section.

AB The paper looks for evolutionary policy responses to techno-institutional lock-in, a persistent state that creates systemic market and policy barriers to technological alternatives. We address the coordination role for authorities rather than corrective optimisation and elaborate three evolutionary policy objectives, including fostering of (i) the diversity of technological options, (ii) common vision for the implementation of technological alternatives and (iii) changes in social and physical networks. We use these objectives to analyse documented experiences from environmental voluntary agreements and foresight activities. We argue that combining the virtues of these tools into a new policy tool, named prospective voluntary agreement, can help facilitate an escape from techno-institutional lock-in. The merit of the prospective voluntary agreement ties with the enhancement of collaborative policy cultures and inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary stakeholder learning that creates commitment to desired action for escaping lock-in.

ID TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS; ZIMBABWE; INDIA; VALUATION
AB Much work has demonstrated the significant role and value of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in the livelihoods of rural people in southern Africa and elsewhere. The findings provide a mean or composite picture, averaged across the sample households within each community. Yet, within any given community, there is significant socio-economic differentiation. It is important to acknowledge such differentiation when considering policy and management interventions to support rural livelihoods and promote sustainable resource use. This paper reports on a study in South Africa, the objective of which was to explore wealth-related differences and similarities in the use and value of NTFPs.
   Data on NTFP consumption, purchase, and sale were collected from households in three rural villages. Households were divided into three wealth classes and patterns of NTFPs use between the classes examined. There was no difference in the proportions of households in each wealth class using NTFPs, nor the total number of NTFPs used per household. Yet, there was some supporting evidence that poorer households derive greater benefits from NTFPs than do wealthy or intermediate households. One clear difference was that, with increasing wealth, households purchased significantly more NTFPs, and a greater proportion of wealthy households did so. Conversely, a greater proportion of poor households were involved in the sale of one or more NTFPs, and they sold a greater number per household, compared to wealthy and intermediate households. Detailed examination of use and value of four NTFPs (fuelwood, wild fruits, edible herbs, and grass hand brushes) revealed that in all instances, the poorest households used more of the resource per capita than the other wealth classes. This was not the case for comparisons based on the total household as the unit of analysis. Gross annual direct-use value did not differ between the wealth classes for any of the four NTFPs examined, at the household level. But on a per capita basis, a significantly higher gross annual direct-use value was evident within poorer households for fuelwood and edible herbs. The significance of these differences is discussed.

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS

DE culture; capital; sustainable development; economics
AB This paper explores the concept of cultural capital and suggests a framework for assessing its influence in the management and use of natural capital. Cultural capital has been described as the,underlying factors that provide human societies with the means and adaptations to maintain themselves in their environment. Sustainable development calls for a shift in the way in which natural capital is managed and used and much effort has gone into discussing and analysing the sustainable development process and mechanisms by which natural capital levels can be maintained. Cultural capital is an important, but much neglected, element in this process. There have been attempts to analyse the role of culture in development, but these have been few and isolated. This paper identifies three key areas in which cultural capital has influence: 'management objectives', 'efficiency of process' and 'demand'. These three areas form the basis of an analysis framework, designed to assess the presence of various cultural traits with regard to the main functions of natural capital-the provision of. raw materials, sinks, environmental services and amenity services.

AB Ecologists, economists and other social scientists have much incentive for interaction. First of all, ecological systems and socioeconomic systems are linked in their dynamics, and these linkages are key to coupling environmental protection and economic growth. Beyond this, however, are the obvious similarities in how ecological systems and socioeconomic systems function, and the common theoretical challenges in understanding their dynamics. This should not be surprising. Socioeconomic systems are in fact ecological systems, in which the familiar ecological phenomena of exploitation, cooperation and parasitism all can be identified as key features. Or, viewed from the opposite perspective, ecological systems are economic systems, in which competition for resources is key, and in which an evolutionary process shapes the individual agents to a distribution of specialization of function that leads to the emergence of flows and functionalities at higher levels of organization. Most fundamentally, ecological and socioeconomic systems alike are complex adaptive systems, in which patterns at the macroscopic level emerge from interactions and selection mechanisms mediated at many levels of organization, from individual agents to collectives to whole systems and even above. In such complex adaptive systems, robustness must be understood as emergent from selection processes operating at these many different levels, and the inherent nonlinearities can trigger sudden shifts in regimes that, in the case of the biosphere, can have major consequences for humanity. This lecture will explore the complex adaptive nature of ecosystems, and the implications for the robustness of ecosystem services on which we depend, and in particular examine the conditions under which cooperative behavior emerges. It will then turn attention to the socioeconomic systems in which environmental management is based, and ask what lessons can be learned from our examination of natural systems, and how we can modify social norms to achieve global cooperation in managing our common future. Of special interest will be issues of intragenerational and intergenerational equity, and the importance of various forms of discounting.

AB In this paper, a finite element numerical algorithm for the simulation of two-dimensional problems of heat transfer with phase change is validated, comparing the numerical results with the experimental ones deriving from tests carried out on two different kinds of PCM containing sandwich panels. The very good approximation affecting the numerical results, as compared with the experimental ones, suggests that it can be a powerful design tool for every kind of PCM containing building elements.
   Moreover, four prototypes of PCM containing sandwich panels for prefabricated walls were tested (two of them used to validate the numerical finite element method for design purposes) in a test-room capable of simulating several kinds of outdoor and indoor environmental conditions, aimed at evaluating the energetic performances of such panels, which make them suitable for use in different climatic contexts or in different elements of buildings. The possibility to adapt such basic technology to manufacture panels with several stratifications allows their installation both on ceilings and walls and in several climatic and design contexts.

TI A global survey of hydrogen energy research, development and policy

LA English

DE hydrogen energy; transportation; fuel cells
ID FUEL-CELLS; FUTURE
AB Several factors have led to growing interest in a hydrogen energy economy, especially for transportation. A successful transition to a major role for hydrogen will require much greater cost-effectiveness, fueling infrastructure, consumer acceptance, and a strategy for its basis in renewable energy feedstocks. Despite modest attention to the need for a sustainable hydrogen energy system in several countries, in most cases in the short to mid term hydrogen will be produced from fossil fuels. This paper surveys the global status of hydrogen energy research and development (R&D) and public policy, along with the likely energy mix for making it. The current state of hydrogen energy R&D among auto, energy and fuel-cell companies is also briefly reviewed. Just two major auto companies and two nations have specific targets and timetables for hydrogen fuel cells or vehicle production, although the EU also has an aggressive, less specific strategy. Iceland and Brazil are the only nations where renewable energy feedstocks are envisioned as the major or sole future source of hydrogen. None of these plans, however, are very certain. Thus, serious questions about the sustainability of a hydrogen economy can be raised. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Market perspectives of stationary fuel cells in a sustainable energy

SO ENERGY POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE stationary fuel cells; market potential; energy scenarios
AB Because of high efficiency, low environmental impacts and a potential role in transforming our energy system into a hydrogen economy, fuel cells are often considered as a key technology for a sustainable energy supply. However, the future framing conditions under which stationary fuel cells have to prove their technical and economic competitiveness are most likely characterised by a reduced demand for space heating, and a growing contribution of renewable energy sources to heat and electricity supply, which both directly limit the potential for combined heat and power generation, and thus also for fuel cells. Taking Germany as a case study, this paper explores the market potential of stationary fuel cells under the structural changes of the energy demand and supply system required to achieve a sustainable energy supply. Results indicate that among the scenarios analysed it is in particular a strategy oriented towards ambitious CO2-reduction targets, which due to its changes in the supply structure is in a position to mobilise a market potential that might be large enough for a successful fuel cell commercialisation. However, under the conditions of a business-as-usual trajectory the sales targets of fuel cell manufacturers cannot be met. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Geothermal energy is already in the form of heat, and from the thermodynamic point of view, work is more useful than heat because not all heat can be converted to work. Therefore, geothermal resources should be classified according to their exergy, which is a measure of their ability to do work. In recent years there has been a remarkable growth of interest in environmental issues-sustainability and improved management of development in harmony with the environment. Environmental impact assessment is one of the most widely used tools in environmental management. In this study, the environmental and exergetic aspects of geothermal energy, namely the rapid impact assessment matrix method, and, specific exergy index, were studied first. They were then applied to the Tuzla geothermal field in Canakkale and Balcova geothermal field in Izmir, Turkey, respectively. Finally, the results obtained are given and discussed.

AB This article expresses both Turkey's present and future renewable energy policy. Air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern in Turkey. Air pollution from energy utilization in the country is due to the combustion of coal, lignite, petroleum, natural gas, wood, and agricultural and animal wastes. In 1992, Turkish Ministry of Environment issued a regulation providing for emissions testing for cars, trucks, and vans. Achieving a solution to environmental problems requires long-term policies for sustainable development. In this aspect, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions. Turkey has substantial reserves of renewable energy resources. However, actual utilization of these resources is quite low.

TI Does the compact-city paradigm foster sustainability? An empirical study

DT Article
AB The compact-city paradigm has received increased attention worldwide for its ability to achieve sustainable development. However, the claim that the compact-city paradigm contributes to sustainability has not been sufficiently verified. In this study we evaluate how major concepts in the compact-city paradigm affect urban sustainability. Correspondingly, the complementary strategies for facilitating compact-city progress are recommended. Structural equation modeling was applied to ninety-two samples of medium-sized or small-sized cities in Taiwan. Latent variables and observed variables were analyzed in the model's structure. According to the results a high-density pattern and intensification negatively affect the environmental and social sustainability, but positively affect economic sustainability. Furthermore, mixture of land use is beneficial to economic sustainability, and does not significantly affect environmental or social sustainability. On the basis of the empirical results, strategies that guide the compact-city paradigm toward the goals of sustainability are also proposed.

AB Taiwan's EPA has implemented a new guideline called the "Plastic Products Restriction Policy", prohibiting some industries to use plastics as packaging materials for the sake of sustainable use of resources. The significant effect resulting from this policy is the substitution of plastic products with paper products. Is this policy beneficial to achieve future sustainability? I allempt to analyze the resource choice between renewable resources and exhaustible resources for production of final products and services in case of exhaustion of natural resources. In this paper, I develop a framework to examine the dynamic responsiveness of a socio-economical system in facing a continual depletion of natural resources provided by an environmental system. In this framework, the status of an environmental system in terms of carrying capacity is affected by the cumulative impacts caused from human activities, including environmental pollution and resource exploitation. Conversely, it also affects the growth of renewable resources. This framework can serve as a guideline to construct indicators to measure the status of the environmental system and the socio-economical system in order to support a policy planner that formulates an appropriate environmental policy. Based on this framework, I also develop a mathematical model to determine the optimal ratio of resources choice between renewable resources and exhaustible resources. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Carbonate sediments are the sole indigenous source of aggregate for infrastructure development on many Pacific islands, and their importance has increased markedly since the middle of the last century. Biogenic gravel and sand are extracted in many places by dredging of shallow lagoons and by the mining of beach deposits. As demand increases, environmental and other problems caused by unrenewable, and thus unsustainable, and/or inappropriate extraction of this limited resource have grown. Majuro Atoll in the Marshall Islands exhibits many of the problems that are widespread in the Pacific. There is now concern on this atoll about damage to the coastline and the largely uncontrolled nature of aggregate extraction, linked to pressure to increase the habitable space by coastal reclamation and leading to the need for discourse among land owners, developers, and government agencies. The lagoon is large and well suited to study by high-resolution multibeam swath mapping, which has allowed three-dimensional imaging of aggregate deposits and dredge scars and pits. Thus, the technique is valuable both for rapid and accurate surveying and, used in conjunction with satellite imagery, as a means of providing to stakeholders colored images of past damage and areas of future interest.

AB This paper summarizes the author's views on the appropriate role and functioning of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP), based on the presentations made by the speakers at AEESP's Annual Conference held at Clarkson University at Potsdam, New York, in July 2005. The paper notes that AEESP and also the American Academy of Environmental Engineer (AAEE) were formed in the mid 20th century that their functions were organized to meet the needs of the United States in environmental development for the second half of the 20th century, and while these organizations have achieved much success in their performance in the previous half-century, the picture for the future looks remarkably different. This is because of the increasing acceleration of new technology which is rapidly changing everything, including changing the pattern of economics from country operated systems to an unprecedented new system of globalization. Both AEESP and AAEE now must reorient their roles and functions to expand American professional capabilities to influence continuing development in both the United States and in the developing countries in order to protect as well as to utilize environmental resources as needed to enable sustainable global development. Recommendations are given for feasible steps which American (and other) universities can take for modifying university programs to suit this objective.

   Goals
AB Solutions to global environmental and development problems require engineers to design and construct ecologically and socially just systems, within the carrying capacity of nature and society, without compromising the welfare of future generations. Engineers must also have international perspectives if the discipline is to take a leadership role in improving the lives of the global community. This manuscript provides details of, and the motivation behind, an engineering program that allows environmental (and civil) engineering graduate students to obtain Master of Science degrees while serving as engineers in the U.S. Peace Corps. Drivers of this educational initiative are the U.N. Millennium Development Goals, the direct link of sustainable development to public health and protection of ecosystems and natural resources, and the need for engineering educators to better integrate societal and economic issues with environmental science. Examples are provided on how these issues are incorporated into a student's education and research requirements. Interviews of incoming Master's International students who do not have a first degree in civil or environmental engineering clearly indicate they are seeking a connection between their professional training and problems of our society. A perceived disconnection between engineering and societal problems is suggested as one reason why women do not go into engineering. To date, the Master's International program has had an enrollment of 39 graduate students. Approximately 40% of the students have been female and 8% have been underrepresented minorities. The program has allowed students to frame their graduate education and research within the context of the environmental, societal, and economic limitations of the developing world.

AB Engineering education has focused on the mathematical and scientific principles which underpin proper design. Technological capabilities have, in some instances, overcome society's ability to adapt behavior to new technologies. Sustainable systems should be engineered to address economic, environmental, and behavioral issues as well as technical issues. Developing education curricula that encourages students to consider all facets involved in sustainable systems has challenged engineering programs. A pilot course based upon the design of a sanitation facility for a school in Azove, Benin, was taught in the 2004-2005 academic year. The objective of the course was to create a meaningful project that would teach sustainability as part of the design process. Over 1,200 7th- to 10th-grade students at CEG in Azove lack access to clean water and basic sanitation facilities. A site visit to the CEG confirmed that water and sanitation were priorities of the school board and parents of the children. Students at Gonzaga University designed a water and sanitation system for CEG and learned about sustainability requirements for structures, hydraulics, and water and wastewater treatment. Upon implementation of the proposed design, exposure to pathogenic organisms is expected to decrease substantially. Students were encouraged to consider sustainability issues in design and problems associated with water and sanitation in the developing world. Incorporating sustainability lessons through design and peer presentation significantly improved the education in global awareness and sustainability as perceived by students and professionals.

AB Industrial ecology is frequently regarded as the organizing framework for studying interactions of technological societies with the environment. A theme central to industrial ecology is the way that materials are used which, in turn, relates to environmental and resource availability concerns. The material fluxes seen between the production of raw materials, the manufacture and use of products, and their fate at their end of life are quantified using material flow analysis, the record keeping of atoms mobilized by humans within a bounded system. The Stocks and Flows project at Yale University examines the full life cycle of anthropogenically mobilized material on a variety of spatial levels, including city-, country-, regional-, and global-level cycles. Different temporal levels are also examined, with research conducted on historical studies, contemporary studies, and scenario development. Material cycles have been completed for copper, zinc, and silver, with current work including iron and steel, chromium, nickel, tungsten, tin, and lead cycles. Such results illuminate the numerous and diverse drivers for constructing technological material cycles: global and local material scarcity, human health and ecosystem effects, energy and water consumption, high unit value of the material, pertinent regulations, waste management strategies, and economic considerations. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of selected topics in the field of industrial ecology, to gather from diverse literature key results from the Stocks and Flows project, and to introduce novel analyses related to environmental losses and waste streams that result from anthropogenic use of materials. This is done with the intent to emphasize to the environmental engineering and science audience what may be termed "forward-looking" environmental engineering.

ID BENEFIT TRANSFER
AB Mining firms stimulate local and national economies but this comes at a certain cost. In the light of increasing public concern, external costs of environmental degradation and social disruption are no longer of pure academic interest. The assessment of mining projects on the grounds of sustainable development is critical in order to decide whether the exploitation of mineral resources is socially desirable. In practice, few steps have been taken towards this end. In this paper, a case study is illustrated that provides the means for evaluating the social worthiness of mining projects. The analysis, which is the first of its kind in Greece, deals with a major problem of the mining industry: the gold debate on the grounds of green economics. The assessment is based on the social cost-benefit approach. Well-established techniques (e.g. benefit transfer) and innovative approaches have been adopted to overcome various practical problems.

AB Lake Taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in China. It serves many social, economic, and ecological purposes in the drainage basin. Unfortunately, the water has been heavily polluted due to rapid industrialization and urbanization during the last two decades. Notwithstanding great efforts made so far to improve the water quality, the environmental situation is still far from being optimistic. The basin and the lake are facing a range of severe environmental challenges: rapid socio-economic development continues to place great pressures on the environment, current pollution control projects have many problems from the viewpoint of effectiveness and efficiency of their implementations, and the non-point sources of pollution such as agricultural fields, for which control is more difficult than for industrial point sources, have become the main contributors to serious eutrophication of the lake. Considering the characteristics of the environmental challenges and problems confronting the basin and the lake, we focus on integrated environmental management (IEM) as a promising and effective approach to overcome these predicaments. Current practices and problems of environmental management in the basin are examined, and potential future developments are discussed. Three aspects of the IEM are emphasized: institutional cooperation, public participation, and internalization of environmental externalities. We think these are the most critical for not only the basin but also for the whole of China to achieve a sustainable society.

AB The purpose of this study was to help to inform policy development for the Australian rangelands, and provide a proof of concept for application of a multi-criteria analysis approach to assessment of competing resource use at continental scale. The study aimed to identify and locate key natural resource and agricultural production assets in the rangelands, define a number of measures of potentially threatening processes, and use a multi-criteria approach to identify areas where threatening processes, agricultural production problems, or valuable natural resources coincided. The analysis used 35 readily available, continental spatial data layers at 5-km pixel resolution ranked from 1 (low) to 5 (high) under three themed groupings: natural resource base, production base, and threatening processes. These measures were aggregated into composite indicators to define attributes such as environmental sensitivity and total grazing pressure. The composites were then compared in a two-way analysis to explore particular interactions between threatening processes such as pastoralism and mining, and the condition of production and natural resource assets. These interactions were defined as "tensions" for purposes of this analysis. Example "tensions" included the association of high grazing intensity with areas of high environmental sensitivity, indicating a risk of land degradation under adverse climatic conditions. A summary of patterns of tension was obtained by extracting area proportions of high-tension classes for selected Natural Heritage Trust Regions, which are a basis for Australian Government funding of improved environmental management. The study provides a basis for further examination of trade-offs in the use of natural assets, opportunities for improved productivity and sustainability, and social and economic implications.

AB Native bacteria, Pseudomonas and filamentous bacteria were quantified and localized on wheat roots grown in the field using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Seminal roots were sampled through the season from unploughed soil in a conservation farming system. Such soils are spatially heterogeneous, and many roots grow slowly through hard soil with cracks and pores containing dead roots remnant from previous crops. Root and rhizosphere morphology, and contact with soil particles were preserved, and autofluorescence was avoided by observing sections in the far-red with Cy5 and Cy5.5 fluorochromes. Spatial analyses showed that bacteria were embedded in a stable matrix (biofilm) within 11 mu m of the root surface (range 2-30 mu m) and were clustered on 40% of roots. Half the clusters colocated with axial grooves between epidermal cells, soil particles, cap cells or root hairs; the other half were not associated with visible features. Across all wheat roots, although variable, bacteria averaged 15.4 x 10(5) cells per mm(3) rhizosphere, and of these, Pseudomonas and filaments comprised 10% and 4%, respectively, with minor effects of sample time, and no effect of plant age. Root caps were most heavily colonized by bacteria along roots, and elongation zones least heavily colonized. Pseudomonas varied little with root development and were 17% of bacteria on the elongation zone. Filamentous bacteria were not found on the elongation zone. The most significant factor to rhizosphere populations along a wheat root, however, was contact with dead root remnants, where Pseudomonas were reduced but filaments increased to 57% of bacteria (P < 0.001). This corresponded with analyses of root remnants showing they were heavily colonized by bacteria, with 48% filaments (P < 0.001) and 1.4%Pseudomonas (P = 0.014). Efforts to manage rhizosphere bacteria for sustainable agricultural systems should continue to focus on root cap and mucilage chemistry, and remnant roots as sources of beneficial bacteria.

AB The transboundary River Nestos in the Balkan Peninsula is a surface water resource shared by Hellas and Bulgaria. The Public Power Corporation of Hellas (DEH) proceeded to the dams' construction of Thesaurus in 1997 and Platanovrissi in 2000, to satisfy the increased needs for power production and irrigation in the Regions of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace in the Hellenic Territory. DEH following the Ministerial Agreement of the Hellenic Parliament "KYA 18492/19-09-1996'' funded a series of Research Projects concerned on the monitoring of the water quantity and quality data of Nestos from the Hellenic-Bulgarian borders to its estuaries in the Thracian sea. "PERSEAS'' Research Group from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, carried out the research, design, construction, installation, operation and maintenance of the "R.E.MO.S.'' (Remote Environmental MOnitoring System) networks. Three REMOS networks have been installed in the areas of (a) the River Nestos deltaic channel, (b) Thesaurus dam-lake in the intramountainous valley and (c) Potamoi (Despat) and Pagoneri (Nestos) villages close to the borders between Hellas and Bulgaria. They record water level (H), water and air temperature (T), water conductivity (ECw), Redox potential (RP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) on a 24h basis, since the beginning of the year 2000. The research carried out in this paper, is focused on the REMOS station in the final course of Nestos in the deltaic area. The continuous monitoring and the data analysis yield useful results for the quality and quantity of the hydrologic regime of Nestos after the dams' construction, as well as for the trends detected of the quality parameters (ECw, RP and DO) and the water level, using the nonparametric Spearman's criterion. The best fitted model of time trend, for each variable, was chosen. The statistical sample of each one of the quality variables consisted of about 1000 values based on daily measures on a three years monitoring program (1/1/2000-31/12/2002). Further research and analysis for the other network stations of REMOS should provide useful results for the sustainable management of the transboundary River Nestos.

AB Hypoxia is affecting thousands of square kilometers of water and has caused declines in fish populations and major changes in aquatic communities worldwide. For the first time, we report that hypoxia can affect sex differentiation and sex development of zebrafish (Danio rerio), leading to a male-biased population in the F1 generation (74.4% +/- 1.7% males in the hypoxic groups versus 61.9% +/- 1.6% males in the normoxic groups, n = 5; p < 0.05, chi(2) test). The increase in males was associated with downregulations of various genes controlling the synthesis of sex hormones (i.e., 3 beta-HSD, CYP11A, CYP19A, and CYP19B) as well as an increase in the testosterone/estradiol ratio. The male-dominated populations caused by hypoxia will have reduced reproductive success, thereby threatening the sustainability of natural fish populations.

AB A team comprising a former Russian policymaker and American analysts of the current Russian energy policy examines the course of that policy and its limitations during the post-Soviet period. In the process, they critically analyze key problems in Russia's oil, gas, coal, and electricity sectors that represent a potential drag on growth of the entire Russian economy and at the very least call into question the sustainability of further increases in exports to the West. The authors explore in considerable depth and detail both the factors underlying the recent increase in government intervention in the energy sector and the likely consequences for domestic production, consumption, resource security, and critical exports.

AB Old and new reflections regarding Mexico Valley's Metropolis are questioned, in order to discover new trends in urban development of the city .We assume the way in which we name the metropolis generates confusion. At the same time, there is an important transformation in the activities leading the economic development of the city. Services are taking the place that industrialization took for more than seventy years. currently adopting the leadership in the vision of the future of the postindustrial city. At the same time, natural and historical patrimonies are nowadays the main resources in order to revalue economic activities. Special mention has to be done to urban periphery, the place where growth and resources allow planning the sustainable city of the future.

AB Although quality has received significant attention during the last decades and its economic benefits are beyond any doubt, lots of questions have remained unanswered as to how much, when, and in what to invest to maintain sustainable competitive advantage. A model is introduced here to guide a firm in addressing these questions. The firm produces a single product and operates in a market where monopolistic competition is effective. Demand for the product in the industry depends on both price and performance quality. Increasing productivity knowledge decreases unit production cost, but demand for the company's product decreases over time, as competitors will be able to offer products with similar performance. Productivity and quality knowledge can be developed through induced and autonomous learning in order to strengthen company position. The paper provides an optimal control formulation of the problem and develops necessary conditions for optimality and characterizes the dynamics of optimal price, quality and investment decisions.

SO EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING

DT Article
AB Foundations often provide short-term seed funding to social service demonstration programs with the presumption that successful projects will be able to replace funding from other, often public, sources when their grants end. It is unclear whether this model actually works. This article explores the sustainability of foundation-funded projects-whether they can survive the loss of their initial funding and continue to operate. To do this, we focus on the Local Initiative Funding Partners Program (LIFP) of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF). After tracking the survival of 112 LIFP projects that ended their RWJF funding during the period 1986-2001, 92% survived at least 1 year, while 80% were still operating in 2002. Thirty-four percent of the projects were replicated by another organization. Project-related factors that contributed to survival include host organization support and strong project management that secures local philanthropic support, develops revenue-generating activities, builds up individual donor pools, capitalizes on technical assistance on fundraising, and disseminates stories of project success. Environmental factors include public awareness of the social problem and recognition of the project as a solution, external championship by community leaders, and the involvement of local funders.

DE theory of change; capacity building
AB Adopting a theory of change is imperative to promoting the building of organizational capacity and program sustainability. In efforts to help organizations develop strong theories of change that are meaningful, plausible, doable, and testable, the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation (EMCF) has designed and implemented 3-day-long theory of change workshops with grantees that create the foundation for subsequent business planning. On Day 1, workshop goals focus on clarifying basic strategic decisions that an organization has made, and defining target populations; On Day 2, goals include selecting and codifying program participant outcomes and indicators; and on Day 3, goals focus on designing and codifying program elements, taking stock of resources required to implement those elements, and clarifying organizational capacities necessary to implement and sustain the program and its delivery. This paper describes how these workshops are facilitated and also some capacity-building benefits to organizations participating in them. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this report, we present a case study of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Faith in Action grant initiative. Faith in Action was created to help meet the needs of people with chronic physical and mental disabilities by funding interfaith volunteer caregiving programs nationwide. Results from two evaluations of these programs are discussed. The first aimed to assess the programs' sustainability and characteristics associated with program survival. The second examined the success of technical assistance provided to the programs. Findings from the studies indicate links between program survival and specific program practices, concerning volunteers and the coalition operating budget. Particularly important were diversity of funding sources, diversity of volunteer services provided, governing bodies that are both supportive and active, adequate supervision and training of volunteers, and directors with relevant prior experience.

AB Asia is an important region in terms of fish trade supplying nearly 60% of global fish production. The region's coastal fisheries play a critical role in ensuring food Security and providing livelihoods, particularly for poorer sections of the community. This paper introduces a regional initiative in which eight Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam) undertook simultaneous, multi-disciplinary assessments of their coastal fisheries. The Outputs of this initiative are presented in the next four papers of this volume of Fisheries Research. The assessments have highlighted two disturbing regional trends: coastal fisheries resources are severely depleted, biological and economic overfishing is occurring throughout the region. These are symptoms of the lack of effective management of fishing capacity in the region.
   This overview paper highlights the urgent need to reduce fishing capacity in the region. Only through such capacity reduction strategies can fish stocks be rebuilt to more productive and sustainable levels so that potential economic and social benefits from fisheries can be realized. Strategies need to be country- and fishery-specific and should focus on the development of effective access and property-rights regimes. For instance, countries need to explicitly allocate rights between small-scale and industrial fisheries, where resources are shared. This will require an understanding of the overlap between the sectors in terms of resource use and also the relative economic and social benefits from each sector. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

ID RAPID APPRAISAL TECHNIQUE
AB A multidisciplinary comparative evaluation of the "health" or sustainability status of 26 major Red Sea fisheries from 5 countries was performed using 44 scored attributes in ecological, economic, social, technological and ethical fields. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique ("Rapfish") was employed to visualize the status of the fisheries for each evaluation field. Comparisons were made among the countries bordering the Red Sea coast, between artisanal and industrial fisheries, and between west and east coast fisheries. Monte Carlo re-sampling was used to analyze uncertainty. Leverage analysis examined the sensitivity of status results to each attribute in the five evaluation fields. Lack of reliable fisheries stock assessment data is not unusual in many tropical countries; however, this paper demonstrates that the approximate relative status of fisheries can be obtained using attributes which are relatively easy to score in a transparent fashion with defined uncertainty.

ID ABUNDANCE
AB In the high seas of the North Pacific, large-scale squid driftnet fisheries targeted the autumn cohort of neon flying squid (Ominastrephes bartramii) from May to mid-September. Total annual catches during 1982-1992 ranged from 102,000 to 209,000 t (149,000 t on average). To assess the effect of intensive commercial driftnet fishing on this cohort, we assessed the stock based on past driftnet fishing data. We used three different methods to estimate stock size during the high fishing season (July) for the driftnet fishing ground between 170 degrees E and 145 degrees W during 1982-1992. We found remarkable agreement in average stock estimates based on the three methods, with estimates of 380,000 t by the swept area method, 367,000 t by the DeLury method, and 333,000 t by the non-equilibrium surplus-production method. Of the three estimates, the swept area estimate was likely to be the most reliable because of the more realistic assumptions and reduced uncertainty of parameters in this method. The relative fishing mortality F/F-MSY derived from the production model was 0.8-1.2, which was around the appropriate (maximum sustainable yield) fishing level (1.0), even during 1987-1990 when catches were large. The proportional escapement (number of squid alive at the end of the fishing season as a proportion of those that would have been alive had there been no fishing) was 18-64%, with an average of 42%, which was around the management target of 40%, even during this period. Thus, the large-scale driftnet fishery is considered to have been sustainable. Possible adverse effects of the driftnet fishery on food webs in the North Pacific are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Spatial measures of forest biomass are important to implement sustainable forest management, monitor global change, and model forest productivity. Several methods for estimating forest biomass by remote sensing have been developed, but their comparative advantages have not been evaluated for large areas in Canada. This study compares four methods to map forest biomass on an extended pilot region (20,000 km(2)) located in western Newfoundland. The methods include: (i) Direct Radiometric Relationships (DRR), (ii) k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), (iii) Land Cover Classification (LCC), and (iv) Biomass from Cluster Labeling Using Structure and Type (BioCLUST). The results of each method were evaluated using an independent set of ground survey plots and compared with a baseline biomass map generated from biomass tables applied to forest inventory stand maps. Considering the root mean square error (RMSE) assessed with the inventory plots. the DRR, k-NN, and BioCLUST methods provided similar results, with average RMSE values of 59. 59. and 58 t/ha, respectively. Bias values were lowest for the k-NN method followed by DRR, BioCLUST, and LCC (6, -8, 17, and 42 t/ha, respectively). Assessed with the baseline map, the BioCLUST method produced the lowest RMSE (41 t/ha) and bias (-4 t/ha) followed by the DRR and k-NN methods, with RMSE values of 47 and 54 t/ha and bias values of 9 and 23 t/ha, respectively. The method using biomass tables applied on the classified TM image (LCC) provided the greatest RMSE and bias, but may be suitable for applications that do not require a high level of precision. The BioCLUST and LCC methods provided practical advantages for the type of data sets available. Overall, the choice of a method rests on both the availability of data sets and the level of precision of the results required. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Tropical montane forests have been recognised as having global conservation importance. However, they are being rapidly destroyed in many regions of the world. Our study focuses on the rate of loss and patterns of fragmentation in tropical montane forests in the Highlands of Chiapas, Mexico, during a 25-year period. Data from Landsat satellite imagery from 1975 (MSS), 1990 (TM) and 2000 (ETM+) were used to ascertain annual deforestation rates of 1.3 and 4.8% for the 1975-1990 and 1990-2000 periods, respectively. Spatial patterns of forest fragmentation were identified using selected landscape indices. Increases in the number of forest fragments (3520-10,542), patch density (1.0-3.2 patches/100 ha), and total edge length (24,781-38,400 km) were associated with decreases in the mean patch size (65.0-8.7 ha), largest patch index (60.7-4.0%), total core area (99,422-9,611 ha), and mean proximity index (10 1,369-1405). The observed trends indicate increasing deforestation and fragmentation, particularly during the 1990-2000 period. Circa 50% of the forest cover in the Highlands has been lost in 25 years, and a proportion of the remaining forests have been degraded as a result of human use. Increasing human population and a more demanding use of soils for agriculture and timber arise as the major causes of deforestation in the study area. We suggest that conservation efforts should be focused on the management of the natural system and the management of the external influences on it, particularly the detection of hotspots, passive and active restoration and sustainable forest exploitation by the local indigenous communities.

AB Sustainable management systems for tropical forests require information on tree growth. Generally, growth rates of commercial tropical tree species are derived from repeated measurements in permanent sample plots. Here, we present an alternative method: the use of tree ring analysis. It has some important advantages over plot studies.
   The aims of this study were (1) to demonstrate how tree ring analysis can be helpful to tropical forest management and (2) to evaluate future timber yields under Bolivian forestry legislation. To this end, we collected stem discs of 17-60 harvested trees of each of four commercial tree species in the Bolivian Amazon and reconstructed their lifetime growth trajectories through ring measurements.
   Using ring analysis, we calculated age estimates of harvested trees and size distributions of potential crop trees for the next harvest. Timber yields at the next harvest were estimated by projecting ingrowth of trees to harvestable sizes during a cutting cycle of 20 years (as set by Bolivian regulations) using the growth data obtained from tree ring analysis. This was done in two ways: by looking forward and project ingrowth in 20 years based on densities of trees below the minimum cutting size ("prospective analysis"), and by looking backwards using densities of trees above the harvest limit to calculate their size 20 years ago ("retrospective analysis"). Both methods yielded low recuperation of initially harvested volume for all four species (generally 20-30%). Thus, initial timber yields of our study species cannot be sustained with a logging cycle of 20 years.
   We discuss the advantages of tree ring analysis over growth rates obtained from permanent sample plot data. First, age estimates are calculated directly - not based on simulations - and are therefore more accurate. Second, growth rates obtained from ring data of canopy trees are representative for those trees that successfully reached the canopy, and do not include the probably slower-growing individuals that are less likely to reach the canopy. Third, the lifetime growth patterns obtained from ring data allow for accurate assessment of variation among trees in long-term growth and incorporating this intra-specific long-term growth variation resulted in higher and more accurate estimates of timber yield.
   Finally, we argue that ring analysis should be added to the toolbox of research methods for tropical forest management, but without substituting the monitoring of permanent sample plots, which provides relevant information on forest structure, damage and growth rates of non-ring forming tree species.

AB Understanding the effect of canopy structure on the understory light environment is useful in the design of silvicultural strategies that facilitate sustainable tree recruitment. To address this need, a study was designed to quantify the relationship between forest structure and light along a gradient of 50-100% canopy cover. The gradient was created by applying I of 4 midstory removal treatments to each of fifty 0.05 ha plots located within a mixed-hardwood riparian forest corridor. The light environment was directly quantified with a linear ceptometer and regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and various metrics of vertical and horizontal structure. Vertical sighting tube estimates of canopy cover (R-2 = 0.73), light estimates derived from hemispherical photography (R-2 = 0.70), and spherical densiometer estimates of canopy closure (R-2 = 0.68) were the best single predictors of understory light transmittance. Including top height and tree density improved the fit of canopy cover based models (R-2 = 0.80). Canopy closure estimates derived from hemispherical photography generally showed a weaker relationship with PAR than other measures of stand structure. Further, the strength of this relationship depended upon photo analysis angle. In general, the vertical component of stand structure seems to influence light transmittance through the forest canopy. This vertical complexity must be addressed when evaluating structure-light relations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The national forest strategy provided a model for Canada's international support for sustainable development, which later resulted in the development of a national biodiversity strategy. Adaptive management is a preferred approach for implementing such policies where incomplete knowledge and the highly variable dynamics associated with natural ecosystems are challenges. While the concept of adaptive management is embedded in various policies, complete implementation is only beginning in Canada. Case studies on adaptive management frameworks focusing on conservation and sustainable management of forest biodiversity compare how information has been integrated across spatial scales, jurisdictions and sectors of activity. To monitor progress in sustainable forest management, the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers established a framework of criteria and indicators in 1995. The potential for criteria and indicators reporting to drive cross-scale adaptive management of Canada's biological resources is discussed.

AB The high functional and unmatched biological diversity represented by arthropods demand that these organisms be considered as ecological indicators of sustainable forest management. Successful use of arthropods in this capacity win require a systematic and rigorous process, including selection of potential indicators, definition of relationships between indicators and disturbance variables, optimization of the useful range of the indicator and application of the indicator(s) in monitoring. In Canada, the single greatest impediment to the use of arthropods as ecological indicators is the importance of accurate species-level identification and the difficulty achieving it. Consequently, most work has focused on a few relatively well-known groups (e.g., epigacic carabid and staphylinid beetles and spiders, saproxylic beetles, butterflies and larger night flying moths). Many recent studies have provided baseline data about the range of natural variation and have begun to quantify arthropod responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the context of preplanned experiments or through various retrospective approaches. Carabid beetles are the best-studied group and sufficient sets of data now exist to permit a meta-analysis of the robustness of carabids as indicators across multiple spatial scales and in terms of how well they represent broader ecological responses to disturbances. There is good potential to incorporate arthropod indicators into monitoring programs in Canada, but it is necessary to first complete a scientifically credible selection process for specific ecological indicators. Future research should focus on completing the process for taxa under current study as this develops the best presently understood opportunities for using arthropod indicators in assessing various aspects of environmental change. Researchers should also consider other means of monitoring arthropod biodiversity by the use of surrogate ecological parameters such as ecological land classification and habitat classification systems.

AB Forested lands in southern Ontario are threatened by a myriad of demands. In order to capture the multi-scale, multi-use and multifunction reality of forests within such intense human-nature interdependent landscapes, an integrative approach to sustainable forest management is necessary. Such forest management may be possible by combining the framework of landscape ecology with an understanding of forest multifunctionality. Within the Greater Toronto Area, the management of forests is provided by several agencies; some are responsible for 1) geological landscapes (e.g., the Niagara Escarpment), 2) for watersheds (e.g., Conservation Authorities) and 3) for political regions (e.g., York Region). In this paper, case studies reflecting important management issues are introduced. Wildlife research is then presented to link these issues to landscape ecology and forest multifunctionality in order to illustrate a means of enhancing sustainable forest management.

DE Criteria and Indicators; business case; sustainable forest management;
   certification; land use planning; forest industry
AB While forest companies in British Columbia have been active in the development and implementation of Criteria and Indicators (C&I) in planning for sustainable forest management, in many cases they are not yet considered to be a core business function. A business case for C&I means going beyond the current paradigm of meeting legislative requirements and identifying C&I for sustainable forest management strictly within the context of certification. Without a comprehensive business case that articulates how C&I programs affect a company's position in the market place in terms of measurable benefits, costs and exposure to risk, activities essential to sustaining the broad range of forestry-related socio-economic and ecological values may not get the prioritization and resources needed. Quantifying costs and benefits will help define how forest companies will most effectively meet their sustainable forest management objectives and identify opportunities for partnerships with government, First Nations, stakeholders and other companies in the collective management of the forest resource. Although some companies have begun to develop approaches to the business case for C&I, more work is needed in integrating the objectives and activities of SFM planning into the basic day-to-day operations of a company as well as providing training to resource managers to communicate in the language of business. Government should adopt and encourage a C&I business case approach to forest resource management by developing strong links to legislative and land use planning requirements.

TI Challenges for forest conservation in Gabon, central Africa
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
ID WILDLIFE POPULATIONS; RAIN-FOREST; EXTINCTION; IMPACTS; RESERVE
AB In recent decades, large expanses of tropical rainforest in central and western Africa have been cleared, logged, fragmented, and overhunted. In contrast, extensive forest in Gabon has survived in a relatively intact condition because the country has a sparse population and substantial petroleum and mineral deposits that have reduced economic pressures on forests. Unfortunately, Gabon's petroleum reserves are dwindling. As a direct result, industrial logging is expanding rapidly; nearly half of the country's forest is currently in timber leases, and this could increase to over 75% of the remaining forest during the next decade. Mechanized logging has important ecological impacts on forests, but the most severe effects are indirect, because loggers create labyrinths of roads that greatly increase access to forests for hunters and slash-and-burn farmers. Declines of forest wildlife from overhunting have been severe in much of tropical Africa, and are likely to rise sharply in Gabon as physical accessibility to forests increases.
   The Gabonese government is eager to consider afternative strategies to augment economic development, including promotion of an ecotourism industry. This commitment is evidenced by the government's recent designation of 13 new national parks that comprise over a tenth of the country's land area. Efforts to develop ecotourism face substantial challenges, however, including the high profitability of exploitative land uses like logging, the illegal encroachment of loggers and hunters into nature reserves, political instability in the surrounding region, and limited infrastructure for tourism. Nevertheless, these and other efforts to promote more-sustainable development should be strongly supported, as Gabonese forests have among the highest levels of species diversity and endemism in tropical Africa and are likely to play a critical future role in biodiversity conservation.

ID PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE; BIODIVERSITY; INDICATORS; POLICY
AB Fire has been a significant force in the evolution of ecosystems since the beginning of life on earth, and has occupied a powerful role in shaping the physical and natural world as we experience it today. Historically, human societies have both feared fire as a natural, destructive force, and used fire to social and technological ends. Indeed, the harnessing of fire by human societies represents one of the most profound changes in the ability of humans to achieve mastery and dominance over the natural world, increasing their safety and well-being. However, the future of fire is uncertain. The great landscape-scale fires that have shaped the natural environment can no longer be allowed to exist. Once thriving on vast uninhabited tracts of forests and grasslands, their existence is now an anatherna to the communities that checkerboard most of our national forests. Like threatened and endangered species in the ecological realm, large-scale fire itself is becoming extinct due to intrusions of human habitation into the very forests that provide (lie fuel for its existence. Modern fire rarely exhibits the qualities of historical fire with its enormous releases of energy, rapid spread, and long duration. When it does, the results are deemed calastrophic and sociopolitical forces intervene to prevent its reoccurrence. Yet, ecosystems are dependent on fire for their vitality and sustainability, creating a conflict between the needs of nature and the fears of human societies. What is the future of a purposive role for fire in ecosystems? How can fire as a historical force continue to play a similar role in the future? This paper examines the relationship between humans and fire, and explores its meanin for how we will make decisions about fire's future as both a property of nature and as a tool for human development.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION
AB Rural, resource-poor communities currently face a number of stressors that curtail livelihood options and reduce overall quality of life. Climate stress in southern Africa could potentially further threaten the livelihoods of such communities. Inappropriate response and adaptation options to risks, including climate stress, could further undermine development efforts in the region. The design and effective implementation of strategies to improve coping and adaptation to possible future risks cannot be undertaken without a detailed assessment of current response options to various risks. By using the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework, this pilot study identifies some of the strategies and constraints to secure livelihoods that are currently being used by small-scale farmers in the Muden area of KwaZulu-Natal. The role and perception of climate risks in relation to a variety of other constraints and risks in the area are also examined. Health status, lack of information and ineffective institutional structures and processes are shown to be some of the key factors aggravating current response options and overall development initiatives with potential negative outcomes for future adaptation to periods of possible heightened climate stress.

AB The article focuses on the use of climate change vulnerability assessments in a local decision-making context, with particular reference to recent studies in Norway. We focus on two aspects of vulnerability assessments that we see as key to local decision-making: first, the information generated through the assessments themselves, and second, the institutional linkages to local level decision-making processes. Different research approaches generate different types of data. This is rarely made explicit, yet it has important implications for decision-making. In addressing these challenges we propose a dialectic approach based on exchange, rather than integration of data from different approaches. The focus is on process over product, and on the need for anchoring vulnerability assessments in local decision-making processes. In conclusion, we argue that there is unlikely to be one single 'correct' assessment tool or indicator model to make vulnerability assessments matter at a local level. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; PRIVATIZATION
AB Despite the proliferation of private regulatory regimes as instruments for global governance, we know little about the operations or effectiveness of these regimes at the national level. This is particularly true in developing countries where these programs are expected to have their greatest impact. This paper examines why it is that in two nations that share several proper-ties believed to support private forms of environmental regulation, the effectiveness of one prominent global program, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), should vary so dramatically. Findings indicate that differences in three variables that often support successful private regulation-domestic and foreign market demand, the influence of transnational actors, and state endorsement-do not adequately account for this variation. Instead, factors that promote the supply of local programs have strongly influenced the effectiveness of the FSC in these nations, particularly the social resources and political strategies utilized by program administrators.

AB The Republic of Ireland is characterised by few urban conurbations and a high rural population, including significant numbers of island dwellers. Information communication technologies (ICT), including telemedicine, present opportunities to address rural health-service delivery issues. As in other Countries, the recent National Health Information Strategy is regarded as pivotal to the modernisation of the Irish healthcare system. There is, however, a dearth of research about telemedicine in Ireland. This paper reports, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic review of telemedicine in the two regional healthboards in the Republic of Ireland. Details of I I telemedicine services, all initiated by local policy, will be presented. Results of an interview study with service providers about their experiences of the practices and processes involved in telemedicine service delivery are also provided. The focus of our analysis is two-fold. We assess the resonance of these Irish data with the international literature with particular reference to a recently developed model for the normalisation of telemedicine. For the first time, this model which was developed in the United Kingdom is applied to a fresh set of empirical data in a different healthcare context. We then discuss a number of health information policy issues for Ireland and elsewhere arising from our analysis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Without access to energy services, people are destined to live in poverty. The provision of such services is a key ingredient to providing a sustainable way of living for all the world's population. This article first outlines the significance of access to energy services in the poverty debate. Secondly, this article considers what strategies have so far been adopted by states to confront this issue and the difficulties that such initiatives have encountered. Against this background, the final section makes the case for access to energy services as a human right and commences the task of providing a content for such a right.

ID LAW LITIGATION
AB Though it has a relatively brief history in Central and Eastern Europe, public interest litigation (PIL) has contributed significantly to the consolidation of the rule of law. PIL faces numerous obstacles in the post-Communist region, including inadequate legal aid; a limited pro bono publico tradition; and rules of procedure and judicial practice that are unreceptive to joint claims, proof of systemic problems, and equitable remedies. This article reviews the development of PIL, surveys the challenges, and offers concrete recommendations for donors and others concerned to foster sustainable and effective PIL in the future.

AB Quantitative estimation of water quality and its relationships with management activities is a necessary step in efficient water resources management. However, water quality is typically defined in abstract terms and management activities are rarely quantified with respect to their impact on lake water quality. Here we show by demonstration of systems for Lake Kinneret, Israel and the Naroch Lakes of Belarus how water quality can be quantified in relation to lake management activities to be a part of sustainable management.

AB This study investigates the dynamic nature of rainfall observed at the Sustainable Agriculture Fanning Systems (SAFS) site in California's Sacramento Valley, which was established to study the benefits of winter cover cropping in Mediterranean irrigated-arid systems. Rainfall data of four different temporal scales (i.e. daily, weekly, biweekly, and monthly) are analysed to determine the dynamic nature of precipitation in time. In an and climate with seasonal precipitation this has large implications for land and water management, both in the short term and in the long term. A nonlinear dynamic technique (correlation dimension method) that uses the phase-space reconstruction and dimension concepts is employed. Bearing in mind the possible effects of the presence of zeros (i.e. no rain) on the outcomes of this analysis, an attempt is also made to compare the dynamic nature of all-year rainfall and winter rainfall. Analysis of 15 years of data suggests that rainfall dynamics at this site are dominated by a large number of variables, regardless of the scales and seasons studied. The dimension results also sua-est that: (1) rainfall dynamics at coarser resolutions are more irregular than that at finer resolutions; (2) winter rainfall has a higher variability than all-year rainfall. These results are indeed useful to gain information about the complexity of the rainfall process at this site with respect to (temporal) scales and seasons and, hence, the appropriate model (high-dimensional) type. However, in view of the potential effects of certain rainfall data characteristics (e.g. zeros, measurement errors, scale effects) on the correlation dimension analysis, the discussion also emphasizes the need for further verification, and possibly confirmation, of these results.

AB Environmental resources have made a substantial contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction in Asia. Natural assets, such as fertile soils, rivers and forests, are often critical for the livelihoods of poor people, This article shows how resourceintensive development in Asia has been achieved at significant environmental cost. Environmental problems such as deforestation, pressure on water supplies, and pollution from industry place real limits on further economic growth and increase the region's already high vulnerability to natural disasters. The challenge for governments and policy makers is to use natural wealth to generate growth and enable poor people to benefit from this growth, while at the same time sustaining its capacity to produce these benefits in the future. The article argues that progress can be advanced through international partnerships which build on existing initiatives in a number of areas including climate change, sustainable forestry and fishing, disaster preparedness and pro-poor conservation.

TI Urbanisation, sustainable growth and poverty reduction in Asia
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB One in three people in Asia live in urban areas. The urban population is growing fast. This article identifies some of the challenges presented by urbanisation in relation to land use, the projected growth of slums (839 million people by 2020), provision for shelter, infrastructure provision, social services and low incomes, Poor living conditions undermine efforts to tackle poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals, but some Asian countries have found innovative urban development solutions - the challenge partly lies in scaling-up, adapting and mainstreaming these innovations. A recurring feature is the need to generate locally rooted information with which to plan, negotiate and monitor urban development solutions, and to integrate these into national strategies and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. The importance of working partnerships between the urban poor, local government and other stakeholders is also recognised, The article makes a number of recommendations to Asian governments and donors to improve urban development processes, particularly highlighting the need for donors to support financial mechanisms that both increase capital financing for urban development and create opportunities for working partnerships to be formed.

ID FUEL-CELL; SYSTEM
AB Multiport DC-DC converters are of potential interest in applications such as generation systems utilising multiple sustainable energy sources. A family of multiport bidirectional DC-DC converters derived from a general topology is presented. The topology shows a combination of DC-link and magnetic coupling. This structure makes use of both methods to interconnect multiple sources without the penalty of extra conversion or additional switches. The resulting converters have the advantage of being simple in topology and have a minimum number of power devices. The proposed general topology and basic cells show several possibilities to construct a multiport converter for particular applications and provide a solution to integrate diverse sources owing to their flexibility in structure. The system features a minimal number of conversion steps, low cost and compact packaging. In addition, the control and power management of the converter by a single digital processor is possible. The centralised control eliminates complicated communication structures that would be necessary in the conventional structure based on separate conversion stages. A control strategy based on classical control theory is proposed, showing a multiple PID-loop structure. The general topology and a set of three-port embodiments are detailed.

AB In this letter, we utilize a self-terminated oxide polish (STOP) planarization technique to fabricate high-yield, high-performance, low-cost, and uncooled 1.3-mu m ridge-waveguide AlGaInAs-InP laser diodes (LDs). The STOP technique is superior to the polyimide planarization, which suffers from high-temperature sustainability. The LDs fabricated by the STOP technique exhibit threshold currents of 8.5 and 30.5 mA, and light output powers of 25.9 and 4.8 mW at 100 mA for 20 degrees C and 110 degrees C, respectively. The characteristic temperatures (To) are 82.6 K from -30 degrees C to 80 degrees C and 55.9 K from 80 degrees C to 110 degrees C. Since the metal pad lies on a thick SiO2 layer, the parasitic capacitance can be effectively lowered to 2 pF. The 3-dB modulation bandwidths of the LDs at 50 mA are 12.1 and 9.44 GHz at 20 degrees C and 90 degrees C, respectively.

AB This paper focuses on power pools in Africa: status, plans of action, further developments, and recommendations. First, the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) formation, current status, and future challenges are addressed. Then the Central Africa Power Pool (CAPP), the economic community of Central African States (ECCAS), and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is examined. CAPP is a new sub-regional institution, created in Brazzaville in April 2003, under the auspices of ECCAS that is presently the focal point for discussions on regional power markets, particularly as the Ingar hydropower complex when developed could generate close to 40 GW. Security issues of power system interconnections in Africa are then reviewed. Also discussed is the current status and developments of the West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) and the East Africa Power Pool (EAPP). Also considered is Hydropower and African Grid Development in relation to a rights-based perspective. Finally, the future of SAPP, CAPP, WAPP, and EAPP is examined.

AB Discovery learning in mathematics in the domain of probability based on hands-on experiments is normally limited because of the difficulty in providing sufficient materials and data volume in terms of repetitions of the experiments. Our cooperative, computational modelling and simulation environment engages students and teachers in composing and simulating stochastic experiments, e.g. throwing dice or drawing balls, playing lottery games. It also facilitates validation and presentation. Engaging teachers in the design process led to the complementary development and evaluation of several learning activities in German secondary schools. Evaluating the results of our action research work indicated the potential of our approach for expanding traditional mathematics instruction when assisting students to develop a sustainable conceptual basis of probability principles, offering them a higher degree of responsibility for their learning.

AB Analytical and numerical solutions are presented for steady evaporating flow in open microchannels having a rectangular cross section and a uniform depth. The flow, driven by the axial gradient of capillary pressure, generally consists of an entry region where the meniscus is attached to the top corners of the channel followed by a jump-like transition to a corner-flow region in which the meniscus progressively recedes into the bottom corners of the channel. Illustrative numerical solutions are used to guide the derivation of an easily applied analytical approximation for the maximum sustainable heat flux or capillary limit. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Flow management systems such as supply chain (SC) systems involve multiple operators managing elements of automation. The success of such multi-operator multi-automation systems depends not only on individual operator's appropriate use of automation, but also on cooperation between operators. Inappropriate reliance on automation may be a critical factor hindering cooperation and sharing automation-related information may improve reliance and promote cooperation. A computational model was developed to investigate how individual operator's use of automation influences cooperation between individuals. The model consists of an extension of the decision field theory [Busemeyer, J.R., Townsend, JT., 1993. Decision field theory: a dynamic cognitive approach to decision making in an uncertain environment. Psychological Review 100(3), 432-459] that simulates the dynamics of an individual's trust and reliance on automation and a game theoretic framework that simulates the dynamics of cooperation between individuals in an iterated Prisoners' Dilemma game. Simulation experiments with this model were conducted to test the following hypotheses in the context of a two-manufacturer one-retailer SC system: (1) inappropriate use of automation will hinder cooperation; (2) sharing information regarding the performance of automation will directly improve reliance on automation and reduce unintentional competitive behavior; and (3) sharing information regarding the reliance on automation will lead to a more charitable interpretation of the other's intent to cooperate or compete and therefore promote cooperation. The simulation results show that inappropriate reliance on automation undermines cooperation and sharing information of automation performance and reliance improves cooperation. The degree of improvement in cooperation by sharing such information is greatest in situations in which automation recovers from faults.
   Relevance to industry
   Promoting cooperation is important for decentralized systems such as SCs where inappropriate use of automation may undermine cooperation. This paper shows how reliance on automation influences cooperation and how sharing automation-related information mediates this influence. The results suggest some ways to promote sustainable cooperation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, Col.; Chrysomelidae) is an alien invasive species in Europe. It is a univoltine species with eggs that overwinter in the soil and larvae that hatch in spring. Three larval instars feed on maize roots, which can cause plant lodging and yield loss of economic importance. Adults emerge between mid-June and early August and can reduce yields through intensive silk feeding. In order to provide a thorough understanding of the population dynamics of this invasive pest species in the invaded European region, complete age specific life-tables were constructed in two maize fields in southern Hungary assessing the significance of natural mortality factors acting on D. v. virgifera populations. This information provides a rational basis for devising sustainable integrated pest management programmes, in particular, by enabling the identification of vulnerable pest age intervals for the timely application of various management tools. The life-table for D. v. virgifera in Europe resulted in a total mortality of about 99% from the egg stage in the autumn to the emergence of adult females in the following year (K-Total = 2.48), which is comparable with North America. The highest reduction of D. v. virgifera numbers resulted from the mortality in first instar larvae (94% marginal death rate) and from the unrealized fecundity (80%). However, only the variation in mortality between years can change the generational mortality and thus influence population growth. High variation in the marginal death rate between fields and years was found in the second and third instar larval stages, and in the overwintering egg stage. These mortality factors therefore have the potential to cause changes in the total generational mortality. Furthermore, the life-table suggested that a high fecundity could compensate for a high generational mortality and would lead to population increase.

AB Background: Heart failure (HF) is responsible for significant disease burden in developed countries internationally. Despite significant advances and a strong evidence base in therapies and treatment strategies for HF, access to these therapies continues to remain elusive to a significant proportion of the HF population. The reasons for this are multifactorial and range from the financial cost of treatments to the individual attitudes and beliefs of clinicians. The collaborative methodology, based upon a quality improvement philosophy, has been identified as a potentially useful tool to address this treatment gap. Aim: In this manuscript, we review the published literature on the collaborative methodology and assess the evidence for achieving improvement in the management of HF. Methods: Searches of electronic databases, the reference lists of published materials, policy documents, and the Internet were conducted using key words including "collaborative methodology," "breakthrough series," "quality improvement," "total quality improvement," and "heart failure." Because of the paucity of high-level evidence, all English-language articles were included in the review. Results: On the basis of the identified search strategy, 43 articles were retrieved. Key themes that emerged from the literature included the following: (1) The collaborative methodology has a significant potential to reduce the treatment gap. (2) Leadership is an important characteristic of the collaborative method. (3) The collaborative methodology facilitates sustainability of the quality improvement process. Conclusion: The collaborative methodology, when implemented and conducted according to key conceptual principles, has significant potential to improve the outcomes of patients, particularly those with HF and chronic cardiovascular disease.

AB Aims and objectives. The main aim of this study was to improve the quality of nursing care for older acutely ill hospitalized medical patients through developing, implementing and evaluating a new model of care using a participatory action research process.
   Background. One of the challenges of nursing today is to meet the health-care needs of the growing older population. It is important to consider what quality of nursing care means to older patients if nurses are to address gaps between their own perceptions and those of older patients themselves and to consider conceptual models of care appropriate for older patients care in order to improve the quality of care provided.
   Design. This study is a mixed method triangulated study, involving the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods through participatory action research methodology to establish an evidence-base for an evolving model of care.
   Methods. The model was tested on 60 acutely ill patients aged at least 65 years. The medical ward nurses selected a key reference group including the researcher to facilitate the participatory action research process to develop, implement and evaluate a new model of care based on Orem's self-care model incorporating the Nurses Improving Care to Health System Elders Faculty (Am J Nurs 1994; 94:21) medication protocol to improve the nursing care provided for acutely ill older patients.
   Results. The participatory action research process resulted in improved heath-care outcomes for the patients, such as significant improvements in activities of daily living capabilities between admission to discharge, significant improvements in knowledge levels regarding their medication regimes, as well as increased satisfaction with nursing care activities as perceived by older patients and nursing staff. The implementation of educational sessions during the model of care improved the older patient's functional activities and knowledge levels of their medication regime prior to discharge. In addition, by repeatedly explaining procedures, nurses became more involved with their individual patient's care, developing a patient-centred care relationship based on Orem's self-care model.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrates the efficacy of a new model of nursing care in improving the quality of nursing care for older patients in the acute medical ward setting.
   Relevance to clinical practice. This study is significant because of its evidence-base and demonstrates how the participatory action research process empowered nurses to make sustainable changes to their practice. The nurses in the study wanted to affect change. The planned change was not dictated by management, but was driven by the clinical nursing staff at the 'grass roots' level. Therefore, being involved in the decision-making process provided an incentive to actively implement change.

AB Tansley's ecosystem concept remains a vital framework for ecological research in part because the approach facilitates interdisciplinary analyses of ecological systems.
   Features of the Hawaiian Islands - particularly the nearly orthogonal variation in many of the factors that control variation among ecosystems elsewhere - make the archipelago a useful model system for interdisciplinary research designed to understand fundamental controls on the state and dynamics of ecosystems, and their consequences for human societies.
   Analyses of rain forest sites arrayed on a substrate age gradient from c. 300 years to over 4 million years across the Hawaiian archipelago demonstrate that the sources of calcium and other essential cations shift from > 80% rock-derived in young sites to > 80% derived from marine aerosol on substrates older than 100 000 years. Rock-derived phosphorus is retained longer within ecosystems, but eventually long-distance transport of continental dust from Asia becomes the most important source of phosphorus.
   A biogeochemical feedback from low nutrient availability to efficient resource use by trees to slow decomposition and nutrient regeneration accentuates the geochemically driven pattern of low phosphorus availability and phosphorus limitation to net primary productivity in the oldest site.
   Variations in ecosystem biogeochemistry across the archipelago shaped the development and sustainability of Polynesian agricultural systems in the millennium between their discovery of Hawai'i and contact by Europeans. Irrigated pondfields were largely confined to stream valleys on the older islands, while rain-fed dryland systems occupied a narrow zone of fertile, well-watered soils on the younger islands.
   The ecosystem approach often represents the most appropriate level of organization for analyses of human influences on ecological systems; it can play a central role in the design and analysis of alternative agricultural, industrial and residential systems that could reduce the human footprint on the Earth.

TI Eco-efficiency in extended supply chains: A case study of furniture

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English

DE eco-efficiency; environmental performance; value performance; extended
   supply chain
ID MANAGEMENT
AB This paper presents a methodology about how eco-efficiency in extended supply chains (ESCs) can be understood and measured. The extended supply chain includes all processes in the life cycle of a product and the eco-efficiency is measured as the relative environmental and value performance in one ESC compared to other ESCs.
   The paper is based on a case study of furniture production in Norway. Nine different environmental performance indicators are identified. These are based on suggestions from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and additional indicators that are shown to have significant impacts in the life cycle of the products. Value performance is measured as inverse life cycle costs.
   The eco-efficiency for six different chair models is calculated and the relative values are shown graphically in XY-diagrams. This provides information about the relative performance of the products, which is valuable in green procurement processes.
   The same method is also used for analysing changes in eco-efficiency when possible alterations in the ESC are introduced. Here, it is shown that a small and realistic change of end-of-life treatment significantly changes the eco-efficiency of a product. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Low-temperature or psychrophilic (< 20 degrees C) anaerobic biological treatment of simple industrial wastewaters has recently been proven feasible as an alternative to more expensive mesophilic (ca. 37 degrees C) technology. We implemented novel expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB)-based bioreactor designs for 27 psychrophilic anaerobic digestion (PAD) trials for the treatment of a broad range of simple and complex synthetic wastewaters representing dairy, food-processing and pharmaceutical sector effluents. A variety of operating parameters, such as hydraulic retention time, organic and volumetric loading rates and upflow velocity, were tested. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies were recorded, which were comparable to previous mesophilic trials. Specific methanogenic activity, toxicity and biodegradability batch assays were employed to monitor the metabolic capabilities of microbial consortia in anaerobic reactors. The prevalence of psychrotolerant communites was observed and psychrophilic populations were detected in two of the reactors. The potential of PAD with respect to global sustainable development is discussed.

AB The increasing demand on primary energy and the increasing concern on climatic change demand immediately a sustainable development, but still there remain open questions regarding its technical realization. The second law of thermodynamics is a very simple but efficient way to define the principle design rules of sustainable technologies in minimizing the irreversible entropy production. The ideal, but real process chain is defined by a still reversible structure or logic of the process chain-the reversible reference process chain-but consisting of real components with an irreversible entropy production on a certain level. It can easily be shown for energy conversion and for transportation that hybridization in general can indeed be a measure to meet the reversible process chain and to minimize the entropy flow to the environment. Fuel cells are principal reversible converters of chemical energy and thus a key element within hybridization. Depending on application, combined heat and power process (CHP) may be a hybridization step or only a slight improvement. There is a fundamental difference in heating a house or in supplying an endothermic chemical reaction with reaction entropy. The use of heat recovery and isolation is a necessary measure to minimize the entropy flow to the environment and can be described by a reversible reference process as well. The application of reversible reference process chains shows that hybrid systems with fuel cells are a technical feasibility to approach very closely the thermodynamic potential. This development differs from the past where the technical possibilities of materials and manufacturing limited the technology to meet reversibility and thus sustainability.

TI Adaptive formation control for rovers traveling over unknown terrains
SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID MULTIPLE SPACECRAFT; MOBILE ROBOTS; ARCHITECTURE; VEHICLES; FEEDBACK
AB A novel adaptive formation-control strategy for a group of rovers navigating over unknown terrain is presented. A leader-follower formation control architecture is employed. Direct adaptive control laws and a formation speed adaptation strategy are developed that 1) bring the rovers into a prescribed formation from arbitrary in-plane locations and 2) enable the group to navigate over unknown and changing terrain, while staying in formation in the presence of actuator saturation. On-line estimates of generic friction parameters account for terrain surface variations. The leader specifies a reference motion for the entire fleet, including both straight-line and turning maneuvers. In saturation events, the formation speed is reduced based on the maximum sustainable speed of the slowest saturated rover using internal fleet communication, allowing the formation error to stay bounded and small. A formal proof for asymptotic stability of the formation system under nonsaturated conditions is given. A simulation example is presented that demonstrates formation initialization, formation-keeping, and formation-switching in both actuator saturation and nonsaturation circumstances.

AB For the past six years, the Chicago-area faith-based Reach Out Consortium has mobilized low-income uninsured and underinsured African American women and Latinas to seek screening for breast and cervical cancer. The funding history for this program illustrates how funds for a small community-based program were leveraged into a broader program, and that grew to serve low-income women across the state. Further, as the program reached more and more uninsured women, community activism led to a further state investment in services for the uninsured. Program sustainability and expansion depended on a combination of public and private competitive grants and grassroots advocacy.

AB Using community-based participatory research methods, a community-research coalition in Santa Clara County, California (SCC) conducted a quasi-experimental, controlled trial to increase Pap test receipt and to build community capacity among Vietnamese-American women. From 1999 to 2004, the Coalition planned and implemented an Action Plan with six components: multimedia campaign, lay health worker outreach, Vietnamese Pap clinic with patient navigation, registry and reminder system, continuing medical education for Vietnamese physicians, and restoring a Breast and Cervical Cancer Control Program site. Components were evaluated individually. Community-wide, cross-sectional telephone surveys of Vietnamese women in SCC (intervention community) and Harris County, Texas (comparison community) measured overall project impact. Receipt and currency of Pap tests increased significantly in the intervention compared with the comparison community Community involvement, system changes, community and research capacity building, dissemination of results, and program sustainability were also demonstrated. Community-based participatory research is feasible and effective in Vietnamese-American communities.

AB An important national health care effort is elimination of racial and ethnic disparities in six specific conditions: infant mortality, cancer screening and management, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and child and adult immunizations. To address this concern, several health entities in Nashville, Tennessee responded to a grant initiative from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop a Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) demonstration project. The resulting award is the Nashville REACH 2010 Project, charged to develop sustainable methods to reduce and, in time, eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease and diabetes in the North Nashville community, where mortality rates of these diseases are substantially higher than in other parts of the county. As one of its many interests, the project included potential health care providers to receive and disseminate messages about disease prevention and health education. The present paper describes the community-campus partnership between the Nashville REACH 2010 project and the post-baccalaureate program of Meharry Medical College, a partnership that enfolded Meharry's pre-professional health care students into the community-based participatory service research project to increase the awareness and sensitivity of future minority health care providers to issues in minority and poor, underserved populations and to increase potential providers' familiarity with the processes involved in community-based participatory research.

AB Phytoecdysteroids have been proposed as new tools for controlling crop pests because of their endocrine disruption and deterrent effects on insects and nematodes. There is increasing evidence of variability between taxa in sensitivity to phytoecdysteroids, but the genetic variability of this sensitivity within species is unknown. However, knowledge about this intraspecies variability is required for predicting evolution of the pest's response to new control methods. We assessed the variability of the response of the aphid Myzus persicae Sulzer, a major agricultural pest, to 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). We determined the number of nymphs produced by six clones of M. persicae exposed to various concentrations of 20E and the capacity of these clones to detect 20E in choice experiments. High concentrations of 20E significantly decreased the number of nymphs produced for two clones and both increases and decreases in the number of offspring were detected at low concentrations. Two clones significantly avoided food with 20E, while one significantly preferred it, suggesting that 20E does not always act as a deterrent in this species. We conclude that genetic variability in the response to 20E exists in natural populations of M. persicae. The consequences of this finding on the sustainability of control methods using 20E are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Polymers synthesized from coconut oil as a precursor find scarce applications. Polyesteramide urethane synthesized from coconut oil, a natural resource, is a dough-like material, unusable in our study. Upon loading with polyaniline it becomes tough and flexible. Composites of ClO4- doped polyaniline with coconut oil based poly(esteramide urethane) (CPEAU) were prepared by a solution blending technique, using different ratios of polyaniline( 2 wt%, 4 wt% and 8 wt%). The composites were further characterized by FT-IR, DSC, TGA, XRD, and SEM. Conductivity was found to be in the range 2.5 x 10(-5) - 5.7 x 10(-4) S cm(-1). The composite was found to show weak hydrogen bonding interactions between PANI and CPEAU at 8 wt% loading.

AB Melamine modified polyester amide (MPEA) was synthesized by the reaction of linseed oil fatty amide. The resin was further cured at room temperature by polystyrene comaleic anhydride (SMA) in different phr ( 30 - 80) to obtain MPEA coatings. The probable structure of MPEA was confirmed by FT-IR, H-1-NMR and C-13-NMR spectroscopic techniques. The physico-chemical characterization of these resins viz. iodine value, saponification value, refractive index, inherent viscosity were carried out by standard methods. MPEA ( 40 wt%) solution in ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) was applied on a mild steel strip of standard sizes to study their physicomechanical and chemical resistance properties. It was found that coatings of MPEA with 60 parts per hundred of the resin ( phr) of SMA showed the best performance in physico-mechanical and alkali resistance properties. Thermal stability and curing behavior were studied by Thermo Gravimetric Analyses (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), respectively.

AB This paper is concerned with the capture and release of flowing biomass in high voidage fibre networks, and the work is relevant to a number of areas including filtration and biomass growth within scaffold structures. Experiments were carried out using a micro scale visualisation flow cell and a laboratory scale filter with similar hydrodynamic conditions and these apparatus were used to establish the dominant modes and mechanisms of deposition during steady flow, and also the efficacy of oscillatory fluid flow for the re-suspension of deposited biomass. Numerical simulation was used to elucidate the flow characteristics through a 'clean' fibre network. Quantitative image analysis of in situ confocal laser scanning microscope data from the flow cell was conducted, obtaining both the local void fraction and surface area exposed to flow as the filtration progressed. The laboratory scale filter apparatus gave the overall filtration efficiency and pressure difference data, and also provided model parameters to estimate the filter coefficient X as a function of the deposit level in the filter. By combining these model parameters with the image analysis results, it was possible to obtain the deposit profile in the filter bed as the filtration progressed and also the average shear stress acting on the biomass deposit as a function of fluid drag. The experimental results showed that the high voidage fibre network was an effective way of capturing biomass, and that filter ripening, steady-state capture and breakthrough are all present during the course of a filter run. During biomass filtration, the average shear stress acting on the biomass started at approximately 1.0 Pa and gradually rose to a peak of 6.5 Pa, which was the maximum sustainable by the deposit. Thereafter, a reduction in the shear stress indicated rearrangement of the deposit to zones further downstream in the filter. Subsequent high intensity oscillatory fluid flow was partially effective at removing the biomass deposit both in the micro flow cell and the laboratory filter experiment, with shear stress levels during this high intensity oscillatory flow starting at approximately 65 Pa with a fully loaded fibre network, and decreasing to 7.5 Pa as the filter medium approached a 'clean' state.

TI Condition rating model for underground infrastructure sustainable water
   mains
SO JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES
LA English
DT Article
DE models; water distribution systems; infrastructure; underground
   structure; rehabilitation
AB One of the greatest challenges facing municipal engineers is the condition rating of buried infrastructure assets, particularly water mains. This is because water mains are typically underground, operated under pressure, and usually inaccessible. Condition rating is a mandatory process to establish and employ management strategies for any asset. To assess the condition of water mains, current research considers physical, environmental, and operational factors and their effect on different types of mains (i.e., cast iron, ductile iron, and asbestos). A condition rating model is developed to assess and set up rehabilitation priority for water mains using the artificial neural network (ANN) approach. Data are collected from different municipalities to train the developed model. The ANN input factors incorporate pipe type, size, age, breakage rate, Hazen-Williams factor, excavation depth, soil type, and top road surface; however, the output is pipe condition. The trained ANN shows robust performance (learning rate=0.005. R-2=0.931, correlation coefficient r=0.9653). Results show that the breakage rate has the highest relative contribution factor among the others. The developed model is relevant to researchers and practitioners (municipal engineers, consultants, and contractors) in order to prioritize pipe inspection and rehabilitation planning for existing water mains.

AB Within the last decade, the link between launch strategies and new product performance has been widely investigated. However, the relationship between resource configurations and launch strategies has received little attention. This study endeavors to fill that void by examining the relationships between resource configurations and launch strategy selections. In addition, this study investigates the moderating effects of market growth and competitiveness on the relationship between resources and launch strategies. Drawing on contingency theory and strategic studies, this study proposes that resource contingencies affect changes in launch strategies. This study also suggests that market characteristics play a contingent role in the relationships between the configurations of resources and launch strategy choices. Based on extensive studies reporting on market characteristics and their links to strategies, this study proposes that two market characteristics-market growth and competitiveness-are relevant for launch strategy decision making. Taiwan's integrated circuit (IC) design industry has been used as the analytical sample, as it has been identified as a promising sector for new product development. Based on the result of investigating 90 firms, four resource configurations are identified: (1) strategic and organizational abilities; (2) technological capabilities; (3) societal assets and goodwill; and (4) physical assets. Furthermore, two different launch strategies-innovative and product advantage and cost oriented-also are discovered. The results from a seemingly unrelated regression model reveal that technological capabilities and societal assets and goodwill contribute to the variation in the firms' choices of launch strategies. This study further conducted the simple slope analysis to observe the effect of the technological capabilities on the innovative and product advantage strategy under different levels of the market growth rate. The results interestingly showed that firms with technological capabilities demonstrated different degree of tendencies in employing this strategy in alignment with various market growth rates. The finding sheds some lights on the moderating role market characteristics play on the relationships between resource configurations and launch strategy selections. Academic implications and suggestions for practitioners also are provided.

AB The purpose of the current study was to compare the effect of 3 different rest intervals on multiple sets of the bench press exercise performed with heavy vs. light loads. Sixteen resistance-trained men performed 2 testing sessions each week for 3 weeks. During the first testing session each week, 5 consecutive sets of the bench press were performed with 80% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) and with a 1-, 2-, or 3-minute rest interval between sets. During the second testing session each week the same procedures were repeated with 50% of 1RM. The total repetitions completed and the sustainability of repetitions were compared between rest conditions and between loads. For each load, resting 3 minutes between sets resulted in significantly greater total repetitions vs. resting 2 minutes (p = 0.000) or 1 minute (p = 0.000) between sets. However, the sustainability of repetitions was not significantly different between loads (p = 0.849). These results can be applied to weekly bench press workouts that undulate between heavy (i.e., 80% 1RM) and light (i.e., 50% 1RM) intensities. When the training goal is maximal strength development, 3 minutes of rest should be taken between sets to avoid significant declines in repetitions. The ability to sustain repetitions while keeping the intensity constant may result in a higher training volume and consequently greater gains in muscular strength.

AB The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of 3 different rest intervals on the sustainability of squat and bench press repetitions over 5 consecutive sets performed with a 15 repetition maximum (RM)-load. Fifteen college-age men with previous resistance training experience were tested weekly over a period of 3 weeks. During each testing session, 5 consecutive sets of the squat and the bench press were performed with a 30-second, 1-minute, or 2-minute rest interval between sets. For each exercise, significant declines in repetitions occurred between the first and the fifth sets (p = 0.000). For the squat, a significant difference in the ability to sustain repetitions occurred between the 30-second and 2-minute rest condition (P = 0.003). However, differences were not significant between the 30-second and 1-minute rest conditions (p = 0.986) and between the 1-minute and 2-minute rest conditions (p = 0.042). For the bench press, significant differences in the ability to sustain repetitions occurred between the 30-second and 2-minute rest conditions (p = 0.000) and between the 1-minute and 2-minute rest conditions (p 0.000). However, differences were not significant between the 30-second and 1-minute rest conditions (p = 0.019). For each exercise, the number of repetitions completed on the first set was not sustained over subsequent sets, irrespective of the rest condition. These results suggest that when short rest intervals are used to develop muscular endurance, the intensity should be lowered over subsequent sets to sustain repetitions within the range conducive to this training goal.

ID MEDIA SYNCHRONIZATION
AB Synchronization of multimedia streams is one of the important issue in multimedia communications. In this paper, we propose an adaptive synchronization agency for synchronization of streams by using an agent based approach. The synchronization agency triggers one of the three synchronization mechanisms, point synchronization or real-time continuous or adaptive synchronization in order to adapt to the run-time and life-time presentation requirements of an application. The scheme or agency employs static and mobile agents for the following purpose: to estimate the network delays in real-time based on sustainable stream loss, to compute the skew, to monitor the loss and estimate the playout times of the presentation units. We have experimentally evaluated the scheme by using IBM Aglets and verified its functioning in terms of synchronization loss and mean buffering delays. The benefits of this agent based scheme are: asynchronous and autonomous delay estimation, flexibility, adaptability, software re-usability and maintainability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Sand and gravel are important raw materials which are needed for many civil engineering projects. Due to economic reasons, sand and gravel pits are frequently located in the periphery of metropolitan areas which are often subject to competing land-use interests. As a contribution to land-use conflict solving, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied within a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. Two AHP preference matrix scenario constellations are evaluated and their results are used to create a land-use conflict map.

AB Municipal economy problems are of a complex nature. Existing requirements for sustainable development make us apply various criteria while solving these problems. These can, for example, include economic, financial, social and environmental criteria. To handle them effectively, multi-criteria analysis should be applied. Decisions about heat production and delivery systems belong to such multidisciplinary problems. They were usually resolved in the past using classical numerical methodology that took into account only the technical and economic merits of the various alternatives. By applying multi-criteria tools instead it is possible to obtain more realistic results and make more effective decisions. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) seems to be a good alternative to fill the existing gap between decision-making as it is actually practiced and the traditional methods when applied to selecting district heating (DH) systems. This paper presents such an application. Our application is to select the best heat energy source for a DH system for a medium sized city located in Poland. Our results led to an interesting conclusion with regard to the best heat energy source. Our results suggest that intensifying the effort to make widespread the use of more efficient, but financially more costly, energy sources is the best.

ID DENTAL-CARE
AB Although health care is a right of citizenship, severe inequities in oral health and access to care persist. This paper provides information on the financing, organization and delivery of oral health services in Canada. It concludes that dental care has largely fallen out of consideration as health care. The increasing costs of dental insurance and disparities in oral health and access to care threaten the system's sustainability. The legislation that allows the insured to receive tax-free care and requires all taxpayers to subsidize that expenditure is socially unjust. Unless an alternative direction is taken, dentistry will lose its relevance as a profession working for the public good and this will be followed by further erosion of public support for dental education and research. However, never before have we had the opportunity presented by high levels of oral health, the extensive resources already allocated to oral health care, plus the support of other organizations to allow us to consider what else we might do. One of the first steps would be to establish new models for the delivery of preventive measures and care that reach out to those who do not now enjoy access.

   vulnerable populations
AB Purpose: Concern is increasing over the effect of lack of access to oral health care on the oral health, and hence general health, of disadvantaged groups. In preparation for a national symposium on this issue, key informants across Canada were canvassed for their perceptions of oral health services and their recommendations for improving oral health care delivery. This paper reports the results of that survey.
   Method: A questionnaire was constructed to address problems facing agencies with responsibility for meeting the oral health care needs of people receiving government assistance, the underhoused and the working poor. The survey was sent to 200 agencies, government and professional organizations. Data from the returned questionnaires were entered into a Statistical Package for the Social Sciences database and analyzed. Responses from Ontario were compared with those from the rest of Canada, those from government organizations were compared with others and results were examined by cultural nature of clients and by type of organization.
   Results: In assessing the positive aspects of oral health care, 84% of respondents agreed that public programs were useful and 81% felt that dentists offer good care. However, 77% disagreed that preventive care is accessible and that access to dentists and dental specialists is easy. More Ontarians than others thought that there are few alternative settings for care delivery (95% vs. 83%) and that the poor feel unwelcome in dental offices ( 83% vs. 70%). The issues most commonly identified were the need for alternative delivery sites, such as community health centres where service delivery could be affordable, accountable and sustainable; the need for oral health to be recognized as part of general health; regulatory issues ( e. g., expanding practice opportunities for non-dentist oral health care providers and removing restrictions on other dental health professionals in providing basic care to the financially challenged); and training.
   Discussion: The survey helped to identify access and care issues across the country. There was considerable agreement that lack of access to dental care services is an important detriment to the oral and general health of many Canadians. Respondents believe that dental health is isolated from general health.

AB A multiperiod model based upon a multicriteria objective function has been developed for a representative area of the Guadalquivir Valley, dividing the irrigated area into homogeneous types of farming as identified by cluster analysis. The model was applied to different future scenarios with a time horizon of 10 years and several different farming environments. A set of eight sustainability indicators has been evaluated for the model. The results show that the evolution of crops over time is closely related to the political environment regarding the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the application of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Methodological innovation has included the successful simultaneous introduction of MCDM and multiperiod programming techniques applied to agriculture and scenario development.

TI Bus quality partnerships, modal shift and traffic decongestion
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable transport; transport policy; Bus Quality Partnerships
AB A more sustainable transport system requires effective alternatives to private cars. Despite more than 40 years of declining use, buses are still the main form of local public transport outside central London. Government policy focuses upon Bus Quality Partnerships-agreements between highway authorities and bus operators to give bus priority access and invest in better quality buses-to reverse this decline and also attract car drivers to change modes and ease urban traffic congestion.
   This paper assesses the potential for Quality Partnerships to provide a more attractive bus service with the ability to achieve modal shift using a Greater Manchester case study. Preliminary results are presented from a comparative study of two Quality Bus Corridors (QBCs), one arterial route into Manchester's Central Business District and one transverse from Leigh to Bolton. The research uses bus user interview surveys and in-depth interviews, which focus upon non-bus users.
   Results of this research show that Bus Quality Partnerships when introduced as a stand-alone policy struggle to achieve significant modal shift and traffic decongestion. Most bus passengers and car users remain unaware of Bus Quality Partnerships. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One reason is that the majority of prevention efforts continue to focus solely on modifying individual behavior, even though public health research strongly suggests that changes to a community's structural elements, such as their programs, practices, and laws or policies, may result in more effective and sustainable outcomes. Connect to Protect is a multi-city community mobilization intervention that focuses on altering or creating community structural elements in ways that will ultimately reduce youth HIV incidence and prevalence. The project, which spans 6 years, is sponsored by the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions at multiple urban clinical research sites. This paper provides an overview of the study's three phases and describes key factors in setting a firm foundation for the initiation and execution of this type of undertaking. Connect to Protect's community mobilization approach to achieving structural change represents a relatively new and broad direction in HIV prevention research. To optimize opportunities for its success, time and resources must be initially placed into laying the groundwork. This includes activities such as building a strong overarching study infrastructure to ensure protocol tasks can be met across sites; tapping into local site and community expertise and knowledge; forming collaborative relationships between sites and community organizations and members; and fostering community input on and support for changes at a structural level. Failing to take steps such as these may lead to insurmountable implementation problems for an intervention of this kind.

TI Cost-effectiveness of WISEWOMAN, a program aimed at reducing heart

AB Objective: To quantify the cost-effectiveness of the WISEWOMAN program. WISEWOMAN is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-funded lifestyle intervention program that provides low-income uninsured women aged 40 - 64 with chronic disease risk factor screenings, lifestyle interventions, and referral services in an effort to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD) and improve health.
   Methods: We used data for 3015 WISEWOMAN participants who completed baseline and 1-year follow-up screenings. We quantified the average per capita cost of providing WISEWOMAN over the last 6 months of the reporting period. We assessed 1-year reductions in select CHD risk factors. We calculated the cost-effectiveness ratio by dividing the average per capita cost by average predicted life-years gained.
   Results: The cost of providing WISEWOMAN services to each additional participant averaged $270 per participant. Participants significantly improved their systolic (1.3%) and diastolic (1.7%) blood pressure, total (2%) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (0.7%) cholesterol, and 10-year risk of CHD (8.7%). There were also significant reductions in percent of women who smoked (11.7%) or had high blood pressure (15.8%) or high cholesterol (13.1%). The best-case cost-effectiveness ratio was $470 per percentage point reduction in CHD risk, or $4400 per discounted life-year gained; however, sensitivity analysis revealed substantial uncertainty around this estimate.
   Conclusions: Although more research is needed to confirm the assumptions used in the model, results of our analysis suggest that the WISEWOMAN program is a cost-effective approach for reducing CVD risk among low-income, uninsured women aged 40 - 64, especially if improvements in risk factors are sustainable when program participation concludes.

AB Objective: This study tested the efficacy of an 8-week culturally targeted nutrition and physical activity intervention on body composition.
   Methods: A randomized, attention-controlled, two-group trial was conducted in a black-owned commercial gym with a sample of 366 predominantly healthy, obese African American women. A free 1-year membership to the study site gym was provided to participants in both groups. Data were collected at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 months.
   Results: Sample retention at 1 year was 71%. Between-group longitudinal analysis including only participants with complete data revealed a trend toward weight stability in the intervention group at 2 months compared with controls (+ 0.05 kg/m(2), p = 0.75; +0.32 kg/m(2), p = 0.08, respectively), disappearing at 12 months (+1.37 kg/m(2), p = 0.0001; + 1.02 kg/m(2), p = 0.001, respectively). Within-group analysis demonstrated that intervention and control participants' fitness (1-mile run-walk) improved by 1.9 minutes (p = 0.0001) and 2.3 minutes (p = 0.0001), respectively, at 12 months. Mixed model regression analyses demonstrated a significant main effect of the intervention on fitness ( p = 0.0185) and a marginally significant effect on body mass index (BMI) ( p = 0.057), at 2 months, disappearing by 6 months. By 12 months, however, the controls exhibited a significant advantage in waist circumference stability compared with intervention participants ( + 1.1 cm, p = 0.2763; + 2.1 cm, p = 0.0002, respectively).
   Conclusions: The intervention produced modest short-term improvements in body composition, but the economic incentive of a free 1-year gym membership provided to all participants was a more potent intervention than the education and social support intervention tested. However, longer-term fitness enhancement remains elusive and demands research and policy attention. These findings have policy implications in that employer-/insurer-subsidized gym memberships may require interventions targeting other levels of change ( e. g., physical or social/environmental) to foster sustainable fitness improvements.

AB This investigation aims to classify, describe and evaluate the sustainability of dairy goat production systems (GPS) in South Spain Sierra de Cadiz. The research took place throughout 25 goat farms during the 2001-2002 campaigns, with the method posed by Masera et al. (1999) [Masera, O., Astier, M., S., Lopez-Ridaura. 1999. Sustentabilidad y manejo de recursos naturales. El marco de evaluacion MESMIS (Sustainability and natural resource management. The MESMIS evaluation framework). Mundi-Prensa, S.A., Gira, IE-UNAM, Mexico. 109 pp.] and adapted to animal production systems, as the guideline and framework to evaluate sustainability.
   The principal component, namely energy input from grazing (eigenvalue 1.329) which comprises the indicators total area per goat (factorial value 0.664) together with net energy obtained from grazing (factorial value 0.903) allowed to differentiate significantly between semi extensive (SES), semi intensive (SIS) and intensive (IS) goat production systems.
   Intensification of the GPS tends to be inefficient, especially in terms of net margin per litre of milk-produced (p < 0.05). A higher degree of adaptability of IS (64.8%) derives from a higher investment on new production strategies. Likewise, higher self-management capacity of SES (60.9%) fosters standards of productivity (76.0%) and stability (42.9%). The SIS presented the highest equity values (67.8%).
   On the whole, sustainability of GPS tends to decrease as the degree of intensification increases: SES=57.3%; SIS=55.7% and IS=53.1%. The reduction of the dependency on external input alongside with the optimization of natural resources management would surely improve the standard of sustainability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

DE registration theory; land registration; marine interests
AB The oldest and most enduring registration systems were developed to manage private property rights in land. Less developed systems are used to manage interests in personal property and resources. These systems formed the background for development of registration of some marine interests. Since then, the need for sustainable land management has pushed registration programs to service public policy purposes. Registration of marine interests, by contrast, remains underdeveloped. Marine systems are examined to identify their core components in compliance and regulation. A new model capable of providing better management of marine resources through an integrated spatial and text capacity is constructed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FUEL
AB In September 1997, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted an international convention protocol to reduce air pollution from ships, in order to achieve sustainable maritime development. This protocol has been approved by 15 member countries and will be enforced in May 2005. Pollutants emitted from ships, such as nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, sulfur oxides, etc. will be regulated by this convention through ship inspections and issuance of certificates. Ships belonging to maritime countries such as Taiwan, which sail around the world and berth in commercial ports, must obey this convention. This study has investigated possible strategies, which may be adopted by maritime countries to conform to this IMO convention in order to reduce the air pollution from ships. A sea-going ship must prepare EIAPP and IAPP certificates for inspection by port-state-control officials, when the ship is anchored at a maritime port. These port-state-control officials may also require the continuous detection and sampling of a ship's emissions, while it is berthed at the port. Legislative support is necessary for successful implementation of these safeguards. It is suggested, therefore, that the administration of both navigational and environmental protection, in maritime countries, cooperate in the revision of relevant federal laws, to implement the provisions of the MARPOL 73/78/97 convention; in this way, the air pollution from ships can be effectively controlled. Installation of advanced detection equipment can effectively detect any ships' violations of air pollution regulations. The Harbor Affairs' Bureau should also establish a database of air pollution inspections for ships berthed within their harbor, requiring that ships' equipment comply with the requirements of the MARPOL convention, for the reduction of air pollution.

AB Joint capture of multiple species by multiple fleets results in technical and economic interactions between fleets. This paper develops a bioeconomic model that incorporates interrelationships between fleets for a representative fishery in India. The study analyzes the impacts of overcapitalization on bio-economic sustainability. Results show that a continuation of the current fishing intensity would deplete most commercially important species in the near future. However, an optimal effort re-allocation between fleets would increase fishery profits substantially, although some species would remain unsustainable. The study demonstrates how the newly emerging, large bodies of fishery data can be used for management decisions in developing countries. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Commercial whaling is highly contentious, angering animal rights groups and conservation organizations, who threaten boycotts. Proponents of whaling argue that many whale stocks are plentiful enough to support sustainable harvests, In terms of economic efficiency, a nation's decision to engage in whaling depends on rents from the whaling industry, ecological and market linkages, and the potential for boycotts. We analyze the tradeoffs involved in a nation's decision to engage in whaling, whale-watching, and fishing. Scenarios exist in which whaling is economically rational. Indeed, sometimes it makes economic sense to subsidize whaling. In other circumstances, market pressures make commercial whaling inefficient. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ENVIRONMENT; CULTURE
AB The pollution effects of cage aquaculture represent an external cost to society, and the challenge for environmental economists has been to estimate the magnitude of these costs and to suggest ways in which they can be mitigated or 'internalised'. One possible mitigation strategy involves the development of integrated production systems based on polyculture, and this paper examines the financial viability of such a system that integrates the farming of salmon and Mussels. The results demonstrate the commercial potential of an integrated salmon-mussel production system under present market conditions, but highlight the critical role played by future price trends.

TI Parallel disk continuously variable transmission (PDCVT)
SO MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article we propose the design of a novel continuously variable transmission, named as the Parallel Disk Continuously Variable Transmission (PDCVT). The PDCVT consists of three disks. Two disks are rigidly connected to the input and output shafts. The third disk is connected to an intermediary shaft that is free to translate. This third disk is in contact with the first two disks through balls the encapsulated in cages. These balls through rolling contact with the disks transfer the power from the input disk to the intermediary disk and from the intermediary disk to the output disk. Offsetting the intermediary disk and balls with respect to the fixed input/output modifies the position of the contact points and controls the transmission ratio. The PDCVT is able to transition smoothly from one transmission ratio to another with minimal force requirement. Finally, the experimental results on a constructed prototype are studied to assess the power loss, sustainable torque, and transmission ratio of the transmission. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We evaluated limits to the accumulation of deficits (symptoms, diseases, disabilities) for 33,069 people aged 65+ years. We combined deficits in a frailty index (theoretical range 0-1) and found that the 99% limit varied little between samples, representing a frailty index value of about 0.65 +/- 0.05. This near-maximum shows no relationship with age. It is the same in community and institutional samples, even though the mean value is much higher in the latter. The data suggest a level of frailty beyond which, even in developed countries, further deficit accumulation is not sustainable. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Addressing gaps in abortion education: a sexual health elective created
   by medical students
SO MEDICAL TEACHER
LA English
DT Article
AB Medical school curricula frequently contain gaps in the areas of abortion and sexual health. A group of first- and second-year medical students at the authors' institution organized a collaborative, multidisciplinary elective course to address such omissions in the preclinical curriculum. This paper describes the process of creating and implementing the elective. Medical students identified curricular gaps in the areas of abortion, sexual assault, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender health, and HIV counseling. Clinical faculty and community-based professionals were invited to address these topics in a weekly lecture series organized by students. The course also included a half-day experience shadowing at a local abortion clinic. Collaboration with several student groups helped broaden student interest in and increase financial support for the elective. Some 37% of all first- and second-year students enrolled in the elective and received institutional credit for the course. Written and verbal evaluations confirmed student satisfaction with the lectures and the clinical experience. Dynamic and well-prepared speakers who presented interesting medical content received the highest ratings from students. Student leaders identified several challenges in implementing the elective. Ultimately the elective proved to be a successful collaboration among students, faculty, and healthcare providers, and resulted in permanent changes in the standard medical school curriculum. Challenges for student-initiated electives include difficulty in finding administrative support, securing funding and ensuring sustainability. This paper aims to make this process accessible and applicable to other students and faculty interested in addressing curricular gaps at their respective medical schools.

AB D-phenylglycine (D-Phg) is an important side chain building block for semi-synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins such as ampicillin and cephalexin. To produce D-Phg ultimately from glucose, metabolic engineering was applied. Starting from phenylpyruvate, which is the direct precursor Of L-phenylalanine, an artificial D-Phg biosynthesis pathway was created. This three-step route is composed of the enzymes hydroxymandelate synthase (HmaS), hydroxymandelate oxidase (Hmo), and the stereoinverting hydroxyphenylglycine aminotransferase (HpgAT). Together they catalyse the conversion of phenylpyruvate via mandelate and phenylglyoxylate to D-Phg. The corresponding genes were obtained from Amycolatopsis orientalis, Streptomyces coelicolor, and Pseudomonas putida. Combined expression of these activities in E. coli strains optimized for the production Of L-phenylalanine resulted in the first completely fermentative production of D-Phg. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Fishery assessment models meant to determine sustainability of commercial marine fish failed to predict recent stock collapses due to overexploitation. One flaw of assessment models is that they strongly rely on catch and age-composition statistics, but largely ignore the genetic background of the studied populations. We examined population genetic structure of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) in the centraleastern and northeastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea to aid fishery management of this heavily fished small pelagic species. We found that sardine has a striking mitochondrial control region, and sequenced a fragment of 387 bp of its 5'-end in 261 individuals collected off the coasts of Morocco (Dakhla, Tantan, Safi, Larache, and Nador), Portugal (Quarteira), Spain (Pasajes, Barcelona), and Greece (Kavala). High levels of haplotypic diversity rendered a rather unresolved NJ phylogeny. The recovered tree had no phylogeographic structuring except for the clustering of 13 individuals of Safi. In contrast, individuals grouped together according to the presence or absence of a 13-bp insertion in the sequence. phi(ST) pairwise comparisons and molecular variance analyses supported genetic differentiation between the population of Pasajes (Bay of Biscay), and those of the Mediterranean Sea and Moroccan coast, with a contact zone around the Strait of Gibraltar. This result confirms the existence of two subspecies, S. pilchardus pilcharchis and S. pilchardus sardina that were previously identified based on meristics and morphometry. Mismatch distribution analysis showed that sardine populations are expanding since the Pleistocene. Surprisingly, the population of Safi showed strong and statistically significant levels of genetic differentiation that could be related with isolation and genetic drift. Comparative analysis of the Safi population versus the rest including mismatch distributions, and a Bayesian skyline plot suggest that the Safi population likely underwent an early genetic bottleneck. The genetic singularity of the Safi population could have been responsible for the historical collapse of this sardine stock in the 1970s. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB From its decade-long pioneering work dedicated to the economic development and environmental regeneration of the high-altitude region of the Indian Himalayas, Pragya-an NGO based in Gurgaon, India, focusing on appropriate development of vulnerable communities and sensitive ecosystems-devised the MVPower (Mountain Village Power) model. This comprises in essence the development of decentralized energy facilities for use in (a) improving rural welfare facilities, (b) creating sustainable, niche-sector enterprise clusters, and (c) providing alternatives to overuse of natural resources. A pilot project is being implemented in the district of Lahaul and Spiti in the Western Indian Himalayas. Discussion of the initial results of the project constitutes the core of this paper.

AB Abundant rivers, streams, rivulets, and lakes are found in the Indian mountain region; ultimately, they flow down to meet the water needs of the population residing in the plains. Adequate efforts have not been made to harness the water resources that originate in the Himalayan region in order to address the increased need for small-scale energy for local use and sustainable livelihoods among the population living in remote and inaccessible mountain areas. Most of these areas are still without electricity, which plays a vital role in the development of any society. There is a need to ensure that local communities can benefit from energy just like people in the plains: they need to be empowered to tap and make the best use of local water resources, based on traditional knowledge of techniques to do this and improvement of time-tested technologies for better efficiency. This will allow them to produce added value and enhance their livelihood options.

DT Article
AB In July 1979, the world's largest wind turbine was dedicated on Howard's Knob, a mountain overlooking Boone, North Carolina. NASA and the Department of Energy's selection of this site confirmed the wind resource, and the windmill's striking presence above town sparked a great deal of imagination. But a newly elected President Reagan removed solar panels from the White House, and along with them went public investment in renewable energy. Nearly 3 decades later the converging threats of peak oil and global warming are compelling reasons to reconsider the wind in Appalachia. Howard's Knob is a poignant reminder of a comparative advantage that could spawn vital new industries and sustainable livelihoods. Appalachia's coal and timber helped to underwrite America's 20th century growth, but the process left a legacy of poverty and environmental destruction, Most recently, free trade agreements have sparked a wave of unemployment prompting citizens, business, and local government to look for a better way forward.

TI "Made in Kyrgyzstan": Innovative approaches to sustainable industrial
   development
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB New economic conditions in Kyrgyzstan today demand new approaches to industrial development. Huge, old plants and factories built in the Soviet era have collapsed, increasing the country's poverty level and the number of jobless people, especially in mountain regions. Lack of finances, poor management, privatization, and the breakup of the centralized industrial system have led to a decline in industrial production in Kyrgyzstan. Industry in the Kyrgyz economy decreased from 62% in 1990 to 16.1% in 2004, as a share of gross domestic product. This economic decline caused disparities between lowland and highland development, and resulted in the migration of rural populations to towns, especially from mountain regions isolated From the outside world. Under such conditions there is a great need to establish a liaison between lowlands and highlands. This role can be played by a network of new small-scale industries based on the obviously high potential of mountain regions. Small investments based on local natural and human resources, innovative approaches to national traditions, and new equipment, management, and marketing adapted to the demands of the modem market-these are essential elements of such industries now appearing in the Kyrgyz market, and the steps forward to creating the "Made in Kyrgyzstan'" brand. But to what extent is this direction in industrial development successful and sustainable?

AB Agenda 21 requires that countries adopt 'national sustainable development strategies' (NSDS), and this has been emphasized in several international commitments. Ghana has contributed to the methodology for peer review of such national strategies, as well as to guidelines designed by OECD and the United Nations for the NSDS process. Ghana has also adopted mechanisms to manage its own development planning in a sustainable manner. This article highlights various types of frameworks for sustainable development currently operating in Ghana, and considers to what extent they conform to NSDS principles. The article concludes that Ghana has made progress in several ways, but faces some of the same challenges as other countries in adhering to sustainability principles. The article offers recommendations as to how Ghana can achieve sustainable development.
   The article is an independent assessment by the author, who has also formulated most of the recommendations, except where otherwise indicated.

AB In response to domestic development challenges and calls from the international community for countries to develop and begin the implementation of national sustainable development strategies by 2005, the Government of Saint Lucia initiated a project named Integrated Planning for Sustainable National Development in 2002. Under this initiative, it was intended to articulate a vision for the country's development and use this as the basis for identifying a set of development imperatives through a process that will superimpose identified national development goals and targets on the international sustainable development agenda to arrive at a national strategy and plan for sustainable development. The plan also called for institutional and structural adjustments to move the country away from current sectoral-based development planning to an environment of dialogue, cooperation and collaboration among development partners in the articulation of development policies, plans and projects. The initiative did not evolve as planned mainly due to inadequate political and financial support and the inability of key institutions to see the bigger picture this initiative tried to paint for the nation.

AB National sustainable development strategies (NSDSs) play a vital role in pursuing sustainable development (SD) at the country level. These strategies help in clarifying priorities and in focusing efforts to more effectively address relevant SD issues. Since its establishment in 1992, the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development has urged its members to formulate and implement their respective NSDS. The Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 (1997) provided a more aggressive push to this advocacy by setting 2002 as the deadline for the formulation of NSDS while the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (2002) targeted 2005 as the year by which all countries should have started implementing such strategies. Many countries have heeded this call, albeit the strategies have taken a variety of forms: some took the route of formulating National Agenda 21s (as in the Philippine case), while others built on existing national environmental action plans, poverty strategies, sustainability plans, so-called green plans, policy statements, or legal frameworks.
   The UN/DESA crafted some guidelines for NSDS formulation but, and rightly so, countries are given freedom of choice as to the scope, substance and form best suited to their own unique circumstances. As varied as the formats of these strategies turned out, so too were the processes that were adopted in their formulation. All these elements could reflect varying degrees of understanding and differing perspectives about the nature of sustainable development and how the concept could be made operational. Consequently, such an understanding could ultimately define a country's success in mainstreaming and achieving sustainable development. In this connection, it would be worthwhile examining how an NSDS has actually played out its role in the national pursuit of sustainable development. Are there creative insights, lessons or guidelines that can be drawn from practical, countrywide experience in NSDS formulation and implementation? What are the emerging challenges and problematic areas in using an NSDS as an instrument for integrating sustainable development in mainstream decision-making? Are there nascent considerations that could be useful in developing design parameters for NSDS? This paper explores the foregoing questions in the Philippine context, given its decade-long experience in implementing its NSDS, the Philippine Agenda 21 (PA 21). In so doing, it hopes to distill potentially valuable perspectives that can inform UNCSD and country-level efforts at crafting, refining and mainstreaming national strategies for sustainable development.

AB The UK reviewed its National Sustainable Development Strategy during 2003 and 2004, and produced a new strategy - the third for the UK - in March 2005. Having established that the main weakness of the previous strategy was in its delivery, the review and the resulting new strategy set out to put a much stronger emphasis on delivery mechanisms. In support of this, the process included more participative ways for those involved in delivering to contribute their views and ideas, including web-based dialogue, participative events and seminars, and community level discussions. The key points for the success of the project were the involvement of stakeholders; project management of the process; a marketing and communications strategy; cross-departmental governance; and involvement of an external challenge function (fulfilled in the UK by the Sustainable Development Commission).

   policy integration; policy coherence; social responsibility
AB Many different approaches for national sustainable development strategies (NSDS) have been proposed since 1992, with some components common to all. A country's national strategy should be designed to help mainstream environmental concerns into policy. More broadly, it should coordinate local policy with global concerns, as well as integrate scientific knowledge into policy and development planning.
   The peer review mechanism for national strategies was piloted by France, and also involved representatives of countries from the North and the South as well as stakeholders. The peer review process allows countries to share their experience and information, and can assist them in identifying their own path to sustainable development.
   The business community can also contribute to sustainable development through provision of local and global public goods. Another input to sustainable development could come from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and its Guidance Standard on Social Responsibility (ISO 26000), as a coordinating mechanism between voluntary initiatives and binding obligations (such as international conventions). ISO standards and guidelines should therefore be integrated with national sustainable development strategies and local Agenda 21 frameworks.

AB At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, it was agreed that all countries should develop a national sustainable develop-ment strategy (NSDS) as a key component of implementing the goals of Agenda 21. Progress has been limited. Few countries have established a formal strategy, and many of the strategies that exist have been only partially implemented. This article proposes an approach that addresses the need to improve existing strategic planning mechanisms. The approach is based on a periodic assessment of existing systems, to evaluate the extent to which they incorporate NSDS principles, and identify areas to be strengthened. The article describes an assessment methodology, presents examples of its use, and discusses ways in which current approaches to NSDS may be complemented by continual review and improvement of existing planning processes.

AB Considering its specific economic, social, environmental and political features, the status and evolution of the Mediterranean have always been of great interest to its countries and concerned partners. From the protection of the sea against pollution, the interest was progressively expanded to land based development and its impacts on environment, to coastal management and finally to sustainable development with the establishment of the Mediterranean Commission on Sustainable Development (MCSD). Cumulated knowledge, coupled with political support and commitment to a common vision, has prepared the ground for the preparation of a regional strategy for sustainable development. Its preparatory process, coordinated by the MCSD Secretariat, has been very interactive, involving various stakeholders. The strategy, adopted in 2005, has raised awareness and induced the preparation of national sustainable development strategies.

AB The old afforestations of Austrian black pine dating from more than a century ago on marly substrates in the French Southern Alps play a protective role against erosion and torrential floods. However, these forests have now reached maturity and it is necessary to consider their renewal within the framework of minimal management to ensure sustainable protection against erosion. We first present methods for determining and mapping priority areas for forestry actions on different spatial scales, after which we define various forestry application rules.

AB An increasing frequency of nutrition-related disorders within New Zealand led us to consider whether a realistic and sustainable group intervention in the workplace could improve risk factors. In 12 healthy volunteers, measurements were made at 0, 3, 6, and 9 weeks of the study. At week 3, all participants received group advice to change diet and physical activity. At week 6, 6 randomly selected volunteers consumed a daily dose of kiwifruit and the other 6 were asked not to eat kiwifruit, but all were encouraged to continue lifestyle change. Measurements included administration of food frequency and physical activity questionnaires, fasting plasma glucose, insulin and lipids, and recording of pedometer steps in weeks 3, 6, and 9. Cancer risk was assessed using the single cell electrophoresis assay in leukocytes following a challenge with the known strand-breaking agent, hydrogen peroxide. The reported diet and level of physical exercise were improved postintervention, but there were no significant effects on plasma glucose, insulin, and lipids, and no overall weight reduction. Although the measured levels of DNA damage were not affected by entry to the study nor by dietary or exercise advice, regular kiwifruit consumption led to a significant increase in the ability of leukocytes to repair DNA breakage by free radicals (P < .008). "Prescription" of daily kiwifruit may provide a sustainable population intervention that could reduce some of the risk factors associated with cancer. However, more aggressive interventions may be necessary to reduce the risk of other lifestyle diseases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the challenging task of permanently organizing projects that include a broad range of actors: enterprises, social movement organizations and state actors. It focuses on a special type of standardization activity, namely eco-labelling, and is based on case studies of two Swedish projects/organizations: labelling of organic food and sustainable forestry. In this paper, I theorize about the concept of inclusiveness, which is seen as being instrumental for the creation of regulatory credibility and authority and argue that different types of members/participants have different types of power resources, which the standardization organization (SO) seeks to mobilize and control. The combination of these individual power resources brings action capacity and symbolic resources to the SO, including an image of independence. Moreover, the SO provides an organizational setting that, inter alias, helps interdependent actors to maintain a hold on each other, and forces them to engage in a dialogue and repeated interaction over time. This interaction can, in turn, result in common expectations and understandings that are essential for the operations of non-state governance. However, the case studies also indicate difficulties in organizing such complex networks. It can, above all, be difficult to prevent a power shift in favour of organizations with large power resources.

AB Objective: Self-management ability (SMA) is the ability to obtain those resources necessary for the production of well-being. With age, SMA becomes increasingly important, if one has a large variety of resources, physical and psychosocial losses due to the aging process can be substituted or compensated for. This study examined whether an increase in SMA would ensure sustainable levels of positive well-being among slightly to moderately frail older people.
   Methods: A bibliotherapy was developed to increase the SMA of slightly to moderaterly frail older people, and to help these persons to sustain a certain level of well-being. The effectiveness of this bibliotherapy was examined by comparing the SMA, mastery, and subjective well-being of 97 older people participating in the bibliotherapy to those of 96 older people in a delayed-treatment control condition.
   Results: The bibliotherapy resulted in a significant increase in SMA and mastery compared to the delayed-treatment control condition, and for SMA, this effect still existed 6 months after the intervention. The increase in SMA among older people who received the bibliotherapy prevented a decline in well-being as expected, but only in the short-term.
   Conclusion: The current findings show that it is possible to counteract an age-related decline in well-being, even with only slight to moderate levels of frailty. Practice implications: Cheap and easily accessible interventions, like the self-management bibliotherapy described in this article, may provide a useful addition to more traditional gerontological interventions.

AB This experiment was undertaken to investigate the effect of sensory modality (vision vs. audition) and if visual status (early blind vs. sighted) on sustainability to the vertical-horizontal illusion. Early blind and blindfolded sighted subjects explored variants of the vertical-horizontal illusion using a device that substituted audition for vision, whereas sighted subjects from an independant group inspected the same stimuli visually. Sensitivity to the vertical-horizontal illusion, including an illusion of moderate strenght when using the sensory substitution device, was observed only in the two sighted groups. The existence of an illusion effect when using such a device supports the idea of a visual perception provided by sensory substitution, whereas the attenuation of the vertical-horizontal illusion strenght is consistent with the visual field shape theory (Kunnapas, 1955a). The absence of the illusion effect in early blind subjects suggests that the sensory experience influences the nature of perception and that the visual experience plays a crucial role in the vertical-horizontal illusion, in accordance with the size-contancy scaling theory (Gregory, 1963).

AB The Lemna genus is a group of monocotyledonous plants with tiny, floating bodies. Lemna gibba G3 and L. paucicostata 6746 were once intensively analyzed for physiological timing systems of photoperiodic flowering and circadian rhythms since they showed obligatory and sensitive photoperiodic responses of a long-day and a short-day plant, respectively. We attempted to approach the divergence of biological timing systems at the molecular level using these plants. We first employed molecular techniques to study their circadian clock systems. We developed a convenient bioluminescent reporter system to monitor the circadian rhythms of Lemna plants. As in Arabidopsis, the Arabidopsis CCA1 promoter produced circadian expression in Lemna plants, though the phases and the sustainability of biolumineseence rhythms were somewhat diverged between them. Lemna homologs of the Arabidopsis clock-related genes LHY/CCA1, G1, ELF3 and PRRs were then isolated as candidates for clock-related genes in these plants. These genes showed rhythmic expression profiles that were basically similar to those of Arabidopsis under light-dark conditions. Results from co-transfection assays using the bioluminescence reporter and overexpression effectors suggested that the LHY and G1 homologs of Lemna can function in the circadian clock system like the counterparts of Arabidopsis. All these results suggested that the frame of the cireadian clock appeared to be conserved not only between the two Lemna plants but also between monocotyledons and dicotyledons. However, divergence of gene numbers and expression profiles for LHY/CCA1 homologs were found between Lemna, rice and Arabidopsis, suggesting that some modification of clock-related components occurred through their evolution.

TI Sugar beet performance with curly top is related to virus accumulation
   and age at infection
SO PLANT DISEASE
LA English
DT Article
ID RESISTANCE
AB Resistance to curly top disease caused by Beet curly top virus (BCTV) and related curtoviruses has been important to sustainable sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) production in the western United States for most of the last century. Recent advances in sugar beet genetics have led to the development of high-yielding cultivars, but these cultivars have little resistance to curly top disease. These cultivars are highly effective when disease management practices or environmental factors minimize curly top incidence, but can result in significant losses in years with early infection or abundant curly top. A greenhouse assay has been developed to rapidly test cultivars for a broad array of factors affecting performance in the presence of curly top. Previous studies have shown that sugar beet plants were more susceptible and losses more severe when seedlings were infected by BCTV, but less severe when plants were larger at the time of infection. To evaluate more precisely the relationship between age at infection, disease severity, virus accumulation, and yield loss in modern cultivars that were not bred for curly top resistance, individual sugar beet plants varying in degree of resistance and susceptibility to curly top were inoculated by viruliferous beet leafhoppers (Circulifer tenellus) when plants had two, four, or six true leaves, and maintained in a greenhouse for 6 weeks. When plants were inoculated at the two-leaf stage, all cultivars became severely stunted, with high disease ratings and similar rates of symptom development, regardless of resistance or susceptibility of the cultivar. Plants inoculated at four-and six-leaf stages exhibited increasing separation between resistant and susceptible phenotypes. with highly resistant cultivars performing well with low disease ratings and increased plant weights relative to susceptible cultivars. High-yielding cultivars performed only slightly better than the susceptible control cultivar. Results from greenhouse trials matched those from field trials conducted under heavy curly top pressure. Importantly, low virus concentration was directly correlated with lower disease ratings and higher plant weight, while elevated virus concentrations corresponded to higher disease ratings and lower weights. This demonstrates that a rapid greenhouse assay involving multiple traits can provide a rapid and effective means of selecting cultivars with improved curly top control, and could lead to more rapid incorporation of resistance into high-yielding sugar beet.

AB Legume rhizobia symbiotic nitrogen (N-2) fixation plays a critical role in sustainable nitrogen management in agriculture and in the Earth's nitrogen cycle. Signaling between rhizobia and legumes initiates development of a unique plant organ, the root nodule, where bacteria undergo endocytosis and become surrounded by a plant membrane to form a symbiosome. Between this membrane and the encased bacteria exists a matrix-filled space ( the symbiosome space) that is thought to contain a mixture of plant- and bacteria-derived proteins. Maintenance of the symbiosis state requires continuous communication between the plant and bacterial partners. Here, we show in the model legume Medicago truncatula that a novel family of six calmodulin-like proteins (CaMLs), expressed specifically in root nodules, are localized within the symbiosome space. All six nodule-specific CaML genes are clustered in the M. truncatula genome, along with two other nodule-specific genes, nodulin-22 and nodulin-25. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis suggest that an unequal recombination event occurred between nodulin-25 and a nearby calmodulin, which gave rise to the first CaML, and the gene family evolved by tandem duplication and divergence. The data provide striking evidence for the recruitment of a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding gene for symbiotic purposes.

DE developing countries; hydrology & water resources; water supply
AB Lack of clean water is the single biggest cause of human illness and death in the world, One of the UN's Millennium Development Goals is to halve the proportion of people lacking access to clean water and sanitation by 2015. But, while the technology underpinning water and sanitation in developed countries has been understood for nearly a century, it is proving difficult to transfer it to developing and transitional countries. This paper examines the evolution of water supply and sanitation in developed countries and identifies the challenges they are facing, including ever-increasing demands for higher quality standards, the need to replace ageing assets and demands for sustainability. It then questions how much of this is relevant to developing countries, where 'sustainability of water supply' simply means what is available today will continue to be available tomorrow.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Water ethics is an important but frequently ignored aspect of water resource planning and infrastructure management. This paper sets out seven basic concerns for the water sector in developed and developing countries. These concerns are the water cycle, quality of life, equity, sustainability, human rights, externalities and governance. They are then used to develop ten ethical principals that should be taken into account by water professionals and decision makers if they are to achieve effective, efficient and ethically acceptable water resource management. Points for discussion are also raised on how ethics can play a more prominent role in ensuring water provision for all.

AB Most of the billions of people without drinking water or sanitation are very poor While private-sector companies are becoming increasingly involved with infrastructure provision in developing countries, their contracts for water and sanitation services tend to forget the social aspects of providing services to poor people. As such, public-private partnerships in particularly poor countries are unlikely to be sustainable in the longer term and UN targets for improvements will fail to be met. Based on a four-year research project in Asia, Africa and Latin America, this paper explains how concession contracts need to be more suited to the needs, resources and aspirations of local impoverished communities-in other words, to be more pro-poor.

AB Dams are important elements of water infrastructure and bring many benefits to society. The World Commission on Dams addressed concerns about them and practice is improving. The UN Millennium Development Goals aim to halve several unsatisfactory situations by 2015, and infrastructure contributing to their achievement should therefore be designed to halve current risks. Quantitative risk assessment methods have been developed to enumerate the safety of UK dams. Any quantitative assessment of risk necessarily raises the need to establish what risks are acceptable to society, and the work on dams has prompted the thought that acceptable risk could become an impartial, apolitical and conscionable means of establishing the standards of infrastructure that should be delivered, How the approach could be applied and developed is described.

AB Behavioural approaches to safety management are commonly implemented within organizations in order to improve safety and reliability. These interventions are based upon the principle that modification and change of safety critical behaviours can facilitate safety improvements and reduce accidents. At the same time, there have been reported criticisms of behavioural approaches; specifically that they provide no substitute for a rigorously applied safety management programme and that behaviour modification is often limited to accidents with clearly identifiable behavioural precursors. Furthermore, it has been suggested (Anderson, 2005) that the focus on behavioural safety could provide a distraction from the ongoing control of low probability/high consequence risks.
   The current paper will identify and discuss both the advantages and limitations of behaviour-based safety interventions through reference to case studies. The sustainability of behavioural approaches will be reviewed in the context of the authors' recent review of a long-standing behavioural safety programme within a high reliability organization. The authors will seek to critically review whether behavioural safety initiatives are short-term 'fads' or provide a sustainable 'fix'.

AB Objective: Disease management systems that incorporate medication algorithms have been proposed as cost-effective means to offer optimal treatment for patients with severe and chronic mental illnesses. The Texas Medication Algorithm Project was designed to compare health care costs and clinical outcomes between patients who received algorithm-guided medication management or usual care in 19 public mental health clinics. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study for patients with major depression (N=350), bipolar disorder (N=267), and schizophrenia (N=309) applied a multipart declining-effects cost model. Outcomes were assessed by the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Results: Compared with patients in usual care, patients in algorithm-based care incurred higher medication costs and had more frequent physician visits, although these differences often became smaller with time. For major depression, algorithm-based care achieved better outcomes sustainable with time but at higher agency and nonagency costs (mixed cost-effective). For bipolar disorder, patients in algorithm-based management achieved better outcomes at lower agency costs (cost-effective). For schizophrenia, patients in algorithm-based care achieved better outcomes that diminished with time, with no detectable difference in health care costs (cost-effective). Conclusions: Cost outcomes of algorithm-based care and usual care varied by disorder and over time. For bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, algorithm-based care improved outcomes without higher costs for health care services. For major depression, substantively better and sustained outcomes were obtained but at greater costs.

AB To ensure the sustainability of the recycled paper industry, economically viable and ecologically sound alternatives must be found for the re-use of the waste residue. One such solution is the utilization of the residue in a value-add product. In this paper, we prepare recycled paper mill sludge with the AGES/KDS micronizer technology and fractionate the resulting material. The characteristics of the sludge fibre and strength properties of handsheets blended from thermo mechanical pulp and recovered sludge fibre are evaluated.

AB We evaluated the adequacy of rotational grazing to improve rangeland condition in the Flooding Pampa region, eastern Argentina, comparing the floristic composition dynamic of the 2 main plant communities under rotational and continuous grazing over a study period of 4 years (1993-1996). The experiment was conducted in commercial farms located in 4 sites of the Flooding Pampa region. In each site, a couple of farms, one managed under rotational grazing (implemented in 1989) and an adjacent one managed under continuous grazing at a similar stocking rate (1 AU(.)ha(-1)), constituted the replications of the experiment. Basal cover of species, litter, and bare soil were monitored in midslope and lowland grassland communities on each farm. Total plant basal cover in midslope and in lowland communities remained unchanged over the whole experimental period under both grazing methods. Under rotational grazing, litter cover was higher in both communities while the amount of bare soil showed a significant reduction in lowlands and a tendency to be lower in midslope. Basal cover of legumes, C-3 annual and C-3 perennial grasses was higher, while cover of C-4 prostrate grasses was lower under rotational grazing in the midslope community. In the lowland community, rotational grazing effects were evident only in the drier years, when higher cover of hydrophytic grasses and legumes and lower cover of forbs occurred. Plant species diversity did not change in response to grazing. In conclusion, rotational grazing promoted functional groups composed of high forage value species and reduced bare soil through the accumulation of litter. These changes indicate an improvement in rangeland condition and in carrying capacity. As the stocking rate was approximately 60% higher than the average stocking rate of the Flooding Pampa region, we believe that productivity and sustainability may be compatible by replacing continuous with rotational grazing.

AB Extending grazing into the winter, as opposed to feeding of harvested forages, can increase the sustainability of ranching in the western US. This study was conducted to determine the economic value of grazing stockpiled forage kochia (Kochia prostrata [L.] Scrad.) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum [Fisch. Ex Link] Schultes) during the fall and winter. Changes in cow body weight, body condition score, and ultrasound backfat were compared for late-gestation cows grazing forage kochia-crested wheatgrass pastures vs. those fed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay in drylot. The study was conducted from early November to late January for 2 consecutive years near Promontory, Utah. Forage availability and nutritional quality were monitored throughout the experiment. Cows grazing stockpiled forages did not receive any protein or energy supplements. Forage kochia comprised approximately 70% of available forage, with November crude protein content of 116 and 76 g(.)kg(-1) in years 1 and 2, respectively. Nutritional quality declined throughout the season, presumably mostly because of removal of higher-quality forage by preferential grazing as opposed to weathering. Averaged over years, cows grazing forage kochia-grass gained body weight (19 kg), increased in body condition (0.3 points), and maintained backfat thickness, finishing well within the range considered optimum for onset of calving and return to estrus. Pasture- vs. drylot-fed cows did not differ with regard to changes in body weight or body condition score. Both treatments increased backfat in year 1, when initial backfat was less than 0.5 cm, but both treatments resulted in loss of backfat in year 2, when initial backfat was greater than 1.0 cm. Grazing was more economical, costing $0.24(.)cow(-1.)d(-1) less than feeding alfalfa hay in drylot. Forage kochia can be used on western rangelands to extend grazing into the fall and winter, thereby improving the profitability of beef production.

DE cattle grazing; mine reclamation; molybdenum toxicity
ID TOXICITY; FORAGE
AB Revegetation and sustainable cattle grazing are major objectives in the reclamation of mine tailings at the Highland Valley Copper mine in British Columbia, Canada. A total of 150 cows with their calves grazed forage extremely high in molybdenum (Mo) for 5-6 weeks in the summer and fall for 3 consecutive years (2002-2004). The average stocking rate was 0.89 ha per animal unit month. The animals' diet consisted primarily of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) containing 100-400 ppm Mo. Each year, the herd was divided into 2 groups of approximately 25 cow-calf pairs. One group was supplemented with 2.5% copper sulphate (CuSO4 center dot 5H(2)O) in loose salt, and the other group was only given loose salt. Clinical signs of Mo toxicity, including lameness, diarrhea, and a faded hair coat, were significantly reduced in the supplement cows compared to control cows, which demonstrated the efficacy of the copper supplement treatment. Cattle also developed a tolerance to grazing high-Mo forage, as lameness and diarrhea were reduced in cows that had previous exposure to the site. However, lameness, the primary sign, and diarrhea were resolved in all cows by the end of each trial without treatment and hair coats returned to normal by the following spring. Only 4 calves showed signs of lameness or diarrhea in the 3-year study. Cattle grazing is a viable option for the end land use plan for Highland Valley Copper, provided a CuSO4-5H(2)O supplement is available to counteract the toxic effects of the high-Mo forage. As well, animals with previous exposure to the site should be utilized, as they appear to develop a tolerance to the Mo in the forage.

AB The large oil and natural gas resource base and the greater competitiveness of conventional energy supply technologies based on oil and gas is a key energy characteristic in the countries of the GCC. Until today, mostly pilot and research Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Rational Use of Energy (RUE) activities were conducted. However, these countries seem to be ready to take a more active part in the development of environmental friendly energy technologies. RES are expected to play a greater role in the future based on the rich natural potential of the region. In addition, appropriate efforts to formulate strategic RUE policies are initiated for assuring buildings sustainability and providing guidelines for future architecture. In this context, GCC countries are realizing the inevitability of putting climate change issues on the top of the list of priorities in the process of economic and social development. This paper includes an analytical review of the current RES and RUE development status in the GCC region, giving special emphasis to the business opportunities that the region offers for regional and international companies involved in this market.

SO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS

AB In sub-Saharan Africa, health systems are fragile and staffing is grossly inadequate to meet rising health needs. Despite growing international attention, donors have been reluctant to undertake the significant investments required to address the human resources problem comprehensively, given social and political sensitivities, and concerns regarding sustainability of interventions and risks of rising donor dependency. In Malawi, one of the poorest nations in Africa, declining human resource levels have fuelled an accelerating collapse of public health services since the late 1990s. In an effort to improve health outcomes, in 2004 the government launched a new health initiative to deliver an Essential Health Package, including a major scale-up of HIV and AIDS related services. Improving staffing levels is the single biggest challenge to implementing this approach. Donors agreed to help the government develop an Emergency Human Resources Programme with five main facets: improving incentives for recruitment and retention of staff through salary top-ups, expanding domestic training capacity, using international volunteer doctors and nurse tutors as a stop-gap measure, providing international technical assistance to bolster planning and management capacity and skills, and establishing more robust monitoring and evaluation capacity. Industrial relations were a prominent consideration in determining the shape of the Programme. The combination of short- and long-term measures appears to be helpful in maintaining commitment to the programme. (c) 2006 Reproductive Health Matters. All rights reserved.

AB In the early 2000s Dutch electricity companies are increasingly investing in technologies that enable them to replace coal with biomass. Replacing large amounts of coal (up to 40%) requires the companies to invest in technological trajectories alternative to the ones they have supported over the past decades. This paper aims to understand why these incumbent firms in the Dutch electricity regime are developing alternatives. The second aim of the paper is to provide a way for assessing the potential of innovations. The paper does so by bringing together insights from literature on (socio-) technical regimes and insights from literature on technological and market niches (strategic niche management). The main conclusion is that both niche processes (at the level of experimenting with alternatives) and changes in the incumbent regime are necessary for understanding the innovation journey of a new technology. A two-by-two matrix is developed that can be used for both analysis and governance purposes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The phrase "knowledge is power-" maybe a cliche, yet in today's business environment it is as true a statement as ever. In fact, knowledge is a unique company resource because its value actually increases when it is shared. Viewing knowledge as a strategic corporate resource, managers need to examine their own organizations to assess the degree of stored knowledge and absorptive capacity necessary to accomplish what is required for sustainable competitive advantage. A key question is whether or not the organizational structure is appropriate-from the perspective of both breadth and depth of knowledge-to the mission at hand. Breadth is obtained through employee diversity and connectedness depth through R&D experience as well as basic research initiatives, partnerships, joint ventures, etc. Overall, knowledge, like other strategic corporate resources, must be actively managed (it is to result in sustainable competitive advantage.

AB How globalization and international trade affect sustainable development and environment has attracted worldwide attention. Associated with the import and export of primary commodities, ecologically important materials have been exchanged among regions and countries. China, having the largest population in the world and the highest economic growth rate in last decades, may have an important influence on global sustainable development through the trade of primary commodities. Using the data from Almanac of China's Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, we analyzed material flows in the trade of primary commodity in China from 1950 to 2001. Our analysis shows that: (1) China has turned from a net exporter of primary commodities to a net importer; (2) minerals and fuels have been the major imports of primary commodities since 1992, just as well as foods and minerals did in 1980s; (3) most of the net imported primary commodities come from Oceania, Africa and Latin America.

AB Does the distribution of foreign development assistance depend on the organizational capacity of the recipient organization? I argue that employees at donor agencies seek signals of which recipients will implement aid most effectively, and use these signals to determine the destination of foreign aid on the micro level. Qualitative evidence gathered in the US and Brazil indicates the types of signals donors seek and recipients strive to transmit: signals of a recipient's professionalism, reputation, and sustainability. After developing a signaling game to derive the conditions under which these signals might be credible indicators of implementation effectiveness, I present quantitative evidence of aid recipient organizations in Brazil and score them on the three signals. Statistical tests confirm that organizations with higher levels of these signals are more likely to receive funding, suggesting that donors use these signals to determine the destination of development assistance.

AB Philippines coastal fisheries research started during the colonization period in the 1800s with the basic taxonomic identification of the countries aquatic resources and a description of their distribution in national waters. Research further evolved with the change from localized fisheries governance to a centralized one, presently, with a combination of both. The dramatic postwar expansion of Philippine fisheries in the mid 1940s led to the need for sustainable resources management. In the mid-1970s, single-species fisheries approaches (i.e. specifically surplus production models) indicated the overfished state of the Philippine coastal fisheries resources. These early models together with additional ecological and socioeconomic studies, served as inputs to coastal resources management initiatives, in the context of an ecosystem approach. The implementation of further management schemes such as marine reserves and fish sanctuaries also resulted from these initiatives. The decentralization of governance of coastal resources in the 1990s led to participatory or co-management approaches for the local governance of coastal resources. The development and great improvement of ecosystem-based models in fisheries science (such as Ecopath with Ecosim [EwE]) during this period allowed for investigations into the interactions of the multispecies and multigear fisheries dynamics. Complementary models derived from single-species such as Yield per Recruit and Surplus production in conjunction with ecosystem-based (EwE-type) approaches are both needed in Philippine fisheries research. An emerging framework for sustainable Philippine fisheries management system requires mainstreaming of coastal governance with science based adaptive management for Philippine aquatic resources governance.

AB Background: The mechanism involved in dyspnea in patients with mitral valve stenosis (MS) is not completely understood.
   Aim: To evaluate in patients with MS, changes in hemodynamic parameters during the assessment of inspiratory muscle endurance (IME) and the relationship between IME, hemodynamics and dyspnea.
   Subjects and methods: We studied 13 patients (9 in NYHA class It and 4 in class III). Endurance was evaluated using a two minute incremental threshold loading test, to obtain the maximal sustainable inspirator)) pressure (SIP), and maximal inspiratory load (MIL). During the test, cardiac output (CO), mean pulmonary and capillary pressures (PAP and PCP respectively), were evaluated.
   Results. Compared to six normal subjects, MS patients bad reduced SIP and MIL (P < 0.01), which correlated with baseline index of ayspnea (r= 0.57 and r=0.52, respectively, p < 0.05). At the end of the test period, basal CO, cardiac index (Q), PAP and PCP increased from 3.4 to 4.0 l/min(-1); 2.1 to 2.5 l/min(-1/)m(-2), 15 to 25 and 11 to 18 mmHg, respectively (p < 0. 01). No relationship between IME and hemodynamic parameters was found.
   Conclusions: IME is reduced and is closely related to dyspnea in these patients with MS. The observed low CI, suggests that muscle underperfusion could contribute to this dysfunction during the inspiratory effort.

AB The growing demand for energy by steelmaking companies, the significant increases in prices of fossil fuels and the environmental commitments have led ACESITA S. A., a Brazilian producer of specialty flat steel products, to review its current energy sources and to aim at self-sufficiency in renewable energy. ACESITA S. A. operates two blast furnaces with coke or charcoal as reductant. With recent investments for the ironmaking area and for Acesita Energetica, along with the combined mastering of blast furnace operation and charcoal production, Acesita will be prepared, as of 2009, to operate its blast furnaces with 100% renewable charcoal fuel. Forest based charcoal production through a modern, environmentally, socially and economically sustainable way is demonstrated.

AB This article presents a framework for practitioners who may be interested in maintaining adaptive stability of sociotechnical networks. The framework is developed from assembling several concepts that are useful for assessing and for drawing on appropriate moral reasoning strategies as sociotechnical networks are designed, constructed, and adapted. One such strategy involves the ability to assess degrees of perspective sharing and trading relationships in networks using moral imagination. The article uses the case of the design of an environmentally sustainable fabric to illustrate these strategic concepts. The framework also draws on other examples of cases in which sociotechnical networks have become destabilized to illustrate instances in which the framework may have been useful for decreasing a tendency for destabilization.

AB Despite the central role of the threshold incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), or lambda (lambda), in the methods and application of cost-effective analysis (CEA), little attention has been given to the determining the value of lambda. In this paper we consider 'what explains the silence of the lambda'? The concept of the threshold ICER is critically appraised. We show that there is 'silence of the lambda' with respect to justification of the value of ICER thresholds, their use in decision-making and their relationship to the opportunity cost of marginal resources. Moreover, the 'sound of silence' extends to both 'automatic cut-off' and more sophisticated approaches to the use of lambda in determining recommendations about health care programs. We argue that the threshold value provides no useful information for determining the efficiency of using available resources to support new health care programs. On the contrary, the threshold approach has lead to decisions that resulted in increased expenditures on health care programs and concerns about the sustainability of public funding for health care programs without any evidence of increases in total health gains. To improve efficiency in resource allocation, decision-makers need information about the opportunity costs of programs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The shift from hardship alleviation policies to behavior-focused policies in cash assistance highlight competing theoretical approaches to poverty: those focused on individuals' characteristics and those focused on structural factors lying beyond the control of the individual. This research bridges these approaches by examining the question, do local conditions have a separate and independent effect from cash assistance caseload characteristics on affecting caseload declines? The results indicate a separate and independent effect of both local conditions and caseload characteristics in explaining caseload declines suggesting that caseload reductions and the economic sustainability of recipients are affected by individual characteristics, but also by where recipients live.

AB Composts are increasingly used as environmentally safe biofertilizers in sustainable agriculture all over the world. Although it is well known that composts may contribute to soil vitality and sustainability, and in the enhancement of various soil microbiological processes, little is known about their direct or indirect effects on a microbial-community or population level. Ammonia oxidation by autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) is a key process in agricultural and natural ecosystems and plays an important role in the global nitrogen cycle. Here, we studied the diversity and community composition of ammonia oxidizers in a long-term crop rotation field experiment (> 10 years) where four major types of compost (from organic waste, cattle manure, green waste and sewage sludge) had been applied annually. The methods used ranged from PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and cloning of 16S rDNA fragments to quantitative real-time PCR. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles differentiated between the microbial communities of composts, compost-treated soils and mineral-fertilized soils. The community composition of the composts was not reflected in the community composition of the compost-treated soils. Sequencing of screened clones revealed a characteristic AOB community structure for the representative soil sample and the four composts. All AOB-like sequences grouped within the Nitrosospira cluster 3 and 4 and within the Nitrosomonas cluster 6 and 7. The average AOB abundance in compost-treated soils was two times higher than in mineral-fertilized soils (4.3 X 10(7) and 1.9 X 10(7), respectively). Our data suggest that composts do not leave direct microbial imprints in soils after long-term amendment, but an indirect effect on the AOB community was evident. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Reducing tillage and optimizing nitrogen fertilization are important strategies for soil and water conservation and sustainability of Mediterranean agricultural systems. These interacting practices can alter soil water and N availability, and thus affect N uptake, water use efficiency and crop yield. Three levels of N fertilization (zero, medium and high) and three tillage intensities (none, minimum and conventional tillage) were evaluated at three locations of the Ebro Valley in northeast Spain with different degrees of aridity and soil types (Guissona, Agramunt and Candasnos). Uptake of N by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was two to three times greater with N fertilization at locations with the best yield potential. Tillage increased soil mineral N content depending on location. Losses of N ranged from 30 to 80% of applied N each year and were encouraged by high N fertilization rates. Recovery of applied N ranged from 28 to 46.5%. N use efficiency ranged from 13 to 80 kg kg(-1) N and was negatively affected by N fertilization up to 50% and by tillage up to 17%. It is thus found that farmer applications of N fertilizer can be reduced by up to 50%. No-till systems do not require increased amounts of N fertilizer for barley production in these areas. Only in wet years, higher yields are obtained in no till when some N fertilizer is applied. However, in dry years with scarce rainfall during autumn, N should not be applied in any tillage system. Reduced tillage and no till are suitable systems for improving yield and for optimal environmental and economical use of N in these Mediterranean conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Rice variety Basmati 370 was transformed with a co-integrate vector pSM6 carrying cry1Ac and cry2A genes. The hygromycin resistance gene on a separate vector, pROB5 was used as a selectable marker. One to two week old scutellum derived calli were transformed with a biolistic gun. Transgenic status of different transformed lines was evaluated by molecular analysis (PCR, Dot blot, Southern blot, Western blot and ELISA) and insect feeding assays with rice leaf folder (RLF) and yellow stem borer (YSB). An average transformation efficiency of 1.98% was observed in a set of experiments. Plants from five different transgenic lines exhibited 100% mortality against rice leaf folder and segregated in Mendelian fashion. Insect bioassays revealed that there is no synergistic or antagonistic effect of cry1Ac and cry2A genes on the development of resistance against RFL and YSB. (c) 2005 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The size and species composition of the soil seed bank of southern Ethiopia rangelands were examined under three land use systems (communal land, a government ranch and traditional grazing reserves) and along a distance gradient (near, middle and far) from water sources. Soil seed bank sampling was carded out at the end of the growing season from 0.25 m(-2) quadrates 30 mm deep. The aboveground species composition was also compared. Of the total plant species identified in the soil seed bank in the greenhouse, 25% were grasses and 75% non-grasses. The near, middle and far sites from water was dominated by Leucas glabrata, Verbesina encelioides and Lintona nutans, respectively. Lepthotrium senegalensis made up 67% of the total composition of the soil seed bank in the traditional grazing reserve. Graminoid seedling density at the traditional grazing reserve (798.8 seedlings m(-2)) was higher (P < 0.01) than that of the ranch and communal sites, but did not vary significantly along the distance gradient from water (average 239.2 seedlings m(-2)). Non-graminoid seedling density did not vary much (P > 0.05) between the land use systems (average 128.9 seedlings m(-2)) and along the distance gradients from water (average 183.7 seedlings m(-2)). Sorensen's similarity index of the aboveground vegetation and the associated seed bank was low at all the sites. Difference in grazing pressure between the land use systems was one of the most likely causes of variations in the soil seed bank density and botanical composition of graminoids. The non-significant differences in the graminoid seed bank density along the distance gradients from water were due to similar population of grasses and may not explain the levels of grazing impact and disturbance. Regeneration from the soil seed bank may have a profound effect in restoring the composition of the grass layer in the degraded Borana rangelands if sustainable management practices are applied and sufficient rest periods followed. By translocating seed rich topsoil from the grazing reserves to degraded grazing areas, the soil seed bank can be used to develop valuable grass species at small community level. (c) 2005 SAAB.

TI Return to the moon: A sustainable strategy
SO SPACE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB On 14 January 2004 President George Bush announced his vision for space exploration, to include a human return to the Moon. He argued that, with a moderate increase in NASA's annual expenditure, such a return was possible. This paper is an exploration of how the President's space initiative can be realised on an international co-operative basis along similar lines to those already existing with the international space station (ISS). By abandoning the concept of a lunar landing as the major goal of a lunar programme, the initiative is made feasible. The three-stage plan here presented meshes with the currently evolving plans for the US space initiative to provide a realistic, affordable and sustainable strategy for manned lunar exploration. It represents a significant opportunity for the USA to unite and lead the world on this grand, civilisation defining adventure. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE knowledge managemem; construction industry; sustainability; risk
AB In the construction industry both the design and management processes differ significantly from the stylised models usually promoted in the academic and business press. To the complexity that is normal business in construction industry projects add the uncertainty associated with the changing legal and ethical imperatives of sustainable development and the result is a mess. Innovative products, together with the companies that make them, are being built on the back of a rigged market in recycled raw materials and policy changes are spawning unintended consequences.
   Making sense of those processes that use knowledge about sustainability, at the level of the firm, is particularly daunting because companies behave differently in different international contexts. The problem is further complicated by the collaborative nature of projects; specialization and the need to communicate with and between experts increases both costs and uncertainties.
   We discuss a fundamental tension between understanding knowledge creation and use, and the drive to capture processes in formal documents and systems.
   We propose similarities between developments in the field of sustainability and developments in the field of risk, with risk having the advantage of being further down the evolutionary line. Both fields have strong dimensions of formal rules and socio-economic behaviours. Such complexity, we argue, requires a number of perspectives to make sense of how knowledge is used in construction and allied industries. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE austenitic; coldworked; deformation capacity; Eurocode 3; high strength;
   laboratory testing; numerical modelling; stainless steel; structures
AB Efficient use of material is an important factor in achieving economical and sustainable structures. Typically, annealed austenitic stainless steel has a material strength of around 220 N/mm(2), somewhat lower than that of common structural carbon steel grades. This lower strength, coupled with the higher material cost, puts stainless steel at a significant disadvantage when considering material selection, despite its other desirable properties. However, the strength of stainless steel may, at relatively low expense, be considerably enhanced through modification of the chemical composition and through the process of cold working clue to the strain hardening nature of the material. This strength enhancement has not generally been utilised in practice due to a lack of knowledge on the structural behaviour of this high-strength material. Given the high material cost of stainless steel, the need to optimise the efficiency of design methods and to develop the performance, availability and diversity of the current product range is clear. To this end, this paper describes tests, numerical modelling and the development of design guidance for high-strength stainless-steel members in a range of structural configurations. Material tensile tests, member tests in compression and member tests in bending have been described. The results of the tests have been successfully replicated numerically, and subsequent sensitivity studies and parametric studies have been performed. Test and numerical results have been compared against two design methods developed for standard-strength material (Eurocode 3 Part 1.4 and the deformation capacity based design method). The comparisons have revealed that both design methods provide a similar level of reliability to that offered for standard-strength material, and thus, extension of both design methods to the high-strength grades has been recommended.

ID TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY
AB It is claimed that the Six Sigma programme brings competitive advantages to companies that implement it. This paper studies the validity of this claim by positioning Six Sigma in the paradigms provided by the literature on competitive strategy. The main functionality of Six Sigma projects is to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency. A continual improvement of operational effectiveness and efficiency is vital in order to avoid competitive disadvantage, however it is all but straightforward to convert the results into sustainable profitability. It is more about staying in the race than about getting ahead. In order to use Six Sigma strategically, a company should do more than just conduct Six Sigma projects by the book, but develop the competencies that the programme can bring to an organization. These competencies - disciplined and effective problem solving and decision behaviour - have the potential to be a source of competitive advantage, when integrated with a company's strategy.

AB We evaluated the effects of past and future trends in temperature and discharge in the Fraser River on the migratory performance of the early Stuart population of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka. Fish of lower condition exhibited disproportionately higher mortality during the spawning run, elucidating a critical link between energetic condition and a fish's ability to reach the spawning grounds. We simulated spawning migrations by accounting for energetic demands for an average individual in the population from the time of entry into the Fraser River estuary to arrival on the spawning grounds (about 1,200 km upstream) and estimated energy expenditures for the average migrant during 1950-2001. The model output indicates relatively high interannual variability in migration energy use and a marked increase in energy demands in recent years related to unusually high discharges (e.g., 1997) and warmer than average water temperature (e.g., 1998). We examined how global climate change might effect discharge, water temperature, and the energy used by sockeye salmon during their spawning migration. Expected future reductions in peak flows during freshets markedly reduced transit time to the spawning ground, representing a substantial energy savings that compensated for the effect of the increased metabolic rate resulting from exposure to warmer river temperatures. We suggest that such watershed-scale compensatory mechanisms may be critical to the long-term sustainability of Pacific salmon, given expected changes in climate. However, such compensation will probably only be applicable to some stocks and may be limited under extremely high temperatures where nonenergetic factors such as disease and stress may play a more dominant role in defining mortality. Our results further indicate that a long-term decline in the mean mass of adult sockeye salmon completing their marine residency could erode their migratory fitness during the river migration and hence jeopardize the sustainability of sockeye salmon and the fishery that targets them.

TI Effective regulation for sustainable public transport in developing
   countries
SO TRANSPORT POLICY

DT Article
DE sustainability; public transport; self-regulation; developing countries;

AB This paper has two key objectives. Firstly, using the findings from case study research undertaken in Colombo (Sri Lanka), Faisalabad (Pakistan) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), the paper seeks to demonstrate the importance of an appropriate regulatory framework and effective mechanisms of enforcement for sustainable urban transport systems in developing countries. Secondly, the paper highlights the critical importance of communication and co-ordination between stakeholders (defined here as transport users, providers and regulators) if regulation is to be effective. The views of poor and disadvantaged passenger groups-women, children, the elderly and disabled-are used in the paper to illustrate the importance of transport systems to their livelihoods, such as work, education, health and social pursuits. The case studies suggest that in the context of the failure of both the fully regulated public transport sector and the completely deregulated sector self regulation is a potentially useful alternative. In practice, self regulation has been achieved in the case study locations through the formation of cooperatives or associations of stakeholders such as users and operators.
   In the conclusion, the paper makes two key points. Firstly, that regulation must be open, honest and effective, but not so detailed or 'heavy' that it incites the potential for corrupt practices.
   Secondly, communication and co-ordination between stakeholders is critical if any form of regulation is to be effective-owners', employees' and passengers' associations have a vital role in this regard, as do Transport Forums consisting of all stakeholders. The participation of stakeholders and real and effective consultation are more important in the case of self regulation of public transport service provision than in other regulatory regimes.

TI Assessment of the future development of car sharing in Germany and
   related opportunities
SO TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA English
DT Article
AB Car sharing, which can be defined as sharing vehicle services amongst members, thereby giving them access to a fleet of vehicles, is important in promoting the use of sustainable modes of transport. Although the car-sharing market in Germany has grown considerably in recent years, customer take-up is still relatively low. Only 0.16% of driving licence holders in Germany have joined a car-sharing organization. As a result, the central objective of this paper is to assess ways of promoting car-sharing services further. Therefore, it begins with an investigation into the current situation in Germany, for which a survey addressing all German car-sharing organizations was conducted. Additionally, a household survey was conducted to evaluate the demand for car sharing. Finally, research into the development of car sharing in other countries was undertaken via the Internet and a brief survey to car-sharing organizations in some of those countries. Recommendations for the further development of car sharing are given based on the findings from each of these studies.

AB Eight oak trees (Quercus robur L.) received P-32 at a soil depth of 50 cm and P-33 at a soil depth of 15 cm at the end of June 2002 through plastic tubes inserted into the mineral soil. The phosphorus uptake from different soil depths was estimated by analysing the concentration of P-32 and P-33 in the foliage of oak growing in a mixed stand in southern Sweden. P-32 and P-33 were recovered in the leaves/needles after 21 and 39 days. The recovery of labelled P in oak was higher from 15 cm soil depth than from 50 cm, however, more than 4% of the total amount of labelled P was taken up from 50 cm. This indicates that oak can utilize deep soil layers for nutrient uptake. A study on the uptake of Cs (as an analogue to K) and N-15 into the leaves was performed on the same trees and detectable amounts of N-15 and Cs were recovered in leaves and buds. This indicates that N-15 and Cs can be used to study nutrient uptake of mature trees from the mineral soil.

AB Livestock diversity contributes in many ways to human survival and well-being, while its loss reduces options for attaining sustainable agriculture and universal food security. The current rapid rate of loss of this diversity is the result of a number of underlying factors. While in some cases changes in production systems and consumer preferences reflect the natural evolution of developing economies and markets, in other cases production systems, breed choice and consumer preferences have been distorted by local, national and international policy. In the context of a widespread threat to local pig breeds in Vietnam, this paper identifies and quantifies the level of agricultural subsidies that are currently contributing to this process of breed substitution. Producer subsidies-which tend to improve the competitiveness of imported breeds and their crosses over local breeds-are shown to be considerable, and mitigating measures are now urgently needed to avoid an irreversible loss of livestock diversity.

AB Background and Objectives Transfusion laboratories with transfusion committees have a responsibility to monitor transfusion practice and generate improvements in clinical decision-making and red cell usage. However, this can be problematic and expensive because data cannot be readily extracted from most laboratory information systems. To overcome this problem, we developed and introduced a system to electronically extract and collate extensive amounts of data from two laboratory information systems and to link it with ICD10 clinical codes in a new database using standard information technology.
   Materials and Methods Three data files were generated from two laboratory information systems, ULTRA (version 3.2) and TM, using standard information technology scripts. These were patient pre- and post-transfusion haemoglobin, blood group and antibody screen, and cross match and transfusion data. These data together with ICD10 codes for surgical cases were imported into an MS ACCESS database and linked by means of a unique laboratory number. Queries were then run to extract the relevant information and processed in Microsoft Excel for graphical presentation. We assessed the utility of this data extraction system to audit transfusion practice in a 600-bed adult tertiary hospital over an 18-month period.
   Results A total of 52 MB of data were extracted from the two laboratory information systems for the 18-month period and together with 2.0 MB theatre ICD10 data enabled case-specific transfusion information to be generated. The audit evaluated 15 992 blood group and antibody screens, 25 344 cross-matched red cell units and 15 455 transfused red cell units. Data evaluated included cross-matched to transfusion ratios and pre- and post-transfusion haemoglobin levels for a range of clinical diagnoses. Data showed significant differences between clinical units and by ICD10 code.
   Conclusions This method to electronically extract large amounts of data and linkage with clinical databases has provided a powerful and sustainable tool for monitoring transfusion practice. It has been successfully used to identify areas requiring education, training and clinical guidance and allows for comparison with national haemoglobin-based transfusion guidelines.

AB Onsite wastewater treatment systems aim to assimilate domestic effluent into the environment. Unfortunately failure of such systems is common and inadequate effluent treatment can have serious environmental implications. The capacity of a particular soil to treat wastewater will change over time. The physical properties influence the rate of effluent movement through the soil and its chemical properties dictate the ability to renovate effluent. A research project was undertaken to determine the role that physical and chemical soil properties play in predicting the long-term behaviour of soil under effluent irrigation and to determine if they have a potential function as early indicators of adverse effects of effluent irrigation on treatment sustainability. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis grouped the soils independently of their soil classifications and allowed us to distinguish the most suitable soils for sustainable long term effluent irrigation and determine the most influential soil parameters to characterise them. Multivariate analysis allowed a clear distinction between soils based on the cation exchange capacities. This in turn correlated well with the soil mineralogy. Mixed mineralogy soils in particular sodium or magnesium dominant soils are the most susceptible to dispersion under effluent irrigation. The soil Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP) was identified as a crucial parameter and was highly correlated with percentage clay, electrical conductivity, exchangeable sodium, exchangeable magnesium and low Ca:Mg ratios (less than 0.5).

AB This study evaluated the use of steam explosion as a pretreatment for municipal wastewater treatment sludges and biosolids as a technique for enhancing biogas generation during anaerobic digestion. Samples of dewatered anaerobic digester effluent (biosolids) and a mixture of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) and biosolids were steam-exploded under differing levels of intensity in this study. The results indicate that steam explosion can solublize components of these sludge streams., Increasing the intensity of the steam-explosion pressure and temperature resulted in increased solublization. The steam-explosion pretreatment also increased the bioavailability of sludge components under anaerobic digestion conditions. Increasing the steam-explosion intensity increased the ultimate yield of methane during anaerobic digestion. Batch anaerobic digestion tests suggested that pretreatment at 300 psi was the most optimal condition for enhanced biogas generation while minimizing energy input. Semicontinuous anaerobic digestion revealed that the results that were observed in the batch tests were sustainable in prolonged operation. Semicontinuous digestion of the TWAS/biosolids mixture that was pretreated at 300 psi generated approximately 50% more biogas than the controls. Semicontinuous digestion of the pretreated biosolids resulted in a 3-fold increase in biogas compared with the controls. Based on capillary suction test results, steam-explosion pretreatment at 300 psi improved the dewaterability of the final digested sludge by 32 and 45% for the TWAS/ biosolids mixture and biosolids, respectively, compared with controls. The energy requirements of the nonoptimized steam-explosion process were substantially higher than the additional energy produced from enhanced digestion of the pretreated sludge. Substantial improvements in energy, efficiency will be required to make the process viable from an energy perspective.

AB This article reflects on the many challenges (financial, practical, and epistemological) facing the producers of digital thematic collections while proposing ways in which to navigate these same challenges. Drawing on current trends in academic librarianship and archive management, as well as the author's experiences gained while managing a digital collection of early twentieth-century newspapers (The Modernist Journals Project), the article defines and discusses thematic collections of primary texts; metadata; preservation and access; collaboration; project sustainability; and implications for women's studies. In so doing, the article addresses the ways in which Feminisms and Print Culture 1830s-1930s, a proposed collaborative multi-media project dedicated to international women's history, feminisms, and print media in the 19th and early 20th centuries, can be the inheritor of the best standards and practices offered by previous projects while avoiding some of their challenges.

AB Many sustainable development projects take place in rural communities experiencing economic decline and out-migration. What kind of sustainable development projects succeed in these economically troubled settings? To answer this question, I examine two sustainable development projects initiated by women in a portion of the Ecuadorian Amazon experiencing economic decline and out-migration. The first project failed, and the second one succeeded. The differing outcomes suggest that, in the absence of larger public interventions to "turn a region around," small scale projects that focus on the needs of the most socially cohesive groups, which are often networks of women, offer the best chance for success.

AB Demographic models are important tools for assessing population status, diagnosing potential causes of population decline, and comparing management strategies that might change population trajectory. The population of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) maintained in North American zoos has been declining for the past decade, and Wiese ([2000] Zoo. Biol. 19:299-309) predicted a continued decline in the population using an age-based matrix model. We developed an individual-based model to further explore the demographic issues of the population. Our model allowed us to quantitatively evaluate the prospects for slowing or reversing the decline given the potential management strategies of improving reproduction, reducing infant mortality, altering birth sex ratio, and recruiting additional individuals from outside the population. Our simulations showed that if current demographic trends continued, the population would continue to decline at 2%/year. It was possible to create sustainable simulations, but these required a large increase in the annual number of births produced. Increasing reproduction was the most effective strategy to slow the decline, whereas other management strategies had the most impact when combined with increases in reproduction. Almost all simulations resulted in large changes in population structure, with increases in the male population and decreases in the female population. Given the population's demographic issues, it will be difficult to either increase the population substantially or sustain it at its current size.

AB Geotextiles constructed from Borassus aethiopum (black rhun palm) leaves are currently being investigated for their effectiveness in decreasing water erosion. The study aims to develop sustainable methods of soil conservation where the material meets selected criteria (readily available, simple and cost-effective to manufacture, provides immediate erosion control and possibly increases soil fertility and organic matter content). Grid mats were manufactured in a cottage workshop in The Gambia, West Africa. They are currently under investigation at the Hilton Experimental Site in Shropshire, UK. Eight runoff plots (10 x I m on a 15 degrees slope) are being used, with duplicate treatments: (i) bare soil; (ii) grassed; (iii) bare soil with I m palm-mat buffer zones at the lower end of the plots, and (iv) completely covered with palm-mats. Results from one year of field study (2002-03) indicate sediment yield is 36.8 per cent from replicated covered plots and 35.9 per cent from the replicated buffer zone plots, compared to the control bare plots. Sediment yield equated to 0.45 1 ha(-1) from bare soil, 0.09 t ha(-1) from grassed plots and 0.17 1 ha(-1) from both the covered and buffer zone plots. The results suggest palm-mat application as protective buffer strips is highly effective in temperate climates. Future work is intended to follow this pilot study and develop well-researched guidelines for practical field applications in other global regions, namely Africa, Southeast Asia and South America.

AB In northern Laos, rapid population growth and government policies to reduce the area under slash-and-burn systems have resulted in increased cropping intensity, which has increased weed pressure and reduced yields of upland rice. Promising alternative cropping systems include the use of weed-suppressing and multi-purpose legumes as short-term fallow crops. In this study, Stylosanthes guianensis (stylo), a promising fodder species, was seeded into upland rice at different times to identify the appropriate time of seeding. The objective is to optimize the establishment and survival of stylo during the rice growing season, and achieve high stylo biomass accumulation during fallow period, while minimizing competition with the upland rice crop during stylo establishment period. Seeding times ranged from 0 day (seeded with rice) to 83 days after rice sowing (DARS) in two experiments. In experiment 1, stylo was grown as a one-year fallow crop while in experiment 2 stylo was grown as a dry season fallow crop. The effect of stylo fallows on the subsequent rice yield, weed biomass and soil nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P) availability was evaluated in comparison with a natural weedy fallow (control). In experiment 2, the effect of burning and mulching fallow residues prior to the rice crop was also evaluated.
   Rice yields were reduced by an average of 55% when stylo was seeded at the same time as rice (0 DARS). When stylo was seeded later than 15 DARS, no competition effect on the accompanied rice growth was observed. Delaying stylo seeding substantially decreased total stylo and weed biomass at the end of fallow period. Following a stylo fallow, rice yields were up to 0.6 t/ha higher and weed biomass was up to 60% less compared to the natural fallow (control). Furthermore, soil available N content was higher following stylo fallows. In experiment 2, the rice yields were similar when fallow residues were burned or mulched but weed biomass tended to be lower when the residues were burned. In conclusion, either pruning stylo after seeding it at the time of rice sowing or seeding stylo 15 days after rice sowing minimizes competition with upland rice while optimizing establishment and biomass accumulation of stylo during fallow period. While relay-seeding stylo appears to improve rice productivity in the short-term, the long-term sustainability of the system needs further evaluation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Using greenways to reclaim nature in Brazilian cities
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING

DT Article
DE urbanization; urban green and blue infrastructure; local authorities;
   urban planning
AB This paper presents eight recent case studies of greenways proposed or implemented in Brazil ranging in scale from a state-wide plan to landscape design for a specific site and also describes the strategies used in each example to preserve, restore and create green spaces. Each case study is analyzed according to its capacity to contribute to a more sustainable urban environment and to foster a more livable and significant landscape. This "blue" and "green" infrastructure is happening as a consequence of changes in the criteria used by public administration and private agents which previously saw each open creek, wetland or forest patch in the middle of or adjacent to an urban area as an empty space and a potential building or road construction site. This more environmentally concerned approach to planning and design, previously shared only by some visionaries in universities and other research centers, is gaining momentum. It is becoming visible across the whole spectrum of Brazilian cities and regions, and is becoming part of the agendas of local communities and public administration.

TI Greenway planning in Britain: recent work and future plans
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB The author's preferred definition of a greenway, as proposed in 1995, remains: 'a route which is good from an environmental point of view' (Turner, 1995). This paper is concerned with the condition of British greenway planning in the first decade of the 21st century. The aim was to discover how the concept is understood and how it is being used. A questionnaire was circulated to all local authorities in the UK. An initial set of questions dealt with definition of the greenway concept. The most supported definition was 'A linear space containing elements planned, designed and managed for multiple purposes including ecological, recreational, cultural, aesthetic and other purposes compatible with the concept of sustainable land use'. A second set of questions dealt with the status of the greenway concept. It was found that the concept was used by 33% of authorities during the past decade but that 75% expected it to become significant during the next decade. A final set of questions dealt with a greenway project selected by the responding local authority. The typical planning period for these projects was 1997-2007 and the average length was 12.9 km. The author concludes that greenways are a landscape planning tool of considerable potential. Though comparatively neglected at the end of the 20th century, there are encouraging signs relating to the prospects for open space planning in 21st century Britain. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Building on the legacy of historic greenway planning in the U.S., several new initiatives have been taking shape and gaining recognition in the past decade. One is 'Green Infrastructure' planning which is a 'must have' inter-connected system of green spaces. Another is 'Smart Conservation'-the counterpoint of another planning initiative that preceded it known as 'Smart Growth'. This is the establishment of critical green corridors that should be preserved and maintained for predominantly ecological functions, in advance of or in conjunction with new development. 'New Urbanism' has focused on bringing order and coherence to escalating 'Edge Cities' on the urban fringe, based on walkable, mixed-use towns, villages and neighborhoods with integrated open-space systems. Transit-Oriented Developments (TODs) are transportation plans for accommodating regional growth around clustered 'pedestrian pockets' linked by transit systems. Both New Urbanism and TODs have applied similar principles to 'brown sites' and declining city neighborhoods.
   All these initiatives are different aspects of the greenway movement, expressing its many possibilities, enriching its original concepts, enlarging its credibility-if need be-and emphasizing its importance for and relevance to current issues of sustainability and 'green' planning and design. The author, a teacher/practitioner, discusses recent U.S. greenway examples at site, metropolitan and regional scales for which he has been the principal planner/designer or a consultant, and compares New Urbanism and TOD methodologies and approaches to established greenway-planning practices and the premises of Smart Conservation.

AB The desire to develop sustainable small-scale aquaculture on the Baja California peninsula has focused attention toward the native scallop Nodipecten (Lyropecten) subnodosus, a species characterized by rapid growth, large size and high domestic market price. The cool upwelling waters around Bahia Magdalena seem to provide suitable conditions for N. subnodosus culture, yet cheaper, less technically demanding methods of culture are desired to add to the practicality of development for local resource users. Culturing in the shallow 'esteros' (reverse-estuaries) rather than in the central section of the bay may provide such an alternative. Between September 2002 and April 2003, three grow-out culture methods (suspended module, bottom and off-bottom culture) were compared at two different densities (40% and 60% coverage) in terms of scallop growth, mortality and associated costs, in order to create a predictive model of monetary returns. Scallops exhibited retarded growth and increased mortality during the warm, oxygen-poor water conditions of late summer (August-September), which coincided with increased reproductive activity (Gonad Index) and lowered energy reserves (Adductor Muscle Index). Growth performance was best during a period of lower temperature in late December 2002 to early January 2003. Of the six treatments, 40% density off-bottom culture provided the best grow-out conditions in terms of average growth and mortality (K-year = 0.51, Z(year) = 0.29). However, a simulation of a 10-year culture operation accounting for the addition of a new batch of seed each year (100,000 ind. (.)year(-1)) shows 60% density off-bottom culture (K-year = 0.44, Z(year) = 037) to be the most profitable (net present value = US$28,631, internal rate of return = 27.0%). A 6-year period is predicted before the culture is profitable. The model proved valuable in comparing profitability between culture methods and is relevant as a tool for investment decisions in other culture operations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Establishing industrial ecosystems (IEs) is a viable approach for the sustainable development of industries. The ultimate objective of an IE is to minimize the material and energy consumption and reduce or even eliminate waste disposal through various recycle and reuse mechanisms. Yet, a rigorous scientific approach for the analysis and design of sustainable IE is lacking. The major obstacles include the challenge of evaluating each dimension of the "triple bottom line" of sustainability, handling the complex interdependency among different members, and the need of a holistic decision-making/decision-analysis method across different scales, from the individual production unit up to the ecosystem. To tackle this difficulty, the improvement of economic and environmental sustainability of IEs is defined as a multilayer multi-objective optimization problem in this paper. A novel Hierarchical Pareto Optimization Methodology is introduced to achieve the most sustainable solution. This methodology provides a systematic and flexible framework to solve multiscale, multidimensional problems, and it provides clear guidance for improving sustainability. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by a case study.

AB Vibrio harveyi is the major causal organism of luminous vibriosis, which causes potential devastation to diverse ranges of marine invertebrates over a wide geographical area. These microorganisms, however, are extremely difficult to identify because they are phenotypically diverse. Biochemical identification techniques involve many tests which may be time-consuming and expensive. The development and sustainability of shrimp aquaculture industry requires a simple, fast and reliable technique for species-specific identification of V. harveyi in order to control it effectively. The present communication describes a simple, cost-effective and rapid PCR-based and species-specific detection technique to facilitate early detection and identification of luminous and non-luminous V. harveyi isolates. Many of these isolates are also resistant to multiple antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, rifampin, polymyxin-B, trimethoprim and penicillin.

AB [1] A stochastic framework for modelling catchment-scale hydrologic and nitrate responses ( as a byproduct of transport processes and of a biogeochemical model of nitrogen cycling and transformations in heterogeneous soils) is proposed and applied to a 53 km(2) basin in northeastern Italy, where observational data and complex land-use distribution and geomorphology demand suitable descriptions. The model is based on a geomorphological scheme of the hydrologic response coupled with suitable Lagrangian transport models (mass-response functions) applied in a Montecarlo framework which explicitly addresses the random character of the processes controlling nitrate generation to the hydrologic cycle, and its transformations and transport. This is obtained by coupling the stochastic generation of climatic and rainfall series with the hydrologic and biogeochemical models. Special attention is devoted to the spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen sources of agricultural origin and to the effects of the relative timing and intensity of the forcing rainfall fields on the ensuing nitrate leaching. The influence of random climatic variables on biogeochemical processes affecting the nitrogen cycle in the soil-water system ( e. g., plant uptake, nitrification and denitrification, mineralization) is also considered. Besides its conceptual interest, the relevance of the model stems from the capabilities of estimating the return period of nitrate loads to the receiving water body and the probability distribution of the variables computed. We found that the modes of nitrogen injection through fertilization significantly affect the form of probability distribution of nitrate contained in soil moisture even when the total amount is fixed. As a result, the return period of the water volumes discharged and of the nitrate loads released ( in this case into the Venice lagoon) can be linked directly to the ongoing climatic and agricultural regimes, with implications for sustainable management practices.

AB The average productivity of rice-wheat sequence is quite impressive in the Trans Indo-Gangetic Plain (India) but these gains are over-shadowed due to declining groundwater, particularly in the areas, where groundwater quality is either good or marginal. The groundwater decline can be reversed through artificial groundwater recharge and by adopting suitable land and water management practices. Groundwater recharge is found technically feasible through vertical shafts conducting water from the ground surface directly to aquifers, after it has been passed through a sand-gravel filter. The recharge rate through this system is almost equal to a shallow cavity/filter well yield (about 11 l/ s) and its cost is estimated at about INR 10/100 m(3) (1 US$ = 45 INR). Further study in the Kaithal and Karnal districts of Haryana for stabilizing watertable within 6-7 m, which permits continuous use of shallow tubewell technology, indicated that the rice area could be supported at 60% of cultivable command area (CCA) and wheat between 65 and 80% of CCA with the existing management practices. The cultivation of wheat crop is sustainable in larger area, mainly due to its medium water requirement, salt resistance characteristics and consistent market demand resulting in assured returns. There is a possibility of supporting rice at a higher level, if part of the area (up to 10%) is left fallow and used for rainwater conservation and recharge. The fallow area may be subsequently put under early rabi (winter) crops like mustard, grain and other pulses. The effect of varying irrigation and fallowing would increase 23% equivalent wheat yield by changing land and water management practices. The analysis further indicated that the adoption of proposed irrigation management practices might stabilize watertable at desired level of 6-7 m in 10-15 years in high (3-4 m), 5 years in medium (5-10 m) and 40 years in deep (> 10 m) watertable areas.

AB The soil water regimes of a Brown Chromosol in response to drying and wetting are reported under three pastures types that were grazed all year long. The study was conducted at the Big Ridge 2 site near Armidale, on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales (NSW) between 1994 and 1998. The three pasture types were degraded pasture (dominated by annual species), a phalaris dominant pasture, and an improved pasture containing phalaris + white clover. This study was conducted to assess the hydrological implications of losing perennial pasture species from the high rainfall (summer dominant) zone of south-eastern Australia.
   Pasture active rooting depth, water use and extraction during drying periods, and the ability of the soil profile to store water during wet periods were evaluated for each pasture type. Pasture active rooting depth, which affects water use, varied with season and water availability. During a typical autumn drying period between 1 and 22 March 1996, the phalaris + white clover pasture with an active rooting depth down to 100 cm used 46 +/- 3.9 mm of water, with 16% of this extracted from the 55-130 cm zone. In the same period, the degraded and the phalaris pasture with active rooting depths of <= 60 cm used 30.7 +/- 5.2 and 23.6 +/- 7.9 mm of water, respectively, all from the surface 0-55 cm zone. However, under extreme drought conditions such as those in spring and early summer 1997 and autumn 1998, no differences in water use were detected between pastures.
   Pasture water use during dry periods affects the amount of water that can be stored in the soil profile and the potential amount of water loss during subsequent wet periods. In any wet period, the increase in soil water storage was greater in the 0-55 cm depth than in the 55-130 cm zone. For example, between 24 January and 14 February 1997 with total rainfall of 203 mm, water storage in the 0-55 cm zone was increased by 104.4 +/- 6.7 mm under the phalaris + white clover pasture compared with 86.4 +/- 4.3 and 84.4 +/- 3.3 mm for the degraded and the phalaris pastures, respectively. The water storage increase in the 55-130 cm zone was not different between pastures (< 12 mm).
   It was concluded that without appropriate grazing management and the presence of the legume component, the phalaris based pasture became unstable and failed to persist. The decline in the phalaris pasture caused invasion of annual species and weeds resulting in low water use, similar to that of the degraded pasture. In contrast, the combination of white clover and phalaris pasture showed a greater potential to maintain the phalaris component and a greater total biomass, and so was able to extract more water and from deeper parts of the soil profile. The vigorous phalaris + white clover pasture has greater potential to store more water than the degraded pasture and the phalaris pasture without legumes in the summer dominant rainfall area of temperate Australia. Therefore, maintaining pasture in good condition should be the main objective for sustainability of a grazing system in this region. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Both binary Cu/ZnO and ternary Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by homogeneous precipitation (hp) using urea hydrolysis. The structure and the activity for the water-gas shift reaction of these catalysts were studied compared with those prepared by coprecipitation (cp). The binary precursors contained hydroxycarbonates such as malachite and aurichalcite phases, whereas the ternary precursors were composed of hydrotalcite, malachite and aurichalcite phases depending on the metal composition. After thermal decomposition, both catalysts contained apparently CuO and ZnO as crystalline phase. No phase derived from Al was observed, since the amount of Al was small as 10 at.% in the ternary catalysts. After reduction pretreatment with hydrogen, the catalysts were tested for the shift reaction between 150 and 300 degrees C. The activity of hp-catalysts was higher than that of cp-catalysts; binary hp-Cu/ZnO showed higher activity than ternary hp-Cu/ZnO/AL(2)O(3) catalysts none the less the surface area was larger for the latter than for the former. The activity apparently depended on the surface area of Cu metal formed on the surface of hp-catalysts and a good correlation was observed between the Cu metal particle size and the activation energy of the shift reaction. However, more precise evaluation of the activity based on turn-over frequency strongly suggested the formation of Cu+ species as the active sites at the boundary between Cu metal particles and ZnO particles. Even after the pre-reduction at the high temperature, 250 degrees C, hp-Cu/ZnO catalyst showed no significant deactivation as well as no detectable sintering of the Cu metal particles during 50 h of the reaction, indicating that the hp-preparation method afforded the Cu catalysts with high sustainability in the shift reaction.

AB Preliminary cost analyses indicate that hybrid RAPS systems are more economically attractive as a means to provide electricity to remote villages than are alternatives such as 24 h diesel generation. A hybrid remote area power supply (RAPS) system is being deployed to provide 24 h electricity to villages in the Amazon region of Peru. The RAPS system consists of modules designed to provide 150 kWh per day of utility grade ac electricity over a 24 h period. Each module contains a diesel generator. battery bank using heavy-duty 2 V VRLA gelled electrolyte batteries, a battery charger, a photovoltaic array and an inverter. Despite early difficulties, the system in the first village has now commenced operation and the promise of RAPS schemes as a means for providing sustainable remote electrification appears to be bright.

AB Costs are surging for India's fine chemicals and pharmaceutical companies, however managers remain optimistic. Economists wonder if the success in the industry is sustainable, as there are indications that it may not be. The rise of India's fine chemicals and pharmaceutical services industry owes a lot to the lower salaries that Indians earn, but those costs are increasing rapidly on the back of the industry's rise. Other than rising salaries, Indian fine chemicals producers and contract research companies are hampered by the developing nation's infrastructure.

AB While different kinds of compost have been tested for highway revegetation, sewage sludge has only been used for agricultural purposes. In this work, its application for helping vegetation establishment on roads embankments is studied. Testing areas measuring 4 x 5 in were constructed on a new highway embankment in an and location. Several variables are analyzed: side slope (2); sludge dosage (4); vegetative species (4). Results are presented on growth, survival rate and germination of the plants; colonization of other species; cover crop for the plots; estimation of the erosion. The species planted manually showed satisfactory results although any variable was specially significant in this case. however, in relation to the species planted using hydroseeding, 2:1 side slope presented better results than 3:2 side slope. Using hydroseeding, the performance of different species was significantly different, thyme did not grow if sludge was not applied and the cover crop was higher in plots with 3:2 side slope than in plots with 2:1 side slope, essentially due to the presence of colonizing species. Finally, the costs of the proposed treatments are figured out, being concluded that, so much from the technical as the economic point of view, it is a viable proposal for sewage sludge management.

TI Sustained reduction in serious fall-related injuries in older people in
   hospital
SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVENT FALLS; INTERVENTIONS; INPATIENTS
AB Objective: To determine whether the rate of falls and associated serious injuries in a hospital aged care setting can be reduced using a multistrategy prevention approach.
   Design, setting and participants: Three-year quality improvement project comparing data at baseline (2001) and at 2-year follow-up (2003) after interventions to reduce falls. All patients admitted to the Aged Care Services wards at Caulfield General Medical Centre, Melbourne, between January 2001 and December 2003 were included.
   Interventions: Multistrategy approach phased in over 3 months from September 2001 and involving data gathering, risk screening with appropriate interventions, work practice changes, environmental and equipment changes, and staff education.
   Main outcome measures: Total number of falls; number of falls resulting in serious injuries (fractures, head injuries, death); staff compliance with the risk assessment.
   Results: Over a 2-year period, there was a 19% reduction in the number of falls per 1000 occupied bed-days (OBDs) (12.5 v 10.1; P=0.001) and a 77% reduction in the number of falls resulting in serious injuries per 1000 OBDs (0.73 v 0.17; P<0.001). Staff compliance with completing the falls risk assessment tool increased from 42% to 70%, and 60% of staff indicated they had changed their work practices to prevent falls.
   Conclusion: A multistrategy falls prevention program in an aged care hospital setting produced a significant reduction in the number of falls and a marked reduction in serious fall-related injuries. Incorporating a falls prevention program into all levels of an organisation, as part of daily care, is crucial to the success and sustainability of falls prevention.

AB Bariatric surgery leads to sustainable long-term weight loss and may be curative for such obesity-related comorbidities as diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea in severely obese patients. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has become the most common procedure for patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The procedure carries a mortality risk of up to 1 percent and a serious complication risk of up to 10 percent. Indications include body mass index of 40 kg per m(2) or greater, or 35 kg per m(2) or greater with serious obesity-related comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, coronary artery disease, debilitating arthritis). Pulmonary emboli, anastomotic leaks, and respiratory failure account for 80 percent of all deaths 30 days after bariatric surgery; therefore, appropriate prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (including, in most cases, low-molecular-weight heparin) and awareness of the symptoms of common complications are important. Some of the common short-term complications of bariatric surgery are wound infection, stomal stenosis, marginal ulceration, and constipation. Symptomatic cholelithiasis, dumping syndrome, persistent vomiting, and nutritional deficiencies may present as long-term complications.

ID UNIT-ROOT
AB This study aims to solve the puzzle of the conventional practice of examining the sustainability of external accounts by initially looking for cointegration between imports and exports. This study proposes a new approach to examine this thesis using unit root tests ( with unknown break date) on trade balance series rather than testing the cointegration relationships between imports and exports. In contrast to previous findings, this study has shown empirically that Japan's trade balances are unsustainable. This finding has important policy implications for Japan's external accounts.

   project risks; Israeli water supply and demand; Israeli conventional
   water supply costs; Israeli desalination program
AB Total desalinated water costs to the Israeli Government, the "off-taker", from the Ashkelon seawater desalination plant consist of the contracted water costs at the plant's battery limits plus the government's own expenditures: a) its initial investments (tender administration, out-of-plant infrastructure required to integrate the product within the national and regional water supply systems, etc.), b) its annual infrastructure O&M, supervisory and administrative costs, and c) the projected additional costs associated with certain project risks assumed by it throughout the life of the project. The paper presents and reviews these risks and quantifies the Government's anticipated direct and indirect, fixed and variable costs, including several cost escalation scenarios anticipated due to the linkage of the contracted water price to various indices (using an item by item and index by index cost sensitivity analysis). The escalated desalinated water costs are then compared to the similarly anticipated but differently escalating costs of other water sources in Israel, to project, long-term, the resultant gap. The benefits foreseen from the project, and particularly those related to its specific site location, and its mandated daily, monthly and annual water supply schedules and product quality, are presented against: a) the background of Israel's current water supply system's water sources' sustainable capacity, reliability, quality and costs, b) the anticipated growth in demand by various consumer sectors and c) the continuous deterioration of groundwater quality. The resulting risk and cost-benefit analyses are relevant not only to the Ashkelon project, which, as the first large scale government sponsored seawater desalination project in Israel, is a pioneering case study, but also to all pending and future seawater desalination projects in Israel. Some of these are not and will not be BOT, as the Ashkelon project was, but BOO and turnkey contracts, but, though government's participation and the division of project risks may vary, the key cost-benefit issues, from the government's point of view, will remain the same. In this context, Israel's overall seawater desalination program, which is currently fixed at 315 million m(3)/y by 2010, and its role within the Israeli Water Commission's long-range planning are briefly reviewed.

AB Environmental modernization of the economy includes the implementation of environmental policies which connect environmental management to technical environmental innovations and improved economic performance. Some of the most important instruments in this respect are standards for enviromnental management systems such as the EU Environmental Management and Auditing Scheme (EMAS). Based on a unique data set of German EMAS-validated facilities, this paper investigates the effects of different characteristics of EMAS on technical environmental innovations and economic performance. Most firms report a positive influence of environmental management systems in general on environmental process innovations. Furthermore, environmental reports support the diffusion of technical environmental innovations. The econometric analysis shows a positive impact of the maturity of environmental management systems on environmental process innovations. Another important determinant of environmental process innovations is the strong participation of specific departments in the further development of EMAS such as the R&D department. For environmental product innovations, learning processes by environmental management systems have a positive impact. Such learning processes as well as environmental process innovations also have a positive influence on economic performance. We conclude that a careful design of EMAS is important for both the environmental and economic performance of a facility. The conclusions should also be relevant for the worldwide ISO 14001 standard since over 55% of the interviewed EMAS-validated firms have also implemented ISO 14001. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI Comparing augmented sustainability measures for Scotland: Is there a
   mismatch?

AB We estimate and compare two empirical measures of the weak sustainability of an economy for the first time: the change in augmented Green Net National Product (GNNP), and the interest on augmented Genuine Savings (GS). Yearly calculations are given for each measure for Scotland during 1992-1999. Augmentation means including, using projections to 2020, changed production possibilities enabled by exogenous technical progress or changing oil prices. The change in augmented GNNP and the interest on augmented GS are both always positive, showing no sustainability problem for Scotland then, according to the assumptions underlying our weak sustainability calculations. However, the former greatly exceeds the latter, even when macroeconomic fluctuations are taken into account. This is a mismatch which poses an unresolved problem with the theory. Resolving it may require respecifying the utility functions used in mainstream growth theory. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

ID SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC WELFARE; ISEW
AB This paper presents a framework for constructing multi-attributed indices to measure welfare derived by a region's citizenry from environmental resources. The framework provides a procedure for integrated regional accounting. The process of index construction is based on stakeholder consultation combined with multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). It is illustrated by developing a water service index for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region in Queensland, Australia. This involved a survey of 901 visitors and residents. The index shows how scientific information can be merged with societal preferences for competing water services to attain an overall measure of performance. Results report regional welfare resulting from alternative policy scenarios and the impact of individual indicators on whole-of-system performance. Regional welfare was found to be strongly influenced by instream heavy metal concentrations, coral cover and sediment exports. The process for index construction developed here could be applied for a multitude of environmental issues. It can provide a single unifying measure of performance when an environmental resource delivers numerous services measured in multiple monetary and non-monetary units. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

   analysis based on ecosystem service provision

   Del Plata Basin
ID PANTANAL WETLAND; PAMPAS
AB The Del Plata Basin is one of the largest watersheds in the world and is the epicenter of MERCOSUR activities in the Southern Cone of South America. Because of the quick expansion of agricultural activities during the 1990s, the imbalanced provision of economic and ecological services has become an issue of increasing concern in the area. In this work, we propose a policy-oriented methodological approach to harmonize land-use options and prevent potential trams-boundary problems among countries. The approach is based on the analysis of tradeoffs between various economic and ecological services that are differentially provided by trams-boundary, interconnected biomes. Data on land-use/land-cover for different biomes have been obtained from different statistical and literature sources. The value of ecosystem services in the study biomes has been obtained from the classical study by Costanza et al. (1997) [Costanza, R., d'Arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Limburg, K., Shahid, Naeem, O'Neill, R.V, Paruelo, J., Raskin, R.G., Sutton, P., van den Belt, M., 1997. The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 387, 253-260], and profit estimations for crop and livestock production has been collected from various economic studies. The results show that the difference between biomes to supply both economic and ecological services in Del Plata Basin is enormous, and cultivation of new lands in some biomes would neither compensate nor justify the loss of irreplaceable ecological services. However, although agricultural exploitation may drastically affect the supply of ecological services in some biomes, not all of them would be equally affected. For example, due to its smaller sensitivity, the environmental cost of cultivation in the Argentine Pampas seems to be rather negligible in relation to the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Then, the functional complementation of biomes across the area through tradeoffs analysis seems to be a viable broad scale strategy to identify sustainable land-use options in Del Plata Basin.

AB A model for simulating resource flows in a rural subsistence community is described. The People and Landscape Model (PALM) consists of a number of agents representing households, the landscape, and livestock. The landscape is made up of a number of homogeneous land units, or 'fields', each represented by an object containing data, methods and properties relevant to the field. Each field object consists of a number of soil layer objects, each of which contains routines to calculate its water balance and carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Organic matter decomposition is simulated by a version of the CENTURY model, while water and nitrogen dynamics are simulated by versions of the routines in the DSSAT crop models. The soil processes are simulated continuously, and vegetation types (crops, weeds, trees) can come and go in a field depending on its management. Crop growth and development are simulated by a generic model based on the DSSAT crop models, and which can be parameterised for different crops. Similarly, livestock growth and resource use is simulated by a generic model which can be parameterised for buffalo, cows, goats, sheep, chickens and pigs. Each household agent has stores of food, cash, fertiliser, fodder, seed, labour, manure, milk and meat, and also maintains dynamic lists of the patches and livestock units it has access to. Various types of household can be accommodated, ranging from resource-poor to resource-rich. Household agents can also communicate and exchange messages with one another and with the agents representing the landscape and livestock. Decision-making occurs on the basis of the internal state of each household agent and on its perception of the outside world gained from the information received during communication with other agents and the environment. Decisions result in activities being carried out by the household, which in turn influence the flows of water, carbon, nitrogen, labour, and finance-activities can be transactions, involving money, such as purchase of food, or actions, which do not include money, such as application of fertiliser to a field. The model uses object-oriented concepts with multiple instances of various sub-models being possible, so that, for example, different crop models (or even the same one) can be run simultaneously in different fields with different parameters (e.g. planting dates, etc.) for each instance. The advantages of using an agent-based approach as a way of integrating the biophysical and socio-economic characteristics of a system is discussed.
   The model was used to simulate a community of households each of which were allocated one of seven strategies of crop nutrient management, with these strategies competing with one another over the period of the simulation, during which soil fertility slowly declined. Unsuccessful strategies, determined by the returns generated in relation to an 'aspiration level', were replaced by more successful strategies. The impacts of agents requiring farmyard manure being allowed to purchase from agents with a surplus of manure was also investigated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, renewable energy facilities of Turkey were investigated. Electricity is mainly produced by thermal power plants, consuming coal, lignite, natural gas, fuel oil and geothermal energy, and hydro power plants in Turkey. Turkey has no large oil and gas reserves. The main indigenous energy resources are lignite, hydro and biomass. Turkey has to adopt new, long-term energy strategies to reduce the share of fossil fuels in primary energy consumption. For these reasons, the development and use of renewable energy sources and technologies are increasingly becoming vital for sustainable economic development of Turkey. The most significant developments in renewable production are observed hydropower and geothermal energy production. Renewable electricity facilities mainly include electricity from biomass, hydropower, geothermal, and wind and solar energy sources. Biomass cogeneration is a promising method for production bioelectricity.

AB Our main aim was to increase our understanding of logged stand structures and dynamics, including the density of harvested trees, age distribution and to estimate tree damage during and after timber harvesting in 1998 due to forest loggings. Our study was from the start of forest logging by a forest concession company by using inventory data of disturbance in 2001. The density, volume and basal area (BA) of trees above 10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) were 220.3 trees/ha, 151.9 m(3)/ha and 11.0 m(2)/ha, respectively, in 3510 ha logged evergreen forest (LGFE) and 241.9 trees/ha, 185.8 m(3)/ha and 13.5 m(2)/ha, respectively, in 4134 ha unlogged evergreen forest. The density, volume and BA of harvested trees at above 50 cm dbh in LGFE were 3.0 trees/ha, 22.2 m(3)/ha, and 1.6 m(2)/ha, respectively. The LGFE density, volume and BA were harvested at dbh above 50 cm at 22.4%, 29.5% and 27.1%, respectively, comparable to total forest area. The density, volume and BA of damaged trees at 10-49 cm dbh in LGFE were 12.6%, 25.3% and 40.4%, respectively. The LGFE density, volume and BA at dbh above 10 cm were reduced 35%, 54.8% and 67.5%, respectively. Our results provide managers with information needed to effectively plan the number of trees remaining after logging in logged areas for the next cutting cycle, and to increase the likelihood of meeting long-term management goals for logged areas. These damage results give useful information to analyze the sustainable cutting cycle. These structural characteristics may be important for forest concessionaires to scale the annual coupe operation zonation and for road construction managers to make a final decision. Extrapolations of these results to an anticipated acceptable cutting cycle must be interpreted with caution. Silvicultural treatment to reduce the damaged rate and improve the selective cutting rate in the forest disturbance zoned for timber production should be considered as a managed viability option. Ongoing restudy of this and other plots at unlogged sites for the next cutting cycle are necessary to provide a strong basis for how to reduce the impact of logging causes. Therefore, the impact of reduced logging should have been included to make the presence investigation more comprehensive and meaningful. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Terminalia oblonga (Ruiz et Pav.) Steud. is a common timber tree in lowland Latin America which is widely utilized and economically and ecologically valuable. The species suffers from reduced natural recruitment but the control of regeneration by environmental factors is incompletely understood. In the forest management plots of the BOLFOR project (La Chonta, Bolivia) we investigated the effects of soil disturbance, litter layer and canopy openness on seedling emergence and survival. Soil disturbance and a thin litter layer favoured seedling emergence, disturbance had also a positive effect on seedling survival, whereas canopy openness had no significant effect on emergence but influenced survival positively. The results are discussed with respect to the life history traits of T oblonga and forest regeneration, which need to be considered for implementation of sustainable logging strategies and forest conservation. It is concluded that the regeneration of T oblonga is favoured by moderate logging although the long-term effects need further research. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hydro-meteorological disasters such as floods are major challenges that need to be overcome in order to realize sustainable development and poverty alleviation for humankind. Devastating flood disasters have occurring in various locations throughout the world, and there has recently been rising concern that the intensity and frequency of catastrophic floods may be increasing. Being located on the eastern edge of monsoonal Asia and having climatic variations according to the seasonal and regional conditions, Japan has long suffered from numerous flood disasters, and thus has developed advanced flood management policies. This paper aims to discuss flood disasters in Japan and the recently improved flood management policies. In addition, this paper introduces a new plan attempted by the Public Works Research Institute (PWRI) of Japan that takes advantage of the wealth of long accumulated experience and knowledge in the hydro-meteorological field. The PWRI is now working toward the establishment of an International Centre on Water-related Hazard and Risk Management by acquiring UNESCO's auspices. In order to contribute to the global challenge of reducing devastating hydro-meteorological disasters all over the world, this centre aims to conduct research, capacity-building and training programmes, and information networking activities at the local, national, regional and global levels. The aim is to prevent and mitigate hydro-meteorological disasters from the viewpoint of sustainable and integrated river basin management. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB High Arctic wetlands, though limited in occurrence, are an important ecological niche, providing the major vegetated areas in an and and cold polar desert environment. These wetlands are often found as patches in the barren landscape. At a few locales which may be ice-wedge polygonal grounds, glacial terrain and zones of recent coastal uplift, wetland occurrence can become extensive, forming a mosaic that comprises patches of different wetland types. Reliable water supply during the thawed season is a deciding factor in wetland sustainability. The sources include meltwater from late-lying snowbanks, localized ground water discharge, streamflow, inundation by lakes and the sea, and for some ice-wedge wetlands, ground-ice melt. Different types of wetlands have their own characteristics, and peat accumulation or diatom depositions are common. The peat cover insulates the wetland from summer heating and encourages permafrost aggradation, with the feedback that a shallow frost table reduces the moisture storage capacity in a thinly thawed layer, which becomes easily saturated. All the wetlands studied have high calcium content since they are formed on carbonate terrain. Coastal wetlands have high salt concentration while snowmelt and ground-ice melt provides dilution. The sustainability of High Arctic wetlands is predicated upon water supply exceeding the losses to evaporation and lateral drainage. Disturbances due to natural causes such as climatic variations, geomorphic changes, or human-induced drainage, can reduce inundation opportunities or increase outflow. Then, the water table drops, the vegetation changes and the peat degrades, leading to the detriment of the wetlands. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reducing soil evaporation (E) is an important way to increase water use efficiency for agriculture and sustainable water use. To achieve this goal, an accurate estimate of soil evaporation at the macro-scale level is necessary. By including the surface temperature of dry soil, the three temperatures model (3T model) was proposed as an estimate of E, and its temperature term was defined as the soil evaporation transfer coefficient (h(a)). Although it has been primarily shown that h(a) determines the boundaries of E, further studies of its properties are necessary because h(a) has the application potential for remote sensing. The objectives of this study are to (1) investigate the relationships between h(a) and those parameters that are important for E estimation but are not able to be remotely measured (aerodynamic resistance, soil surface resistance (r(s)), and cumulative evaporation (E-c)); and (2) discuss the possibility for remote sensing application. Two experiments were carried out for these purposes: one in an open field and the other one in a closed growth chamber at constant temperature, humidity, and radiation. The following results were obtained: (1) Given the boundaries of 0 <= h(a) <= 1, E was determined between its maximum value (potential evaporation rate) and minimum value (zero); (2) During the period when evaporation is controlled by r a linear relation between h(a) and log (r(s)) is observed with a coefficient of determination r(2)=0.76. Because h(a) and r(s) are independent variables with significant differences in properties and magnitudes, these results indicate that h(a) and r(s) are well related to each other; (3) During stage 1 of evaporation, cumulative evaporation (E-c) increased with time while h(a) remained constant. Afterwards, ha linearly increased with E-c. The relationships among h(a), E-c, r(a), and r(s) would be useful for estimation of evapotranspiration by remote sensing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Enhanced plant biomass accumulation in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration could dampen the future rate of increase in CO2 levels and associated climate warming. However, it is unknown whether CO2-induced stimulation of plant growth and biomass accumulation will be sustained or whether limited nitrogen (N) availability constrains greater plant growth in a CO2-enriched world(1-9). Here we show, after a six-year field study of perennial grassland species grown under ambient and elevated levels of CO2 and N, that low availability of N progressively suppresses the positive response of plant biomass to elevated CO2. Initially, the stimulation of total plant biomass by elevated CO2 was no greater at enriched than at ambient N supply. After four to six years, however, elevated CO2 stimulated plant biomass much less under ambient than enriched N supply. This response was consistent with the temporally divergent effects of elevated CO2 on soil and plant N dynamics at differing levels of N supply. Our results indicate that variability in availability of soil N and deposition of atmospheric N are both likely to influence the response of plant biomass accumulation to elevated atmospheric CO2. Given that limitations to productivity resulting from the insufficient availability of N are widespread in both unmanaged and managed vegetation(5,7-9), soil N supply is probably an important constraint on global terrestrial responses to elevated CO2.

AB There is a need for better description and heuristic understanding of the sustainability of populations connected over space by a dispersing stage, both for management purposes and to increase our basic knowledge of the dynamics of these populations. We show that persistence of such a population of connected subpopulations depends on whether the sum of the reproductive gains through all possible closed, between-patch reproductive paths through multiple generations, relative to the shortfall in self-persistence in each path, exceeds unity plus extra terms, which only appear if there are four or more patches. These extra terms have the heuristic explanation that they avoid double counting of reproductive paths that arise with four or more patches because there can be nonoverlapping subnetworks. Thus only those patterns of reproduction and connectivity which eventually lead to descendants returning to the patch from which they originate contribute to persistence. This result provides the basis for evaluating connectivity and habitat heterogeneity to understand reserve design, the effects of human fragmentation, the collapse of marine fisheries, and other conservation issues.

AB Sustainable water use in the piedmont region of the Taihang Mountains in the northern part of the North China Plain (NCP) is under serious crisis due to the rapid depletion of groundwater caused mainly by pumping for agricultural irrigation. The development of water-conserving agricultural practices is essential in order to limit agricultural water use. To find an effective way to save water in the wheat-growing season without markedly reducing wheat yield, DSSAT-wheat was calibrated, validated and used to simulate water use by winter wheat. The simulations suggest: (1) since a moderately low growth in the leaf area index (LAI) of wheat does not result in low yield, moderate water deficits in March can save water, and therefore, the aim should be to avoid irrigation in March. (2) Depending on the soil water condition, irrigation in mid November is recommended to obtain a good growth of LAI and to create a moderate condition for water stress in March. (3) After the start of the growth of the ears (around 15 April), water deficits should be avoided so as to ensure there is no influence on ear growth and grain filling. Simulation of a 12-year period showed that when irrigation practice follows the above three principles, 76 mm of evapotranspiration and 99.5 mm irrigation water can be saved without much reduction in the yield of winter wheat (only 4.5%). This is sufficient to decrease the drawdown of groundwater by 0.42 m a(-1) and to improve water use efficiency from 1.27 to 1.45 kg m(-3). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The methodology for the N-alkylation of indole and pyrrole using potassium carbonate in 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [bmim][BF4] as the sustainable reaction media with acetonitrile as the cosolvent is described herein. Our approach provides good yields with alkyl halides as well as sulfonates as the electrophiles. Cesium carbonate was also found to be a consistent base in the N-alkylation. The proposed methodology is simple and mild with easy workup. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A model for improving physician performance in developing countries: A
   three-year postgraduate training program in Laos
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNAL-MEDICINE; COMPETENCE; MALARIA
AB The Faculty of Medical Sciences of the National University of Laos, in partnership with Health Frontiers, an American nonprofit organization, Case Western Reserve University of Cleveland, Ohio, and Khon Kaen University of Khon Kaen, Thailand, administer a postgraduate internal medicine training program for Lao physicians. Begun in 2001, the program admits six participants per year; participants complete clinical rotations in three hospitals in Vientiane, Laos, as well as one other clinical site.
   The goal of the program is to prepare a core group of local physicians to deliver healthcare, and train others according to an international standard of care. The program has two exceptional features. First, the vast majority of the training takes place in Laos. This avoids the "brain drain" that can occur when nationals of developing countries train abroad. In addition, because the training uses personnel, facilities, and technology available locally, graduates are better prepared to serve the needs of the Lao people. Second, the partnership is an all-volunteer model, committed to a long-term undertaking. American-trained specialists who live in Laos are available to work with the participants on a daily basis. Participants have a long period of time to acquire, reinforce, and be tested in new knowledge and benefit from learning from American colleagues who model an evidence-based approach to medical care, while still working in local conditions. As more Lao physicians receive this level of training, the program will become locally sustainable and help break a cycle of dependency on foreign expertise within the Lao health care sector. Preliminary results suggest that the program is succeeding, and could be replicated elsewhere.

TI Adopting sustainable farm management practices within a Nitrate
   Vulnerable Zone in Scotland: The view from the farm

   motivations

AB Aquatic pollution associated with agriculture is a problem that has been receiving increasing attention in the European Union (EU). The EU's Nitrates Directive (91/676EC) and its associated Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) legislation were extended in Scotland in 2003, requiring more farmers to adopt more sustainable land management practices. This paper presents results from a qualitative socio-economic study of the motivations and management practices of 30 farmers located within the Strathmore and Fife NVZ. It was found that these farmers rarely consider environmental issues beyond the boundaries of their farms unless the productive capacity and economic viability of their farms are affected. Despite contrary evidence, the farmers did not believe that they were responsible for any water quality problems, nor is the intrinsic linkage between catchment and coastal zone management established in their minds. They were suspicious of agri-environmental funding opportunities, and tend to regard the bureaucracy involved in applying for funding as more of a problem than it is worth. Experience of environmental regulations has left many with concerns about rules changing in unfavourable ways. Many of the farmers are dependent on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidy support, and the proposed de-coupling of direct payments from production is regarded with suspicion. Current NVZ regulations will impact most on milk and intensive livestock producers but our results indicate that even if the legislation is followed exactly, the desired environmental benefits are unlikely to be realised because most farmers claim already to be managing nutrients within allowable limits.

AB Organic farming can enhance soil biodiversity, alleviate environmental concerns and improve food safety through eliminating the applications of synthetic chemicals. However, yield reduction due to nutrient limitation and pest incidence in the early stages of transition from conventional to organic systems is a major concern for organic farmers, and is thus a barrier to implementing the practice of organic farming. Therefore, identifying transition strategies that minimize yield loss is critical for facilitating the implementation of organic practices. Soil microorganisms play a dominant role in nutrient cycling and pest control in organic farming systems, and their responses to changes in soil management practices may critically impact crop growth and yield. Here we examined soil microbial biomass and N supply in response to several strategies for transitioning from conventional to organic farming systems in a long-term field experiment in Goldsboro, NC, USA. The transitional strategies included one fully organic strategy (ORG) and four reduced-input strategies (withdrawal of each or gradual reduction of major conventional inputs-synthetic fertilizers, pesticides (insecticides/fungicides), and herbicides), with a conventional practice (CNV) serving as a control. Microbial biomass and respiration rate were more sensitive to changes in soil management practices than total C and N. In the first 2 years, the ORG was most effective in enhancing soil microbial biomass C and N among the transition strategies, but was accompanied with high yield losses. By the third year, soil microbial biomass C and N in the reduced-input transition strategies were statistically significantly greater than those in the CNV (averaging 32 and 35% higher, respectively), although they were slightly lower than those in the ORG (averaging 13 and 17% lower, respectively). Soil microbial respiration rate and net N mineralization in all transitional systems were statistically significantly higher than those in the CNV (averagely 83 and 66% greater, respectively), with no differences among the various transition strategies. These findings suggest that the transitional strategies that partially or gradually reduce conventional inputs can serve as alternatives that could potentially minimize economic hardships as well as benefit microbial growth during the early stages of transition to organic farming systems.

AB By baiting soil samples with larvae of Galleria mellonella detailed surveys of the occurrences of entomopathogenic fungi were conducted over two consecutive years in the soil of an organically farmed field (17.1 ha) and the associated hedgerow. Samples were collected at specific points (at distances of 25 in) based on Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and sample point coordinates were relocated by Global Positioning System (GPS). In the agricultural field soil Beauveria bassiana was the most common fungus while Paecilomyces fumosoroseus was most common in soil from the hedgerow. Significant clustering of B. bassiana in the agricultural field was found in one of the two years. High and low densities of B. bassiana were subsequently confirmed within selected areas by reducing distances between sample points. The results demonstrated the suitability of the sampling method for identifying distribution patterns of soil borne entomopathogenic fungi and the importance of large sample sizes to describe local biodiversity of the fungi in the soil environment.

AB Presence of different types of trees dispersed singly or in small groups throughout the fields is a very common feature in the extensive rice paddies of Laos and Thailand. Factors such as land-settlement history, proximity to forest, and role of species in the local culture are known to influence the nature and distribution of tree species so retained. The extent of influence of these factors on tree-species composition and distribution in rice paddies was investigated in three villages in Central Laos: Dongmakngeo, a newly established village with an abundance of adjacent forest; Bak, an old village with adjacent forest; and Nakhou, an old village without any adjacent forest. At Dongmakngeo village, 23 species, mostly remnants from the original forest, were observed in paddy fields. At Bak village, few trees were found in the paddy fields because villagers had ample access to resources in the surrounding large forest. On the other hand, 119 species, 27 of which were planted, were recorded at the forest-deprived Nakhou village; the scarcity of forest resources at Nakhou was compensated for by the utilization and management of trees located among the fields, resulting in tree species changing from remnant to ruderal over time. Thus, our results demonstrate that the pattern of tree distribution and species composition in paddy landscapes is not uniform, but varies in relation to settlement history, topography, and human management. This has important implications for setting both landscape-level land-use management plans and local tree management policies for achieving sustainable tropical paddy-dominated agro-silvicultural systems.

AB Mixed systems of agriculture incorporating combinations of trees and crops have formed key elements of the landscape of Europe throughout historical times, and many such systems continue to function in the present day. In many cases they represent formerly widespread traditional systems in decline and a number have already become extinct or exist only in a threatened state. The causes are both practical and economic. The agricultural subsidy regime within the European Union is presently unfavourable towards silvoarable practices, which has been a major factor in their recent decline. The silvoarable systems of Europe can be split into two classes according to location - northern Europe and the Mediterranean. The latter contains not only a greater area of silvoarable cultivation, but also a greater diversity of systems due to the broader range of commercial tree and crop species grown. In general, the systems of northern Europe are limited by light, whilst those of the Mediterranean are limited by the availability of water. Mixed systems of agriculture present an opportunity for future European rural development and have the potential to contribute towards the increased sustainability of agriculture and enhancement of biodiversity, whilst preserving landscapes that are both culturally important and aesthetically pleasing. A better understanding of the legacy of traditional silvoarable systems, combined with the formulation of a consistent de. nition and specific European policy towards them will be invaluable in ensuring that the benefits of mixed agriculture are fully exploited in the future.Mixed systems of agriculture incorporating combinations of trees and crops have formed key elements of the landscape of Europe throughout historical times, and many such systems continue to function in the present day.

AB Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective method of sustainable weight loss among morbidly obese patients. The types of bariatric surgeries can be divided into three categories: restrictive procedures, malabsorptive procedures, and combination (restrictive and malabsorption) procedures. In general, patients undergoing restrictive procedures have the least risk for long-term diet-related complications, whereas patients undergoing malabsorptive procedures have the highest risk. For many patients, the benefits of weight loss, such as decreased blood glucose, lipids, and blood pressure and increased mobility, will outweigh the risks of surgical complications. Most diet-related surgical complications can be prevented by adhering to strict eating behavior guidelines and supplement prescriptions. Eating behavior guidelines include restricting portion sizes, chewing foods slowly and completely, eating and drinking separately, and avoiding foods that are poorly tolerated. Supplement prescriptions vary among practitioners and usually involve at least a multivitamin with minerals. Some practitioners may add other supplements only as needed for diagnosed deficiencies; others may prescribe additional prophylactic supplements. The most common nutrient deficiencies are of iron, folate, and vitamin B12. However, deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins have been reported in patients with malabsorption procedures, and thiamin deficiency has been reported among patients with very poor intake and/or nausea and vomiting. Frequent monitoring of nutrition status for all patients can aid in preventing severe clinical deficiencies.

AB This paper analy/es the development process and goals of sustainability in two internationally popular cultural destinations in Turkey. A central hypothesis of the study was that the rapid development and high concentration of tourism activities cause negative effects on the natural and cultural environments, and when involvement of locals is minimal or lacking, the outcome would be especially unacceptable to the host community. Residents, tourists, and investors were involved, with perceptional analyses conducted for evaluation of the significance of tourism and environmental attributes for future policies, supplemented with an examination of local involvement in the development process. Findings indicate that coastal locations have met more pressure and encounter greater environmental problems than inland destinations.

AB A debate oil the sustainability of mass tourist destinations and the need to reorient them towards the high quality segment has recently arisen. However, it has not yet been studied whether Such a shift in the specialization pattern would result in an increase of efficiency. In this paper, a vertical differentiation duapoly model in which hotels compete in both quality and prices is used. The market duopoly and the Social planner solutions are compared, and different external costs are considered. It is found that efficient solutions allow for the coexistence of both the high and low quality segments, and that an expansion of the fortiler does not necessarily improve welfare.

AB One reason why tourism destination resources have proven difficult to manage sustainably is that man), of their most important attributes are common pool resources and thus subject to the "tragedy of the commons." Common pool resources are subject to both overuse and Underinvestment. This study considers how the Canadian side of Niagara Falls exhibited the characteristics of an unmanaged common pool resource until 1885, when a self-financing parastatal corporation, the Niagara Parks Commission, took over its management. The strengths and limitations of this approach to the commons problem are demonstrated through an account of the commission's history and accomplishments.

AB The objective of this study was to identify factors influencing the intentions of Vietnamese hotel businesses to adopt environmentally friendly practices. This was approached from the perspective of hotel managers within the framework of the diffusion of innovations theory. Participants were asked to evaluate the potential advantages and barriers to the adoption of selected sustainable tourism practices and to make all adoption/ rejection decision based oil their-judgment. Innovation characteristics were the most influential factors, being highly correlated with the likelihood of adoption. External environment characteristics were also highly correlated with intention to adopt to environmentally friendly frameworks. Organizational characteristics had a weaker relationship with the likelihood of adoption, except for the attitude toward change/level of risk-taking.

AB Seaweed farming is often depicted as a Sustainable form of aquaculture, contributing to poverty reduction and financial revenues in producer countries. However, farms may negatively affect seagrasses and associated organisms (e.g. invertebrate macrofauna) with possible effects oil the flow of ecosystem goods and services to coastal societies. The present study investigates the influence of a seaweed farm, and the fanned seaweed Eucheuma denticulatum in particular, on fishery catches using a traditional fishing method ("madema" basket traps) in Chwaka bay (Zanzibar, Tanzania). The results suggest that a seaweed farm, compared to a seagrass bed. had no influence on catch per unit effort (no. of individuals per catch, or catch weight) or no. of species per catch, but significantly affected catch composition (i.e. how much that was caught of which species). The two species contributing most to differences between the sites were two economically important species; the herbivorous seagrass rabbit fish Siganus sutor, which was more common in the seaweed site and is known to graze on the fanned algae: and the benthic invertebrate feeder chloral wrasse Cheilinus chlorourus, more common in the seagrass site. Compared to vegetation-free bottoms, however, the catches were 3-7 times higher, and consisted of a different set of species (ANOSIM global R > 0.4). As traps placed close to the seaweeds fished three times more fish than traps placed on sand patches within the seaweed farm, the overall pattern is attributed to the presence of submerged vegetation. whether seagrass or seaweed. probably as shelter and/or food for fish. However, qualitative differences in terms of spatial and temporal dynamics between seagrass beds with and without seaweed farms, in combination with other factors such as institutional arrangements. indicate that seaweed farms cannot substitute seagrass beds as fishing grounds.

AB This study attempts to characterize national passenger and freight transportation sustainability. Based on the indicator that measures the conformity of the growths of all sectors with transportation, the Islamic countries are comparatively studied. The proposed measure, elasticity, for each pair of variables indicates the extent to which the two variables have been changing consistently. The study database consisted of key aspects of transportation sustainability in the form of national variables including transportation, economic, social, and environmental categories for the period 1980-1995. Firstly, the elasticity of the social, environmental, and economic variables with respect to passenger and freight transportation variables was developed. Using individual elasticities, composite passenger and freight sustainability indices were suggested. Then, utilizing partial order theory and Hasse Diagram Technique (HDT), two composite indices were employed to visualize the comparative situations of countries. Based on comparative appraisal achieved by HDT, country ranking were developed. The methodology may be applied to any other time and geographic area for addressing pertinent issues for balancing and sustainable development of transportation systems.

AB Since its 2005 annual revision, the Biblis B nuclear power station has pioneered the use of digital instrumentation and control (I&C) technology in German nuclear power plants. All I&C installations controlling the unit and regulating its performance are digital. The control system for emergency feeding of the steam generators has been in operation already for a couple of years. In addition, plans are being developed to replace the reactor protection system. As early as in the mid-nineties, planning was begun by the nuclear power plant to upgrade sustainably the I&C systems for rod control and primary systems controls and limits. After the required preparations had been made, the original systems platforms of reactor limits and reactor control, electronic control rod position measurement, control rod initiation, and steam generator level control were replaced by the modem TELPERM(R) XS safety I&C system by AREVA NP.

AB Bird feeding on residential property is a popular activity throughout Western countries. Advocates insist the practice is beneficial, while opponents maintain that it can result in a wide range of negative outcomes including malnutrition. The biological effects of 'backyard feeding' were studied in Australian magpies Gymnorhina tibicen during the non-breeding season in 1999 in the Greater Brisbane and the Lockyer Valley regions, south-east Queensland, Australia. Six magpie populations were selected and 70 birds were individually tagged for identification. The birds were provided with processed foods, 20-40 g per bird daily. To monitor the effects of the food, blood chemistry and body mass (BM) were used as indices. Significant effects were observed in BM and plasma cholesterol (PC), showing strong sensitivity to food provisioning. Significant effects on PC and uric acid were found only when birds were fed dog sausage. Results suggest that blood PC levels in magpies are readily influenced by, probably, the lipids present in food, and that the type of food can affect blood PC levels. These effects may occur widely among fed magpies if the influence that we demonstrated at plasma level can be generalized. Following the free-ranging study, six magpies were captured and subjected to a 6-day captive experiment to determine whether the selected foods had the potential to alter the birds' blood chemistry. It was found that all of the foods, when provided ad libitum, influence at least two of the three blood parameters (PC and non-esterified fatty acids). Due to its popularity, wildlife feeding will continue. To make wildlife-feeding activities truly sustainable, there is a need for further studies. This study clearly demonstrated that the physiology of wild magpies can be affected by 'backyard feeding'.

AB Natural flora, vegetation, diversity and structure of 62 traditional coffee-banana plantations on Kilimanjaro were investigated and compared with the other vegetation formations on this volcano on basis of over 1400 plots following the method of Braun-Blanquet. The vegetation of the so-called Chagga homegardens belongs floristically to the formation of ruderal vegetation forming two main communities that are determined by altitude. These coffee-banana plantations maintain a high biodiversity with about 520 vascular plant species including over 400 non-cultivated plants. Most species (194) occurring in the Chagga homegardens are forest species, followed by 128 ruderal species, including 41 neophytes. Typical of the agroforestry system of the Chagga homegardens is their multilayered vegetation structure similar to a tropical montane forest with trees, shrubs, lianas, epiphytes and herbs. Beside relicts of the former forest cover, which lost most of their former habitats, there are on the other hand (apophytic) forest species, which were directly or indirectly favoured by the land use of the Chagga people. High demand of wood, the introduction of coffee varieties that are sun-tolerant and low coffee prizes on the world marked endanger this effective and sustainable system.

AB The woodlands of Quinto Real (Quinto Real, Erreguerena and Legua Acotada) are a 3,000 hectare beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest managed by the shelterwood system applied to even-aged (regular) stands. This study analyses how forest management determines the local distribution of the white-backed woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) and black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) and its relationship with the type, structure and size of the stands used for nesting by both species, as well as their dead wood requirements. The most suitable nesting habitat of both species is the mature forest (stands of regular large final crop trees), but the size of the mature fragments and a minimum quantity of dead wood is also important.

AB There are thousands of protected forest areas existing on earth, yet the deforestation rate continues unabated both inside and outside the protected areas especially in the tropical forests. It identifies the less effectiveness of the current conservation strategies, which is normally oriented around the forest area cover rather than the quality of the protected areas. This calls for realistic and effective management strategies for forests. Based on the drawbacks the present study aims at identifying conservation priority sites within the protected areas (Reserved Forests) of Shervarayan hills, Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu, India. The remnant forest patches having less effective management/protection is identified and analysed for its qualitative contribution to the ecosystem. Quadrats of 20 x 20 m were laid in different vegetation based on the percentage of forest cover and assess the species diversity pertaining the richness, Endemism and Red list categories. Thematic layers (maps) such as vegetation type, floristic species richness, floristic endemism, and red list flora are created and categorized according to their weightage classes and overlaid in GIS domain to demarcate the Conservation Priority Zones (CPZ). The CPZ are classified according to the priority status i.e., high, moderate and low based on the contributing species richness, levels of endemism and concentration of Red listed plants.

AB Base cation cycling was investigated on the Canadian Shield in a pristine catchment of the boreal forest. An input-output budget (atmospheric deposition-stream exports) for the whole watershed indicated that nitrogen (N) was strongly retained, while sulphur (S) and base cations (K, Ca, Mg) were lost. The S losses are attributed to internal sources, such as SO4 desorption and/or mineralisation of soil organic-S. The base cation losses at the catchment scale, however, might be contributed by weathering of the till below the rooting zone, which has little ecological significance. For this reason, a detailed budget of basic cations, including atmospheric deposition, tree uptake, mineral weathering and leaching losses was constructed for the soil rooting zone of a stand representative of the forest covering the catchment. Different scenarios of tree uptake (whole tree and stem-only harvesting), weathering rates (PROFILE modelled values, PROFILE modelled values corrected for soil Na leaching) and soil leaching losses (depth of 22 and 81 cm) were considered. The element budgets were summed for the 1997-2003 (7 years) period. In every scenario, K was lost (-35.5 to -1.2 kg ha(-1)) from the exchangeable reservoir. Gain or losses of Ca were observable, depending of the scenario considered (28.8 to -20.1 kg ha(-1)) while Mg (-0.8 to 13.3 kg ha(-1)) generally accumulated over the 7-year period. The absolute K losses are very important, given the very small K soil exchangeable reservoir (55.2 kg ha(-1)) at the site. Because the amount of K sequestered in biomass (110 kg ha(-1)) is twice the amount found in the exchangeable soil reservoir, this forest is very sensitive to commercial forestry operations and forest harvesting appears as the main pathway of base cation losses. This raises important questions regarding the sustainability of the boreal forest that lies on K-poor soils of the Canadian Shield.

AB Populations of threatened taxa in captivity within their natural ranges can make important contributions to conservation, but these may be compromised by the inappropriate application of population management goals developed in other contexts. We conducted demographic, genetic, and population viability analyses on the captive population of Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus) in Venezuela to investigate the management of within-range captive populations in general, and to better integrate this population into the conservation of Andean bears in particular. We found that although the present population is very small and not internally self-sustaining, incorporation of confiscated wild individuals has resulted in a low average number of generations in captivity and low inbreeding, with moderate gene diversity and a high probability of future population persistence. However, past imports from extra-range populations have been from over-represented lineages of unknown origin, which have mixed with under-represented Venezuelan ones, reducing the future value of the Venezuelan population as a source for founder stock. Our analyses indicate that the rate of incorporation of wild recruits is a major factor influencing proxy measures of conservation value, and distinguishing within-from extra-range populations. This implies that, contrary to conventional wisdom, internal self-sustainability can be a misguided goal in within-range populations, which furthermore may not be suitable destinations for surplus animals from captive populations elsewhere.

SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION

AB Community Based Wildlife Management (CBWM) has been suggested as a conservation strategy in response to bushmeat hunting in the Udzungwa Mountains within the Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot. The feasibility of CBWM based on meat cropping was therefore evaluated in New Dabaga/Ulangambi Forest Reserve (NDUFR). Comparison of relative wildlife densities with West Kilombero Scarp Forest Reserve, which is subject to only low hunting pressure, indicate that most relevant populations are severely depleted (Cephalophus monticola, C. harueyi and C. spadix, Potamochoerus larvatus) and hence that sustainable harvesting currently is not possible in NDUFR. Records of catch from hunters in the villages surrounding NDUFR indicate that bushmeat is of relatively low importance in terms of use and contribution to protein intake. Proximity to NDUFR and secondarily population size in the different villages is positively correlated with hunting intensity and depletion of wildlife. Comparisons between hunters and non-hunters in terms of wealth measures show that hunting is linked to poverty and low protein intake. An estimation of maximum sustainable harvest in NDUFR reveals that CBWM only has limited capacity to reduce these causes of hunting, maintain the communities' interest and offset the opportunity costs of conservation. Results of this study suggest that conservation efforts in NDUFR should focus on protecting wildlife against exploitation instead of encouraging use and dependence through CBWM. Supporting efforts should attempt to facilitate a complete shift to domestic sources of meat, by increasing the number of domestic animals in the poorest part of the population.

AB Hector's dolphin Cephalorhynchus hectori is found only in New Zealand waters. We carried out a population survey of the North Island subspecies Cephalorhychus hectori maui, also known as Maui's dolphin. The total population size estimate is ill individuals (95% confidence interval = 48-252). The small population size confirms its critically endangered IUCN status. A sustainable level of human-caused mortality for this population would be 0.16 (one dolphin every 6.4 years). This essentially means that fisheries bycatch, and where possible other human impacts, need to be eliminated to allow population recovery. A protected area has been created to reduce the threat from entanglement in fishing gear. Gillnet fishing is prohibited along a 210 nautical mile stretch of coastline. The main concerns are that gillnet fishing is still allowed inside harbours and trawling continues inside the protected area. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pelargonium sidoides (Geraniaceae) is a medicinal plant used for the treatment of various infections including tuberculosis and bronchitis. Traditionally, only the roots of the plant are used for medicinal formulations in the Eastern Cape. In addition to traditional uses, there is a great demand for the plant for export, therefore, the rate of its harvesting and the number of its collector has increased in recent years. This has led to a drastic drop in the population of the species in the wild. A method that could achieve the sustainable harvesting of P. sidoides would be to substitute its shoot for the roots in medicinal formulations. A comparative study of the antibacterial activities of the leaves and the roots of the plant was conducted on the materials collected from three different populations. Generally, both the shoot and the roots of P. sidoides have antimicrobial properties. There was no significant observable difference between the MIC of extracts from both parts. The choice of the root by the traditional healers over the leaves may be arbitrary or due to easy collection. The leaves of P. sidoides may, as well, substitute for its roots in medicinal formulations especially in the treatment of bacterial diseases like tuberculosis and bronchitis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As an aim toward developing biologically mimetic and functional nanofiber-based tissue engineering scaffolds. we demonstrated the encapsulation of a model protein, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated bovine serum albumin (fitcBSA), along with a water-soluble polymer, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), within the biodegradable poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers using a coaxial electrospinning technique. By variation of the inner flow rates from 0.2 to 0.6 mL/h with a constant outer flow rate of 1.8 mL/h, fitcBSA loadings of 0.85-2.17 mg/g of nanofibrous membranes were prepared. Variation of flow rates also resulted in increases of fiber sizes from ca. 270 nm to 380 nm. The encapsulation of fitcBSA/PEG within PCL was subsequently characterized by laser confocal scanning microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. In vitro release Studies were conducted to evaluate sustained release potential of the core-sheath-structured composite nanofiber PCL-r-fitcBSA/PEG. As a negative control, composite nanofiber PCL/fitcBSA/PEG blend was prepared from a normal electrospinning method. It was found that core-sheath nanofibers PCL-r-fitcBSA/PEG pronouncedly alleviated the initial burst release for higher protein loading and gave better sustainability compared to that of PCL/fitcBSA/PEG nanofibers. The present study would provide a basis for further design and optimization of processing conditions to control the nanostructure of core-sheath composite nanofibers and ultimately achieve desired release kinetics of bioactive proteins (e.g., growth factors) for practical tissue engineering applications.

AB The use of forest fuels has more than doubled in Sweden over the last 25-30 years. Almost a fifth of the utilized energy is now based on forest biomass. Concurrently, real prices of bioenergy have decreased to less than a third of what they were 25 years ago. Some principal driving forces behind this development are identified and discussed in this paper.
   The origin of this development was equally the result of a foreseen shortage of fibre and a reaction to this vulnerable position, made obvious through the 'oil crises'. Although Sweden has a long tradition of large-scale use of forest energy, 35 years ago she was almost totally dependent on imported oil. Forest mechanisation provided rational solutions to handling small diameter wood and stumps in conventional industrial processes, but also enabled the economical use of such wood for energy.
   During 3 decades of development, drivers and obstacles have shifted. What started to reduce dependence on fossil fuels was later driven by increased general environmental awareness. An emerging 'green' lobby blocked the development of nuclear power and expanded harnessing of hydropower which were alternative means of self-sufficiency.
   In the last 10-15 years, focus has changed again. Global concern for climatic change due to emissions of greenhouse gases is a powerful driver, endorsing increased use Of CO2-neutral energy sources. Sustainability, resource cycling and the welfare of future generations are seen as goals for continued development.
   Ideals and policies do not, however, automatically induce change in regular operations. A set of drivers is identified, that has played the decisive role in practice. These include the direct technical-operational drivers, as well as indirect drivers through market development, taxation and other legislation. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In approximately 20,000 US wildfire "at-risk" communities, private citizen awareness and involvement is essential for the effective integration of sustainable fuel reduction programs with the establishment of local biomass/woody materials businesses and bioenergy facilities. The factors that influence local community bioenergy and wood products economic development are mostly social, political, and financial not biological, ecological, or technological. It is the private sector that is the driving force for creating and influencing sustainable forest resources and broadening access to public lands. The many years of no-wood harvesting policies in the United States have caused excessive overgrowth and eliminated local forest products markets. Now with the severe overgrowth, drought and beetle-infested conditions in many Southwestern forests, actions are necessary to reduce fire hazards, improve public safety, and promote forest health. It is the local communities that must take an active role in creating bioenergy facilities and wood products markets to use these fuel reduction supplies. A case in point is Prescott, Arizona, which is enclosed in the south and west by the Bradshaw Mountains and Sierra Prieta range. In 1990, under companion resolution of the Mayor of the City of Prescott and the Yavapai County Supervisors, the Prescott Area Wildland/Urban Interface Commission (PAWUIC) was formed to address the continuing growth of urban population into the wildland areas surrounding the Prescott basin. This organization of private volunteers and cooperating government agencies has the objectives to provide community fire safety education, wildland/urban fire hazard removal, and to promote the local markets for materials harvested from the wildland areas.

AB This work shows a full spectrum of research on Vitamin E TPGS-emulsified Poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) for paclitaxel formulation to improve its therapeutic index and to reduce the adverse effects of adjuvant Cremophor EL in its current clinical formulation of Taxol(R). Paclitaxel-loaded PLGA NPs were prepared by a modified solvent extraction/evaporation technique with vitamin E TPGS as emulsifier. The formulated NPs were found in quite uniform size of similar to 240 nm diameter. The in vitro drug release profile exhibited a biphasic pattern with an initial burst followed by a sustained release. In vitro HT-29 cell viability experiment demonstrated that the drug formulated in the NPs was 5.64, 5.36, 2.68, and 1.45 times more effective than that formulated in the Taxol(R) formulation after 24, 48, 72, 96 h treatment, respectively at 0.25 mu g/mL drug concentration, which should be even better with the sustainable release feature of the NPs formulation considered. In vivo PK measurement confirmed the advantages of the NP formulation versus Taxol(R). The area-under-the-curve (AUC) for 48 h for Vitamin E TPGS emulsified PLGA NP formulation of paclitaxel were found 3.0 times larger than that for the Taxol(R) formulation. The sustainable therapeutic time, at which the drug concentration drops below the minimum effective value, for the NP formulation could be 1.67 times longer than that for the Taxol(R) formulation.

AB On-farm production of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus inoculum can reduce the cost of the inoculum and increase utilization of this symbiosis in plant production. Bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) seedlings, colonized by AM fungi, were transplanted into raised bed enclosures. Media within the enclosures was vermiculite mixed with either field soil or yard clippings compost in Experiment I and vermiculite mixed with yard clippings compost or dairy manure/leaf compost in Experiment II. Compost and vermiculite mixtures yielded more propagules of AM fungi than soil-based mixtures in Experiment I. Growth of plants in a 1:4 (v/v) mixture of yard clippings compost and vermiculite produced more inoculum (503 propagules cm(-3)) than growth in 1:9 and 3 1:99 (v/v) mixtures (240 and 42 propagules cm(-3), respectively). Water, inorganic nutrient solution minus P, and fish protein digest were added to inoculum production enclosures in Experiment II. Results indicated that supplemental nutrient addition was unnecessary. This method produces a concentrated inoculum of AM fungi in a form readily used as an amendment to horticultural potting media for the production of vegetable seedlings. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Sizing on-farm reservoirs for crop-fish integration in rainfed farming
   systems in eastern India
SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID PONDS; HYDROLOGY; MODEL
AB For natural resource management and sustainable development of rainfed farming systems, the optimum size of the rainwater storage and recycling processes is essential for mitigating the uncertainty of rainfall. In the present study, a model is developed to predict the optimum size of the on-farm reservoir so as to provide supplemental irrigation to rice in monsoon season, pre-sowing irrigation to mustard in winter and to support fish cultivation in rainfed farming systems in Eastern India. The model is based on water balance approach for both the crop field and the reservoir, where hydro-meteorological parameters and the irrigation management practices are input to the model. The model predicts the reservoir sizes in terms of the percentage of the farm area under unlined and plastic lined conditions for two side slopes (horizontal: vertical) of 1-5:1 and 1:1 and two reservoir depths of 2 and 2.5m. The study reveals that for a 1-5:1 side slope, a return period of 5 yr requires 21.4% and 17.5% of the farm area for the unlined and 17.3% and 13.2% of the farm area for the lined reservoirs for depths of 2 to and 2.5 m, respectively. However, the same return period requires 18-9% and 14.9% of the farm area for the unlined and 14.7% and 10.7% of the farm area for the lined reservoirs at 1:1 side slope with a depth of 2 to and 2.5 m, respectively. Based on the simulated sizes, 1 yr of field experiments are undertaken for the plastic lined and unlined reservoirs with rice-mustard cropping system along with fish cultivation in the reservoirs. Economic analysts of the study reveals the benefit-cost ratio of 1.28 and 1.75, internal rate of return of 18-1% and 29.2% and capital recovery periods of 8 and 5 yr for the unlined and lined reservoir, respectively.

AB Over the last decade it has been ever increasing interest in developing alternative sanitary systems, which would be more sustainable than a conventional one is. In Sweden urine separation has been considered a promising approach towards increasing recycling of wastewater nutrients. Full scale trials are carried out and examined. This paper presents a study on implementation of urine separation system in urban environment. Technical and non-technical aspects of system performance are evaluated; system's interference with existing infrastructure is examined. Benefits and losses connected to urine separation system are analysed not only from environmental perspective but also system's owner point of view. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Firms and industries increasingly subscribe to voluntary codes of conduct. These self-regulatory governance systems can be effective in establishing a more sustainable and inclusive global economy. However, these codes can also be largely symbolic, reactive measures to quell public criticism. Cross-sector alliances (between for-profit and nonprofit actors) present a learning platform for infusing participants with greater incentives to be socially responsible. They can provide multinationals new capabilities that allow them to more closely ally social responsibility with economic performance. This paper examines learning facilitators in cross-sector alliances that enrich corporate understanding of stakeholder concerns. it suggests that these organizational learning experiments can translate into globally responsible practices and processes that improve the content and effectiveness of voluntary corporate codes.

TI The implications of reuse and recycling for the design of steel

DE reclaimed steel; reuse of materials; steel recycling; design for
   deconstruction; sustainable construction
AB There is an increasing interest in reuse and recycling in the Canadian construction industry. This. interest is driven partly by the recent adoption in Canada of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED (R)) Green Building Rating System and partly by a greater general awareness of environmental issues. Designers are beginning to look at how to incorporate reused steel components into construction projects, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions by saving on primary steel production. However, although some designers are willing to redesign their projects to make use of available reclaimed structural steel components, it is often difficult to identify suitable materials in the local area at the appropriate time in the life of a project. A limiting factor is that designers, construction companies, and others perceive a lack of a well-established and easily available mechanism for exchange of reclaimed components. This paper reviews the issues that are relevant to increasing recycling and reuse in construction and focuses on examples that illustrate the benefits that steel can bring to sustainable construction. In particular, it discusses the issues relevant to designing to enable future disassembly and the way in which steel components can be readily reused.

AB Mixedwood forests are an ecologically and economically important ecosystem in the boreal forest of northern Canada. The objectives of this study were to (i) compare the age-height relationships for dominant tree species growing on two contrasting soil types and originating from different disturbances (logging versus wildfire), and (ii) determine the influence of competition on tree growth. Eight stands were selected that encompassed two age-classes replicated on two soil types (clay loam and sand) in a split-plot design. Four of the eight stands originated from logging (21-26 years old), and the four others originated from wildfires (80 years old). Nonlinear age-height analyses were used to compare annual height and radial increment growth of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). Species, soil type, and size class explained significant amounts of the measured variation in the age-height models. Aspen, black spruce, and jack pine were 16%, 27%, and 19% taller, respectively, on clay soils than on sandy soils at the burned stand. Tree heights did not differ significantly among species or between soil types in logged stands. Diameter growth decreased as competition increased for black spruce and jack pine in the burned stands. The results for these three important boreal tree species are discussed in the context of sustainable forestry for boreal mixedwood forests.

AB Producers in the semiarid Brown soil zone of Saskatchewan have historically produced spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in fallow-based rotations because these cropping systems are profitable and risk efficient; however, their use has also been most damaging to soil quality. New wheat types and management methods have been developed that may offer wheat producers opportunities to enhance economic returns, while improving environmental sustainability. This study compares the economic merits of reducing fallow (F) frequency, using an annual legume green manure (LGM) crop as a summer fallow replacement, adopting a flex-cropping approach based on available soil water reserves (if water) or the need to control problem weeds (if weeds), and the production of Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat (W) versus the higher yielding Canada Prairie Spring (CPS) wheat class (HY). The results are based on 15 yr of data from seven crop rotations included in an ongoing experiment being conducted on an Orthic Brown Chemozem at the Semiarid Prairie Agricultural Research Centre at Swift Current, Saskatchewan. The crop rotations included F-W-W, LGM-W-W, F-HY-HY, F-W-W-W, continuous W (Cont W), Cont W (if water), and Cont W (if weeds). Cropping systems were managed using conservation tillage practices. They were fertilized with recommended rates of N and P based on soil tests, and crop residue was maintained as tall as possible (usually > 30 cm) to enhance snow trapping. The 1988-2002 study period was characterized by above normal growing season precipitation; thus, grain yields were also above average for this region. Results showed that producers will earn the highest net return with Cont W ($41 ha(-1)), despite this rotation having the highest production costs. Net returns ranked second highest for F-W-W-W, F-HY-HY, and the flex-crop rotations (about $15 ha-1 less than Cont W), and ranked lowest for F-W-W and LGM-W-W (about $25 ha(-1) less). However, since 1993, when the LGM was managed more effectively than in the first 6 yr, LGM-W-W was more profitable than F-W-W. On average, it was more profitable to produce CPS compared with CWRS wheat when the CPS/CWRS price ratio was greater than 0.8. Producers who are highly averse to risk would still choose cropping systems that included some summer fallow, while those with lower risk aversion would choose Cont W, but with all-risk crop insurance. In the absence of an all-risk crop insurance program, producers would typically choose Cont W (if water), F-W-W-W, or F-W-W. We concluded that area producers, who practice conservation tillage management and use tall stubble for snowtrapping, can enhance farm income by moving to more intensive cropping systems, and while doing so, they will foster improved environmental sustainability.

AB Sustainability of forest ecosystems and climate change are two critical issues for boreal forest ecosystems in Canada that require an understanding of the links and balance between productivity, soil processes and their interaction with natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Forest ecosystem models can be used to understand and predict boreal forest ecosystem dynamics. EFIMOD 2 is an individual tree model of the forest-soil ecosystem capable of modelling nitrogen feedback to productivity in response to changes in soil moisture and temperature. It has been successfully applied in Europe, but has not been calibrated for any forest ecosystem in Canada. The objective of this study was to parameterize and validate EFIMOD 2 for jack pine in Canada. Simulated and measured results agreed for changes in tree biomass carbon and soil carbon and nitrogen with increasing stand age and across a climatic gradient from the southern to northern limits of the boreal forest. Preliminary results from scenario testing indicate that EFIMOD 2 can be successfully applied to predict the impacts of forest management practices and climate change in the absence of natural disturbances on jack pine in the boreal forest of Canada. Model development is underway to represent the effects of natural disturbances.

AB Carbon (C) dynamics and forest management have become integrated in recent years, largely due to the Kyoto Protocol stipulating that forest C changes may be accountable in an emissions framework. A C stock modeling framework for forest managers is introduced in this paper. Empirical growth and yield models are used to develop sustainable timber supply for forest companies. These models use linear programming to solve the complex mathematical problem of timing and allocation of forest harvest and silviculture interventions. In this paper, we evaluated the effects of "business as usual" forest management versus management objectives to maximize C sequestration. Goal programming was used to minimize the deviation of two goals for C forest management: maximizing C in the forest, and maximizing the return on investment (net present value of forest timber products). Species-specific wood-to-C content conversion factors were used to parameterize the amount of C in forest stands on Canadian Forces Base Gagetown forest lands in New Brunswick, Canada. Goal programming reduced the loss of revenue associated with increasing C stocks in the forest. Partial harvesting and high valued end-products tended to increase C stocks and provided a higher return on investment in the simulations.

AB Over many decades, teaching and research in chemical engineering were largely directed towards the oil refining and commodity chemicals industries. However, changes in the structure of the process industries have placed an increased emphasis on the manufacture of speciality chemicals and consumer products. Such products, for both industrial and domestic use, often possess a microstructure on the scale of 1-1000 mu m which is created specifically to meet the user needs. There are significant challenges to chemical engineers in developing relevant teaching and research for the processing of such products.
   Chemical engineers are well placed to apply process engineering concepts to the design of manufacturing equipment on the scale unit operations. However, there are challenges to `stretch the boundaries of chemical engineering' so that appropriate teaching and research can be developed which is relevant to product microstructure at a lower scale, and to the supply chain at a much larger scale. Suggestions are made for teaching and research which can fit chemical engineers to identify and solve important issues of product design, product use, supply chain optimization and sustainability.
   In research, a multi-disciplinary approach will often be needed involving, e.g., chemistry, colloid science, measurement science, computation modelling, materials science, complex systems analysis and environmental science. In teaching, case studies should be developed as a means of providing students with an awareness of issues of product innovation, supply chain optimization, sustainability and consumer demand.

AB Biocatalysis has emerged over the years as a powerful methodology for synthesizing fine chemicals, vitamins and chiral intermediates and other key products of the chemical industry. In the future, many more applications in the synthesis of industrial chemicals based on renewable resources will be developed. Biocatalysis is also believed to deliver a major contribution to the production of biofuels as well as sustainable and biodegradable polymers.

AB Background: Impaired exercise tolerance is frequently observed in patients with COPD. Respiratory muscle endurance training (RMET) by means of normocapnic hyperpnea can be used to improve respiratory muscle function and probably exercise capacity. RMET is not applied on a large scale because complicated equipment is needed to maintain carbon dioxide homeostasis during hyperpnea, which can also be done by enlarging the dead space of the ventilatory system by breathing through a tube. Therefore, tube breathing might be a new, inexpensive method for home-based RMET. The aim of this study was to assess whether home-based RMET by means of tube breathing improves endurance exercise performance in patients with COPD.
   Methods: We randomized 36 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD to RMET by paced tube breathing (n = 18) or sham training (control, n = 18). Both groups trained twice daily, for 15 min, 7 days per week for 5 weeks.
   Results: Patients receiving RMET showed significant improvements in endurance exercise capacity (constant-load exercise on cycle ergometry; 18 min vs 28 min, p < 0.001), in perception of dyspnea (Borg score; 8.4 vs 5.4, p < 0.001), and respirators, muscle endurance capacity (sustainable inspiratory pressure; 25 cm H2O vs 31 CM H2O1 P = 0.005). Quality of life (chronic respiratory disease questionnaire) also improved (78.7 to 86.6, p = 0.001). The control group showed no significant changes.
   Conclusion: Home-based RMET by, means of tube breathing leads to a significant improvement of endurance exercise capacity, a reduction in perception of dyspnea, and an improvement in quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

AB 1. Antagonists of the V-2 vasopressin (AVP) receptor are aquaretic agents, inhibiting water resorption without stimulating electrolyte excretion. In this set of experiments, a novel V-2 receptor antagonist, RWJ-351647, was characterized in vitro and in vivo.
   2. RWJ-351647 displaced H-3-AVP binding from cloned human V-2 and V-1A receptors with Ki values of 1 nmol/L and 24 nmol/L. In assays using transfected HEK293 cells expressing either human or rat V-2 receptors, RWJ-351647 inhibited AVP-induced cAMP accumulation with Ki values of 3 nmol/L and 6 nmol/L, respectively.
   3. RWJ-351647 was very selective in binding assays and showed only weak functional antagonist activity at either the cloned human V-1B and oxytocin receptors or the human platelet V-1A receptor. No agonist activity was seen with the compound at any receptor.
   4. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed RWJ-351647 to be 41.9% bioavailable after a single oral administration. After repeated daily dosing over 5 days, the oral bioavailability remained at 43.9% with no change in the compound peak plasma levels or clearance rate.
   5. In efficacy studies, RWJ-351647 increased urine output and decreased urine osmolality with oral doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. In a multiple dose study in primates, RWJ-351647 maintained a consistent aquaretic effect over 10 days without increasing sodium or potassium excretion.
   6. In summary, RWJ-351647 was shown to be a selective and potent V-2 receptor antagonist with sustainable aquaretic activity in both rats and primates. The preclinical data suggest that RWJ-351647 is a potent and effective aquaretic agent with potential for use in diseases characterized by water retention.

TI Management of coastal areas in the Caspian Sea region: Environmental
   issues and political challenges
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Caspian Sea; coastal areas; enclosed water bodies; sustainable
   development
AB Enclosed coastal waters are subject to deterioration and eutrophication. Caspian Sea ( CS), the world's largest lake, located in western Asia, constitutes the focus of this article. The CS is possibly the world's third largest reservoir of oil and natural gas after the Persian Gulf and Russia. Hence, management of its coastal waters requires extraordinary efforts by all littoral states. Economical rivalries in the CS states have created an atmosphere of uncertainty in the future and commotion. In this article the geography, history, politics, and the environmental issues of the CS are discussed. It is concluded that future success of a sustainable coastal management scheme in this region can only be implemented with full cooperation and understanding between the countries neighboring the CS. Despite all existing differences, it is herewith submitted that sustainable growth and sound environmental plans in the coastal regions of the CS are attainable and will create unique growth opportunities for all countries bordering the CS (Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan) and countries that are located in the CS region (Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan). A sign of such cooperation has already emerged within the Caspian Environmental Programme (CEP), which initiated its activities in 1998 for the protection of the Caspian Sea marine environment and inland zone of 100 km. With the secure future of CEP, it can be a base for future agreements between the Caspian states regarding all aspects of the Caspian region.

AB This article examines the sociocultural, economic, and environmental causes of the decline of the artisanal fisheries in the rocky coast of Cape Creus ( NW Mediterranean) over the past decades. The changes that have occurred over time have favored trawlers, purse-seiners, shellfish fisheries, and tourism activities, to the detriment of artisanal fisheries. This article shows that the establishment of a marine reserve in 1998 could not reverse the observed decline in the artisanal fisheries. This raises the necessity of implementing a fishery management plan integrated into a coastal management plan, which should accompany the habitat protection. These plans could assist in the maintenance and the sustainable development of the artisanal fishing sector in Cape Creus as well as in other Mediterranean coastal areas where artisanal fisheries are also declining.

AB An approach for manufacturing cell formation with machine modification is presented. In cell formation it is often important in practice to be able to reassign parts to additional machine types in order to create better cell configurations. This involves extending the set of parts that certain individual machines can process, Such extensions may be cheaper than simply purchasing additional machines. Thus, there is the possibility of machine modification to reduce inter-cell travel. The cost of such modifications must be balanced by the consequent reduction in inter-cell travel cost. The extended machine cell fort-nation problem to be described involves the specification of which individual machines should be modified to enable them to process additional part types, part-machine assignment, and the grouping of individual machines for cell formation. The objective is to minimize the sum of the machine modification costs and the inter-cell travel. We call this the sustainable cell formation problem (SCFP). As far as the authors are aware, there have not been any solution procedures for this important problem reported in the open literature. It is our purpose to fill this gap by presenting a mixed integer programming model of the SCFP. We also propose and analyze greedy and tabu search heuristics for the design of large-scale systems related to the SCFP. Computational experience with the solution procedures indicates that they are likely to be useful additions to the production engineer's toolkit. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of the present paper is to select the best compromise irrigation planning strategy for the case study of Jayakwadi irrigation project, Maharashtra, India. Four-phase methodology is employed. In phase 1, separate linear programming (LP) models are formulated for the three objectives, namely. net economic benefits, agricultural production and labour employment. In phase 2, nondominated (compromise) irrigation planning strategies are generated using the constraint method of multiobjective optimisation. In phase 3, Kohonen neural networks (KNN) based classification algorithm is employed to sort nondominated irrigation planning strategies into smaller groups. In phase 4, multicriterion analysis (MCA) technique, namely, Compromise Programming is applied to rank strategies obtained from phase 3. It is concluded that the above integrated methodology is effective for modeling multiobjective irrigation planning problems and the present approach can be extended to situations where number of irrigation planning strategies are even large in number.

AB The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) regulates the ecolabeling of products from fisheries with the aim of promoting sustainable fishery practices. To date 11 fisheries have attained full certification and a further 7 are under review. Together these fisheries offer 220 ecolabeled marine products to consumers. Despite great potential to encourage sustainable fisheries, and thereby bring conservation benefits to marine systems, a range of issues may limit the wider uptake of MSC ecolabeled products. These include a general lack of consumer concern for marine fishes and sustainable fisheries, an absence of guaranteed continued financial benefits to participating fishers, and difficulties of quality assurance that are related to complexities of monitoring compliance of marine fisheries. In addition, it is apparent that property rights over the fishery seem to be an essential prerequisite for engagement in MSC, and this is one major impediment to wider uptake of the scheme in current marine fisheries, which tend to be open access. Some modifications to the current scheme may be needed if wider participation of marine fishers is to be achieved. These may include a tiered approach to certification, certification of fishers rather than fisheries, governmental facilitation to assist the latter, and greater engagement with retailers and buyers rather than individual consumers. None of these changes will occur without constructive engagement of government, retailers, and the fishing industry.

AB At the beginning of the 1990s, a combination of a sharp decline in shellfish populations and mass bird mortality in the Dutch Wadden Sea led to a conflict between conservationists and the shellfishery. The conflict gave rise to the establishment of a shellfish management policy in 1993. Although this policy certainly improved upon the old situation, without clear restrictions on fishing effort, the policy has been unable to manage the complex ecosystem satisfactorily. This paper addresses the question of why the conflict was not resolved. At the heart of the problem lie an improperly functioning co-management arrangement and general disagreement about which changes in the management policy should be adopted. In order to understand the fishing industry, the conservationist and the government positions in the co-management arrangement, we analyse what has been the impact of the current shellfish policy on the satisfaction of the objectives of the various stakeholders. We examine whether the implementation of alternative policy scenarios could lead to the establishment of a sustainable shellfishery. The case of the Dutch shellfishery is an important example of an unsustainable management policy. As such, this paper illuminates many of the problems faced by fisheries management regimes worldwide and suggests how some of them could be avoided. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple and reproducible algal tissue extraction protocol and a total antioxidant, radical cation decolourisation spectroscopic assay has been developed. This was applied to ascertain the potential for using algae and their stress responses as biological and biochemical indicators of environmental impacts in urban ponds. Total antioxidant and soluble protein profiles were constructed for the green alga Cladophora glomerata, which was seasonally sampled, from three sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) ponds located in an industrial and residential development created on a former Greenfield area in Fife, Scotland. Algal antioxidant profiles were impacted by a combination of lifecycle and pond structural parameters, including: seasonal sampling time, pond site and pond structure (e.g. inlet, outlet). The assay, as applied to algae as primary producer-indicator organisms is recommended for use in aquatic environmental monitoring programmes, which have a requirement to maintain the health status of disturbed aquatic urban ecosystems.

AB Transformation in human-dominated ecosystems results from cumulative impacts of human activity. A comprehensive system for State of Environment Reporting (SOER) must take into account indicators of stress on ecosystems, indicators of the state of the system (i.e., ecosystem structure and function), and indicators of social response (policy interventions). The Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model for State of Environment Reporting developed by Statistics Canada in the mid 1970s incorporated these elements. By adopting an ecosystem perspective, it represented a significant advance from the then prevailing engineering-based approaches, with their focus on contaminants in air, water and land. The PSR model, however, has its own inherent limitations: its focus on isolating "pressures", "states", and "responses" tends to provide a static representation of the environment, ignoring the significant dynamic processes that comprise the interactions between these components. The PSR model also lacks a 'bottom line' that would provide the policy community and the public with an overall assessment of environmental trends. These limitations can be overcome by adopting an ecosystem health approach, which allows for a determination of the overall viability of environments and for the identification of the collective pressures from human activity that threaten that viability. An ecosystem health approach also allows for a more explicit connection between the state of the environment and human well-being. In this paper, we trace the evolution of SOER and provide some of the building blocks for overcoming its present limitations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although the "new" economic geography has explored links between the subdiscipline's traditional areas of study and cultural, institutional, and political realms, environmental issues remain comparatively underresearched within the subdiscipline. This article contends not only that the environment is of key importance to economic geography, but also that economic geographers can make an important contribution to environmental debates, through providing not just a better analysis and theoretical understanding, but also better policy proscription. Rather than claim new intellectual territory, the intention is to suggest potential creative opportunities for linking economic geography's strengths with those insights from other theoretical perspectives. In particular, this article focuses upon linking insights from ecological modernization theory, developed by environmental sociologists, with regulationist approaches.

AB Although ecosystem-based management can lead to sustainable resource use, its successful implementation depends on stakeholders' acceptance. A framework to integrate scientific knowledge about the ecosystems with stakeholders' preferences is therefore needed. We propose here a 'Public Sentiment Index,' or PSI, as an integration framework that combines an ecosystem model (Ecopath with Ecosim; EwE) with a public choice model (the damage schedule). Using Chesapeake Bay as a case study, we demonstrate the development of the PSI, based on judgments of Bay stakeholders, including 'watermen' (commercial fishers), seafood wholesalers and retailers, recreational fishers, representatives from non-governmental organizations, scientists and managers on a range of Bay ecosystems. The high PSI for Chesapeake Bay suggests a consensus amongst Bay stakeholders who, understanding the need for restoring the Bay ecosystem, may accept difficult policy choices and support their implementation.

AB The design and use of heat sinks, which are compatible with sustainable development, involves a subtle balance between a superior thermal design, minimum material consumption, and minimum pumping power. Due to the rapid proliferation of electronic systems, substantial material streams, energy consumption, and entropy generation rates are associated with the cooling of computers, as well as other categories of electronic equipment. This presentation reviews the theory underpinning the least-energy optimization of natural and forced convection air cooled heat sinks, using the total coefficient of performance, relating the cooling capability to the energy invested in the operation and fabrication of the heat sink, as the sustainability 'metric'. Particular attentions is devoted to the determination of the most favorable fin and channel aspect ratios for plate and pin fin arrays, the allocation of available energy between fabrication and operation, and the selection of fin material, for both natural and forced convection air-cooled heat sinks.

DT Article
DE renewable energies; poor; energy access
AB Renewable energies are considered as an essential element of any strategy for sustainable energy development. The poor in the developing world without access to modern energies are regarded as a major market for renewable energies. This short paper attempts to analyse whether such a niche is backed by any economic logic and whether renewable energy and the poor nexus could be a strategy for success. The paper Suggests that contrary to the common belief, the economic logic behind the niche is unsound and that the nexus is not a recipe for success. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the results of case studies examining two independent projects that worked to bring solar home systems (SHSs) to isolated communities in El Salvador. Both projects were implemented by small nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that did not have prior experience with SHSs. One project was market-based: families were given the opportunity to purchase the systems at going prices. The other was donor-based: residents were provided the equipment in return for their agreement to cooperate in local environmental protection efforts. Results of a comparative analysis support several conclusions. (1) For small NGOs, the promotion of markets is appealing because of the potential for financial sustainability; yet a reliance on markets may also heighten complexity and increase opportunities for failure. (2) In implementation of market-based projects, all stakeholders, including potential consumers, private-sector service providers, and the staff of NGOs acting as project managers, will face pressures to modify and adapt their attitudes and behaviors. (3) Alternative models for small-scale projects that integrate market-based and donor-based design features deserve consideration. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The issue of regulating greenhouse gas emissions of developing countries is one of the main reasons for the US's retreat from ratifying the Kyoto Protocal, and this deserves particular attention in order to ensure that a robust international climate policy exists in the future. Enabling developing countries to move toward low-carbon energy systems would enhance the feasibility for their participation in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This study evaluates wind, solar, and biomass energy sources in a rural area of Chigu in southwestern Taiwan by means of analyzing technical, economic, environmental, and political implications in order to establish an evaluation model for developing local renewable energy sources. The adopted approach evaluates local potentials of renewable energy sources with the aid of a geographic information system according to actual local conditions, and allows the assessment to consider local potentials and restrictions such as climate conditions, land uses, and ecological environments, thus enabling a more-accurate assessment than is possible with evaluations on an approximate basis. These results may help build a developmental vision for sustainable energy systems based on locally available natural resources, and facilitate a transition of national energy and environmental policies towards sustainability.

AB This study uses an endogenous switching-regress ion model to examine the impact of slash-and-burn cultivation practice on the application of commercial fertilizer and pesticides, as well as yields and net returns. The empirical evidence of the study indicates that cross-section analysis of the impact of technology adoption on input demand and output supply should take into consideration sample selection, and also examine the impact separately for adopters and non-adopters. The results show that education, access to credit, land rights, and visits by extension agents reduce the probability of farmers adopting slash-and-burn farm practices. Environmental variables, such as soil quality and plot slope, do not impact on the adoption decision, but affect Output Supply of both adopters and non-adopters of slash-and-burn technology.

AB Integrated assessment of decisions under uncertainty for sustainable development (IANUS) is a method for aiding public decisionmaking that supports efforts towards sustainable development and has a wide range of applications. We introduce the main features of IANUS and illustrate the method by using the results of a case study in the Torgau region (eastern Germany) with conflicts over economic development and groundwater protection in the Elbe River basin. IANUS structures the decision process into four steps: scenario derivation, criteria selection, modelling, and evaluation. Its overall aim is to support the finding of policy solutions in a participatory setting and to extract the information needed for a sound, responsible decision in a clear, transparent manner. The method is designed for use in conflict situations where environmental and socioeconomic effects need to be considered and so an interdisciplinary approach is required. Special emphasis is placed on a broad perception and consideration of uncertainty. Three types of uncertainty are explicitly taken into account by IANUS: development uncertainty (uncertainty about the social, economic and other developments that affect the consequences of decision), model uncertainty (uncertainty associated with the prediction of the effects of decisions), and weight uncertainty (uncertainty about the appropriate weighting of the criteria). The backbone of IANUS is a multicriteria method with the ability to process uncertain information. In the case study the multicriteria method PROMETHEE is used. As PROMETHEE in its basic versions is not able to process uncertain information an extension of this method is developed here and described in detail. One methodological lesson to be learned from the experience of the case study reads that the design of the participation process must be planned and executed carefully to prevent important stakeholders backing out of the participatory evaluation process-as happened with the decisionmakers in the Torgau case study.

AB Translating environmental concern into social debate and public policy is one of the notable achievements of industrial societies over the past generation. Yet the process that has emerged in rich countries does not appear to be simply transferable, or even tenable, over time. The search for sustainable development may, accordingly, require practical models of social change that have yet to be invented or imagined. In this paper, the problems of applying the existing model of environmentalism to two kinds of cities are analyzed: poor cities, in which population is growing faster than income, and rich cities, whose local environmental problems have been largely solved, but whose residents make consumption and investment choices with distant environmental impacts that are hard to perceive.

AB This paper highlights the importance of considering ecological sustainability issues in any city's infrastructure plans and investments. It reviews the South African government's current and planned investment in urban infrastructure, both to enhance economic growth and to contribute to poverty reduction, and what this implies for Cape Town. It highlights the lack of attention given to ecological issues and the dangers of assuming that the resources will be available to support it, and that prices for fresh water, fossil fuels and food will not rise. It also points to Cape Town's large ecological footprint (comparable to that of Canada, per person) and its heavy dependence on non-renewable resources, especially oil-which means that every oil price rise transfers money from the Cape Town economy to national and global financial circuits. Housing lower-income groups in conventional housing with no attention to a more compact, less automobile-dependent city form exposes them to high water and energy costs. The paper ends by pointing to the advantages for the city and for lower-income groups of including ecological issues, and outlines the possibilities for doing so.

AB This paper describes how the city of Panjim (capital of Goa, in India) and its wider region could meet the multiple goals that sustainable development requires - combining high quality living conditions, a successful economy, and sustainable levels of resource use and waste generation. It outlines the methodologies used and describes the changes needed in the use and management of water and land, infrastructure, buildings and transport systems, and in the governance framework needed to underpin such changes. It uses the term "RUrban" to highlight how this requires a sustainable integration of rural and urban communities, where rural living standards come to match those in urban areas and where cities become net producers of ecological services rather than relying on regional and global resources and waste sinks.

   transport; urban centres; urban design; urban form
ID ENERGY
AB Making existing cities and new urban development more ecologically based and liveable is an urgent priority in the global push for sustainability. This paper discusses ten critical responses to this issue and summarizes them in a simple conceptual model that places the nexus between transport and urban form at the heart of developing an eco-city. This involves compact, mixed-use urban form, well-defined higher-density, human-oriented centres, priority to the development of superior public transport systems and conditions for non-motorized modes, with minimal road capacity increases, and protection of the city's natural areas and food-producing capacity. These factors form the framework in which everything else is embedded and must operate, and if they are not addressed only marginal changes in urban sustainability can be made. Within this framework, environmental technologies need to be extensively applied. Economic growth needs to emphasize creativity and innovation and to strengthen the environmental, social and cultural amenities of the city. The public realm throughout the city needs to be of a high quality, and sustainable urban design principles need to be applied in all urban development All these dimensions need to operate within two key processes involving vision-oriented and reformist thinking and a strong, community-oriented, democratic sustainability framework for decision-making.

TI Towards adaptive town environmental planning: the experience from

ID DELPHI METHOD; MANAGEMENT; URBAN
AB In China, concern is growing with regard to environmental issues related to the growth of peri-urban towns. Rapid urbanization and the backlog in constructing needed environmental infrastructure have resulted in severe environmental issues for many peri-urban towns, affecting their sustainable development. In Xiamen, a coastal city, town-level environmental planning was proposed in 2003 as an important tool to control Pollution and conserve ecosystems. But for environmental planning to work, it needs to be more adaptable to local circumstances and decision-making processes. This paper presents a framework for adaptive environmental management and discusses how it was implemented in Dongfu Town, one of the peri-urban towns around Xiamen. It describes the principles of adaptive peri-urban town environmental planning and how this process integrates information from multiple sources and different stakeholders. This experience shows how science can be integrated into the decision-making process, avoiding both the narrow-minded viewpoints of planners and the natural resource use conflicts among a variety of stakeholders. It also shows how the environmental planning process can propose results that are acceptable to local communities and decision makers, even when they suggest directions that were not in accordance with the public's initial priorities. Finally, it shows that sustainable development of targeted areas can be achieved through well-designed environmental planning.

TI The Ecological Footprint of cities and regions: comparing resource
   availability with resource demand
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English

DE Ecological Footprint; regional governance; resource accounts;
   sustainability
AB Cities and regions depend on resources and ecological services from distant ecosystems. The well-being of city and region residents is affected by both the health and availability of these ecosystems, especially in today's ecologically strained world. The management of a city or region's resource metabolism, including the natural capital that supports these flows, is becoming increasingly a central concern to cities and regions that want to succeed. Urban infrastructure is long-lasting and influences resource needs for decades to come: which cities are building future resource traps, and which are opportunities for resource-efficient and more competitive lifestyles? Reliable measures comparing the supply of natural capital to human demand are indispensable for managing resource metabolism, as they help identify challenges, set targets, track progress and drive policies for sustainability. This paper describes one such measurement tool: the Ecological Footprint. After explaining the assumptions behind the Footprint and describing some representative findings, it provides examples of how this resource accounting tool can assist local governments in managing their ecological assets, and support their sustainability efforts.

TI Planning with Ecological Footprints: a sympathetic critique of theory

SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
DE cities; Ecological Footprint; hinterlands; planning; sustainability
ID CITIES
AB The concept of the Ecological Footprint has become a popular and increasingly used approach in environmental policy and planning, for western cities in particular. The concept is useful not least as a metaphor that effectively communicates the message that environmental impacts extend beyond the built area of cities. However, the use of Ecological Footprint analysis as a measuring tool is problematic, particularly when it is used as a tool for comparisons between jurisdictions. This paper sets out the benefits of the concept, indicates its history and use, and offers a sympathetic critique of both the theory and practice of Ecological Footprints. We believe this is necessary so that policy makers thinking of adopting this approach are aware of its strengths and limitations, and avoid using the concept in a mariner that may be misleading.

ID COMPARATIVE RISK-ASSESSMENT
AB Following the Earth Summit in 1992, Cuba designed and implemented a variety of programs, administrative structures, and public awareness activities to promote sound environmental management and sustainable development. This came shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union and the strengthening of the US blockade in 1990, which resulted in a 35% drop in Cuban GDP. This period, referred to as the Special Period, witnessed a decrease in many environmentally damaging activities both by choice and by necessity, but also resulted in many decisions to resuscitate the Cuban economy. The purpose of this work was to compare and rank the environmental risks Cuba faced before and during the Special Period (1990-2000) using two Comparative environmental risk assessments (CERAs). To do so, an ecosystem integrity risk assessment matrix was constructed with 42 risk end points. The matrix assessed the fisk posed by 17 problem areas including air pollution, water contamination, solid waste sites, pesticides and ecosystem degradation. The risks were calculated using five criteria: area affected, vulnerability of affected population, severity of impact, irreversibility of effect and uncertainty. To construct this matrix, both literature reviews and expert interviews in Cuba were conducted in 2000. The results showed a general decrease in risk scores during the Special Period. Before the Special Period, high risks were posed by: terrestrial degradation and industrial wastewater and sludge, followed by freshwater degradation, surface water stressors, and pesticides. After the Special Period, industrial wastewater and sludge and pesticides were no longer high-risk areas, but municipal wastewater and marine coastal degradation ranked higher than previously. Also, the fisk endpoints most stressed after 1990 were affected by activities controlled by the government, such as mining and tourism, and lack of infrastructure. Therefore, the claims that public environmental education is the main pathway to sustainable development in Cuba seem uninformed and other management practices should be evaluated.

AB Scarcity of groundwater necessitates the present study to evaluate groundwater potential and quality for designing suitable water management plans in the Bhatsa and Kalu river basins in the Thane district in the western Deccan volcanic province of India. A Geographical Information System platform is used to integrate and spatially analyse multiparametric data comprised of satellite, topographical, geological and hydrogeological information to generate several thematic maps, including groundwater potential zonation map. This study reveals that 70% of the area has medium to low groundwater potential, while only 10% has high potential. The static and dynamic groundwater potentials are estimated to be 10.7 and 4.8% of the annual rainfall. The groundwater quality in terms of hardness, total dissolved solids, salinity and chloride is suitable for domestic and irrigational purposes. A database is developed for sustainable water management program for the region and areas where suitable water conservation techniques need to be adopted are identified.

AB Karst rocky desertification in karst areas of Southwest China is an obstacle for the sustainable development of the locality. While many researchers have studied this issue, this study quantified the various indicators affecting desertification, using GIS technology to extract spatial data and to construct a RBFN (radial basis function network) model for Guizhou province. By calibrating sample data of the different levels of karst rocky desertification, the model parameters were established, and then the assessment of karst rocky desertification. Results show that in counties of Southwestern Guizhou Province karst rocky desertification is severe, counties in northern Guizhou have moderate desertification, and southeastern counties are affected lightly. Comparison of the results with other research shows conformity with actual conditions, proving the reasonability and applicability of the RBFN model.

DE the Water Framework Directive; river basin management plans; the
   Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive
AB This paper highlights, explores and reflects on the linkages between the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive. The assessment of river basin management plans (RBMPs), the key procedural linkage between the two Directives, is addressed. The assessment of other actions affecting the water environment, particularly land use plans, could also aid the achievement of the aims of the Water Framework Directive. As water quality is related intimately to the development and use of land, this significant issue is considered. There are numerous potential benefits that could arise from exploring the linkages between these two pieces of EU environmental legislation. These are highlighted, and include encouraging resource savings, generating a holistic approach to water resource management and ultimately the promotion of more sustainable forms of development.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; INDICATORS; CHALLENGES; SCIENCE
AB Management by objectives (MBO) is a technique for integrating ecological concerns into national political and administrative structures. Politicians determine environmental objectives and interim targets to be implemented and assessed by civil servants in national, regional, and local contexts. Well-developed organizational communication is a prerequisite for MBO. However, communication-related obstacles can arise when using MBO in public environmental management. We examine communicative aspects of environmental MBO, looking specifically at the implementation, administration, and assessment of Swedish environmental quality objectives. Our argument is illustrated by quotations from individual and focus group interviews. We conclude that communicative problems may arise, because different actors interpret messages from different perspectives, depending on their agendas, prior knowledge and experience, and positions in the administrative system. It is crucial to recognize the dialogical aspects of communication, by involving the receiver of a message in a process of response. In addition, the different timeframes underlying different arguments could contribute to misunderstandings between actors involved in handling environmental issues. In assessing the achievement of environmental objectives, indicators are used as communicative tools. It is important to investigate whether and how these indicators contribute to the de- and recontextualization of environmental objectives.

AB An innovative management strategy is proposed for optimized and integrated environmental management for regional or national groundwater contamination prevention and restoration allied with consideration of sustainable development. This management strategy accounts for availability of limited resources, human health and ecological risks from groundwater contamination, costs for groundwater protection measures, beneficial uses and values from groundwater protection, and sustainable development. Six different categories of costs are identified with regard to groundwater prevention and restoration. In addition, different environmental impacts from groundwater contamination including human health and ecological risks are individually taken into account. System optimization principles are implemented to accomplish decision-makings on the optimal resources allocations of the available resources or budgets to different existing contaminated sites and projected contamination sites for a maximal risk reduction. Established management constraints such as budget limitations under different categories of costs are satisfied at the optimal solution. A stepwise optimization process is proposed in which the first step is to select optimally a limited number of sites where remediation or prevention measures will be taken, from all the existing contaminated and projected contamination sites, based on a total regionally or nationally available budget in a certain time frame such as 10 years. Then, several optimization steps determined year-by-year optimal distributions of the available yearly budgets for those selected sites. A hypothetical case study is presented to demonstrate a practical implementation of the management strategy. Several issues pertaining to groundwater contamination exposure and risk assessments and remediation cost evaluations are briefly discussed for adequately understanding implementations of the management strategy.

AB Using a two-player differential game approach, this paper deals with the issue of tropical deforestation. The assumption is that developing forestry countries (called the South) do not, or cannot, necessarily have the same utility for forest conservation than the developed countries (called the North). Given the global nature of the problem, we assume that it may be wise that the North offers financial support to the South to help in achieving a sustainable forest policy. We derive sustainable and short-run deforestation policies and provide a transfer mechanism which insures that the South will indeed implement the sustainable one.

AB This paper uses a dynamic model to explore the issue of irrigation-induced salinity, which puts irrigation at risk in most irrigated areas throughout the world. We address the design of instruments that an irrigation district board could implement to induce irrigators to take sustainable irrigation decisions. In our approach, the irrigators located above an aquifer participate in the accumulation of groundwater, a stock pollution. We analyse input-based instruments to induce the agents to follow the optimal stock path.

AB Despite the progress made in controlling local air pollution, urban areas show increasing signs of environmental stress and air quality is one of the major concerns. The findings of several studies provide evidence that the shape of a city and the land use distribution determine the location of emission sources and the pattern of urban traffic, affecting urban air quality.
   This work focuses on the potential impacts of different land use patterns oil urban air quality. Three imaginary cities were created, based on alternative urban planning strategies, considering different land use patterns: from the scenario of urban sprawl to the opposite scenario of a compact city with mixed land use. The mesoscale photochemical system MEMO/MARS was applied to evaluate the urban air quality in each of the idealized city structures.
   Simulation results indicate that more compact cities with mixed land use provide better urban air quality compared to disperse and network cities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the face of unprecedented economic and industrial growth levels, China is rapidly developing its system of environmental governance. Coming from a conventional command-and-control approach to environmental policy, which fitted well its centrally planned economy, transitional China is swiftly reforming and diversifying its environmental approaches, instruments, arrangements and legal regulations. This article aims to grasp and assess the direction, extent and speed of change in China's environmental governance. New relations between state, market and civil society, and an opening up towards the outside world characterise new modes of environmental governance that try to turn China's development path in more sustainable directions.

AB Up to now China's environmental reform has been mainly a state-led process. Yet, to enable further environmental improvements increased involvement of citizens and consumers is inevitable. This article explores existing, newly developing and future forms and channels of public participation in China's environmental management. Opportunities for public participation are analysed against the background of actual environmental parameters and in relation to China's specific political and socio-cultural dynamics. This contextual analysis of the ( potential) roles for civil actors is framed around five environmental issues, which are central to the contemporary Chinese environmental debate: ( 1) protection of nature and bio-diversity; ( 2) local control of environmental pollution; ( 3) construction of green company images; ( 4) establishment of sustainable household practices; and ( 5) participation in international conventions and treaties.

AB This study extends the great fish war model of Levhari and Mirman [Levhari, D. and Mirman, L. (1980) Bell Journal of Economics 11: 322-344] by incorporating a multiple country context into the model and investigates the existence of a partial coordination Nash equilibrium. First, findings of this paper suggest that a partial coordination scheme is sustainable only in limited cases. Any coalition that has more than two member countries cannot be sustained. Second, the existence and the number of coordinating countries depend critically on the magnitude of the biological and preference parameters. Finally, if the coalition is assumed to be a dominant player, there always exist one or two welfare-improving sustainable coalitions and the size of the sustainable coalitions depends on the parameters of the problem.

AB A feature of the sustainability problem is that the preferences of future generations are uncertain. In this paper, we put forward a fairness-based definition of sustainability that takes this uncertainty into account. We analyze the implications of this definition in the context of a model of project evaluation. We show that our definition encompasses the concepts of non-declining welfare and of weak and strong sustainability. Furthermore, we show that preference uncertainty has a substantial influence on the implications of sustainability.

AB This article presents a new methodology for the management of dredging operations. Partly derived from existing methodologies (OECD, UNEP, AIPCN), its aim is to be more complete, by integrating the qualities and complementarities of former methodologies. Moreover, it was carried out in a context of sustainable development. Indeed, it supports, according to a framework of industrial ecology, the development and the implementation of solutions of waste improvement of dredged materials, in order to minimize the environmental impact of dredging. It also uses a tool of MultiCriteria Decision-Making Aid (M.C.D.M.A.), in order to integrate local characteristics. In addition, this tool, called DRAGSED, allows to a dialogue to be established between all the parties concerned with a dredging project (harbour's authorities, industrialists, municipalities, administrations, populations, associations....). Thus, the implementation of this methodology enables consensus to be reached for the dredging solution retained. It also proposes an environmental follow-up, which will allow an evaluation during its application.

AB The relevance of endocrine-disrupting compounds as potential contaminants of drinking water is reviewed, particularly in the reuse of wastewater. Growing populations and increasing intensification of land and water use for industry and agriculture have increased the need to reclaim wastewater for reuse, including to supplement the drinking water supply. The variety of anthropogenic chemicals that have been identified as potential endocrine disruptors in the environment and the problems arising from their use as human and livestock pharmaceuticals, as agricultural chemicals and in industry are discussed. The potentially adverse impact of these chemicals on human health and the ecology of the natural environment are reviewed. Data for the removal of estrogenic compounds from wastewater treatment are presented, together with the comparative potencies of estrogenic compounds. The relative exposure to estrogens of women on oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and through food consumption is estimated. A brief overview of some methods available or under development for the assessment of estrogenic activity in environmental samples is provided. The review concludes with a discussion of the directions for further investigation, which include human epidemiology, methodology development, and wastewater monitoring.

AB Generalist predators play a key role in agriculturally and environmentally sustainable systems of pest control. A detailed knowledge on their ecology, however, is needed to improve management practices to maximize their service of pest control. The present study examines the habitat use and activity patterns of larval and adult Cantharis beetles that are abundant predators in arable land. Laboratory experiments revealed that sixth instar larvae of Cantharis fusca and Cantharis livida significantly preferred high relative humidity levels of 85-90% to lower ones. This can explain their preference for meadows over fields due to the more favorable microclimatic conditions in the former habitats. Surface activity of sixth instar Cantharis larvae during autumn, winter and early spring occurred at soil temperatures above 0 degrees C. However, no correlation between surface activity and soil temperature, air temperature or relative humidity was found above 0 degrees C. Catches of sixth instar Cantharis larvae within fenced pitfall traps were higher in a meadow (Mean +/- S.D.; 13.8 +/- 7.63 individuals m(-2)) than in a field (4.60 +/- 2.89 individuals m(-2)). Mark-recapture density estimations for sixth instar larvae indicated mean densities of 25.9 +/- 5.63 (field) and 42.8 +/- 16.0 individuals m(-2) (meadow). The same pattern was found for adult emergence rates in the field (0.17 +/- 0.39 adults m(-2)) and meadow (1.83 +/- 1.17 adults m(-2)) as well as for adult densities in the vegetation (field 4.89 +/- 3.62 adults 60 m(-2); meadow 12.5 +/- 11.2 adults 60 m(-2)). It is concluded that especially in winter elements that provide plant cover should be incorporated in arable fields to enhance larval cantharid population densities and to attract them from their prime grassland habitats into arable sites.

AB The leaching of phosphorus (P) within soils can be a limiting consideration for the sustainable operation of intensive livestock enterprises. Sorption curves are widely used to assist estimation of P retention, though the effect of effluent constituents on their accuracy is not well understood. We conducted a series of P-sorption-desorption batch experiments with an Oxic Haplustalf (soil 1), Haplusterts (soils 2 and 3), and a Natrustalf (soil 4). Phosphorus sources included effluent, orthophosphate-P in a matrix replicating the effluent's salt constituents (the reference solution), and an orthophosphate-P solution. Treated soils were incubated for up to 193 days before sequential desorption extraction. Effluent constituents, probably the organic or particulate components, temporarily increased the vulnerability of sorbed-P to desorption. The increase in vulnerability was removed by 2-113 days of incubation (25 degrees C). Despite vigorous extraction for 20 consecutive days, some P sorbed as part of the treatments of soils 1 and 2 was not desorbed. The increased vulnerability due to effluent constituents lasted a maximum of about one cropping season and, for all other treatments, adsorption curves overestimated vulnerability to desorption. Therefore, adsorption curves provide a conservative estimate of vulnerability to desorption where effluent is used in continued crop production in these soils.

TI New urban governance processes on the level of neighbourhoods
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The spatial. concentration of multi-dimensional problems in parts of urban areas and the related trend towards socio-economic and ethnical fragmentations is a known but unanswered question in international urban research as well as of high socio-political relevance. The present study analyses a new model of governing at the urban level which can be described by "New Urban Governance" and the influence it has on the development of urban areas. Beside the term "governance " key terms such as "network of actors ". "change of institutions ", "participation ", "empowerment", "activating state" or "civil society" are involved in this study, too. In line with a multi-level analysis of New Urban Governance processes the small-dimensional level of a neighbourhood is important here entailing two other topics like "neighbourhood management" and "neighbourhood governance". With a view to an integrated sustainable urban development the transformation of the urban political-administrative control system into a New Urban Governance culture is analysed in art example of the URBAN II operational programme implemented in Dortmund-Nordstadt where neighbourhood approaches and integrated action programmes are being tried out. The objective of this study is to disclose the connections between actions of actors, political-administrative structures and relevant institutions, the disputes over "space and power" as well as the utilization, adaptation and shaping of place between "top-down" and "bottom-up" strategies against a background of a modern institutional and action-theoretical-orientated geographic urban research to detect entrenched obstacles to and prospects for urban development programmes.

TI The fiscal background of the Russian revolution
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF ECONOMIC HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
AB This article examines important aspects of the interaction between the fiscal history and political events of tsarist Russia's final years in the light of macroeconomic theories of government budget constraints. Using econometric tests of intertemporal stability and techniques of intervention analysis, I find that tsarist Russia had achieved a sustainable peacetime balance in its fiscal relations by the eve of World War I, but that this balance was lost under the strain of wartime financial difficulty.

TI Receptivity to social research by the CGIAR
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper analyses the way the CGIAR system has incorporated social research in its agenda. Since 1995, the social science staff capacity in the CGIAR has decreased by 24%, and the overall balance of social science research is still significantly tilted away from the core germplasm enhancement, production systems/natural resources management, and technology adoption work - the 'bread and butter' of technology generation and development effort - toward ex-ante and ex-post activities, Further, the bulk of the social science research has low social research content despite the significant expansion of the CGIAR initial goal of increasing the proverbial pile of rice' to poverty alleviation and sustainable food security. The paper concludes that a concerted effort is now required to mainstream social research in the CGIAR system, and this cannot occur without the full support of the CGIAR donors, the CGIAR senior managers, and the centre boards and executive staff.

AB The English Channel cuttlefish fishery provides one of the highest cephalopod yields in the north-east Atlantic, with catches by many interacting fishing gears. The aim of this study is to show that population modelling can be developed for this stock and that model estimates are useful to address practical issues such as diagnostics of fishing pressure and interactions between fishing fleets. Abundance indices were calculated from catch and effort data using a General Linear Model and stock size was assessed with analytical methods based on biological data collected since 1996. Cohort analysis was carried out on six cuttlefish cohorts on a monthly basis using catch-at-age data and the results were integrated in a Thomson and Bell model to simulate production and biomass of the stock. GLM indices indicated a strong seasonal pattern of abundance with a peak of adult abundance in spring and of juveniles in autumn. Cohort analysis estimates show that recruitment can vary by a factor of 2 between years. Estimated fishing mortalities indicate rather stable exploitation patterns. Diagnostics show that each studied cohort was generally fully exploited, and do not reveal evidence of recruitment over-fishing. Simulations of fishing fleet interactions for the resource show that otter trawls play a dominant role in cohort exploitation whereas artisanal trap net fisheries are described as "dependent" on other gears. In spite of biological differences between teleost fishes and cephalopods, classical age-based models can be adapted to cuttlefish to provide fishery management advice. Although marked over-fishing was not observed, the studied cohorts were subjected to high catch rates and there is little scope for increased exploitation. Interactions between the fishing fleets involved underline the point that management in the coastal zone alone is not sufficient to ensure sustainable exploitation in a migrating species.

ID FISHERIES-MANAGEMENT; IMPACT
AB Fishery policy formation is a multilateral political process that typically involves conflicting attitudes towards management, and opposing interests among resource users. As fisheries resources continue to decline, conflict between and within fishing sectors will grow. The challenge for fisheries policy makers is to ensure fisheries resources are evenly allocated among the stakeholders whilst managing resources in a sustainable manner. Australian fisheries management has been revolutionized by the introduction of Integrated Fisheries Management (IFM), which is based on a systematic approach involving the inclusion of all sectors in the management process. This approach means determining the total amount of fish that can be harvested from a fishery and then adopting management strategies for allocating explicit catch shares between the competing sectors. The recent increased burden on fisheries stocks, caused by higher recreational user participation, has forced policy makers to make large changes relating to the allocation of resources. Policy makers in Western Australia, aware of conflict developing between users of the abalone resource, developed a unique management system based on resource sharing. By integrating the recreational sector in the overall management process, the primary objective of the new agenda is to decrease conflict between competing users and develop a management system without partisanship.

AB The paper describes the recruitment pattern, Structure and yield of Calabrian pine (Pinus nigra Arn. ssp. laricio Poiret var. Calabrica Delamare) stands on the Sila Plateau (Calabrian Region, Italy) that have been managed for over a century with a particular form of selection cutting. Management of these pine stands follows an unwritten plan which is based on a selection cut that is repeated approximately every 20 years on the same section of the forest. This type of management has preserved the typical forest landscape by maintaining a continuous forest cover.
   Age, dbh, height, diameter increment and spatial distribution of the trees were measured in a stand where the owner had marked trees for cutting according to traditional criteria. Results show that stand structure consists of very small Clusters (60-100 m(2)) of trees in four distinct age classes which are the result of the natural regeneration occurring in the gaps opened by the periodic removal of the biggest trees in the stand. The volume of harvested trees is slightly less than the volume increment for the average cutting cycle.
   The authors conclude that the description of truly traditional silvicultural systems, which have developed in different environments and with different techniques and often in contrast with established silvicultural methods, can make an important contribution to the search for ecologically, economically and socially sustainable ways of managing forests.

ID MODEL; GROWTH
AB It is widely acknowledged that spatial forest structure is a driving factor behind growth processes and that forest growth, in return, influences the structural composition of woodlands. Also any impact on forests is primarily a change of spatial forest structure. In the last few decades an impressive number of structural indices have been developed to quantify spatial forest structure and it has also been suggested that they can be used as surrogate measures for quantifying biodiversity [Pommerening, A., 2002. Approaches to quantifying forest structures. Forestry 75, 305-324]. Of particular interest in this regard is the development of a family of individual tree neighbourhood-based indices, which are measures of small-scale variations in tree positions, species and dimensions, developed by Gadow and Hui [Gadow, K.v., Hui, G., 2002. Characterising forest spatial structure and diversity. In: Bjoerk, L. (Ed.), Proceedings of the IUFRO International workshop 'Sustainable forestry in temperate regions', Lund, Sweden, pp 20-30]. Especially when expressed as frequency distributions these indices offer valuable information on spatial woodland structure. An important element of appraising the merits of such indices is a detailed evaluation of their performance for a specified purpose. One possible evaluation path is based on the idea that a successful quantification of spatial forest structure should allow the analysis to be reversed and enable the synthesis of forest structure from the indices derived. This idea is investigated here with a simulation model that uses the concept of cellular automata combined with further development of an approach by Lewandowski and Gadow [Lewandowski, A., Gadow, K.v., 1997. Ein heuristischer Ansatz zur Reproduktion von Waldbestanden (A heuristic method for reproducing forest stands). Allg. Forst- u. J.-Zeitung 168, 170-174]. The rules according to which the spatial pattern of tree positions "grows" in the stand matrix are deduced directly from the distributions of the structural indices of the input data. Different combinations of indices are used to assess and simulate the structure of four sample stands. The results show that simulations using species specific distributions of indices and a limit to the number of neighbours, used for index calculation to three or four neighbours are most successful at reconstructing the original stand structure. The specific sequence of simultaneous distributions of structural indices was not significantly superior to the use of marginal distributions. Contrary to the suggestion in Hui et al. [Hui, G.Y., Albert, M., Gadow, Kv., 1998. Das Umgebungsmass als Parameter zur Nachbildung von Bestandesstrukturen (The diameter dominance as a parameter for simulating forest structure). Forstwiss. Centralbl. 117, 258-266] no significant trend could be detected with regards to the use of the diameter dominance (formula 5) versus the diameter differentiation (formula 4).
   The artificial synthesis of forest structure is of particular importance to conservationists who wish to develop forest landscapes to create a particular habitat pattern in order to support or re-introduce rare animal species. The topic is also important for modellers who require individual tree coordinates as input data for simulation runs or visualisations, which are hard to obtain in forest practice.

ID GROWTH-MODEL; STANDS; AUSTRIA
AB In plantation forestry, as well as in forests managed according to the single tree selection system (Plenter forest), there are well established methods available to control sustainable management in terms of timber resources. If a shift from even-aged to uneven-aged management is intended, there is usually a lack of a clear, numerically defined aim. Then individual tree growth models help to (i) check if certain aims can be achieved at all and (ii) to define these aims more clearly and numerically, e.g. in terms of structural indices. Regular inventories, based on permanent sample plots, help to determine deviations from these aims. As a feedback of these results, management may be changed or aims may be adjusted. Two forest management districts in Austria were investigated. In one of them, continuous cover forestry was intended where, as soon as regeneration has reached a certain height, the upper layer was removed. In the other case, individual tree harvesting has been performed for 30 years, and a single tree selection system is intended. In both cases, permanent inventories based on angle-count sampling have been installed and remeasured at least once after 10 years. Using the individual tree simulator PROGNAUS it is shown, that the intended management strategy for the single tree selection system leads to an equilibrium of harvests and growth after about 80 years, accompanied by the intended high structural diversity of the stands, while species diversity and between-stand variation cannot be enhanced by much. In the natural regeneration system without single tree selection, species diversity, structural diversity and between-stand variation is enhanced, but during the 100 years simulated no equilibrium between harvests can be reached. Periods where there is a lack of large timber to be harvested occur regularly. From these examples it is concluded that inventories with permanent sample plots, together with individual tree growth simulators are appropriate tools to evaluate forest management changes.

AB A questionnaire was developed to assess people's sustainability orientation concerning forests considering the ecological, social, and economical dimension and to assess their knowledge of labels for sustainable forestry (SF). The questionnaire items were used to analyze the relationship between the individual sustainability orientation of a person and the knowledge of sustainability labels and the attention to and preference for labeled wood products. An experimental design embedded in the survey showed that the communication of corresponding label information enhances (stated intentions concerning) attention to and preference for labeled products in a prospective purchasing situation. Moreover, results showed that a sustainability orientation favoring ecological and social aspects, as compared to economical aspects of forestry, correlates positively with the stated intentions in favor of the purchasing of labeled wood products. The positive correlation of these intentions with the a priori knowledge of the participants was only marginally significant. The results indicate that it is possible to successfully promote SF and to enhance the demand for correspondingly certified products through marketing and other strategies. These might include the generation of innovative certification systems in a transdisciplinary, participatory process. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article reviews the performance of various State Forest Development Corporations of India which have existed for around 25-30 years. It looks at various factors, both macro and micro, which explains why the Corporations performed dismally in the past. Micro variables are important at the local level whereas the macro variables shape the performance at the national level. At the micro level, several factors have affected the functioning of these organizations, including structural, Cultural, and organization-specific variables. At the macro level, technological, legal, political, and market-related phenomena have added pressure on them and impeded their performance. For example, legal control of trade in nontimber forest products has had very negative effect on the industry and in turn on the Corporations in general. As far as social welfare role is concerned, Corporations have done reasonably well and benefits of markets have been passed on to tribal collectors in terms of increased income and employment. The study uses a number of criteria for evaluation of Corporations which are grounded into the theory of instrumental rationality, including organizational performance, financial performance, resource extraction sustainability, social welfare, and dynamic capability. Using these criteria, most Corporations have performed sub-optimally and many are in a financial turmoil. Finally the article reviews various models of nontimber forest products management and concludes that in the Indian context there is a need for more decentralized type of management. It proposes promotion of community-managed systems of nontimber forest products with government Support as facilitator. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. Ali rights reserved.

AB Characterizing spatial and temporal variability of soil properties at field and landscape scales is tremendously important for a variety of agronomic and environmental concerns including solute transport modeling of non-point source pollutants in the vadose zone, site-specific crop management, and soil quality assessment, to mention a few. Currently, there is a global need to develop tools that evaluate the overall quality of soil to determine the effectiveness and sustainability of farm-management practices. The knowledge now exists for characterizing the spatial variability of soil quality with non-invasive geophysical measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity (EC) using mobile GPS-based systems. The objective of this research was to evaluate ECa-directed soil sampling as a means for monitoring management-induced spatio-temporal changes in soil quality. Appraisal was made of a specific management practice, the reuse of irrigation drainage water applied to a saline-sodic soil in central California.
   A soil quality assessment study was conducted on a 32.4-ha saline-sodic field comprised of 8 rectangular paddocks in California's San Joaquin Valley from August 1999 to April 2002. The study evaluated the spatio-temporal changes that had occurred as a result of irrigation with drainage water over that time period. Using geospatial electromagnetic induction (EMI) measurements of EC;, and a spatial response surface sampling design, 40 sites were selected that reflected the spatial variability of the EC;, measurements. Duplicate samples were taken at eight selected sites (one randomly selected site from each paddock) to study local-scale variability. At each site soil-core samples were taken at 0.3-m intervals to a depth of 1.2 m and analyzed for 28 physical and chemical properties. Maps created from a geographic information system (GIS) show spatio-temporal changes of four dynamic soil properties (salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, boron, and molybdenum) critical to soil quality, which were strongly and significantly correlated with ECa.
   Data from 1999 indicate the presence of high salinity, which increased with depth, high sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), which also increased with depth, and moderate to high B and Mo, which showed no specific trends with depth. The application of drainage water for 32 months resulted in leaching of B from the top 0.3 of soil, leaching of salinity from the top 0.6 m of soil, and leaching of Na and Mo from the top 1.2 m of soil. The leaching fraction over the time period from 1999-2002 was estimated to be 0.10. The level of salinity in the reused drainage water (i.e., 3-5 dS m(-1)) allowed infiltration and leaching to occur even though high sodium and high expanding-lattice clay levels posed potential water flow problems. Preliminary spatiotemporal analyses from 1999-2002 indicate at least short-term feasibility of drainage water reuse from the perspective of soil quality when the goal is forage production for grazing livestock. The implications of this research extend beyond the provincial applications of assessing drainage water reuse in central California to the global potential of ECa-directed soil sampling for evaluating farm-induced management ramifications on soil quality.

AB Purpose: To promote health and maintain independence, Just for Us provides financially sustainable, in-home, integrated care to medically fragile, low-income seniors and disabled adults living in subsidized housing. Design and Methods: The program provides primary care, care management, and mental health services delivered in patient's homes by a multidisciplinary, multiagency team. Results: After 2 years of operation, Just for Us is serving nearly 300 individuals in 10 buildings. The program is demonstrating improvement in individual indices of health. Medicaid expenditures for enrollees are shifting from ambulances and hospital services to pharmacy, personal care, and outpatient visits. The program is not breaking even, but it is moving toward that goal. The program's success is based on a partnership involving an academic medical center, a community health center, county social and mental health agencies, and a city housing authority to coordinate and leverage services. Implications: Just for Us is becoming a financially sustainable way of creating a "system within a nonsystem" for low-income elderly persons in clustered housing.

ID POTASSIUM-CALCIUM GLASS
AB The growth behaviour of bracken, which was sampled throughout the spring, summer and early autumn of 1999 from two different sites, is used to establish whether bracken was a sustainable supply of alkali for use by medieval and early post-medieval glassmakers. Data from the collection of bracken from the Snake Pass, Derbyshire and from Cannock Chase near Rugeley, Staffordshire is presented. The field evidence suggests that bracken could have played such a role, being used as a single alkali added to the glass batch for specialist glasses or to complement other alkali raw materials.

AB Ensuring the sustainable supply of water for the world's largest cities has been and is a current challenge. Future trends in urban water consumption patterns will be determined by changes in population concentration, per-capita water use, climate, and the proportion of water retained for the production of instream ecosystem services. The objective of our research was to identify patterns of renewable water availability and urban consumption throughout the globe between the years 2000 and 2015. To better understand the interactions between urban consumption and regional availability of renewable water we used a modified ecological footprint (EF) approach. Urban water footprint areas were differentially sensitive to changes in consumption and changes in water availability; our results suggest climate induced reductions in water availability may be more of a concern than population growth or increased per-capita for securing continued supplies of water to large cities. Our results provide a comprehensive description of global urban water demand and highlight the variation between consumption and availability relationships for the 524 largest cities.

AB This article seeks to inform current debates on the changing architecture for global governance by cataloguing and suggesting evaluation criteria for alternative multilateral arrangements. Rather than describing a system in crisis, it focuses on the dynamics of change and flexibility in which established intergovernmental organizations are challenged to meet new demands and requirements while accommodating new mandates and members as well as nonstate actors with global reach. A proliferating and fluctuating set of intergovernmental and multistakeholder arrangements with more assertive and diverse actors best describes the international operating environment for collective decisionmaking and action across a range of global issues, raising fundamental questions of effectiveness, accountability, legitimacy, and sustainability and posing challenges to the authority of existing IGOs.

AB This study assessed the antecedents of continued use of an education program to prevent passive smoking in infants. It consists of a booklet for parents and a manual for health professionals describing a five-step procedure for discussing passive smoking. A questionnaire was sent to 67 managers, 670 nurses, and 335 physicians working in well-baby clinics (response rate: 70%, 53%,47% respectively). Questions concerned the completeness of use, level of institutionalization. and characteristics of the organization, the user, and the dissemination strategy. Seventy-one percent of nurses and 42% of physicians worked with the program. They foremost provided the first three steps of the five-step procedure. Physicians' completeness of use was related to their perceived responsibility in providing this education, and nurses' use was related to their perceived self-efficacy, responsibility, training attendance, participation in the adoption decision, and level of institutionalization. Diffusion efforts should focus on improving the completeness of use and level of institutionalization.

AB Objective. To provide detailed demographic profiles of prescription drug utilization and expenditures in order to isolate the impact of demographic change from other factors that affect drug expenditure trends.
   Data Sources/Study Setting. Demographic information and drug utilization data were extracted for virtually the entire British Columbia (BC) population of 1996 and 2002. All residents had public medical and hospital insurance; however their drug coverage resembled the mix of private and public insurance in the United States.
   Study Design. A series of research variables were constructed to illustrate profiles of drug expenditures and drug utilization across 96 age/sex strata.
   Data Collection/Extraction Methods. Drug use and expenditure information was extracted from the BC PharmaNet, a computer network connecting all pharmacies in the province.
   Principal Findings. Per capita drug expenditures increased at an average annual rate of 10.8 percent between 1996 and 2002. Population aging explained 1.0 points of this annual rate of expenditure growth; the balance was attributable to rising age/sex-specific drug expenditures.
   Conclusions. Relatively little of the observed increase in drug expenditures in BC could be attributed to demographic change. Most of the expenditure increase stemmed from the age/sex-specific quantity and type of drugs purchased. The sustainability of drug spending therefore depends not on outside forces but on decisions made by policy makers, prescribers, and patients.

ID CONSERVATION
AB Residential landscapes are responsible for a large share of the water use of New Mexico communities. Water conservation plans and programs are being promulgated throughout New Mexico and the western U.S. as concern grows over the sufficiency and variability of present supplies, sustainability of current population growth rates, and desire for enhanced economic development. Household attitudes, choices, and behaviors ultimately underlie the success and performance of community water conservation programs. Homeowners in three New Mexico cities were surveyed concerning their attitudes and behavior toward water use, water conservation, and residential landscapes. Findings suggest that New Mexico's homeowners are mindful of the water resource challenges faced by communities, and are prepared to shoulder responsibility for stewarding the state's water resources. There is broad community support to limit traditional turf-grasses [e.g., kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis)] and to increase the areas planted to native, natural, and water-conserving landscapes; for example, 92% favored limiting turfgrass to less than 25% of the area around public buildings. Evidence showing that 40% are not "content" with their current landscape suggests that significant impediments remain and limit still greater adoption of water-conserving landscapes and subsequent potential for increased household water savings.

ID PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE; SCIENCE
AB The history of environmental decision-making in the United States is primarily one of antagonism, conflict, and litigation. Four sectors of American society are typically at odds over why and how to solve environmental problems-government regulators, businesses proponents, environmental advocates, and members of affected communities. Dissimilar worldviews are at the heart of most environmental disputes, and people in the four sectors tend to have diverse perspectives and philosophies that affect how they interpret and respond to environmental issues. To promote integrated, cost-effective decisions, the public health paradigm (prevention first, intervention second, treatment third), as embodied in the Precautionary Principle and the concept of Sustainable Development, should be Mutually adopted as a joint framework for prioritizing solutions to pressing environmental problems. The core public health principle of prevention first is a simple yet powerful tenet that can help foster better environmental choices that are more effective, efficient, and equitable.

AB This article proposes an integrated Health Impact Assessment/Strategic Environmental Assessment (HIA/SEA) framework that can be applied to fishery products regulations in Taiwan Strait. In recent years, many studies with regards to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), especially DDT and its derivatives, in Taiwan's environment and aquatic biota indicated that DDT, DDD, and DDE in seafood, especially oysters, in the Kinmen, Manchu area near China's Fu-Tzien Province, I-lad relatively high concentrations. It was discussed that this may be caused by distribution of OCPs in China's vicinity. In this study, the concentration of DDT, DDD, and DDE reported by many researchers in the last two decades were compared and analyzed. The concentrations of these three chemicals were found to be as high as hundreds of ng/g-dw in seafood produced in Kimmen and Machu near China, whereas those for seafood caught in Taiwan's coastal areas were not significant. The need for trade agreements or regulations on fishery was then discussed. According to the viewpoints of health and environmental sustainability, HIA methodologies were incorporated in the SEA to help identify and analyze the potential impacts on human health caused by OCPs in seafood consumed in Taiwan, which may be caused by the lack of trade regulation mechanisms between Taiwan and China. The integrated HIA-SEA framework for fishery trade agreements or regulations in Taiwan was thus proposed and. the procedures were discussed. It is anticipated that the health of Taiwan's residents can be protected through implementing this and the human health perspective can be emphasized in the HIA-SEA procedures.

AB A major challenge for contemporary conservation policies and practices is formulating workable compromises between wildlife conservation and the people who live with wildlife. We strongly support the view that anthropology has a critical role to play in contributing to our understanding of human-environment interactions. The study of complex biophysical and human systems can be greatly assisted by appropriate simulation models that integrate what is known about ecological and human decision-making processes. We have developed an integrated modeling system for assessing scenarios in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area in northern Tanzania to modify the situation there to improve human welfare without compromising conservation value. We present the results of some scenarios that indicate that the current situation there is not sustainable, and that tough policy decisions need to be taken if household well-being of the pastoralists who live there is to be improved or even sustained.

AB In this letter, we propose a three-dimensional Markov chain model for the 802.11e enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mode. This model can be used to compute the maximum sustainable throughput and service delay distribution for each priority class when under saturation load. The new framework models the performance impact of major quality-of-service (QoS)- specific features (e.g., CWMin, CWMax, AIFS, internal collision resolution) of the 802.11e EDCA mode, and hence can provide an analytical approach to pick the parameter values associated with EDCA to meet the QoS requirements of each priority.

ID DESIGN
AB Important challenges remain for sustainable design, manufacture, use, and recycling of electronics including materials selection and disassembly time. This paper examines the value relationship between the quantity of plastics separated and the time required for disassembly and segregation. Labor,costs for disassembly can constitute a large portion of the total acquisition cost for a recycled material. We report work measurement studies conducted on the disassembly of 21 computers, 22 printers, and 32 monitors manufactured by 27 producers in the years from 1984 to 2001.
   Results include the weight per total separation time for each plastic part. Each recovered part is identified according to polymer resin using laser Raman spectroscopy by chemometric reference to a library of standards. We extrapolate time as well as the product input required to accumulate various specific types of plastic. We develop disassembly policies and show that they are effective for a variety of computer, printer, or monitor models, which is typical of the random product streams that arrive at electronics recycling facilities. The results demonstrate how new laser identification tech- nology and work measurement can be used for plastics separation planning.

ID ELECTRIC-POWER QUALITY
AB In this paper, a quality-assurance model is proposed to correctly manage large-scale measuring systems in a sustainable way. Such systems are made up of interconnected hardware devices and software programs that are distributed over a large area and act as single measuring systems. The proposed model is based on a network-assisted calibration procedure, which allows both the hardware and software sections of a large-scale measuring system to be contemporaneously verified. The calibration procedure requires the availability of programmable traveling standards, which are sent to each measuring unit and are remotely controlled through the Internet. Two application examples that refer to the metrological confirmation of distributed measuring systems that monitor the power quality and the environmental pollution are also described.

AB Often, the computing of differences of numerically obtained solutions is a crucial point in achieving results of high accuracy. Nevertheless, several applications, like the identification of unknown hidden objects with the aid of exciting and receiving coils, necessitate the building of differences. It is shown that the application of the theorem of reciprocity or of a zero-solution scheme improves the accuracy sustainably. On a ferrous conductive iron grid the investigations are demonstrated. The appearance of eddy-currents not only in the rods but also in the meshes of the iron grid enforces a very fine and accurate discretization of the FE-model, additionally.

AB In this article we report on our effort and experience in designing, deploying, and using our 30-node wireless mesh testbed, the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) MeshNet. Compared to simulation, the construction and utilization of a wireless mesh testbed poses many new challenges. We discuss the challenges with distributed testbed management, nonintrusive and distributed monitoring, and node status visualization. These are vital components in a sustainable wireless mesh testbed, but at the same time nontrivial to design and realize. As a case Study, we present the UCSB MeshNet architecture, including its management, monitoring, and visualization systems. We share our lessons learned from this effort and believe that they will be valuable to other researchers who develop experimental wireless mesh networks.

AB A long-term field experiment was conducted since 1994 to 2004 in the rainfed upland red and laterite soils of dryland agriculture research farm, Phulbani, Orissa for maximising the yield of rice (Oryza sativa L.) - horsegram [Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.)Verd.] cropping sequence through use of organic and inorganic source of nutrient alone or their combinations on sustainable basis. The results showed that rice of yield of 1.87 tonnes/ha was obtained in the treatment receiving 30 kg N through farmyard manure although rice yield of 1.84 tonnes/ha was achieved with the treatment receiving 50% N through chemical fertiliser and 50% N through farmyard manure that was higher than the chemical fertiliser alone. The use of 50% N through other organic manures like Glyricidia and Cassia leaves along with 50% of P and K dose of fertilisers were more or less at par with the use of 50% chemical fertiliser. Horsegram was grown on residual fertility and moisture. The residual effect of farmyard manure (0.41 tonne/ha) gave higher grain yield of horsegram than the other treatments.

AB An experiment was conducted during the 4 consecutive summers of 1999-2000, at Kukumseri (Lahaul valley) to identify the varieties in pea (Pisum sativum) - pea and pea - buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn) crop sequences. Results revealed that pea - pea crop sequence was the most productive-and remunerative as compared to pea - buckwheat sequence. Pea varieties 'Azad P1' - 'Arkel' (15.24 tonnes/ha) and 'Palampriya' - 'Arkel' (15.04 tonnes/ha) remaining statistically at par resulted in significantly higher pea equivalent. The lowest pea equivalent (7.96 tonnes/ha) was found in 'Ageta matter' - 'Local' buckwheat crop sequence. Production efficiency was the highest with 'Azad' - 'Arkel' (92 kg/ha/day) followed by 'Palampriya' - 'Arkel' (87 kg/ha/day) sequence. The total monetary gains (retums/ha/day) sustainable yield index and sustainable value index were also recorded the maximum in 'Azad', - 'Arkel' followed by 'Palampriya' - 'Arkel'. The highest benefit: cost ratio was associated with pea varieties 'Azad P1' - 'Arkel' (4.61) followed by pea variety 'Palampriya' - 'Local' buckwheat variety (4.45). Land-use efficiency varied from 34.2 ('Ageta matter' - 'Local' buckwheat) to 48.7% ('Arkel' - 'Palampriya') with the different crop sequences.

AB The adoption of new methods and information technologies to improve the management of Mexican irrigation districts maintenance is very important to guarantee their sustainability In this research a system approach was applied to characterize the problem of irrigation networks maintenance. As a result, a computer information system was designed and implemented to improve the management of irrigation network maintenance called SISCOMAN. The methodology applied is based an a linear software development approach and implemented under a C++ Builder platform which involves a friendly graphical user interface. This software includes a database to manage the inventory of the hydraulic infrastructure, the maintenance engines and daily maintenance activities; it facilitates the creation of the yearly maintenance program of irrigation network and the supervision of the execution of programmed activities. In addition, it incorporates a set of heuristic rules to obtain the optimal allocation of engines. Furthermore, this computer system facilitates the periodical report generation to evaluate the maintenance activities and to detect anomalies. The computer tool proposed, has been tested with data provided by the water user association of the irrigation district DR 011 Alto Rio Lerma, Guanajuato in Mexico.

TI Thinking Broadly About Costs and Benefits in Ecological Management
SO INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Cost-benefit analysis; Social decision making; Resource valuation;
   Ecological management; Sustainability
AB Decisions regarding both human and natural systems often involve either explicit or implicit consideration of relative costs and benefits. These costs and benefits, however, go well beyond those captured in conventional economic cost-benefit analysis. It is not so much the mere consideration of costs and benefits that hampers cost-benefit analysis but, rather, the narrowness and incompleteness of the subset of costs and benefits that are usually considered. To use cost-benefit analysis for social decision making, one needs to think very broadly about which categories of costs and benefits need to be addressed (including effects on built, human, social, and natural capital as well as sustainable well-being) and deal with the inherent uncertainty and imprecision attached to many of the more important categories. One needs to consider the full range of possible values and valuation methods, to shift the burden of proof to the parties that stand to gain from the decision, to deal with the distributional consequences of decisions, and to be clear about the social goals being served by the decision. Failure to think broadly enough about costs and benefits leads to decisions that serve only narrow special interests, not the sustainable well-being of society as a whole.

DE Neoclassical economics; Cost-benefit analysis; Institutional theory;
   Positional analysis; Political economic person
AB Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is part of neoclassical economics, a specific paradigm, or theoretical perspective. In searching for alternatives to CBA, competing theoretical frameworks in economics appear to be a natural starting point. Positional analysis (PA) as an alternative to CBA is built on institutional theory and a different set of assumptions about human beings, organizations, markets, etc. Sustainable development (SD) is a multidimensional concept that includes social and ecological dimensions in addition to monetary aspects. If the political commitment to SD in the European Union and elsewhere is taken seriously, then approaches to decision making should be chosen that 1st open the door for multidimensional analysis rather than close it. Sustainable development suggests a direction for development in a broad sense but is still open to different interpretations. Each such interpretation is political in kind, and a 2nd criterion for judging different approaches is whether they are ideologically open rather than closed. Although methods for decision making have traditionally been connected with mathematical objective functions and optimization, the purpose of PA is to illuminate a decision situation in a manysided way with respect to possibly relevant ideological orientations, alternatives, and consequences. Decisions are understood in terms of matching the ideological orientation of each decision maker with the expected effects profile of each alternative considered. Appropriateness and pattern recognition are other concepts in understanding this process.

AB The effects of conservationist procedures such as minimal tillage, acid resistant cultivars, rotation of cultures and combinations of organic and inorganic fertilizers upon the dynamics of P availability and the sustainability of a cereal-legume rotation system were evaluated on a Typic haplustults acid soil of very low productive capacity. The treatments were: sorghum crop remains (RG), Indigosphera lespedicioides (RN) and Crotalaria juncea (RL), which were compared with a control with no residue (SR). Organic fertilizer parcels were supplemented with inorganic sources: T1 (N+0P+K), T2 (N+P-RFR+K), T3 (N+P-RFRA+K) and T4 (N+P-FDA+K), where RFR: "Riecito" phosphoric rock, RFRPA: partly acidulated "Riecito" phosphoric rock and FDA: diammonium phosphate. On each Sorghum bicolor tillage 100, 80 and 60kg(.)ha(-1) of N, P and K, respectively were applied, and on those of Cajanus cajan 15, 60, 45, 5,7 and 0,2kg(.)ha(-1) of N, P, K S and Mo, respectively, were applied. After 2 years of conservationist handling, increment in P availability and Al+3 reduction were observed. Available P ranged between 10 y 40mg(.)kg(-1), being significantly higher where RN and RL were applied with any of the P sources. Subsoil exchangeable At (Al+3) was reduced (< 0,7cmol(.)kg(-1)) with P-FDA. With FDA the was no P mobilization down to 40cm in depth, where the percentage of aluminium saturation is high.

AB Objective. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an international collaboration designed to create a sustainable emergency medicine training and qualification process in Tuscany, Italy. Part of the program involves training all emergency physicians currently practicing in the region. This qualification process includes didactic lectures, clinical rotations and practical workshops for those with significant emergency department experience. Lectures in the didactic portion were given by both emergency medicine (EM) and non-EM faculty. We hypothesized that faculty who worked clinically in EM would give more effective lectures than non-EM faculty.
   Methods. Fifty-one emergency physicians from the hospitals surrounding Florence completed the course, which included 48 one-hour lectures. Twenty lectures were given by practicing emergency physicians and 28 were given by non-EM faculty. Participants completed an evaluation at the end of each session using a 5-point Likert scale describing the pertinence of the lecture to EM, the efficacy and clarity of the presentation, the accuracy of the information and the didactic ability of the lecturer.
   Results. A mean of 38.5 evaluations was completed for each lecture. Every factor was significantly higher for lectures given by EM faculty: the pertinence of the lecture to EM (4.46 vs 4.16, p < 0.001), the efficacy of the faculty (4.10 vs 3.91, p < 0.001), the accuracy of the lecture content (4.16 vs 3.96, p < 0.001), and the didactic ability of the instructors (4.02 vs 3.85, p = 0.001).
   Conclusions. When teaching EM, evaluations of lectures in this training intervention were higher for lectures given by EM faculty than by non-EM faculty.

AB The giant Geode of Pulpi (Almeria, Spain) can be considered its one of the most significant recent mineralogical discoveries in terms of geological heritage. Any tourist exploitation of this mining environment should be sustainable, and the first step is to determine the feasibility of opening the interior of the geode to visitors. To achieve this objective it was necessary to characterize the variation of physical parameters of the air and rock (gypsum crystals) during monitored visits, similar to the hypothetical visits that Would occur if the geode were opened to the public. The main environmental impact of a continuous presence of people inside the geode is condensation on the surface of the gypsum crystals as a result of increased temperature and water vapor caused by respiration. The phenomenon of condensation on the gypsum crystals begins to Occur with visits of two or three people for longer than 10 min. Condensation on the crystal surface brought about by this human presence could lead to the corrosion of the crystals. The total recovery time required after a visit of this type to resume the initial natural thermal and humidity conditions was 27 h. The results obtained from the environmental monitoring of the geode Suggest that it is not feasible to allow visits inside it because of the mechanical impact of the visitors on the crystals and of the risk of condensation of water vapor.

AB A novel application of Sensitivity Analysis is presented. Useful applications of Global SA (GSA) already exist in the field of numerical modelling. In this paper, we explore the joint use of GSA, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Evaluation. In this preliminary case study, 11 factors have been used to find the best place to locate a hazardous waste landfill. Two variance-based methods (Sobol' and E-FAST) are used to compute sensitivity indices in order to identify the factors that determine the variance of the model output. The results show that only three factors jointly account for 97% of the output variance. This information is employed to make a simplification of the original model, retaining only these three influential factors. In addition, if the SA is carried out in a pilot area where the spatial properties are similar to those of the whole region, we can infer the results to the whole area. This procedure achieves the goal of the study with an optimized allocation of resources for GIS data acquisition.

ID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; PART I; FRAMEWORK
AB Goal, Scope and Methodology. This paper describes a case study carried out as part of a wider programme to provide Support for environmental decision-making in the highway maintenance programme of a local government body: Surrey County Council (SCC). UK local authorities are required to demonstrate that sustainable development principles are addressed in service provision, by improving environmental, economic or social wellbeing and improving public consultation. A methodological approach was developed to meet these requirements by using life cycle assessment (LCA) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) through the process of decision conferencing.
   Results. In projects requiring strategic decisions, difficulties arise in identifying relevant sustainable development criteria and in evaluating maintenance options against these criteria where the context for decision-making is complex and characterised by uncertainty, where multiple public policy objectives compete and a number of decision-makers and key players are affected by the outcome. Clearly, a structured process is needed to engage such stakeholders in the decision process, utilising quantitative and qualitative information. The approach described proved to be capable of fulfilling these requirements.
   Conclusions and Recommendations. The approach of combining LCA with MCDA through decision conferencing is capable of further development to support other strategic decision-making activities. However, this illustrative case study has revealed a need for methodological developments in LCA for local, project-level decisions.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. Although both cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) have developed from engineering practice, and have the same objective of a holistic ex-ante assessment of human activities, the techniques have until recently developed in relative isolation. This has resulted in a situation where much can be gained from an integration of the strong aspects of each technique. Such integration is now being prompted by the more widespread use of both CBA and LCA on the global arena, where also the issues of social responsibility are now in focus. Increasing availability of data on both biophysical and social impacts now allow the development of a truly holistic, quantitative environmental assessment technique that integrates economic, biophysical and social impact pathways in a structured and consistent way. The concept of impact pathwavs, linking biophysical and economic inventory results via midpoint impact indicators to final damage indicators, is well described in the LCA and CBA literature. Therefore, this paper places specific emphasis on how social aspects can be integrated in LCA.
   Methods and Results. With a starting point in the conceptual structure and approach of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), as developed by Helias Udo de Haes and the SETAC/UNEP Life Cycle Initiative, the paper identifies six damage categories under the general heading of human life and well-being. The paper proposes a comprehensive set of indicators, with units of measurement, and a first estimate of global normalisation values, based on incidence or prevalence data from statistical sources and severity scores from health state analogues. Examples are provided of impact chains linking social inventory indicators to impacts on both human well-being and productivity.
   Recommendation and Perspective. It is suggested that human well-being measured in QALYs (Quality Adjusted Life Years) may provide an attractive single-score alternative to direct monetarisation.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. Life cycle assessment has emerged into a useful tool to assess and potentially reduce the environmental impacts per functional unit. This has contributed to increase eco-efficiency but not necessarily to decrease absolute pollution per capita. The number of functional units is increasing and new functions add to the impacts of consumption. Despite the attempts to use different levels of definitions for the functional unit and applying LCA in the field of lifestyle studies there has been little success to grasp the consumption side of sustainable production and consumption. This contribution aims to tackle the consumption side by at least two extensions: the function of products, services, and activities is assessed with a multi-attribute need function and the propensity to cause both psychological and physical rebound effects are considered in the design phase.
   Methods. We develop a checklist approach with an evaluation and assessment table. The elements of the checklist are rooted in a number of independent fields of science: needs matrix, happiness enhancing factors, a number of limiting factors that can cause rebound effects, and streamlined LCA.
   Results and Conclusion. For illustration purposes we comparatively evaluate gardening, having a dog, a weekend house, and starting yoga classes and show that the new analysis framework is able to make transparent and operable the inclusion of a number of additional factors that remained so far implicit or neglected. The additional factors considered can be grouped into factors that may cause rebound effects through psychological or physical mechanisms. The assessment table combines the degree of satisfying needs and enhancing happiness in a psychological rebound score. The physical rebound score considers six factors that may constrain consumption: Costs, time, space, other scarce resources, information, and skills. This allows predicting the potential for rebound effects that would increase total impacts from consumption. In addition, it gives also a handle on how to use the knowledge on rebound effects to not only reduce the impacts of the product or activity at hand but also reducing other consumption that in turn might have adverse impacts.
   Recommendation and Perspective. Many assumptions in selecting and quantifying the additional factors and the final assessment procedure remain conceptual and therefore provisional. This contribution opens new avenues of investigations that need both further refinements of the theories and empirical evidence. Consumerism and materialism has undermined much of the success stories of improved eco-efficiency and LCA. We suggest using some of the very same psychological and physical mechanisms to foster sustainable consumption.

TI The role of SETAC in the development of LCA
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT

DT Article
DE LCA; LCC; SETAC; sustainability assessment; UNEP/SETAC LC initiative
AB Background. Life cycle assessments have been performed using different methods before the name was coined since about 1970 in several countries of North America and Europe. It was the merit of SETAC to start a standardization process which culminated in the LCA-guidelines ('A code of practice') in 1993. It is the aim of this paper to trace back this and further LCA-related achievements by SETAC on the basis of documents and personal memories. It may be subjective in the selection and weighting of some events, but objectivity is strived for with regard to the whole and, in my view, singular development.
   Results and Discussion. Starting 1990 with two workshops in Smuggler's Notch (Vermont) and Leuven (Belgium), SETAC and SETAC Europe organized several workshops during which important topics (framework, impact assessment, data quality, etc.) were treated and published in the form of reports which are still available. The main contribution by CML and its head, Helias Udo de Haes, was a practical method of impact assessment, transforming the formerly more "technocratic" LCA (energy, resources, waste) into an instrument of environmental assessment of product systems. In addition, important contributions to the allocation problem were made. Starting in 1993, ISO took over the leadership in standardization and SETAC started the famous working groups in North America and Europe, often dealing with the same topics in parallel. Due to the different cultures, the results were frequently complimentary rather than harmonic. The CML-method of LCIA, widely accepted in Europe, had to wait for about 10 years to be accepted at the other side of the Atlantic. It was helpful that SETAC - meanwhile a global organization looked for a partner in order to implement LCA all over the world. This partner was found in the 'United Nations Environmental Programme' (UNEP) and the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative was officially launched by Klaus Topfer in Prague in April 2002. SETAC also assumed an important role in communicating LCA via publications: workshop and conference reports, the 'code of practice', working group results and LCA News Letters. The annual meetings offered forums for LCA scientists, practitioners and users, well prepared by the LCA Steering Committee (SETAC Europe) and the LCA Advisory Group (SETAC North America).
   Recommendations. The main recommendation to SETAC is to adhere to LCA as the main environmental assessment tool for products and to expand it to a true sustainability assessment tool by adding Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and a still to be invented 'Social Life Cycle Assessment'. SETAC is to remain the scientific arm within the UNEP/SETAC LC Initiative, without loosing its identity. Working groups should be global rather than regional in the future, as suggested by the SETAC Europe LCA Steering Committee at the 2004 World Congress in Portland, Oregon.

DT Article
AB UNEP DTIE, through its Life Cycle Initiative, aims to enhance the skills of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries on Life Cycle Management (LCM). This is part of its contribution to the 10-year framework of program on Sustainable Consumption and Production as a follow-up of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002). Apart from the potential of improving their environmental performance, life cycle thinking and the use of LCA can be a business opportunity for SMEs. The development of environmental management expertise may help them to position themselves as reliable suppliers. The Life Cycle Initiative has promoted and facilitated the establishment of regional life cycle networks, and UNEP has started a training program on LCM targeted at National Cleaner Production Centers (NCPCs) and other national institutes that are able to pass on the information to the target groups. Some multinational companies have started to provide capacity building on life Cycle management for suppliers in developing countries. More companies could use this approach to help developing countries to tackle environmental requirements in the supply chain and thus the private sector may contribute significantly to eco-efficiency, cost savings and finding new markets for sustainable products and services in developing countries. Life cycle thinking applied to basic services such as water, waste and energy could be another way to directly contribute with life cycle management to human development.

DE environmentally friendly wastes, hybrid industrial; ecological systems,
   environmental coordination
AB Humankind is now using natural resources more rapidly than natural systems can replace them and has been doing so for approximately two and a half decades. Moreover, both natural capital and the ecosystem services it provides are being diminished at an unprecedented rate. Finally, the human population is expected to increase by three billion by 2050. This situation is clearly unsustainable, but it can be made less so by redesigning societal wastes so that they benefit the biospheric life-support system. Nature initiates and maintains a system of energy and nutrient cycling and, if the system integrity is maintained, provides alternative and redundant means that help stabilize functional capacity. The system is composed of opportunistic individuals that compete with other individuals to acquire the resources essential to their survival. The interrelationships within this aggregation of individuals (i.e. system components) are based on energy flow. This self-organizing and self-maintaining system is increasingly stressed by human activities. Humans are a part of, not apart from, this system and are governed by the same laws of nature. In short, an ecologically-based economic system is essential to sustainable use of the planet. The planet's life-support system has been a superb model of sustainability, which humans should emulate and become a part of more than they now are. When the biospheric life-support system is stressed to the point of disequilibrium, the results are disastrous for societies, individuals and ecosystems. Evolutionary processes have produced replacement systems following the five great biological extinctions. However, the probability is high that the next replacement system will not be as suitable for humankind as the present system. Sustainable practices are intended to prevent biospheric disequilibrium and maintain the present environmental conditions so favorable to humankind, including posterity.

AB The broad range of definitions for sustainability has led to the development of several sustainability evaluation frameworks that have emphasized facets of sustainability but have not encompassed all aspects found at the industry and regional level. The aim of this study was to address the broader issues of sustainability of agro-industrial systems. Rather than exclusively focusing on the environmental and social aspects of those economic activities that take place within the boundaries of industrial systems, it should be recognized that they belong to a broader system. The various types of sustainability are highlighted and current sustainability frameworks are evaluated. A comprehensive sustainability model that adequately takes into consideration the various types of sustainability within industrial systems was developed. The proposed framework considered indicators that provide descriptions of the systemic nature of industry and incorporates two-dimensional indicators instead of solely focusing on indicators that provide a one-dimensional, piecemeal evaluation of economics, environment, social and institutional sustainability. By evaluation of the boundaries of each arena, it provides comprehensive understanding of the system. The sustainability of the Costa Rican coffee industry within the context of the new framework is discussed. The framework presented integrates concepts such as industrial ecology and cleaner production, along with the more traditional EMS and social justice programmes, to promote sustainability. The development of employment and economic returns that benefit the local and regional systems through the generation of additional value-added products are promoted through the integration of eco-efficiency into the framework.

AB Indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) of Borana pastoralists on strategies of sustainable resource utilization, forage species, ecological interactions, rangeland condition and trend was documented using discussions, a semi-structured questionnaire survey and analytical workshops. Traditional strategies of rangeland and water management were described and the most important forage species identified. Pastoralists' perceptions were compared across age, gender and site. There was a positive correlation between pastoralists' preference ranking of forage species and crude protein content of the species. IEK of men and women was complementary. The process of rangeland degradation was described as shortage of grass and decrease in density and frequency of highly palatable grass species, leading to low milk production and reduced conception rates in cows. The results confirmed that the IEK of these pastoralists could still provide the basis for sustainable resource utilization and rangeland rehabilitation. However, the young generation in the area had not only limited knowledge but also showed less interest to learn and apply the traditional resource management strategies. Therefore, there is high need to perpetuate, document and use this IEK for sustainable development. On the other band, shortage of forage resources as a result of rangeland shrinkage (leading to rangeland degradation and woody plants encroachment), less application of IEK, the gap between traditional and formal systems, and trends of disobeying traditional rules and regulations were identified as Current challenges for the Borana pastoralists.

AB This paper discusses some of the potentials, problems, policies and progress in modelling sustainable development. After briefly describing ten approaches to modelling sustainable development, some of the methodological problems still to be resolved are addressed. It is then suggested that policies to promote sustainable development should operate at six different spatial levels connecting global, multinational, national, regional, local and individual. Attempting to model Sustainable development in such a hierarchical manner is exceedingly difficult. One way of modelling sustainable development is to develop the concept of a sustainable corridor, combining ecological, economic and equity considerations in a hierarchical fashion and through space-time. A preliminary dynamic, hierarchical model is described connecting global and national patterns of development. Using global and national data for Scotland, the calibrated model, running under the business-as-usual scenario, shows that current development paths are unsustainable. It is shown that, by implementing a judicious choice of policies, a sustainable corridor for a global and a national system can be achieved. The ways in which this preliminary model can be developed to connect all six hierarchical levels are discussed.

TI Water resources in Italy: Availability and agricultural uses
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
LA English
DT Article
DE water balance; evapotranspiration; effective rainfalls; effective
   infiltration
AB Information on quantity and quality of fresh water and is availability is essential for sustainable development, economic growth and social stability.
   The International Programme for Technology and Research in Irrigation and Drainage (IPTRID) and the Italian National Committee of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) combined their efforts to publish a document on water resources in Italy with special attention devoted to the state of agricultural water management.
   The aim of this paper is to give a quantitative overview on available water resources in the Italian countryside, taking into account the existing differences between the many Italian regions.
   The report focuses on renewable water resources, defined as that part of water resources generated from precipitation and computed on the basis of the water balance.
   Thank to the collaborations between ICID-Italy and the Central Office of Agro-Ecology (UCEA), for the period 1971-2000, we were able to analyse the annual values of rainfall and reference evapotranspiration related to 544 points of a grid which covers the whole country.
   The grid comes from a geostatistical computation, the so-called kriging interpolation, based on data observed at weather stations belonging to the SIAN network.
   Data processing, supported by GIS software, is aimed at the computation of the effective infiltration that gives us a reliable assessment of the amount of renewable water resources.
   On the one hand the results confirm the global amount of water resources previously computed in other projects, but on the other they highlight the differences between the many parts of our country and they point out that a good assessment of water resources needs an awareness and a knowledge of the differences in reality which are typical features of our country.

ID CONJUNCTIVE USE; NONSALINE WATERS; IRRIGATION; WHEAT; SALINIZATION
AB Use of saline groundwaters is inevitable in rice-wheat, cotton-wheat, and millet-wheat crop rotations in the northern region of India due to limited canal water supplies. The UNSATCHEM model is calibrated and validated with field data on saline water use for the wheat and cotton crop. The calibrated and validated model has been employed to study different aspects of the salinisation process. The effect of irrigation water quality on the salinisation process is understood with the help of simulations in which irrigation waters of different SAR, SO42- and Cl- concentrations are used. A linear relation is observed between the weighted average of irrigation water salinity and the root zone. The salinisation process under different conjunctive use practices is understood through simulations. The practices are compared on the basis of temporal changes in root zone salinity with reference to the sensitivity of the wheat crop to salinity for deciding the preference of one conjunctive use practice over another. The preference order, thus prepared, is verified with the published yield data of wheat from conjunctive use field studies. The effect of soil texture on salinisation is studied through simulations. The saturated water content influences the salinisation process more than the hydraulic conductivity. The long-term simulations as per water quality guidelines for a six-year period under wheat-cotton rotation are carried out to assess the sustainability of saline water use for crop production.

AB 1. Intercropping of white clover and cereals has recently been promoted for low-input farming systems because it offers several benefits for sustainability, but the practical use of this system has been limited by the relatively low wheat yields. Very little is known about competition between the two species in this intercropping system and its implications for production.
   2. To investigate the interaction between white clover and wheat, we separated above- and below-ground competition in the field in a fully factorial additive design. The treatments were with and without clover, with and without below-ground partitions between rows of the two species, and with and without above-ground partitions. Above-ground biomass of both species was harvested three times over the growing season, and the wheat biomass was analysed for nitrogen content.
   3. When wheat was grown without clover, its biomass was much reduced by below-ground partitions and slightly reduced by above-ground partitions. Presence of both above- and below-ground partitions did not result in lower wheat biomass than below-ground partitions alone.
   4. Total biomass was higher when both species were present, and this biomass was reduced by below-ground partitions and, to a lesser degree, by above-ground partitions. In mixture, below-ground partitions reduced wheat biomass and increased clover biomass at the last harvest, whereas above-ground partitions reduced clover biomass and increased wheat biomass.
   5. The interaction between the two species was dominated by competition for soil nutrients, but competition for light influenced the partitioning of biomass production between the two species. Mingling of the roots of both species is important for maximizing soil resource utilization, whereas shoots performed almost as well without mingling.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The results suggest that competition between wheat and clover for nitrogen is reduced by nitrogen fixation because clover obtains some of its nitrogen from fixation. Increased availability of nitrogen to the intercropped wheat late in the growing season could increase grain protein content. Our results suggest possibilities for improved management of competition between the two species to optimize resource utilization, biomass production and wheat yields. Goals for yield should be based on a specific component, such as total biomass, grain yield and grain quality, because these yield components can behave differently when another species is present.

AB 1. Models of wildlife population dynamics are crucial for sustainable utilization and management strategies. Fluctuating ecological conditions are often key factors influencing both carrying capacity, mortality and reproductive rates in ungulates. To be reliable, demographic models should preferably rely on easily obtainable variables that are directly linked to the ecological processes regulating a population.
   2. We compared the explanatory power of rainfall, a commonly used proxy for variability in ecological conditions, with normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), a remote-sensing index value that is a more direct measure of vegetation productivity, to predict time-specific conception rates of an elephant population in northern Kenya. Season-specific conception rates were correlated with both quality measures. However, generalized linear logistic models compared using Akaike's information criteria showed that a model based on the NDVI measure outperformed models based on rainfall measures.
   3. A predictive model based on coarse demographic data and the maximum seasonal NDVI value was able to trace the large variation in observed season-specific conception rates (Range 0-0.4), with a low median deviation from observed values of 0.07.
   4. By combining the model of season-specific conception rates with the average seasonal distribution of conception dates, the monthly number of conceptions (range 0-22) could be predicted within +/- 3 with 80% confidence.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The strong predictive power of the normalized differential vegetation index on time-specific variation in a demographic variable is likely to be generally applicable to resource-limited ungulate species occurring in ecologically variable ecosystems, and could potentially be a powerful factor in demographic population modelling.

AB The purpose of this study was to establish a research mechanism to investigate the impact of corporate commitment to sustainability on capital project planning and capital project performance. The research hypothesized that increasing commitment to sustainability leads to increasing sustainable project planning, and to better cost and schedule performances in large projects. Two sustainability indices, CSCI and SCPPI, were used to determine the level of corporate sustainability commitment and its impact on sustainability practices in capital project planning, and the impacts of corporate sustainability commitment and sustainable practices in project planning on cost and schedule performances, design changes, and safety compliances. Limited data collected from 17 Fortune 100 owner organizations suggested that a relationship between tire two indices existed and that there are strong grounds supporting further development of such sustainability indices. Such indices can help multinational corporations better allocate resources and strike a balance between sustainable practices and financial bottom line.

AB The typical cow has a maintenance requirement of about 10 Mcal of net energy for lactation (NEL) per day. Each kilogram of milk takes an additional 0.7 Mcal of NEL. Thus, the cow producing 45 kg of milk per day needs 4 times as much total energy as she needs for her maintenance requirement alone. The elite cow producing 90 kg/d needs 7 times as much total energy as she needs for maintenance alone. Consequently, the efficiency of using feed energy is much greater for the elite cow than it was for the cow of 100 yr ago consuming a diet of mostly forage. With increased productivity has come the need for fewer cows to produce milk on a per capita basis and increases in net income per cow. However, compared with energetic efficiency, the efficiency of using feed protein to make milk protein has not increased as dramatically, partly because cows are often fed protein in excess. This nitrogen waste is an environmental concern; N losses in manure contribute to water pollution and ammonia emissions from dairy farms. However, the complexities of protein nutrition and limitations in measuring feed N fractions make accurate specifications for feed protein fractions difficult. The economic risk of underfeeding protein is greater than the risk of overfeeding protein, so protein efficiency has not been maximized in the past, nor is it likely to be maximized in the near future. Most cows also are fed excess P, a notable contaminant of surface waters, but several recent studies have shown that feeding P above NRC recommendations has no utility for milk production or fertility. The goal of this article is to examine the impact of nutrition on productivity, efficiency, environmental sustainability, and profitability of the dairy industry.

AB The efficacy of a mosquito netting to protect cabbages, Brassica oleracea L., against pests was investigated in field trials in Benin, West Africa. A polyester net covered the plants at night by using a wood armature. The net was removed during the day to prevent overheating and excessive shade, both problems of insect-proof screens used under tropical conditions. The number of all lepidopteran larvae with netting protection and foliar insecticide sprays was significantly lower than the unprotected control. The number of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), was significantly lower with netting protection compared with foliar insecticide sprays and control. Netting treated with deltamethrin gave total protection of young plants against the aphid Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach). At harvest, the number of marketable cabbages protected with untreated netting was significantly higher compared with the production with foliar insecticide sprays. The protection of cabbages with netting can be an economically viable method. Considering the price of cabbages on local markets (US$1/ unit), the net returns per 100 m(2) were US$247 by using netting, US$149 by using insecticides, and US$117 for controls. The net returns for using netting are based on replacing the netting each crop cycle. But netting can be reused several times, depending upon conditions, increasing the profit margin. The netting protection may be an alternative to the growing unsustainable practices of vegetable cropping in peri-urban areas of tropical countries.

DE engineering education; sustainable development; professional practice
AB This paper was presented as the Simon W. Freese Lecture at the 2000 ASCE Annual Meeting in Kansas City, Kansas, July 24, 2000. It is obvious that an increasing global population with aspirations for a higher standard of living is significantly altering Our natural systems. This affects the quality and quantity of life on earth. Technology is both partially the cause and a critical component of a future solution. Have engineering schools incorporated the topic of sustainability in meaningful ways? This paper attempts to answer this question. Findings are based on published literature and two questionnaires. The first survey went to environmental engineering faculty via the 724 Members of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors. Twenty two responses were received. The second questionnaire was sent to 600 U.S. based environmental professionals employed by Environmental Resources Management (EPM) as representatives of recent graduates. The paper concludes that the faculty believes that teaching principles of sustainability is important, even though many are generally ill informed, and that graduates should have a basic understanding, but they don't. Although many colleges offer courses, only a few appear to be seriously incorporating sustainability concepts.

   joint forest management; coastal zone guidelines
AB India's coastal resource complexes were traditionally characterized by a continuum of 'common property resources' or 'commons' that stretched from the shores to the seas. The continuum aided the existence of sustainable livelihood systems for local communities. Today, fragmented policy approaches and economic welfare schemes have caused the disintegration of community control over the continuum. As a consequence, livelihood systems of local communities have declined. The introduction of coastal management guidelines in the 1990s has exacerbated the situation. With reference to a coastal village located in the State of Kerala in South West India, the paper describes the trajectory of unsustainable change that has taken place in the coastal area resource complexes of the country. The paper argues for restoring the continuum of commons in the study area through community driven systems of natural resource management that are based on networks of nested institutions.

DT Article
DE sustainable waste management; life cycle assessment; LCA
AB This paper analyses different alternatives for solid waste management that can be implemented to enable the targets required by the European Landfill and Packaging and Packaging Waste Directives to be achieved in the Valencian Community, on the east coast of Spain. The methodology applied to evaluate the environmental performance of each alternative is Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The analysis has been performed at two levels; first, the emissions accounted for in the inventory stage have been arranged into impact categories to obtain an indicator for each category; and secondly, the weighting of environmental data to a single unit has been applied. Despite quantitative differences between the results obtained with four alternative impact assessment methods, the same preference ranking has been established: scenarios with energy recovery (1v and 2v) achieve major improvements compared to baseline, with scenario I v being better than 2v for all impact assessment methods except for the EPS'00 method, which obtains better results for scenario 2v. Sensitivity analysis has been used to test some of the assumptions used in the initial life cycle inventory model but none have a significant effect on the overall results. As a result, the best alternative to the existing waste management system can be identified. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   chemical, physical and biological soil degradation in a Spanish
   Mediterranean region
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

DT Article
DE soil; degradation; GIS; indicator
AB Soil is one of the main non-renewable natural resources in the world. In the Valencian Community (Mediterranean coast of Spain), it is especially important because agriculture and forest biomass exploitation are two of the main economic activities in the region. More than 44% of the total area is under agriculture and 52% is forested.
   The frequently and or semi-arid climate with rainfall concentrated in few events, usually in the autumn and spring, scarcity of vegetation cover, and eroded and shallow soils in several areas lead to soil degradation processes. These processes, mainly water erosion and salinization, can be intense in many locations within the Valencian Community.
   Evaluation of soil degradation on a regional scale is important because degradation is incompatible with sustainable development. Policy makers involved in land use planning require tools to evaluate soil degradation so they can go on to develop measures aimed at protecting and conserving soils.
   In this study, a methodology to evaluate physical, chemical and biological soil degradation in a GIS-based approach was developed for the Valencian Community on a 1/200,000 scale.
   The information used in this study was obtained from two different sources: (i) a soil survey with more than 850 soil profiles sampled within the Valencian Community, and (ii) the environmental information implemented in the Geo-scientific map of the Valencian Community digitised on an Arc/Info GIS.
   Maps of physical, chemical and biological soil degradation in the Valencian Community on a 1/200,000 scale were obtained using the methodology devised. These maps can be used to make a cost-effective evaluation of soil degradation on it regional scale.
   Around 29% of the area corresponding to the Valencian Community is affected by high to very high physical soil degradation, 36% by high to very high biological degradation, and 6% by high to very high chemical degradation. It is, therefore, necessary to draw up legislation and to establish the policy framework for actions focused on preventing soil degradation and conserving its productive potential.

AB Long-term field trials using lignite fly ash (LFA) were carried out in rice crops during the period 1996-2000 at Mine 1, Neyveli Lignite Corporation, Tamil Nadu. LFA, being alkaline and endowed with an excellent pozzolanic nature, silt loam texture, and plant nutrients, has the potential to improve the texture, fertility, and crop productivity of mine spoil. The rice crops were the first, third, fifth, and sixth crops in rotation. The other crops, such as green gram (second) and sun hemp (fourth), were grown as green manure. For experimental trials, LFA was applied at various dosages (0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 t/ha), with and without press mud (10 t/ha), before cultivation of the first crop. Repeat applications of LFA were made at the same dosages in treatments of up to 50 t/ha (with and without press mud) before cultivation of the third and fifth crops. Press mud, a lightweight organic waste product from the Sugar industry, was used as an organic amendment and source of plant nutrients. Also, a recommended dosage of chemical fertilizer, along with gypsum, humic acid, and biofertilizer as supplementing agents, was applied in all the treatments, including control. With one-time and repeat applications of LFA, from 5 to 20 t/ha (with and without press mud), the crop yield (grain and straw) increased significantly (p < 0.05), in the range from 3.0 to 42.0% over the corresponding control. The maximum yield was obtained with repeat applications of 20 t/ha of LFA with press mud in the third crop. The press mud enhanced the yield in the range of 1.5-10.2% with various dosages of LFA. The optimum dosage of LFA was 20 t/ha for both one-time and repeat applications. Repeat applications of LFA at lower dosages Of Lip to 20 t/ha were more effective in increasing the yield than the corresponding one-time applications of up to 20 t/ha and repeat applications at 50 t/ha. One-time and repeat applications of LFA of up to 20 t/ha (with and without press mud), apart from increasing the yield, evinced improvement in the texture and fertility of mine spoil and the nutrient content of crop produce. Furthermore, some increase in the content of trace and heavy metals and the level of gamma-emitters in the mine spoil and crop produce was observed, but well within the permissible limits. The residual effect of LFA on succeeding crops was also encouraging in terms of eco-friendliness. Beyond 20 t/ha of LFA, the crop yield decreased significantly (p < 0.05), as a result of the formation of hardpan in the mine spoil and possibly the higher concentration of soluble salts in the LFA. However, the adverse effects of soluble salts were annulled progressively during the cultivation of succeeding crops. A plausible mechanism for the improved fertility of mine spoil and the carryover or uptake of toxic trace and heavy metals and gamma-emitters in mine spoil and crop produce is also discussed.

AB Objective: To identify and evaluate the options for population level government policies to increase the prevalence of homes free of secondhand smoke.
   Methods: The literature was searched for population level policy options and evidence on them. Three criteria were used to evaluate the policy options: effectiveness, the reductions on inequalities in secondhand smoke exposure, and cost effectiveness. The setting was four developed, English speaking jurisdictions: Britain, USA, Australia, and New Zealand.
   Results: Evidence from all four countries shows some association between relatively comprehensive tobacco control programmes and lower prevalence levels of smoking in homes. The evidence of the effect of such programmes on inequalities in smokefree home prevalence is limited. No published evidence was found of the cost effectiveness of the programmes in achieving changes in smokefree homes. Within comprehensive programmes, there is some indirect evidence that some mass media campaigns could increase the prevalence of smokefree homes. Structural options that have potential to support smokefree homes include smokefree places legislation, and laws for the protection of children.
   Conclusion: The available evidence to date suggests that comprehensive tobacco control programmes ( to reduce the prevalence of smoking in the total population) are likely to be the most effective and sustainable option for increasing the prevalence of smokefree homes.

TI Closing the gap: collaborative learning as a strategy to embed evidence

SO JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE

DE collaborative learning; evidence-based practice; occupational therapy
AB Rationale The principles of clinical governance apply as guidelines for good practice to all practitioners. However, evidence-based practice (EBP) is proving a challenge for practitioners who lack the confidence to consume published research. For therapists not wishing to undertake formal study there is a risk of becoming disempowered within a culture of EBP. Opportunities to develop skills in consuming research have focused on the information dissemination model that has limited effect. Mutual reflective learning processes are recommended to empower practitioners to bridge the theory-practice gap.
   Aim An action research approach investigated practice based collaborative learning as a catalyst to increase therapist's competence and confidence in consuming research and to explore the transition toward EB practitioner.
   Methods and Results A diagnostic survey reaffirmed therapist's lack of confidence in EBP. Formative interviews (n = 5) found an over reliance on professional craft and personal knowledge. Research knowledge was not included in participants' construct of a good practitioner and engagement in higher order critical reflection was limited. Collaborative learning groups (n = 6) embedded in practice integrated research, theory, practice and critical reflection. Supported by the collegial learning environment, a learning package developed participants' confidence and competence in consuming published research. Summative interviews (n = 5) evaluated the group and found that therapists were empowered to incorporate propositional knowledge into their clinical reasoning, engage in critical reflection and challenge their practice. They felt confident to incorporate EBP into their continuing professional development plans. Sustainability of these changes requires commitment from the therapists and the workplace.

TI Role of homestead forests in household economy and factors affecting

SO JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH

AB Empirical information regarding the role of homestead forests in household economy is essential in understanding the importance of these resources. Identification of the factors that affect homestead forest production and understanding forest owners' attitudes toward key forest management issues have great significance in making appropriate policy responses to manage these resources on a sustainable basis. In Bangladesh, homestead forests are claimed to play an important economic role in rural livelihoods, but no reliable quantitative information exists. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of homestead forests in the household economy, examine if forest production and income vary across landholding size classes, to explore the relationships of homestead forest production with species richness, education level, and household size, and to assess the attitude of homestead forest owners toward key forest management issues. Results show that homestead forests contribute 15.9% of the household income and generate 51.4 man-days of employment per household per year. Production of homestead forests significantly varies across landholding size classes. It was observed that forest production depends significantly on species richness of homestead forests and the education level of forest owners. However, no such relationship was found between forest production and household size. The study revealed that farming families depend more on forest income than nonfarming families. Attitudes of forest owners toward key forest management issues differ significantly across landholding size classes. For example, although the majority of the forest owners prefer fruit species to timber species, the percentage of respondents decreased as the landholding size class increased, while the opposite trend was observed for timber species. The findings of this study suggest that diversification of forests and extension of education amongst forest owners would improve forest production. Furthermore, forest policy should address the concerns of the forest owners in different landholding classes and focus on their specific requirements to enhance sustainable forest management.

AB Globally, the need to construct new pipelines is increasing dramatically, both on shore and off shore. So too are the risks that are faced in attempting to meet project and stakeholder goals. Not meeting such goals has even greater consequences as a result. Project execution from potential identification of its need through execution and in-service use to decommissioning requires project management processes and tools at all stages of this timeline. Today, global project management standards are being developed, Promulgated, taught, and applied. The reason is obvious. Project management is an essential function that is the single greatest means of assuring that a project is successful in meeting all objectives from cost to functionality. It also is the single greatest means of assuring that a party with a role in the project execution (developer, owner-employer, engineer-constructor, contractor-subcontractor, vendor, operator-User, etc.) achieves its commercial, professional, and related goals. Project management is the most widely found cause for failure to meet project objectives and goals. Within today's project management bodies of knowledge, risk management techniques are evolving as a key tool to maximize achievement of goals, yet application of risk management in pipeline projects is not focused on a broad spectrum of the risks being experienced throughout the project. Ultimately, risk management application provides the ability to identify risks, determine characteristics of risk emergence, allow measurement through control systems, and apply enhanced project management methods for improved achievement of project and stakeholder goals throughout the life of a pipeline project. Risk management is essential to recognize and develop input to meet the different needs for the project and respective stakeholders' Success throughout the seasons of a pipeline project's life-a project's spring season (from the identification of a possible need that may become a project to its financing/funding), a project's summer season (project execution), a project's fall season (project use), and a project's winter season (sustainable recycling). This paper develops the types of risks for eight categories of risk factors being experienced, tools being used, application options and successes, and the contexts needed for Success. The basis for these approaches is the global project management experience of the writer over the last three decades, on six continents (on-shore and off-shore), including oil and gas, water, and wastewater.

DT Article
DE alternatives assessment; hospital pollution prevention; occupational
   health in hospitals; substitution; worksite interventions
ID EXPOSURE
AB At? integrated pollution prevention (P-2) and occupational safety, and health (OSH) worksite intervention and alternatives assessment strategy was developed in hospitals. It was called the Pollution Prevention-Occupational Safety and Health ((POSH)-O-2) assessment for the "Sustainable Hospitals Project". Methods included (a) developing a participatory intervention model for introducing more environmentally sound, healthy, and safe materials and work practices for specific hospital procedures; (b) developing an integrated (POSH)-O-2 survey to evaluate environmental and occupational impacts of the intervention; and (c) conducting and evaluating interventions by applying the (POSH)-O-2 assessment pre- and post-intervention. Eleven interventions were performed in six hospitals: an aliphatic fixative replaced xylene in three histology laboratories; a mercury reduction plan was implemented in three clinical laboratories: digital imaging replaced wet chemical film processing in three radiology departments; a less toxic aldehyde replaced formaldehyde in one hospital histopathology laboratory; and conventional mopping was replaced by microfiber mopping in one hospital. Occupational and environmental health and safety impacts were observed for all interventions. The alternatives generally were beneficial, although each had limitations that resulted in process and task changes with potentially negative P-2 andlor OSH impacts. When these were identified in the pilot phase they could be addressed before full-scale implementation. The (POSH)-O-2 method shifts the focus of occupational and environmental hygiene from hazard control to substitution. Because few ideal alternatives exist, the emphasis is on a continuous process to identify, implement, and evaluate alternatives, rather than on a particular alternative. Occupational and environmental health and safely professionals have an important role as agents in hospital organizational change and in the search for healthier and safer alternatives. Through these activities they can become involved in the design/redesign of products, materials, and processes, thus expanding their traditional role.

AB Background: Septicemia is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period and it often has a rapid and fulminant course.
   Aims: To determine the incidence, predisposing factors, clinical features, bacteriologic pattern and antibiotic sensitivity of neonatal septicemia.
   Design: A prospective study was undertaken over a 1(1)/(2)-year period in the neonatal unit of Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Southeastern Nigeria.
   Methods: All newborns ( age 0-28 days) admitted with clinical features and/or risk factors suggestive of neonatal septicemia were selected and screened for septicemia.
   Results: The study identified 33 septicemic neonates of the 138 neonates (23.9%) screened, 19/92 (20.7%) for inborns and 14/46 (30.4%) for outborns, representing an incidence of 7.98/1000 live births. Prolonged/obstructed labor, severe birth asphyxia, maternal pre-partum/peripartum pyrexia and home/traditional birth attendant deliveries were the main predisposing perinatal factors. Respiratory distress, fever and jaundice were the predominant presenting clinical findings. Gram-positive organisms were cultured from 18 neonates with Staphylococcus aureus accounting for 45.5% of the cases, while Escherichia coli was the predominant Gram-negative organism accounting for 18.2% of the cases. Group B streptococcus accounted for only one case and there was no case of Listeria monocytogenes. Early onset septicemia was commoner in in born while late onset septicemia was commoner with out born (chi(2)=10.45, P < 0.05). The bacterial isolates showed a high degree of in vitro antimicrobial resistance to conventional antibiotics and the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the organisms indicated the use of ceftriaxone and gentamicin as initial therapy while awaiting culture results. The overall mortality rate was 26.7%. Early onset septicemia and concomitant meningitis were associated with high mortality.
   Conclusion: Neonatal septicemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the study site. Most of the predisposing factors were due to poor obstetric care and unsterile delivery practices which could be avoided and prevented, and the causative organisms were different from those in the developed countries. There was appreciable resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Simple and sustainable interventions such as promotion of clean and timely deliveries, modern newborn care and specialized diagnostic facilities, hand washing and barrier nursing, and restriction of antibiotics may help reduce the burden of neonatal infection in the study community.

AB For the development of sustainable land-management systems in the highlands of N Thailand, detailed knowledge about soil distribution and soil properties is a prerequisite. Yet to date, there are hardly any detailed soil maps available on a watershed scale.
   In this study, soil maps on watershed level were evaluated with regard to their suitability for agricultural land-use planning. In addition to common scientific methods (as underlying the WRB classification), participatory methods were used to exploit local knowledge about soils and to document it in a "Local Soil Map".
   Where the WRB classification identified eight soil units, the farmers distinguished only five on the basis of soil color and "hardness". The "Local Soil Map" shows little resemblance with the detailed, patchy pattern of the WRB-based soil map. On the contrary, the "Local Soil Map" is fairly similar to the petrographic map suggesting that soil color is directly related to parent material.
   The farmers' perception about soil fertility and soil suitability for cropping could be confirmed by analytical data. We conclude that integrating local soil knowledge, petrographic information, and knowledge of local cropping practices allows for a rapid compilation of information for land-evaluation purposes at watershed level. It is the most efficient way to build a base for regional land-use planning.

AB The characterization of topsoils has recently received enhanced attention, particularly for environmental monitoring. Traditional national and international soil taxonomies hardly consider the topsoil in spite of its importance for soil quality. Consequently, the FAO "Topsoil Characterization for Sustainable Land Management" was developed to be used additionally for describing topsoils and to combine it with the "World Reference Base for Soil Resources" (WRB). In this paper, recommendations for a first step of a revision and expansion of the FAO "Topsoil Characterization" are made. On the one hand, common rules for soil description as used in the FAO "Guidelines for Profile Description" were incorporated in the FAO "Topsoil Characterization". On the other hand, new characteristics for the description of the organic matter and of biological features of the topsoils were introduced. At first, the proposed German systematics of humus forms is presented and correlated with different national systematics, for validation in the international context. Secondly, a correlation of the new German systematics of humus forms with the FAO "Top-soil Characterization for Sustainable Land Management" and other topsoil systematics is made. Thirdly, additional qualifiers are described focussing on the organic layers and the biological features.
   A coincidence between the characterization of humus forms and topsoils was found which appears to be an appropriate basis for the incorporation of humus forms in the FAO "Topsoil Characterization". Investigations have shown that the topsoils in forests can be described comprehensively by additional qualifiers for the organic layers. Grassland or arable land which usually lack organic layers can be characterized in detail by qualifiers concerning soil biological activity in the A horizon. The methodology was already applied successfully in temperate regions. But there is still a need for further discussion of the revision and for tests in tropical and subtropical zones and poorly drained areas.

AB Although water-soluble synthetic polymers find wide applications as flocculants, the potential problem associated with their use is lack of biodegradability and high cost. Polysaccharides owing to their distinctive features like ability to undergo different chemical reactions, biodegradability and sustainability inspire hope to obtain effective, economical viable and safe substitute of the synthetic flocculants. In this regard, chemical modification of Cassia tora and guar gum was carried out through different substitution and grafting reactions. The modified products were tested against kaolin under laboratory conditions vis-a-vis polyacrylamide based synthetic flocculant.

AB Objective. Etanercept is one of a new subgroup of biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are non-responsive or intolerant to conventional DMARD. We evaluated the effects of etanercept (Enbrel((R))) therapy in patients with RA in community-based clinical practice in Canada.
   Methods. Using a cohort design, patients requesting etanercept therapy were stratified into treatment and control arms based upon their individual accessibility to obtain the drug. Patients were interviewed serially during a 12-month period of monitoring. The study measured painful or tender joint count, morning stiffness, pain severity, quality of life measures, medication utilization, health services utilization, and presence of adverse events.
   Results. The baseline demographic and clinical variables for the treatment group (n = 223) and the control group (n = 208) were similar, except for education. income, and drug plan coverage. In followup, there was greater improvement in most clinical variables in the treatment arm compared to the control arm during the first 6 months, but the magnitude of difference between the 2 groups for some clinical variables decreased or became non-significant during the second 6 months. During the 12 month followup period there were 40 (18%) patient dropouts in the treatment group
   Conclusion. In a community based setting for the treatment of RA, etanercept can effectively improve the disease state, functional class, work disability, and quality of life during the first 6 months of use. To determine the longterm sustainability of these effects studies with more than 12 months' duration will be required.

AB The direction, complexity and pace of rural change in affluent, western societies can be conceptualized as a multifunctional transition, in which a variable mix of consumption and protection values has emerged, contesting the former dominance of production values, and leading to greater complexity and heterogeneity in rural occupance at all scales. This transition is propelled by three dominant driving forces, namely: agricultural overcapacity; the emergence of market-driven amenity values; and growing societal awareness of sustainability and preservation issues. Australia's generous supply of land and sparse investment in agriculture has facilitated local transitions towards enhanced consumption and protection values, enabling a clearer delineation of emerging differentiated modes of rural occupance than in more contested locales. In Australia seven distinctive modes of occupance can be identified, according to the relative precedence given to production, consumption or protection values. These modes are described as: productivist agricultural; rural amenity; small farm (or pluriactive); peri-metropolitan; marginalized agricultural; conservation; and indigenous. Within these seven modes, alternative trajectories are identified, indicating variability in the intensity and type of resource use. Articulation of the transition concept may provide synergy between discrete discourses in rural research. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   agri-environmental policy implementation at Finnish farms
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES

ID NETWORK; KNOWLEDGE
AB One of the main challenges of European environmental policies is to recruit local-level actors to fulfil set targets. This article explores how targets of European agri-environmental policy have been achieved in Finland. It also analyses how implementation practices produce conditions for agri-environmental management and how policy success-or sustainability in general-relates to the different actors' capacities to act. It is argued that we need to adopt a relational view in order to analyse the success and outcome of agri-environmental policy. This article assesses the ways in which the actor-network theory could contribute to this discussion by a notion of co-construction of agency. The empirical part of the article follows farmers' sociologies. The practices and conceptualisations through which the policy goals are translated into farming practices are analysed, and it is shown how different forms of knowledge have become relevant stakes in the politics of agri-environmental management. It is argued, that the notion of co-construction of agency will help to open up the translation process and scaling between local and universal knowledge. Most importantly, it reveals the different forms of resistance deriving from farming practices. Finally the challenges that the notion of co-construction of agency poses for the agri-environmental policy are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The status of the Delaware whelk dredge fishery was assessed front state landings reports and from data collected by an onboard observer. Mean annual whelk landings for 1994 to 2000 were 18.5 mt of meats and increased to 241.6 mt for the period 2001 to 2004. Annual landings for 2001 to 2003 were 88% to 119% of the sum of dredge and trawl fishery landings reported by the remaining states on the United States Atlantic coast. Although knobbed whelks. Busycon carica, are landed throughout the year. 88% of pooled monthly landings for 1994 to 2004 were taken between March and June inclusive. Eleven observer cruises were conducted March to June 2004. Total estimated daily take of legal (length >= 127 mm) knobbed whelks ranged from to 197-3.710 organisms. Expected catch rates were estimated at 83.2 legal knobbed whelks per hour per meter of dredge width. Dredges were generally (owed parallel to bathymetric contours and adjacent to shoal features in 2-20 in depths. Estimates of the area of bottom dredged on each cruise ranged from 4.9-14.2 ha. At times, multiple boats were observed dredging the same bottom, suggesting a cooperative fishing technique. Seventy-nine percent of dredge tows occurred on bottom comprised of mud and sand. and mean numbers of knobbed whelks in 0.04 m(3) samples, were greatest from mud/sand habitats. Twenty-one taxonomic groups of organisms were observed in samples taken from dredges. Knobbed whelk and horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus, dominated dredge catch by number. Whelks collected in file 9 Atlantic Ocean were significantly larger than those collected in the Delaware Bay. Mean lengths of whelks collected in the Bay in 2004, were significantly less than lengths of Bay whelks collected in 1994 prior to the inception of the minimum length regulation. Shifts in size distribution and the cyclical nature of other whelk fisheries suggest that the elevated landings experienced during 2001 to 2004 are not sustainable.

AB The diverse and often complex essential components of successful marine stock enhancement are briefly reviewed. Progress on a project to enhance the New South Wales blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) fishery is discussed to demonstrate that for sedentary reef invertebrates such as abalone. successful enhancement entails an understanding of recruitment and production limiting factors. These include age and size specific growth and mortality rates. These variables encompass the influence of other species within reef ecosystems, especially predators and species that compete directly with them for space, shelter and food. This discussion is also used to demonstrate that such difficult projects can be facilitated and refined using a simple bio-economic model centered on two interdependent tasks. The first is to minimize net costs per unit of additional sustainable production generated by enhancement. The second is to determine the minimum amount of additional sustainable production required to render a project cost-effective. This first task has, as expected, proven complex and its resolution protracted and expensive, requiring innovative biotechnology and a comprehensive knowledge of the natural biology of blacklip abalone. This discussion principally reflects the perspective of the direct potential beneficiaries of abalone fisheries enhancement. namely commercial and recreational fishers and does not deal extensively with wider views and interests of other stakeholders. namely relevant government agencies and NGOs and the general public.

AB Background: Fractionation of a ginseng source to produce differences in the ginsenoside profile might influence its effect on postprandial glycemia. To explore this possibility and identify an efficacious ginseng for a longterm study, we conducted a preparation-finding study of different Korean red ginseng (KRG) root fractions followed by a dose-finding study of the most efficacious fraction.
   Methods: A double-blind, randomized, within-subject design was used in both studies. In the preparation-finding study, 7 healthy subjects (sex: 3m:4f, age: 32 +/- 4 y, BMI: 24 +/- 2 kg/m(2)) received 6 g placebo and KRG-rootlets, -body, and -H2O extract 40 min before a 50 g-OGTT' with finger-prick blood samples at -40-, 0-, 15-, 30-, 45-, 60-, 90-, 120-min. In the dose-finding study, 12 healthy subjects (sex: 9M,3F, age: 29 +/- 3 y, BMI: 22.5 +/- 1 kg/m(2)) received 0 g (placebo), 2 g, 4 g, and 6 g of the most efficacious root fraction following the same protocol. Ginsenosides were analyzed using HPLC-UV.
   Results: In the preparation-finding study, a wide variation in the ginsenoside profiles was achieved across the 3 KRG fractions. This variation coincided with differential effects. The main effects of KRG-rootlets (p = 0.050) and time (p < 0.001) and their interaction (p < 0.1) were significant. This was reflected in a 29% reduction in area under the curve (AUC) by KRG-rootlets compared with placebo (p = 0.052). Conversely, neither KRG-H2O extract nor KRG-body affected glycemia. Stepwise-multiple regression models identified Rg1 as the sole predictor of mean- and AUC postprandial blood glucose. In the dose-finding study, KRG-rootlets were tested as the most efficacious fraction. A significant effect of KRG-rootlets treatment (mean of 3 doses) but not dose was found. The mean of 3 doses decreased AUC by 17% compared with placebo (p = 0.057).
   Conclusions: Together the studies indicate 2 g KRG-rootlets is sufficient to achieve reproducible reductions in postprandial glycemia. But the longterm sustainability of KRG selected using this approach remains to be tested.

AB Information technology investments and the management consulting industry witnessed unprecedented growth in the last decade. This led to regulators' ( SEC and Congress) allegations that consulting services that are provided by incumbent auditors may be disguised extra payments to auditors for favorable financial reporting. However, there may be alternative valid reasons for procurement of consulting. Under new legislation ( proclaimed in the aftermath of spectacular failures like Enron and Worldcom), publicly traded corporations that engage professional services firms to provide both audit services and consulting services must now disclose the extent and nature of these services. Using the data made available by these new mandated disclosures and using the theoretical backdrop of the resource-based view (RBV), this paper examines whether investments by firms in consulting services follow predictable patterns driven by economic factors. Thus, rather than examine whether IT consulting has any ex-post value or whether procurement of consulting impairs auditor independence, this study focuses on whether investments, ex-ante, follow logical patterns consistent with microeconomic principles. Our analysis shows that procurement of IT and management consulting is consistent with the resource-based view - companies seek to develop organizational capabilities they lack as dictated by their strategic business need. In contrast to the narrow "IT Doesn't Matter" view, it can be argued that even in the current environment of IT outsourcing, firms must carefully match their IT capability (in-house or outsourced) with organizational strategy and capability to develop unique and inimitable resources as put forth by RBV. We find that companies are indeed investing consistent with fundamental tenets of financial value analysis and based on market expectations of performance. More specifically, after controlling for pressure to perform and cash availability, low margin and low turnover companies spend more on consulting services. Low-margin strategy companies expend more on consulting when their asset turnover is also low, while low-turnover strategy companies expend more on consulting when their earnings margin is also low.

AB Nature conservation in the UK has relied heavily on science to justify the selection and management of protected areas. Despite apparent movement towards sustainability rhetoric, and a downplaying of scientific expertise, scientific guidelines continue to drive protected area designation. This paper reports on interview-based research in northern Scotland with stakeholders around designated nature conservation sites, and records views on the roles of scientific and local knowledge. This demonstrates the way in which scientific knowledge acts to reduce opportunities for debate, and ways in which local knowledge is used as a form of resistance. It is concluded that the focus on science can exacerbate conflict between conservation organisations and landowners, and that efforts to work with broader definitions of value, which generate popular appeal, must be developed.

Salinity and waterlogging have developed over time in the region, due to unfavorable use of irrigation water and inadequate drainage. We use data collected in a Survey of farmers in the region to estimate regression models for cotton production on degraded and non-degraded soils. We conclude that cotton yields are reduced by 34.4% and gross margins are reduced by $860.2/ha, as a result of land degradation. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is a strong history of social science research within Latin America, but its visibility (both within and outside the region) has been low for reasons of language and print distribution. The introduction of the Internet and online publication makes this information potentially more visible to the global research community, and within Latin America several organizations have undertaken to exploit this opportunity. The approaches taken show how collaboration between countries, and particularly between librarians and publishers, can provide innovative solutions. The CLACSO project uses a digital library model as a publishing platform for its member journals and this has provided a successful - and hopefully sustainable - model.

DT Article
AB Rhetoric about the ideal pricing model for scholarly content is often both strident and ill-informed. Recognition of the nature of the business model is sometimes overlooked in favour of slogans or blanket accusations. This paper reviews qualitatively some of the core issues surrounding the creation of a sustainable pricing model that will enable authors, readers, and publishers to coexist. No particular examples are recommended or rejected; what is important is that interested parties explore thoroughly the available options and make decisions based on available facts, instead of emotion or trends.

AB Illuminance has long been the Holy Grail if the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America and of its constituents. For a century, illuminance has been a moving target. Now unpopular with or at least uninteresting to most of the research community and, apparently, even the application committees, illuminance criteria waffle from RP to RP and recently handbook to handbook. Its fall from grace is illuminated in the latest handbook where it is subservient to other important but less risky criteria. Illuminance simply isn't glamorous. Further, now, many illuminance criteria are promulgated as single-values, while a few notable and critically important exceptions such as parking lot illuminance criteria are essentially nonexistent with a heavily-footnoted ambiguous figure in the handbook suggesting anything goes. To reclaim its position as The Lighting Authority T the IESNA must reestablish if not simply reinstate rational, robust illuminance guidelines for real-world applications worthy of professionals', code officials', and the public's immediate and every attention.

AB This article discusses animal welfare in organic farming systems in relation to values and aims in organic farming. It sums up experiences from a 4-year interdisciplinary project. An important finding is that animal welfare is understood somewhat differently in organic fanning from what is common in conventional agriculture. It is interpreted in terms of natural living, which includes the possibility to perform a natural behaviour, feed adapted to the animal's physiology and a natural environment. Some of the criticism of animal welfare in organic farming may stein from different understandings of what "welfare" actually means. However, although welfare is an important aim in organic fanning, the overall concern is to develop sustainable farming systems. This causes some welfare dilemmas. For example, a healthy system does not automatically mean good welfare for the individual. Based on available literature the actual welfare situation in organic systems was scrutinized. Unfortunately little research has been done, but a careful conclusion was that animal health is as good or better than in conventional farming-with the exception of parasitic diseases. Organic farming systems have a "welfare potential", but organic farmers must deal with the dilemmas and take animal welfare issues seriously. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the extent to which the managerial skills possessed by top management teams affect the performance of municipal organisations in Israel. We evaluated both perceived (education, employment, and culture, recreation and sport services) and objective (collecting efficiency ratio and surplus (deficit) ratio) performance measures. In general, the results show that the managerial skills possessed by the top management team explain variance in organisational performance. Interestingly, structural context plays an important role, especially for performance measures that are potentially less changeable in the short term (collecting efficiency ratio). Managerial skills are a good predictor of performance measures (surplus (deficit) ratio) that can be changed in the short term rather easily, and explain variance in municipal services, especially when the top management team views them as important and highly valued by residents.

AB Many smelter operators subscribe to the "precautionary principle" and wish to understand the behavior of the metals and impurities during smelting, especially how they distribute between product and waste phases and whether these phases lead to environmental, health, or safety issues. In copper smelting, copper and other elements are partitioned between copper matte, iron silicate slag, and possibly the waste gas. Many copper concentrates contain small amounts of cobalt, a metal of considerable value but also of some environmental interest. In this work, the matte/slag distribution ratio (weight percent) of cobalt between copper matte (55 wt pet) and iron silicate slag was thermodynamically modeled and predicted to be approximately 5. Experiments were performed using synthetic matte and slag at 1250 degrees C under a low oxygen partial pressure and the distribution ratio was found to be 4.3, while between industrial matte and slag, the ratio was found to be 1.8. Both values are acceptably close to each other and to the predicted value, given the errors inherent in such measurements. The implications of these results for increasingly sustainable copper production are discussed.

AB Alcohol production from corn is gaining importance in Ontario, Canada, and elsewhere. A major cost of corn production is the cost of chemical fertilizers and these continue to increase in price. The competitiveness of alcohol with fossil fuels depends on access to low-cost corn that allows growers to earn a sustainable income. In this study we set out to determine if we can identify root-associated microorganisms from Ontario-grown corn that can enhance the nutrient flow to corn roots, directly or indirectly, and help minimize the use of extraneous fertilizer. Bacteria were isolated from corn rhizosphere and screened for their capacity to enhance corn growth. The bacteria were examined for their ability to fix nitrogen, solubilize phosphate, and produce indole acetic acid (IAA) and antifungal substances on potato dextrose agar. Bacterial suspensions were applied to pregerminated seed of four corn varieties (39D82, 39H84, 39M27, and 39T68) planted in sterilized sand and unsterilized cornfield soil. The plants were grown under greenhouse conditions for 30 days. Three isolates were identified as having growth-promoting effect. These bacteria were identified as to species by biochemical tests, fatty acid profiles, and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Corn rhizosphere isolates, Gluconacetobacter azotocaptans DS1, Pseudomonas putida CQ179, and Azospirillum lipoferum N7, provided significant plant growth promotion expressed as increased root/shoot weight when compared to uninoculated plants, in sand and/or soil. All strains except P. putida CQ179 were capable of nitrogen fixation and IAA production. Azospirillum brasilense, however, produced significantly more IAA than the other isolates. Although several of the strains were also able to solubilize phosphate and produce metabolites inhibitory to various fungal pathogens, these properties are not considered as contributing to growth promotion under the conditions used in this study. These bacteria will undergo field tests for their effect on corn growth.

AB Camping has severely impacted soil and vegetation in many natural areas. Effective techniques for restoring native vegetation are needed, particularly at high elevation. This study assessed the effectiveness of transplanting and restoration treatments designed to improve the physical, biological, and chemical properties of soils (scarification and amendments of organic matter, compost, and soil inoculum), and ameliorate microclimatic conditions (application of a biodegradable mulch mat) on six closed campsites in subalpine forests in Oregon. Most transplants (68%) were still alive seven years after transplanting. Mean area and height of surviving transplants increased 39% and 19%, respectively, over the seven years. Transplanting success varied among species. Graminoids survived most frequently, while tree species grew most rapidly. Only 45% of the shrub transplants survived and the canopy area of most survivors decreased. Shrubs constitute about 70% of the undisturbed groundcover. The soil amendments, particularly addition of compost and organic matter, increased the growth of transplants but had little effect on survivorship. Effects were most pronounced for graminoids and diminished after the fourth year of the experiment. The application of a biodegradable mulch mat had no effect. Transplanting locally collected plants is an effective means of accelerating the restoration of damaged campsites in these subalpine forests. However, the more elaborate treatments were only modestly successful in increasing transplanting success. They did not overcome the difficulty of restoring sustainable populations of the shrubs Vaccinium scoparium and Phyllodoce empetriformis.

AB Numerous studies have shown the neuroprotective and regenerative benefits of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in animal models of PD. Brain delivery of GDNF can, however, be associated with limiting side-effects in both primates and PD patients, rendering the duration of delivery a critical factor. In the present study, the effects of transient vs. sustained GDNF delivery by encapsulated cells were evaluated in a bilateral animal model, closely mimicking advanced PD. One week following bilateral striatal 6-hydroxydopamine injections in rats, capsules loaded with human fibroblasts genetically engineered to release GDNF were bilaterally implanted in the striatum. GDNF delivery resulted in a significant improvement of movement initiation and swimming performance in the lesioned animals, associated with striatal rein nervation of dopaminergic fibers. To test the sustainability of the behavioral improvement, GDNF-secreting capsules were withdrawn in a subgroup of animals, 7 weeks post-implantation. Strikingly, both the behavioral and morphological improvements were maintained until the sacrifice of the animals 6 weeks post-GDNF withdrawal. The sustained cellular and behavioral benefits after GDNF washout suggest the need for temporary delivery of the trophic factor in PD. Retrievable encapsulated cells represent an attractive delivery tool to achieve this purpose. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Much of the criticism leveled at aquaculture (e.g., dependency on animal-derived feedstuffs, nutrient-laden effluent discharges, and increased organic contamination in edible products) can be traced to the feeds in use. Accordingly, finfish nutritionists are being challenged to formulate feeds that not only meet the nutritional requirements of livestock but also minimize production costs, limit environmental impacts, and enhance product quality. These challenges not only add considerable complexity to finfish nutrition but also afford opportunities to avoid some of the mistakes made by other industries in the past. From a review of the current status of finfish nutrition with respect to major nutrient classes, we comment on future opportunities and promising avenues of research. Alternative protein sources, specifically those derived from marine bycatch, plants, and microbes, are discussed, as well as methods to facilitate their implementation in finfish feeds. Dietary lipid, its role in fish bioenergetics and physiology, and quality of aquaculture products is reviewed with special emphasis on alternative lipid sources and finishing diets. Carbohydrates and fiber are discussed in terms of nutrient-sparing, least-cost diet formulation and digestive physiology. Micronutrients are reviewed in terms of current knowledge of requirements and, along with other dietary immunostimulants. are given further consideration in a review of nutriceuticals and application in finfish feeds. The status of nutritional research in new aquaculture species is also outlined. By integrating classical approaches with emerging technologies, dietary formulations, and species, finfish nutritionists may identify means to increase production efficiency and sustainability and provide for the continued success of aquaculture.

AB Improving the efficiency of aquaculture production is important for both economic and environmental sustainability. The purpose of this work was to define the relationships between feed intake, weight gain, and feed efficiency (measured as residual feed intake) in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss fed either to apparent satiation or a limited ration. The results indicated that under an apparent satiation feeding regime, a weak but significant correlation existed between weight gain and residual feed intake (RFI; r = -0.31, P < 0.04). When fed a limited ration, the correlation between weight gain and RFI was stronger (r = -0.57, P < 0.001). Genetic differences between family groups were detected only under the apparent satiation feeding regime and not under limited feeding. Although these experiments were conducted on different groups of fish, it appears that the variation in RFI was greater in satiation-fed fish than in fish fed a limited ration (coefficient of variation = 174% versus 33%). Estimates of residual feed intake measured on individuals from full-sib families and on groups of individuals from the same families were correlated (r = 0.66, P = 0.03), suggesting that the feed efficiency measured on individually reared fish captures a trait expressed in social groups as well.

TI The design of the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor
SO NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB India has a moderate uranium reserve and a large thorium reserve. The primary energy resource for electricity generation in the country is coal. The potential of other resources like gas, oil, wind, solar and biomass is very limited. The only viable and sustainable resource is the nuclear energy. Presently, Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors utilizing natural uranium are in operation/under construction and the plutonium generated from these reactors will be multiplied through breeding in fast breeder reactors. The successful construction, commissioning and operation of Fast Breeder Test Reactor at Kalpakkam has given confidence to embark on the construction of the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR). This paper describes the salient design features of PFBR including the design of the reactor core, reactor assembly, main heat transport systems, component handling, steam water system, electrical power systems, instrumentation and control, plant layout, safety and research and development.

AB A number of international fisheries instruments, starting with the U.N. Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995, have made provisions for the participation of fishing entities in the conservation and sustainable use of the world's fisheries resources. These instruments have created rights and obligations for fishing entities which are, in many respects, almost identical to those accorded to states. Although this development does not necessarily imply that fishing entities are states, the conclusion is inescapable that such entities are new subjects of international law in so far as international fisheries management is concerned.

AB Understanding the factors leading to inter-annual variation in recruitment of animals with complex life cycles is a key goal for ecology and the sustainable management of animal resources, such as fisheries. We used otolith microstructure to determine larval growth rates of post-larval King George whiting, Sillaginodes punctata, in seagrass beds of Port Phillip Bay, Australia. Inter-annual variation in growth determined early in the pelagic, offshore larval-stage was highly correlated with post-larval abundance (a predictor of fishery recruitment). Sea surface temperature measured near the presumed spawning area off Western Victoria was significantly correlated with larval growth, and was also significantly correlated with post-larval abundance in Port Phillip Bay. Increased water temperature would have had the direct effect of increasing larval growth and therefore contributing to larval survival, but may also have been indicative of enhanced physical transport and/or plankton productivity. Overall, larval growth rate of King George whiting is a very strong predictor of post-larval abundance, which in turn will influence fishery recruitment in 3-5 years' time.

ID GROWTH
AB Seahorses and their syngnathid relatives have provided a focus for efforts to ensure sustainable use of marine resources, with new international trade controls (CITES Appendix II) implemented in May 2004. We demonstrate how a study of international trade can be used to assess relative levels of threat and set domestic research and conservation priorities. Australia has remarkably high syngnathid biodiversity with at least 14 seahorse species, two endemic sea dragon species, and 90 species of pipefishes and pipehorses found in its territorial waters. Our objectives were to quantify species, trade routes, volumes, values and temporal trends in syngnathid trade to and from Australia. We found that Australia is probably the major global supplier of dried pipehorses Solegnathus spp.. These fishes, including at least one endemic species, are sourced from trawl bycatch and comprise Australia's largest syngnathid export, by both volume and value. Research is urgently needed to evaluate the impacts and sustainability of trawling on pipehorse populations. Australia is also the sole supplier of two sea dragon species, Phycodurus eques and Phyllopteryx taeniolatus, for the live aquarium trade. Although lucrative, the number of wild-caught individuals involved in this trade was relatively low and probably of low conservation risk relative to habitat loss. Exports of seahorses and other pipefish species, and imports of all syngnathid species, are minor on a global scale, although the burgeoning aquaculture industry for seahorses requires careful evaluation for its potential impacts on wild populations.

AB Madagascar's endemic freshwater crayfish (Parastacidae: Astacoides) are harvested by local people for both subsistence use and small-scale trade. There has been concern that populations, and even species, are threatened by overexploitation but little is known about the harvest or its economic importance. We studied crayfish exploitation in eastern Madagascar over 3 years. The existence of local taboos (lady) preventing commercial crayfish harvesting, as well as access to markets and forest, influenced involvement in the harvest. All four crayfish species found in the region were harvested, but A. granulimanus provided the majority of the catch. In one harvesting village more than 50% of the 47 households were directly involved in the harvest, which contributed USD 2,382 to the village economy in 2003/2004, an important sum in the context of local incomes. Subsistence use was widespread, particularly by children to whom it may provide an important protein source. Community-based conservation (through transfer of harvesting rights and responsibilities for forest management to local communities) is central to a new conservation paradigm in Madagascar. This recognizes communities' long term interest in their natural resources and offers an ideal opportunity for those concerned with the sustainability of the harvest to implement management tools (such as avoiding reproductive females, size limits and no-take zones). We discuss each tool with respect to biological implications and practical constraints. We note that community-based approaches may not be sufficient to conserve rarer species, which make up a small proportion of the value of the harvest.

AB From March 2001 to December 2003 eight direct count surveys in an upstream direction were conducted for Ganges river dolphins Platanista gangetica gangetica in the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, a c. 60 km long segment of the middle Ganges River in Bihar, India. The mean number of dolphins recorded during upstream surveys was 119.4 +/- 31.8 (range 88-174), with an encounter rate of 1.8 dolphins km(-1) (range 1.4-2.8). During these surveys a rich diversity of other threatened aquatic wildlife was also documented, including the Indian smooth-coated otter Lutrogale perspicillata, gharial Gavialis gangeticus, a variety of freshwater turtles, and 135 water bird species. An assessment of fisheries documented 76 fish species of which 43% were caught exclusively in monofilament gill nets, a gear known to kill dolphins by entanglement. Eight new records of fishes preyed upon by Ganges river dolphins were identified from the stomach contents of two dolphin carcasses (Setipinna brevifilis, Osteobrama cotio cotio, Puntius sophore, Crosochelius latius, Mystus cavasius, Heteropneustus fossilis, Macrognathus pancalus, Sperata seenghala). These fishes and other species previously recorded in the diet of the dolphins composed 33.3% of the total catch sampled in 2001-2003. Interviews of 108 fishing households revealed that literacy rates were low (29.9%) and almost 50% earned less than USD 411 per year. The most important conservation actions that could be taken are for national and state governments to establish civil control and promote the development of community-based fishing cooperatives. These cooperatives could enjoy ownership rights to certain river segments in exchange for employing sustainable fishing techniques that are less injurious to dolphins.

AB Vicuna Vicugna vicugna are an emblematic species of one of the major arid ecosystems of the neotropics: the puna or altiplano. Excessive commercial hunting of vicuna for their valuable fleece in the past caused a severe decline in the population, with the vicuna almost becoming extinct by the mid 20th century. Effective protection resulted in the recovery of some populations and, recently, limited vicuna exploitation has been allowed. Research is urgently required to underpin the design of the management systems used for this exploitation. We present the results of a 2-year study on habitat utilization of vicuna in Laguna de Pozuelos UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in Argentina. Vicuna did not use the study area homogeneously but preferred vegetation communities dominated by grasses (known locally as pajonal and esporal) and with high overall plant cover. Vicuna were less selective in 2003, when overall habitat quality decreased, than in 2002. This change is predicted by habitat selection theory. We also found that members of family groups spend more time foraging than members of non-reproductive groups. Solitary vicuna spend more time standing up than members of groups, consistent with the observation that herding behaviour is related to protection against predators. Heterogeneous use and habitat selectivity suggest that exploitation of vicuna needs to take spatial behaviour into account in the establishment of the optimal location of capturing sites.

AB The anthelmintic properties of tanniferous plants and of their secondary metabolites represent one possible alternative to chemotherapy that is currently being explored as a means of achieving sustainable control of gastrointestinal nematodes in ruminants. Previous in vivo and in vitro results Suggest that tanniferous plants can have direct anti-parasitic effect against different stages of nematodes. However, the mode of action of the bioactive plant Compounds remains obscure. The objectives of the Current study were (1) to examine the hypothesis that extracts of tanniferous plants might interfere with the exsheathment of third-stage infective larvae (U); (2) to assess the role of tannins in the process by examining the consequence of adding an inhibitor of tannins (polyethylene glycol: PEG) to extracts. The effects of 4 tanniferous plant extracts on exsheathment have been examined on L3 of Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Artificial exsheathment was induced in vitro by adding hypochloride solution to larval suspension. The evolution of exsheathment with time was measured by repeated observations at 10-min interval for 60 min. The selected plants were: genista (Sarothammus scoparius), heather (Erica erigena), pine tree (Pinus sylvestris), and chestnut tree (Castanea sativa), with tannin contents ranging from 1.5 to 24.7% of DM. Extracts of a non-tanniferous plant (rye grass, tannin content: 0.3% of DM) were included in the assay LIS negative controls. The extracts were tested at the concentration of 600 mu g/ml and the effects were compared to the rate of exsheathment of control larvae in PBS. No statistical differences in the pattern of exsheathment was observed after addition of rye grass or genista extracts for both nematode species and with heather extracts for T. colubriformis. In contrast, pine tree extracts on larvae of both species and heather extracts with H. contortus induced a significant delay in exsheathment. Last, contact with chest nut extracts led to a total inhibition of the process for both nematodes. These results Suggest that extracts of tanniferous plants might affect a key process in the very early stages of larval invasion of the host. In most cases, the addition of PEG led to a total or partial restoration towards control values. This suggests that tannins are largely involved in the inhibitory process. However, other secondary metabolites may also interfere with the process that Would help to explain some of the differences in response observed between the two nematode species.

AB China has to raise agricultural productivity in its limited and shrinking farmland to guarantee food security for its huge and ever-growing population. Sustainable soil nutrient management is of paramount importance to the world's most populous country. Critical challenges the country is facing in sustaining soil fertility and in alleviating the hazardous impact of intensive fertilizer use are discussed in this paper. It is emphatically pointed out that national strategies as well as area-specific action plans with respect to scientific nutrient management are urgently needed to balance productivity and sustainability in the future. Relevant proposals for addressing those challenges are also presented.

AB The objective of this work was to evaluate soil and water losses by hydric erosion, in standard plots under natural rainfall, in different management systems of post-planting eucalyptus forests. The experiment was installed in an undulated relief, on a very clayey Typic Haplustox. The data collections were performed from October 2002 to February 2004, in rain events considered erosive. The studied systems were: native forest; planted pasture; cross slope direction eucalyptus; slop direction eucalyptus; slope direction eucalyptus with burning of crop residues, and bare soil. Among the forest systems, the cross slope direction eucalyptus is the one which is closer to the native forest in terms of soil losses, indicating the highest sustainability of the former in the water erosion context. The higher values of water losses, were found in the slope direction eucalyptus system with burning of crop residues, suggesting that the fire both increases repellence to water and diminishes water infiltration rates in soil. All the eucalyptus management systems presented soil losses below tolerance limit.

AB Cerebral palsy is one of the most common causes of activity limitation in children. The central nervous system (CNS) lesion causing the disorder of posture and movement is nonprogressive, but the manifestations of the lesion may change over time. Children with cerebral palsy may display a range of movement disorders, alone or in combination, including dystonia, athetosis, ataxia, and spasticity.(1) Spasticity is a complex phenomenon and has been defined as "a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motoneuron syndrome."(2(p485)) Spasticity can be associated with co-contraction, clonus, and hyperreflexia. Children with spastic cerebral palsy generally have a typical pattern of muscle weakness, impairment in selective motor control, and sensory impairment, in addition to spasticity.(1) In some centers, traditional management for children with spastic cerebral palsy has included physical therapy interventions and use of orthotic devices, with the goal of postponing orthopedic Surgery until the child is older (eg, after age 6 years).(3) These interventions aim to optimize function and strive to delay or treat deformity resulting from spasticity, but they do not effect any sustainable change in the amount of spasticity.

DE fisheries management; maximum sustained yield; maximum sustained
   economic yield; individual transferable quotas
AB Many fisheries management systems, even when based on apparently sound science, have failed to prevent severe overfishing. And even when successful in this sense, such systems have frequently resulted in a large degree of excess fishing capacity. The reason for these failures can often be found in a lack of consideration of the economic incentives affecting fishermen. Specifically, when forced to compete for a fixed total annual catch quota (TAC), fishermen are motivated to fish at high intensity, and to expand the fishing power of their vessels. Individual fishing quotas (IFQs) are being increasingly used as a method of altering economic incentives in a desirable way. IFQ systems, however, can also suffer severe shortcomings, unless substantial fees are extracted for the exclusive right to exploit a publicly owned resource. When combined with appropriate fees, or royalties, IFQs can indeed result in sustainable, profitable fisheries. There still remains the fundamental question of risk management, but this is also now beginning to be addressed. Thus there is now a strong hope for the future success of marine fisheries, at least within 200-mile coastal zones.

AB Sustained oscillation is frequently observed in population dynamics of biospecies. The oscillation comes not only from deterministic but also from stochastic characteristics. In the present article, we deal with a finite size lattice which contains prey and predator. The interaction between a pair of lattice points is carried out by two different methods; local and global interactions. In the former, interaction occurs between adjacent sites, while in the latter interaction takes place between any pair of lattice sites. It is found that both systems exhibit undamped oscillations. The amplitude of oscillation decreases with the increase of the total lattice sites. In the case of global interaction, we can present a stochastic differential equation which is composed of two factors, i.e., the Lotka-Volterra equation with density dependence and noise term. The quantitative agreement between theory and simulation results of global interaction is almost perfect.

TI Household strategies in the face of resource scarcity in coastal Ghana:
   are they associated with development priorities?

AB In many developing regions, women and young girls spend several hours daily in the collection of natural resources. Still the link between these household resource strategies and stakeholder perceptions of development priorities remains unexplored. This project examines this association with survey data representative of the adult population from Ghana's Coastal Region. Although natural resource scarcity and the sustainability of resource use represent key development challenges, there are others (e.g., energy, sanitation, employment, and educational opportunities). As such, even in the face of natural resource scarcity, individuals may place greater importance on other dimensions of development, especially if household resource strategies are perceived as relatively efficient. The analytical focus here is on water and the results suggest that gender roles shape household water collection strategies, while also shaping these strategies' perceived opportunity costs. Specifically, Ghanian adults more often see drinking water provision as their primary development need when water sources are distant and/or when male household members collect water (particularly male heads). In the end, I argue that social science inquiry benefits by contextualizing social dynamics within environmental context, particularly within cultural settings in which human subsistence is intimately tied to the state of the natural environment.

AB Aim: To evaluate the feasibility and impact of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW MRI) as the first line neuroimaging of stroke at a district general hospital.
   Methods: Prospective audit of all in-patients admitted with clinically suspected acute stroke and referred for imaging over a consecutive 17 week period. The data collected included scan type, time from cerebral event to imaging request, and time from formal radiological request to neuroimaging. Clinicians' ( general physicians, neurologists, and radiologists) perceptions were assessed by a questionnaire.
   Results: 148 patients had neuroimaging for clinically suspected stroke during this period. Eighty one per cent of patients (120 of 148) had DW MRI as first line. Ninety two per cent of these patients had DW MRI within 24 hours of the formal radiological request. Twenty eight patients did not undergo DW MRI because lack of MRI safety, clinical state, unavailability because of maintenance service or lack of trained staff. Clinicians found the introduction of the DW MRI based service a significant improvement on computed tomography, especially for equivocal cases.
   Conclusion: DW based MRI service is both feasible and sustainable in the setting of a district general hospital and most clinicians feel that this is a significant improvement to stroke services.

AB Health care access issues present significant challenges for rural populations and health providers. Psychology can support improved access and quality of rural health services through the development of integrated behavior health programs within primary care settings. This article reviews a clinical training and service delivery program, the Rural Hawai'i Behavioral Health Program, which has evolved in response to the pressing health needs of Native Hawaiians in rural communities. Native Hawaiian cultural factors and components of the primary care model that have supported the development of this program will be reviewed. Program expansion, sustainability, and treatment efficacy research will be discussed.

AB Background: Experts call for stronger safety cultures and transparent reporting practices to increase medication safety in today's strained healthcare environments. The field of ecological restoration is concerned with the effective, efficient, and sustainable repair and recovery of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. A study was undertaken to determine whether the lessons of restoration science can be adapted to the study of medication safety issues.
   Methods: Working with 26 practitioners, the principles of good restoration were used to design and pilot an innovative multifaceted medication safety intervention. The intervention included focus groups with practitioners, the construction and administration of a research based medication safety inventory, repeat digital photography of environmental safety issues, and targeted environmental modifications.
   Results: Participants were most concerned about staff education and the physical environment for medication administration. Ward staff used the research to build a healthy reporting culture, introduce regular discussions of near misses, develop education strategies, redesign delivery and storage processes, and renovate the environment.
   Conclusions: Members of a busy hospital ward successfully adapted methods of restoration science to study, redesign, and strengthen medication safety practices and ward safety culture within existing resources. Further research will be conducted to test the merits of restoration science for health care.

AB After 16 years of implementation of the European Union's (EU) Cohesion policy, it is appropriate to review its initial rationale and subsequent impact on socio-economic conditions in the EU. In 1989, few expected significant results from the policy. During the last decade and a half, not only have the peripheral and less-developed regions and countries not fallen behind the developed countries of the core, but also they have grown at faster rates than the core areas. The policy has helped to reduce the socio-economic disparities between core and peripheral areas. For the less-developed countries that have recently (or are expected to join in the near future), the real attraction for entering the EU is not limited to full access to the Single Market, but it is also tied to the goal of participating in the Cohesion policy as a means of spurring a sustainable pattern of economic growth in the medium- to long-term.

AB Concerns about sustainability, and the harsh realities of environmental catastrophe, can be traced back at least 4000 years. This paper points out how human pressures on the surrounding environment have had severe consequences over this period, coal burning has had adverse consequences traceable over the past 750 years, and the adverse environmental impacts of using other fossil fuels have aroused attention more recently. Heightened awareness of the need for sustainable development is a modem development, evident in international and national debates since the early 1970s. With the Brundtland Commission report published in 1987 came a framework for sustainable energy development. However, performance under the four element, of that framework have been almost uniformly disappointing. Fossil fuel use has continued to rise; renewable energy use has made insufficient inroads; waste and inefficiency in energy usage continues to be far too high; too many people remain without modem energy services or are exposed to severe pollution in the home and local atmosphere; there are mounting concerns about the conventional oil resource base-and future supplies and prices of oil and natural gas; greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and evidence of human-induced climate change continues to mount. Indices of national environmental performance suggest no country is performing adequately; population, housing and transportation pressures result in greater pollution, loss of natural habitats, and species reduction; and poor governance is frequently cited as a major cause of poor environmental performance. The prospects for sustainable energy are bleak on current trends. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Since the Stockholm Conference of 1972 the UN system has taken a leading role in promoting environmental and development issues, and more recently sustainable energy issues. A review of the past 30 or so years suggests that the results, especially for energy and emissions related matters, have been modest. The author raises questions as to whether the UN system, although easily criticised, is to blame or whether it is national governments and/or apathetic populations with their own vested interests. He concludes that failures are more at the national and individual levels, where sound and imaginative governance and responses are to be found wanting. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental concerns are growing and interest in environmental issues is increasing and the idea of generating electricity with less pollution is becoming more and more attractive. Unlike conventional generation systems, fuel of the solar photovoltaic energy is available at no cost. And solar photovoltaic energy systems generate electricity pollution-free and can easily be installed on the roof of residential as well as on the wall of commercial buildings as grid-connected PV application. In addition to grid-connected rooftop PV systems, solar photovoltaic energy offers a solution for supplying electricity to remote located communities and facilities, those not accessible by electricity companies.
   The interest in solar photovoltaic energy is growing worldwide. Today, more than 3500 MW of photovoltaic systems have been installed all over the world. Since 1970, the PV price has continuously dropped [8]. This price drop has encouraged worldwide application of small-scale residential PV systems. These recent developments have led researchers concerned with the environment to undertake extensive research projects for harnessing renewable energy sources including solar energy. The usage of solar photovoltaic as a source of energy is considered more seriously making future of this technology looks promising.
   The objective of this contribution is to present the latest developments in the area of solar photovoltaic energy systems. A further objective of this contribution is to discuss the long-term prospect of the solar photovoltaic energy as a sustainable energy supply. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fuel cell system is an advanced power system for the future that is sustainable, clean and environmental friendly. The importance of fuel cell as the future power system is discussed in the light of future fossil fuel depletion, impending international law on green house gases control and the national renewable energy policy. The modern development of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) for the last 20 years is then briefly reviewed and the current status of international and national research and development of this type of are established. The review also discuss the remaining research and development issues that still need to be resolved before these fuel cells are available for commercial application. The main thrust in PEMFC research and development is to lower the cost of the fuel cell by reduction in membrane and electrocatalyst costs. Although Europe, USA, Canada and Japan are leading fuel cell research and development as commercialization, it is not too late for Malaysia to master this technology and to apply it to niche markets in the future.

TI Monetary union with voluntary participation
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB A monetary union is modelled as a technology that makes a surprise policy deviation impossible and requires voluntarily participating countries to follow the same monetary policy. Within a fully dynamic context, we show that such an arrangement may dominate a regime with independent national currencies. Two new results are delivered by the voluntary participation assumption. First, the optimal plan is shown to respond to a country's temptation to leave the union by tilting both current and future policy in its favour. This yields a non-linear rule according to which each country weight in policy decisions is time-varying and depends on its incentive to abandon the union. Second, we show that there might be conditions such that a break-up of the union, as has occurred in some historical episodes, is efficient. The paper thus provides a first formal analysis of the incentives behind the formation, sustainability. and disruption of a monetary union.

AB OBJECTIVE: The expense of acquiring antiretroviral drugs in Brazil has given rise to debate about the sustainability of the policy of universal access to AIDS medications, despite the evident benefits. The objective of this study was to analyze the evolution of the Ministry of Health's spending on acquiring antiretroviral drugs from 1998 to 2005, the determining factors and the medium-term sustainability of this policy (2006-2008).
   METHODS: The study on the evolution of spending on antiretrovirals included analysis of their prices, the year-by-year expenditure, the number of patients utilizing the medication, the mean expenditure per patient and the strategies for reducing the prices maintained during this period. To analyze the sustainability of the policy for access to antiretrovirals, the cost of acquiring the drugs over the period from 2006 to 2008 was estimated, along with the proportion of gross domestic product and federal health expenditure represented by this spending. The data were collected from the Ministry of Health, the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and the Ministry of Planning,
   RESULTS: The expenditure on antiretrovirals increased by 66% in 2005, breaking the declining trend observed over the period from 2000 to 2004. The main factors associated with this increase were the weakening of the national genetics industry and the unsatisfactory results from the process of negotiating with pharmaceutical companies.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Brazilian policy for universal access is unsustainable at the present growth rates of the gross domestic product, unless the country compromises its investments in other fields.

AB This study was intended to assess care provided to those living with HIV/AIDS in Brazil and the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) capacity of delivering interventions to cope with the epidemic as well as to discuss the sustainability of the Brazilian initiative of providing universal free access to antiretrovirals (ARVs). Original data from a study comprising 119 respondents on the potential capacity of delivering a prospective HIV vaccine in Brazil was used. Inpatient and pharmaceutical care was based on data from the SUS Hospital Information System and Drug Logistics Management Systems of the National Program for STD/AIDS. The study results indicate good performance of the Brazilian ARV Access Program but access to treatment of opportunistic infections was, however, unsatisfactory. The rates covered by SUS for AIDS hospital admissions remained very low, on average around R$700 in 2004. Health care to HIV/AIDS patients has been considered a citizen's right strongly supported by an effective joint action of the Brazilian government and civil society. The current challenges are fine monitoring of processes and program results and ensuring sustainability of universal free ARV access.

The national policy on AIDS was characterized by the illustrative Brazilian experience in summoning multiple government, civil society, and private sector initiatives to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The synergy between different partners needs to be enhanced and efforts in the field of scientific and technological development must be articulated in order to minimize the effects of technological dependence. These actions are aimed at the sustainable production of drugs and other products, with the perspective of improving the fulfillment of the constitutional precept of health as a universal right.

AB Livestock is one of the main sources of wealth in developing countries. The improvement of national herds and of their productivity through controlling the main diseases and preventing epizootics is a major objective in these countries. The organisation of surveillance systems is indispensable to proper animal health management, both nationally and internationally. Therefore, thanks to foreign assistance, developing countries have gradually established epidemiological surveillance networks, despite unfavourable contexts (poverty, lack of resources or infrastructure...). To date, many networks are operating in satisfactory manner and produce tangible results. However, further efforts must be made to improve the quality of sanitary information produced, its performance and sustainability. This article discusses the context and motivations for the establishment of epidemiological surveillance networks in developing countries, especially in Africa, by describing some of their operational specificities and some results. Finally, it presents the example of a Mauritanian animal disease epidemiological surveillance network and its role in managing a health crisis.

AB Trade in livestock and livestock products makes up approximately one sixth of global agriculture trade. This trade is demand driven, primarily by growing human populations, changing economies, and consumer preferences in developing countries. Different rates of population growth, economic growth, urbanisation, environmental sustainability, and technology transfer will determine which countries will reap the greatest benefits. Global trends in demand and supply for food, not terrorism, will drive the future of animal and public health service delivery.
   To benefit the greatest number of people and countries, animal and public health services should support policies that temper growing disparities among rich and poor countries, city and rural populations, and the sexes. Economic growth is critical to overcoming disparities between countries and best supported by integrated animal health, public health, labour, and foreign policies. Opportunities for job growth will be the greatest along the value added chain of food production and will require significant investments in science-(risk-) based education.

AB Sheep, and to a lesser extent goats, have contributed substantially to the grassland-based agricultural production in North European countries for centuries. Most of these countries are now members of the European Union and both EU policy and global trade negotiations with the World Trade Organization are bound to influence in many ways the future development of the present production systems. This paper will review briefly the present situation with special reference to the sheep meat sector. Sustainability of production will be analyzed and discussed in terms of several criteria such as economics and farm income, resource utilization, environmental impact, landscape conservation, marketing of local value-added products and the maintenance of the rural population. Attention will be paid to the influence of increased world trade and competition, as a result of WTO negotiations, and changes in the direction of support through EU policy reform (CAP), namely the decoupling of subsidies from production to sustainable development ("the green box"). Finally, the economic problems experienced by sheep and goat farmers in countries ranging from the Arctic to the Alps will be discussed in the face of these challenges. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Human geographers have explored at some length the discourses and subject positions implicated in the recent rise of 'environmental responsibility'. Assigning it either as an individual disposition enacted in various spaces, a performative 'othering' tool, and/or a form of ecological governmentality, these debates have said little about the role of research and researchers in encouraging environmental responsibility. Utilising arguments from William James' 'radical empiricism, I argue that exploring practices through a pragmatist lens enables a tentative re-envisioning of environmental responsibility. Revisiting my doctoral research into the household-level adoption of sustainable consumption practices, I claim environmental responsibility as an ethical experience felt at the moments when practices are reconsidered. Here, my presence played a vital role in this social experimentation, which, as pragmatists argue, is the fundamental basis of positive social change.

ID WELFARE-STATE
AB In the 1970s and up until the financial crisis occurred in the late 1990s, Hong Kong prospered in a relatively stable social, economic and political context. Since the financial crisis, however, its population has been increasingly exposed to risk: there has been job uncertainty and decreasing capacity for self-reliance, leading to a growing reliance on public welfare and on families at a time when both are under pressure. The old welfare policies, unable to cope with the new risk, have been replaced by neo-liberal reforms, redistributing the roles and responsibilities of the individual and the state, with a greater burden falling on the firmer Individuals are required to be prudent to manage risk. While these reforms have relieved some. of the burden on the state, both new social risk groups and 'net taxpayers' considered themselves to have borne disproportional costs. Society is facing serious problems resulting from ineffective old welfare policies, new social risks due to new policies, and the political upheavals arising from increased social conflicts and weakened social cohesion and solidarity. A further complication is that there is no acceptable platform or agent to negotiate a compromise between the polarized groups. This article argues that reliance on publicly funded risk coping strategies or on neo-liberal risk prevention and mitigation strategies is not a desirable and sustainable policy. A commonly accepted political platform is required to negotiate a compromise which emphasizes shared and balanced roles and responsibilities, and a well-conceived combination of risk prevention, mitigation and coping strategies.

AB Water is a natural resource subject to management in many small-scale societies as common property. A dominant approach to understanding the sustainability of such common property resource (CPR) management regimes is the rational action model, which assumes that their successful governance is achieved through collective action based on a rationally constructed set of working rules. By presenting a holistic study of indigenous water management system in small-scale community setting in India, this article argues that the relationship between water resources and society extends beyond a materialistic mundane relationship, to incorporate a ''symbolic'' orientation. It concludes that rooted in the cosmology of the society, the indigenous water management system represents a mechanism to reinforce the symbolic constructions and also to fulfill water-related needs that cut across material and nonmaterial realms. The outcomes of the article enhance the understanding of management of CPRs, adding an alternate perspective concerning beliefs and values associated with such resources.

AB Northeast China is the main production area of maize and soybean in China. In the present study, the rates of decomposition and replacement of soil organic carbon (SOC) were estimated using the soil inventory collected since 1991. from long-term maize and soybean cultivation plots in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, to evaluate the sustainability of the present cultivation system. The total carbon (C) content in soil was stable without any significant changes in the plots (approximately 28.5 g C kg(-1)). The delta C-13 value of soil organic matter under continuous maize cultivation increased linearly with an annual increment of 0.07%. from -23.9%. in 1991, which indicated that approximately 13% of the initial SOC was decomposed during the 13-year period of maize cultivation, with a half-life of 65 years. Slow decomposition of SOC was considered to result from the low annual mean temperature (1.5 degrees C) and long freezing period (170-180 days year(-1)) in the study area. In contrast, the amount of organic C derived from maize increased in the soil with a very slow annual increment of 0.17 g C kg(-1), probably because of the removal of all the plant residues from the plots. Based on the-soil organic matter dynamics observed in the study plots, intentional recycling/maintenance of plant residues was proposed as a way of increasing soil fertility in maize or soybean cultivation.

AB Soil organic matter (SOM) is strongly related to soil type and management practices. Changes in government policy have brought drastic changes in farm management practices in the last two decades in rural China. This study investigates changes in SOM in two different soils: Ustepts and Udolls. Ustepts, in the North China Plain where the climate is warm and sub-humid, developed from an alluvial flood plain with organic matter <10 g kg(-1). Udolls, in Northeastern China where the climate is cool and sub-humid, developed from loess-like materials with organic matter >20 g kg(-1). Two locations for Ustepts and three locations for Udolls were used to collect 567 soil samples in 1980-1982 and again in 2000 for SOM analysis. Soil organic matter increased for Ustepts and decreased for Udolls soils over the sampling period, resulting from differences in fertilizer rates and crop residue input to soil. Higher fertilizer input and crop intensity and initially very low SOM content in Ustepts all contributed to greater OM input than oxidation release. In contrast, lower fertilizer input and crop intensity, and initially high SOM content in the Udolls, led to lower OM input than oxidation release. Increasing SOM content through higher mineral fertilizer input is a valuable option for sustainable agriculture production in areas where SOM is low and there is a shortage or potential shortage of food supply.

AB A considerable proportion of the 200 million hectares of the Brazilian Cerrado is suitable for annual crops but little is known about the effects of tillage on the C dynamics of Cerrado soils. We evaluated the role of two representative Cerrado Oxisols (350 and 650 g clay kg(-1)) as sources or sinks of atmospheric C when managed under three tillage systems (conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-till (NT)) in 8- and 5-year long-term experiments. A literature review was also carried out and the mean C sequestration rates in no-till soils of tropical and subtropical regions of Brazil were calculated and compared with values for soils from temperate regions of the world. The original C stocks in 0-20 cm layer of soils under native Cerrado were higher in the clayey (54.0 Mg ha(-1)) than in the sandy clay loam soil (35.4 Mg ha(-1)), suggesting a higher physical stability of organic matter associated with variable clay minerals in the clayey Oxisol. The original C stocks of the native Cerrado soils appear not to have decreased after 23 years of conventional tillage in the sandy clay loam Oxisol, except when the soil had been subjected to erosion (15% loss of C), or after 25 years in the clayey Oxisol. Compared to conventionally tilled soil, the C stocks in no-till sandy clay loam Oxisol increased by 2.4 Mg ha(-1) (C sequestration rate = 0.30 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and in the clayey Oxisol by 3.0 Mg ha(-1) (C sequestration rate = 0.60 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). The mean rate of C sequestration in the no-till Brazilian tropical soils was estimated to be 0.35 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), similar to the 0.34 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) reported for soils from temperate regions but lower than the 0.48 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) estimated for southern Brazilian subtropical soils. Considering the large area (about 70 million hectares) of the Cerrado which is currently used and potentially available for cropland, the adoption of no-till systems could turn the Cerrado soils into a significant sink for atmospheric C and contribute to the mitigation of global climate change.

AB This paper uses the case of developing sustainability indicators on the Island of Guernsey over the last four years to show that Agenda 21's call to activate grass roots action is being realized, but in ways that are neither top down and modernist in approach, nor bottom up and post-modern as Agenda 21 advocates. Whilst best practice literature often suggests that community involvement must be engaged prior to designing sustainability indicators, this paper explores the reasons why this is not always possible. Guernsey's case is used to show how it only became possible to generate interest in the indicator process once the indicators were actually operational. it also shows that once interest was secured by a few relevant stakeholders it became possible to further evolve the indicators in a process that has slowly been attracting more and more of the island's community.

TI Sustainable natural resource use and economic development in small

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainability; Pacific tuna fishery; small developing states; Fiji;
   Samoa
AB This paper is concerned with the sustainable management of the Western Pacific tuna fishery given its critical contribution to the economies of many small island developing states in the region. The paper focuses on contrasting the operation, regulation and management of the tuna fisheries in two Pacific island states, Fiji and Samoa, in the light of progress in regional fishery co-operation, and is based upon research undertaken in 2003. The analysis identifies critical shortcomings in implementation and enforcement of sustainable management policies in Fiji, which compare unfavourably with Samoa's attempts to ensure the long-term sustainability of a crucial economic sector. The principal differences in the effectiveness of these policies can be ascribed to the quality of governance as well as the general coherence of national economic policies. The paper attempts to highlight some of the problems faced by small developing states in ensuring the long-term sustainability of an important migratory marine resource.

   multi-dimensional model
AB This paper introduces an island tourism multi-dimensional model. Its aim is to develop an approach for integrating quantitative models and qualitative techniques into a coherent and useful methodology. The island tourism multi-dimensional model is divided into several modules as presented in the paper. They include geographic information system applications, economic impact assessment, forecasting modeling, accessibility modeling, seasonality modeling and alternative modeling. Forecasting models, economic impact assessments and geographic information systems can be used to project forecasts and demonstrate sustainable and economic development issues. The paper demonstrates that the outcomes of the accessibility and seasonality modules can be used to generate strategic plans of marketing segments, service engagement and community involvement. It suggests that by using alternative modeling the output of quantitative analyses and the input of private, voluntary and public sectors at community, business and governmental levels can be integrated with each other.

TI Sustaining social development in a small island developing state? The
   case of Seychelles
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Seychelles; small island developing states (SIDS); social development
AB Since the 1970s there has been a significant interest in small island developing states (SIDS). Since the 1990s the vast majority of this focus has been on economic and environmental 'vulnerabilities'. This paper reaffirms the importance of 'the social' when analysing the 'vulnerabilities' of SIDS through a country case study of Seychelles in the context of its SIDS status. It outlines Seychelles' demographic processes and macroeconomic volatilities and discusses its post-independence social development achievements. This paper provides critical analysis of how these achievements have been attained and considers the extent to which the present levels are sustainable. It argues that significant social gains are under threat from a range of domestic and international forces, potentially destabilizing the main pillar of the economy, tourism. The paper concludes that while the economic and environmental vulnerabilities of SIDS are of conceptual importance, reaffirming the centrality of the social is vital to understanding the potential causes and consequences of these vulnerabilities.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Many Caribbean islands are neglecting the role of waste in monitoring and assessing progress towards sustainability. Arguing that the material basis of the economic process dictates that solid waste should be among the priority indicators for small island developing states and territories, the paper explores the utility of waste as an indicator in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands. Substantial growth in waste quantities is challenging the island's capacity to process and assimilate wastes. Analysis of available data provided evidence of increasing consumption by residents and tourists, and increasing material intensity per unit economic output - unsustainable trends, which, if unaddressed, would result in Tortola moving away from sustainability. It is concluded that Tortola is in a good position to implement the use of waste as an indicator within its policy framework and could develop an understanding of the material dimension of its economic process, thereby providing an example for other Caribbean islands in assessing progress towards sustainability.

AB Small island states and island territories of larger countries tend to have ample renewable energy potential from sun, wind, waves, biomass and other sources. Nevertheless, they rely heavily on fossil fuels to generate electricity. Fluctuations in fossil fuel prices may impact significantly upon small island economies. This paper aims to help researchers and decision-makers better understand the unique features of small islands in relation to the power industry. The paper identifies public policy influencing production of electricity and limitations to energy policy reform in small islands. A range of conventional and renewable energy options available to small island policy-makers is presented using anecdotal evidence. It is argued that small islands need to build upon their energy resource potentials and by this exert more control over their energy futures. The paper concludes by recommending holistic strategies that small islands can use to enhance their long-term energy security and sustainability.

DT Article
DE creative system thinking and practice; ecological art; action research
   and environmental education
AB System thinkers and practitioners are trying to help society understand better the interconnectedness between issues that we previously tended to explore in isolation. Because of this, they have an important role to play in dealing with environmental issues. Indeed, the need to tackle those in holistic ways is now recognised and systems approaches are now complementing academic approaches such as ecological economics (Neumayer E (ed) (2003) Online encyclopaedia of ecological economics. International Society for Ecological Economics; Faber M, Manstetten R, Proops J (1996) Ecological economics. Concepts and methods. Edward Elgar, Cheltenham), which analyse ecological-human interactions. This paper explores how new forms of 'environmental education' could constitute particularly relevant vehicles for systems thinking and practice by building on messages and practices initiated in ecological art. Ecological art, it argues, has provided, for centuries, a practical form of holistic, interdisciplinary, problem-solving environmental management model-a particularly insightful illustration of how 'systems thinking and practice' can be used to deal with environmental problems. The paper suggests that art-based pedagogic forms could help put sustainability into practice by providing an educational tool that respects the systemicity of environmental issues and by encouraging systemic learning processes that are based on improved communication, sharing of perspectives, and stakeholders' empowerment through participation and experience.

TI Playing with risk? participant perceptions of risk and management
   implications in adventure tourism
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT

DT Article

AB Adventure tourism is a rapidly expanding tourism market segment. It is suggested that adventure travel and its related expenditure contribute $220 billion annually to the US economy alone (http://www.adventuretravel.com/seminar_home.htm). However, recent high-profile tragedies in adventure tourism might suggest that participation does not come without its risks. Existing literature would suggest that the pursuit of these risks is a central attraction of these activities. However, drawing on research conducted in the self-styled 'Adventure Capital of the World', Queenstown in New Zealand, the author suggests that this is a simplistic view of adventurous motivation. The research shows that rather than demanding actual risks, participants engaging in commercial adventurous activity primarily seek fear and thrills. The most successful adventure tourism operators are those that have reduced their actual risk levels whilst effectively commodifying the thrills within. Thus the responsibility of the commercial operator to minimise the opportunity for loss to as low a level as possible is not only an ethical one, but also ensures long-term business sustainability.

AB Very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs) are essential for human health and well-being. However, the current sources of these valuable compounds are limited and may not be sustainable in the long term. Recently, considerable progress has been made in identifying genes involved in the biosynthesis of VLCPUFAs. The co-expression of these genes in model systems such as plant embryos or yeast provided many valuable insights into the mechanisms of VLCPUFA synthesis. The recent successful reconstitution of pathways leading to the synthesis of arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and finally docosahexaenoic acid in oil-seed plants indicates the feasibility of using transgenic crops as alternative sources of VLCPUFAs. The various approaches used to attain these results and the specific constraints associated with each approach are discussed.

AB Domestic violence (DV) screening and prevention interventions have been implemented in the health sector; however, few health care settings have successfully implemented protocols that have been fully integrated and sustained within the larger organization. Researchers have tended to focus on individual-level characteristics of health care providers to explain this. The authors argue that organizational, structural, social, and cultural factors, especially related to gender, also play roles in adoption and integration of these interventions. It is important for policy analysts and program evaluators to use this larger framework to ensure sustainable integration of DV screening programs within health care systems.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Water is needed in all aspects of life and is vital to its social, economical and environmental dimensions. Having a key role in sustainable development, water management requires an integrated approach.
   Irrigation Water shortage promotes the development of innovative management and supply enhancement models. Effective water management requires a comprehensive consideration of all related aspects, e.g., technical, social, environmental, institutional, political and financial. Then the conventional methods of cost-benefit analysis and single-objective models have changed to multi-objective models.
   The rising of population in Iran puts significant pressure on authorities and infrastructures to provide water. Without improvement in water management, Irrigation demand will continue to increase, water supplies will diminish and the population pressure will decay infrastructure.
   This paper describes compromise programming to solve multi-criteria decision making in irrigation planning for Polrud project in the North of Iran. The important objectives of project are: regulation of reliable water at the demand time, improving rice and tea production, domestic water supply, environmental needs as well as reducing social conflicts. After execution of the model, results show the optimum decision for crops pattern and extents of allocated water to each area. This study is a successful implementation of IWRM in irrigation planning.

AB The National Water Act (NWA) of 1998 has been promulgated in South Africa to support the attainment of sustainable water resource use. Before the Act was promulgated, landowners were entitled to unlimited groundwater use. The Act rectified this anomaly; however, the practical application of sustainable development concepts in groundwater resource management will be complex. A multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was used to identify critical alternative courses of action and to develop a decision-making framework for sustainable groundwater management. Through applying the decision model described in this paper a number of strategies have been proposed which are aligned to the legislative requirements of the NWA.

TI Up-scaling of rain-water harvesting for crop production in the communal
   lands of the Modder River basin in South Africa: Comparing upstream and
   downstream scenarios
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
DE rain-water harvesting; catchment management; river basin; small-scale

AB The study area is the Upper and Middle Modder River basin situated in a semi-arid area of central South Africa. This is an important catchment because of the relatively large nearby towns of Bloemfontein, Botshabelo and Thaba Nchu. Crop production in the basin using conventional production techniques is currently not suitable due to marginal and erratic rainfall, and high evaporative demand, as well as low precipitation use efficiency on the clay and duplex soils caused by large runoff and evaporation losses. A labour-intensive in-field rain-water harvesting (IRWH) technique for crop production recently introduced into a part of the basin occupied by communal farmers has been shown to increase maize and sunflower yields by 30 to 50% compared to conventional tillage, making crop production utilising this technique a feasible proposition for these farmers. The area of land suitable for the IRWH in the basin is estimated to be 80 667 ha, of which 15 000 ha is located in the communal land. The two catchment management options compared in this paper are:
   Allowing the 80 667 ha to remain under grassland and utilising the runoff downstream for irrigating maize
   Utilising the 80 667 ha for maize production in the basin using the IRWH technique.
   Results showed that the expected maize production from the options shown above were 23 040t and 137 134t respectively. The large unproductive water losses during storage and conveyance to downstream use points are probably the main reason for this large difference in production. An economic analysis, which enabled the grazing benefit to be included in the first option, shows that the gross margin of this option, expressed as R/m(3) of rain water utilized, could be expected to be between 0.0234 to 0.0254 under current conditions, of which irrigation contributed about 25% or less. The comparable value for the IRWH option was 0.0354. The second option is clearly shown to be the most preferable, with high socio-economic benefits for the communal farmers who are currently struggling to achieve sustainable livelihoods.

AB Resistance to the herbicide glyphosate is currently known in at least eight weed species from many countries. Some populations of goosegrass from Malaysia, rigid ryegrass from Australia, and Italian ryegrass from Chile exhibit target site-based resistance to glyphosate through changes at amino acid 106 of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene. Mutations change amino acid 106 from proline to either serine or threonine, conferring an EPSPS weakly resistant to glyphosate. The moderate level of resistance is sufficient for commercial failure of the herbicide to control these plants in the field. Conversely, a nontarget site resistance mechanism has been documented in glyphosate-resistant populations of horseweed and rigid ryegrass from the United States and Australia, respectively. In these resistant plants, there is reduced translocation of glyphosate to meristernatic tissues. Both of these mechanisms are inherited as a single, nuclear gene trait. Although at present only two glyphosate-resistance mechanisms are known, it is likely that other mechanisms will become evident. The already very large and still increasing reliance on glyphosate in many parts of the world will inevitably result in more glyphosate-resistant weeds, placing the sustainability of this precious herbicide resource at risk.

AB In the Southern Great Plains, producers of hard red winter wheat seek sustainable methods for controlling cheat and improving economic returns. Experiments were conducted at two sites in north-central Oklahoma to determine the effect of cheat management programs, with various weed control strategies, on cheat densities and total net returns. The cheat management programs, initiated following harvest of winter wheat, included conventionally tilled, double-crop grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) followed by soybean (Glycine max L.); and continuous winter wheat. Rotating out of winter wheat for one growing season increased yield of succedent wheat up to 32.% and 42% at Billings and Ponca City, respectively. Dockage due to cheat in the succedent wheat was reduced up to 78% and 87% by rotating out of winter wheat for one growing season at Billings and Ponca City, respectively. Cheat management programs including a crop rotation with herbicides applied to the grain sorghum, except for an application of atrazine + metolachlor at Ponca City, improved total net returns over the nontreated continuous wheat option. Cheat panicles in the succedent wheat were reduced up to 87% by rotation out of winter wheat for one growing season.

AB The Baynes Sound area accounts for a large proportion of shellfish aquaculture production in British Columbia. In response to non-industry concerns regarding impacts from this inter-tidal fanning on bird populations in Baynes Sound, a quantitative inventory of aquaculture infrastructure, more specifically clam netting, was done.
   Low-level high-resolution air photos were taken during periods of extreme low tides, for all intertidal shellfish tenures in Baynes Sound. Images were geo-referenced and used to create a digital geographic file of clam netting. Geographic Information System (GIs) processing of this clam net coverage information combined with existing shore substrate data and new littoral bathymetry data for Baynes Sound resulted in an accurate enumeration of clam net coverages for each of Baynes Sound's major substrate types and for the fanned clam species' optimum habitat.
   The results showed shellfish tenures occupy 20.3% and clam netting 2.9% of the intertidal area of Baynes Sound as defined by the Baynes Sound Coastal Plan [British Columbia Ministry of Sustainable Resource Management, 2000. Baynes Sound Coastal Plan for Shellfish Aquaculture. http://sn-nwww.gov.bc.ca/rmd/coastaUplanning/south-island/baynes/docs/Baynes-Plan-Decl9-2002.pdfl boundary. Of the major substrate types in Baynes Sound, none had a clam net coverage exceeding 6%. Further analysis using optimal habitat areas, based on tidal heights, for each of three clam species [Prothaca staminae (native littleneck), Nuttallia obscurata (varnish clam), and Tapes philippinarum (manila clam)] revealed no clam net coverage exceeded 20% of a shore type (based on a major substrate) found within optimal habitat areas (with the average below 6%). These techniques offer a cost-effective method of assessing inter-tidal resource utilization and provide a basis for time-series evaluation and a useful tool for adaptive resource management in Baynes Sound. More generally, these techniques can be used in any region where a shoreline classification system is complete to quantify the extent of intertidal habitat modification and be used as a decision support tool.

AB Soil erosion is a widespread phenomenon in Andean South America, where many regions are covered with soils derived from volcanic parent materials. Climate-induced differences in the genesis of these soils have been demonstrated along toposequences on volcanic slopes. This research was conducted to study the impact Of Such differential pedogenesis on erodibility and runoff-infiltration characteristics along an altitudinal Entisols-inceptisols-Andisols sequence in the Andes of northern Ecuador. Surface soils were packed into small pans and placed on a 9% slope, and a simulated rainstorm with varying intensities was applied for a duration of 30 min. The runoff-erosion behaviour of the studied volcanic ash soils is strongly affected by their pedological development. Accumulation of organic matter and precipitation of active amorphous materials at high elevations have led to the formation of well-developed Andisols with very stable aggregate structure. These soils remain wettable when air-dried, show very high infiltration capacity and, consequently, low potential for runoff generation and soil erosion. Low organic matter contents and absence of active amorphous materials at low elevations have led to the formation of weakly aggregated Entisols and Inceptisols. These soils are susceptible to surface crusting, which lowers their infiltration capacity and increases their erodibility. However, in comparison with other soils of different origin and composition, the interrill erodibilities determined for these more erodible low-elevation soils are classified as low. The findings of this study suggest that upland soil erosion is not a major threat to sustainability in the studied volcanic landscape, which is generally confirmed by field observations.

AB Inverse spinel structured LiNiVO4 has been prepared by a citric acid polymeric process in addition with urea. Al2O3 derived from (methoxyethoxy) acetate-alumoxane (MEA) has been used to coat the LiNiVO4 cathode and it has established sustainable extended cycle stability. The (MEA)-alumoxane was prepared by reacting pseudo-boehmite with (methoxyethoxy) acetic acid. XRID patterns showed that the formation of a crystalline phase occurred at 723 and 873K and for the coated material with no indication of new peaks. TEM micrographs of the pristine LiNiVO4 and coated powder revealed that particle size ranged from 50 to 70 rim and the coating was compact with an average thickness of about 15 nm. ESCA depth profiles of the constituent elements in the coated particle confirmed a layer of Al2O3 formed on the surface of the LiNiVO4. The galvanostatic cycling studies suggest that 0.5 wt.% coating resultant from a (methoxyethoxy) acetate-alumoxane enhanced the cycle stability two times compared with the pristine LiNiVO4. The improved performance is attributed to the ability of the Al2O3 resultant (MEA) precursor layer on the core material to suppress the side reaction and dissolution of 3d metals in LiPF6 based liquid electrolytes during charge-discharge processes. A comparison of the electrochemical impedance behavior of the pristine and coated materials suggested that the coated material was resistant to the impedance growth of the LiNiVO4 cathode upon cycling.

AB Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have become a topic drawing increasing interest within the field of soil and environmental research because they can provide important soil physical data at relatively low cost. Few studies, however, explore which contributions PTFs can make to land-use planning, in terms of examining the expected outcome of certain changes in soil and water management practices. This paper describes three scenario studies that show some aspects of how PTFs may help improve decision making about land management practices. We use an exploratory research approach using simulation modelling to explore the potential effect of alternative solutions in land management. We: (i) evaluate benefits and risks when irrigating a field, and the impact of soil heterogeneity; (ii) examine which changes can be expected (in terms of soil water balance and supply) if organic matter content is changed as a result of an alternative management system; (iii) evaluate the risk of leaching to deeper horizons in some soils of Hungary. Using this research approach, quantitative answers are provided to 'what if?' type questions, allowing the distinction of trends and potential problems, which may contribute to the development of sustainable management systems.

TI A silicon transporter in rice
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID GENE; AQUAPORINS; RESISTANCE; FAMILY
AB Silicon is beneficial to plant growth and helps plants to overcome abiotic and biotic stresses by preventing lodging ( falling over) and increasing resistance to pests and diseases, as well as other stresses(1-3). Silicon is essential for high and sustainable production of rice(4), but the molecular mechanism responsible for the uptake of silicon is unknown. Here we describe the Low silicon rice 1 (Lsi1) gene, which controls silicon accumulation in rice, a typical silicon-accumulating plant. This gene belongs to the aquaporin family(5) and is constitutively expressed in the roots. Lsi1 is localized on the plasma membrane of the distal side of both exodermis and endodermis cells, where casparian strips are located. Suppression of Lsi1 expression resulted in reduced silicon uptake. Furthermore, expression of Lsi1 in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity for silicon only. The identification of a silicon transporter provides both an insight into the silicon uptake system in plants, and a new strategy for producing crops with high resistance to multiple stresses by genetic modification of the root's silicon uptake capacity.

AB The Indian Himalayan region occupies a special place in the mountain ecosystems of the world. These geodynamically young mountains are not only important from the standpoint of climate and as a provider of life, giving water to a large part of the Indian subcontinent, but they also harbour a rich variety of flora, fauna, human communities and cultural diversity. Despite the abundance of natural resources, most of its people are marginalized and still live on subsistence level. The unscientific exploitation of natural resources is leading to increasing environmental degradation and aggravating the impact of natural hazards. There is a need to evolve new paradigm to restore balance between economic interest and ecological imperatives with due regards to socio-cultural principles.

AB Upgrade of the emergy analysis of Secovlje saltpans [Babic, J., 2005. Emergy analysis of the salt production process at the Secovlje saltpans, Slovenia. In: Proceedings of the Third Biennial Emergy Analysis Research Conference, January 29-31, 2004. The Center for Environmental Policy, Gainesville, FL] was performed with STELLA programming language. STELLA model of the solar salt production process was constructed to simulate emergy flows and emergy indices. Sensitivity analysis of state variables with regard to various emergy indices was also performed. We compared several process scenarios as well as the process behavior under different environmental and economic conditions. The model structure enables adding new state variables in order to obtain better control over emergy flows within the model and between the model and its environment, Results show that evaporated water contributes the highest identified environmental renewable emergy inflow to the area. Precipitations themselves have very negative effect on actual salt production due to the dilution of concentrated brine with rainwater. However, human labor, as it is driven mostly by nonrenewable emergy, contributes the highest nonrenewable emergy inflow. The general trend of decreasing percentage of renewable emergy in human work as well as the need for additional inputs of nonrenewable emergy aimed at reducing labor demand, limits the possibilities to achieve a higher sustainability and a lower environmental loading of the investigated production process. The paper compares the effects of different process modifications and the effect of changing meteorological conditions to the indicators of environmental loading and degree of sustainability.

AB The paper considers a forest management problem, which consists of decisions on investment, silvicultural and harvesting activities for an existing forestland over a long time horizon, while guaranteeing sustainability, maximizing the expected profit, referring to ecological objectives and the public's acceptance of decisions. in order to solve this problem, several decision support systems and models were developed. Here, we present a fuzzy, dynamic and multi-objective model for optimal forest management, which deter-mines the sequence of decisions that jointly maximizes economic, ecological and social objectives, respects prescribed constraints and imprecision, and takes the forest system from its existing state to the goal state. The idea of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is introduced within a discrete dynamic programming process to evaluate the conflicting objectives. The cumulative impacts of objectives are formulated on the basis of attributes as a sum over all products of their membership functions and their relative importance (weights). Finally, the problem is presented in a form of a network, and the optimal policy over all time periods is determined using the iteration method for the solution of sequential decision processes of Bellman's type. A case study involving the forest Panovec, Slovenia is used to demonstrate the application of the presented model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The gooseneck barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) is a highly exploited species in Spain and Portugal due to the great commercial demand and the high prices in the market. Due to the inaccessibility of the Gaztelugatxe coastal area (Basque Country, Northern Spain), the gooseneck barnacle has maintained one of the greatest populations of the Basque coast in this area. Declared as a marine reserve by means of the 229/1998 (Basque Government) Decree, a 2 years moratorium in the gooseneck shellfishing was established. Facing the possibility of the gooseneck barnacle fishery opening in the area of the biotope, it was noticed the need for the development of a management tool, capable to think over the different management decisions: from the complete conservation of the system to the sustainable exploitation of the resource, joining together different social and biological factors, allowing the protection of the firsts (protection of the stock) and the development of the seconds (fishery activity). Based on the population dynamics of the gooseneck barnacle, a system dynamic model dominated by one positive and three negative loops was developed. The positive loop portrays the reproductive and maturation process, ultimately producing more adult gooseneck barnacles. The negative loops cause the stabilisation as the different stages of the population expire due by natural causes and exploitation of the resource. According to the model results, the best management decision is the maintenance of the moratorium. Taking into account the dispersion capability of larvae, other areas near the reserve, and subjected to commercial exploitation like Ogono, izaro and cape Villano, will benefit from the protection of Gaztelugatxe production. In the case of exploitation, the best management decision, which maximises captures and minimises the stock looses in a sustainable manner, is an alternate exploitation between Aketxe and Gaztelugatxe coastal areas of the marine reserve.

AB Steller's sea cow, a giant sirenian discovered in 1741 and extinct by 1768, is one of the few megafaunal mammal species to have died out during the historical period. The species is traditionally considered to have been exterminated by 'blitzkrieg'-style direct overharvesting for food, but it has also been proposed that its extinction resulted from a sea urchin population explosion triggered by extirpation of local sea otter populations that eliminated the shallow-water kelps on which sea cows fed. Hunting records from eighteenth century Russian expeditions to the Commander Islands, in conjunction with life-history data extrapolated from dugongs, permit modelling of sea cow extinction dynamics. Sea cows were massively and wastefully overexploited, being hunted at over seven times the sustainable limit, and suggesting that the initial Bering Island sea cow population must have been higher than suggested by previous researchers to allow the species to survive even until 1768. Environmental changes caused by sea otter declines are unlikely to have contributed to this extinction event. This indicates that megafaunal extinctions can be effected by small bands of hunters using pre-industrial technologies, and highlights the catastrophic impact of wastefulness when overexploiting resources mistakenly perceived as 'infinite'.

AB It is now becoming increasingly clear that the in situ use of biomass and organic waste streams are likely to provide the key to energy self sustainability for islands and remote communities. Traditionally biofuels have been used in combustion engines for electric power generation, however, when replaced by fuel cells there is the prospect of achieving higher generating efficiencies, coupled with, in some instances, the opportunity to produce biofuel at a cheaper rate than conventional fuels. Additionally, important environmental benefits can be achieved by way of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, whilst providing a carbon sink. This paper presents the design details of such an installation that will provide a practical solution on an island (and be applicable in other remote and rural areas) where connection to the grid can be expensive, and where biofuels can be produced on site at no significant extra cost.

AB Conventional agriculture has improved in crop yield but at large costs to the environment, particularly off-site pollution from mineral N fertilizers. In response to environmental concerns, organic agriculture has become an increasingly popular option. One component of organic agriculture that remains in question is whether it can reduce agricultural N losses to groundwater and the atmosphere relative to conventional agriculture. Here we report reduced N pollution from organic and integrated farming systems compared with a conventional farming system. We evaluated differences in denitrification potential and a suite of other soil biological and chemical properties in soil samples taken from organic, integrated, and conventional treatments in an experimental apple orchard. Organically farmed soils exhibited higher potential denitrification rates, greater denitrification efficiency, higher organic matter, and greater microbial activity than conventionally farmed soils. The observed differences in denitrifier function were then assessed under field conditions after fertilization. N2O emissions were not significantly different among treatments; however, N-2 emissions were highest in organic plots. Annual nitrate leaching was 4.4-5.6 times higher in conventional plots than in organic plots, with the integrated plots in between. This study demonstrates that organic and integrated fertilization practices support more active and efficient denitrifier communities, shift the balance of N-2 emissions and nitrate losses, and reduce environmentally damaging nitrate losses. Although this study specifically examines a perennial orchard system, the ecological and biogeochemical processes we evaluated are present in all agroecosystems, and the reductions in nitrate loss in this study could also be achievable in other cropping systems.

TI Collaborating while competing? The sustainability of community-based
   integrated care initiatives through a health partnership
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SERVICES; POLICY
AB Background: To improve health-care delivery, care providers must base their services on community health needs and create a seamless continuum of care in which these needs can be met. Though, it is not obvious that providers apply this vision. Experiments with regulated competition in the health systems of many industrialized countries trigger providers to optimize individual organizational goals rather than improve population health from a community perspective. Thus, a tension exists between the need to collaborate and the need to compete. Despite or because of this tension, community health partnerships are being promoted, and this should enforce a needs-based and integrated care delivery.
   Methods: In this single case study, we retrospectively explored how local health-care providers in Amsterdam collaborated for more than 30 years, interacting with the changes to the national health-care system. In-depth analysis of interviews, documents and literature focused on the complex relationship between the activities of this health partnership, its nature and its changing context.
   Results: The findings revealed that the partnership itself was successful and sustainable over time, although the partnership lost its initial broad explorative nature and narrowed its strategic focus towards care of the elderly. Furthermore, the realized projects - although they enforced integrated care - lost their community-based character. This declining scope of community-based integrated care seems to have been influenced by the incremental introduction of regulated competition in Dutch health care. This casts doubts on the ability of health partnerships to apply a vision of community-based integrated care within the context of competition.
   Conclusion: Collaborating health-care providers can build seamless continuums of care in a competitive environment, although these will not automatically maximize community health with limited resources. Active policies with regard to health system design, incentive structures and population-based performance measures are warranted in order to insure that community-based integrated care through health partnerships will be more than just policy rhetoric.

SO BMC MICROBIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID REGULATORS; DISCOVERY; SEQUENCES; PATTERNS; GENOMES
AB Background: Transcriptional regulation processes are the principal mechanisms of adaptation in prokaryotes. In these processes, the regulatory proteins and the regulatory DNA signals located in extragenic regions are the key elements involved. As all extragenic spaces are putative regulatory regions, ExtraTrain covers all extragenic regions of available genomes and regulatory proteins from bacteria and archaea included in the UniProt database.
   Description: ExtraTrain provides integrated and easily manageable information for 679816 extragenic regions and for the genes delimiting each of them. In addition ExtraTrain supplies a tool to explore extragenic regions, named Palinsight, oriented to detect and search palindromic patterns. This interactive visual tool is totally integrated in the database, allowing the search for regulatory signals in user defined sets of extragenic regions. The 26046 regulatory proteins included in ExtraTrain belong to the families AraC/XylS, ArsR, AsnC, Cold shock domain, CRP-FNR, DeoR, GntR, IcIR, LacI, LuxR, LysR, MarR, MerR, NtrC/Fis, OmpR and TetR. The database follows the InterPro criteria to define these families. The information about regulators includes manually curated sets of references specifically associated to regulator entries. In order to achieve a sustainable and maintainable knowledge database ExtraTrain is a platform open to the contribution of knowledge by the scientific community providing a system for the incorporation of textual knowledge.
   Conclusion: ExtraTrain is a new database for exploring Extragenic regions and Transcriptional information in bacteria and archaea. ExtraTrain database is available at http:// www. era7. com/ ExtraTrain/.

AB This paper reviews the development of ecological economics in Australia and New Zealand since its beginnings in the late 1970s. A historical account is presented that focuses particularly on the activities of the Australia New Zealand Society for Ecological Economics and key ecological economics research activities. Achievements of ecological economics in Australia and New Zealand are assessed, using a range of quantitative and qualitative data. The main areas of expertise developed by Australian and New Zealand ecological economists were found to be: theoretical foundations and visions for ecological economics; biodiversity and resilience; input-output analysis; heterodox valuation approaches; analysis of economy-environment interactions; sustainability indicators; sustainable agriculture, fisheries and oceans; and energy/thermodynamics. Both countries are ranked at the top (or near the top) of the world rankings in terms of per capita ISEE membership and publication rates in Ecological Economics. A defining feature of ecological economics in Australia and New Zealand has also been its practical and problem-solving focus and the level of end-user engagement. The paper concludes by discussing the challenges that face the future development of ecological economics in Australia and New Zealand. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper briefly reviews key insights from natural resource and environmental economics, ecological economics and industrial ecology in an effort to identify the major contributions of these fields to the understanding and promotion of sustainable development. Each is based on overlapping worldviews, methods and tools. Their synthesis and extension-subsumed under the rubric of 'Natural Economics'-is suggested as a new thrust in environmental research, offering valuable guides to policy making. An early illustration of the application of natural economics in New Zealand is presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Efficiency forms the bedrock of policy, planning and business approaches to sustainable development. But what do ecological economists mean by efficiency? In the resource use context, efficiency has a wide range of potential interpretations, from the ratio of work output/energy inputs to Pareto efficiency. Despite the potential richness of the efficiency concept, in practice, efficiency is often narrowly conceived within disciplinary boundaries. This appears to be the case even in ecological economics, which purports to be 'transdisciplinary' and pluralistic. Such narrow disciplinary perspectives essentially waste the richness of the efficiency concept. This wasting could mean ecological economists and decision-makers are destined to Sisyphean toil in the pursuit of sustainable development.
   This paper explores the efficiency concept and its interpretation. It then reviews ecological economic literature to find that there is much room for improvement in the way ecological economists apply efficiency. Finally, the paper presents a framework within which a truly ecological economic approach to efficiency can emerge. Armed with this framework, policy makers and planners should be better prepared to make decisions leading to sustainable development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The need to implement sustainable resource management regimes for Australia's extensive grazing lands is acute. Proposed solutions for promoting sustainable management typically seek to strike a balance between ecological and economic imperatives required to maintain the function of local ecosystems and to preserve the economic viability of the grazing enterprises. This paper explores some issues associated with the challenges of balancing ecological and economic objectives for the sustainable management of grazing lands. Some broad economic and ecological trends that might create conflict in defining sustainable management systems are considered. Prospective changes in resource use that may arise in response to these trends are also considered, along with barriers and opportunities that might retard or progress those changes. Some economic data, drawn from a case study of four grazing properties in the grassy woodlands of Queensland, are presented to highlight the difficulties of achieving an appropriate balance of ecological and economic outcomes for landscape management. Poor economic prospects and a range of practical management issues are apparent barriers to changing present practices on private land. Collective action to reduce the unit cost of management options also appears to offer little immediate attraction to landholders. Limited markets for conservation services and institutional constraints also impede the achievement of a better balance between economic and ecological objectives. Some suggestions are made on how to improve the prospects for adoption of sustainable land management practices. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of sustainability is to have levels of resource use and waste assimilation sufficient to maintain a good quality of life for citizens, yet be within environmental carrying capacities. In countries with ageing populations, consumption is constrained by the lower incomes of retired people, and therefore, prospects exist for reductions in resource use and pollutant outputs. The extent of this effect is investigated in this study. This paper uses a new approach to quantify, by age cohort, patterns of resource use and residual generation in New Zealand. These use patterns are then projected to 2051 to see what happens as the population ages. Results indicate that resource use and waste production decline as more people enter the 65+ age group. Gains, however, are diminished by the smaller percentage of young people who have the lowest per capita requirements. Projected growth in population numbers swamp any reductions from ageing effects, even when allowances have been made for future technical change. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
