AB The move toward defining ''best practice'' in urban development, a search which is central to the preparations for the Habitat II conference, is encouraging and represents a new paradigm in the quest for improvement. This paper examines a number of propositions, hypotheses if you will, related to that change. These propositions focus particularly on the implications of the shift on the meaning of community, the need for transferable tools, the limitation of state-based and market-based housing solutions within this context, the essential nature of networks, particularly the overlapping networks of neighbours, relatives and friends with networks of locally-based production and trading, labour and service providers, and the implications of all of these elements on sustainability.

AB Sustainable development is frequently oriented towards aspects of environmental quality and carrying capacity.(1) A broader view, endorsed by the UN Centre for Human Settlements, includes aspects of social and economic equity as well. In this connection, global restructuring presents a significant context. Its associated processes, including international migration, help create and reinforce patterns of socioeconomic polarisation and spatial segregation. These patterns find expression particularly in urban housing. This paper examines various aspects of the housing situation of immigrants in the USA. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A recent study sponsored by the UK Overseas Development Administration of housing extensions in government-built housing has demonstrated that there is considerable advantage arising from extension activity (transformation) for the sustainability of cities in developing countries. This paper briefly describes the phenomenon as studied in a total of 1224 extended and 221 non-extended houses in Bangladesh, Egypt, Ghana and Zimbabwe, in which occupants initiate increases in accommodation in neighbourhoods which are often approaching the end of their economic life. It shows how the activity of transformers is congruent with many of the precepts of sustainable development and recommends that they could be enabled through policy to provide housing goods more efficiently.

AB Bangladesh, a low-income country, experiences an unsatisfactory situation in urban housing. Improvement in the situation is constrained by a number of factors, such as rapid population growth, an inequitable social structure, poor economy and persisting poverty, an ineffective public policy and a hostile natural environment. In sustainability terms, rapid urbanisation and large-scale demands for housing in urban areas may pose some problems for ecological sustainability. There are also conflicting and competitive issues in technological and economic sustainability versus cultural and social sustainability. The provision of easy access to housing finance, in the model of Grameen Bank's housing credit, access to land, realistic building standards and access to affordable building materials along with community involvement are some of the options towards achieving a sustainable housing policy in Bangladesh. At the same time strong political commitment and a stable political environment are recognised as preconditions to sustainable urban housing. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Urban infrastructure, particularly water supply, sanitation, drainage and solid-waste management, is essential if improvement is to be made to the urban environment. Unforturnately, in too many cities of the developing world the majority of residents do not have access to these basic urban services. Infrastructure is an essential element if urban sustainability is to be achieved. In order to provide infrastructure to low-income settlements in such cities, it is necessary to design programmes which involve the progressive improvement of on-site facilities. There are parallels in this approach to that which, since the 1960s, has been increasingly accepted as the most efficient way of meeting housing needs in low-income situations. The role of outside organisations that might assist in this progressive improvement of infrastructure process, as well as the required role of governments, are explored. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.
   The paper considers the approaches used by a number of countries that have attempted to facilitate local infrastructure. These are evaluated, based on case study evidence, in terms of their abilities to meet local infrastructure needs in a cost-effective manner while at the same time including the communities to be served in the planning, decision-making, implementation and management processes. The result is a 10-principle model that can be interpreted as a means of facilitating the meeting of local needs in a sustainable and environmentally-friendly manner.

AB Aspects of the technologies that might be employed in the wastewater infrastructures of cities in the longer-term future are discussed. For this purpose a wastewater infrastructure is defined as the string of unit process technologies used to recycle and return the waterborne residuals of a city to its surrounding environment. In the cities of Europe aad North America, for example, this infrastructure conventionally comprises the urban sewer network, wastewater treatment plant, and receiving water body. To provide context and direction for the discussion, the impact of the city and its wastewater infrastructure on the surrounding environment is reviewed over a time-scale of centuries. Two analogies are employed in order to illustrate this impact: the concept of a city's 'metabolism' within the global cycling of materials; and the notion of gauging the 'health' of the system through something akin to measuring the 'pulse-rate' of an organism. Three scenarios are drawn for the possible pattern of adaptation and more radical change in the technological composition of the city's future wastewater infrastructure. These may culminate in a structure altogether different from that with which we are familiar today, i.e. a decentralised, highly segregated system in which control and manipulation of the composition of any residual at its source is maximised. Further, it is argued that the issue of reliability of performance may be a critical (technological) factor in choosing a preferred form of wastewater infrastructure. We do not discuss the economic, social or cultural dimensions of our subject; we acknowledge that these are likely to be decisive considerations, the seeming technological attraction of any option notwithstanding.

AB This paper analyses how health-sector professionals view the discussion of sustainability, takes these discussions further by applying the concept to urban health, and compares key issues of sustainable urban health with other aspects of sustainable develop ment. The health sector's respective emphasis on health services versus environmental health is discussed and current action within the World Health Organisation's Healthy City projects is considered in the light of sustainable urban health. Finally, a discussion of the concept ''think globally, act locally'' is considered and the proposal to ''think locally, act globally'' is presented in relation to the UN Summit on Human Settlements, Habitat II.

AB The paper aims to identify the qualities required from urban planning to make it an effective tool to promote sustainable urban development.
   The paper reviews trends in urban development that imply that urban plans and planning processes should perform new and demanding roles. These demands go beyond guidance or the control of land uses and location. They require a framework for multiple actors to share visions to commit themselves to action and to co-operate in achieving it. One of these visions is sustainable urban development. The paper argues that the process of building consensus on development gives increased chances of sustainability. The recent emphasis on approaches inspired by modern business management does not, however, do away with the need for some legally enforceable aspects of plans. It is also important not to expect miracles from new approaches to planning. Reference is also made to the international debate on the subject and examples are drawn from the author's experience.

AB This paper addresses rehabilitation and conservation of old inner-city areas and historic monuments in the cities of the developing world which have so far received very little attention in urban development policy. The need for urban rehabilitation and adaptive re-use is discussed with reference to a number of cases, i.e. Cairo, Tunis, Sana'a, Aleppo, Delhi, Bombay, Bhaktapur, Galle, Penang, Singapore, Shanghai, Beijing, Quite, Cartagena, Rio de Janeiro and Havana. A delineation of the concept is provided, and some key aspects of rehabilitation are discussed. The paper concludes with considerations on the need for area rehabilitation and revitalisation approaches which maintain the typical urban tissue and essential qualities of the historic areas and of the life of the communities residing there, but which can also adapt the physical structures and activities to some of the present day requirements. In terms of monuments, it is stressed that these need to be seen as part of conservation areas, and that their sustainability and revitalisation will be most feasible if they are integrated into new concepts of use: Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper explores the relative roles of universal models and local knowledge in the conceptual framework of Pakistan's Conservation Strategy. The domination of universal models over historical and institutional factors in the methodology of the strategy is demonstrated through a critical analysis of its contents. From this ''case study'', a number of methodological issues relating to the knowledge-base of planning or policymaking exercises in the Third World have been identified. The relevance and effectiveness of planning or policy-making partially depend on choices made on these methodological issues. An approach of particularising the universals and grounding analysis in institutional realities is proposed as the basis of the planning process. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB As one of a number of strategies in support of sustainable development, international agencies have increasingly and forcefully advocated the use of environmental impact assessment studies (EIA) for projects that they sponsor in the Third World. The philosophy and many of the techniques and processes associated with EIA, however, reflect social, technological, political and economic forces in the industrialised world that contrast sharply with the development context in many Third World countries. Significant modifications in the traditional standards, approaches, methods and legislation are required to ensure that EIA offers an appropriate aid to environmental management and decision making. This is particularly so in areas where governments seek to apply standards that are consistent with the formal sector to communities that are essentially the product of ongoing informal development processes.
   This paper focuses on the feasibility of adapting EIA procedures as a strategy to improve the regularisation process in Trinidad and Tobago, where the government has recently enacted environmental legislation that includes provision for impact assessment. Critical issues in developing regularisation schemes include the urgency of resolving particularly serious environmental problems, unrealistic standards, insufficient data, a lack of co-ordination among government agencies, some of whom are reluctant to accommodate special needs and the need to rely on the resources, skills and willingness of local residents to implement change. Within this context, inappropriate approaches to the impact assessment of community housing projects or programmes may, in fact, be counter-productive. Overly explicit and rigid standards and regulations may well serve as barriers to self-help housing and independent community action. When the sense of independence among informal actors is curtailed, there is an almost total reliance on government initiative.
   It is postulated that strategies that are flexible, process oriented and which assess the needs and capacity of the community for change are required. Once needs have been expressed and the capacity for change assessed, realistic standards and goals can be set and monitored over the course of the development process. ELA provides many tools and procedures that can be adapted to support this process. The paper concludes with a discussion of the need for a balanced approach to environmental management that may be applied in support of both informal and formal community development sectors.

AB Increased interest in the potential contribution of insecticide-impregnated bed nets (ITBN) to malaria control has led to research efforts to determine the impact and sustainability of ITBN programmes in differing environments. There is a need to develop effective, feasible educational strategies that will both inform and motivate community members, and thus maximize the correct usage of ITBN. This is especially true in communities where indigenous usage of bed nets is low. This paper describes the educational component of a randomized controlled community intervention trial of ITBN, with childhood malaria morbidity as an outcome. The educational approach and messages for the ITBN trial were developed from anthropological survey data collected 4 years before the trial, and from community surveys conducted by project researchers. Low levels of understanding amongst mothers of the aetiological link between mosquitos and malaria led to the exclusion of the term 'malaria' from the initial educational messages promoting the use of ITBN. Appropriate individuals within the existing district health care structure were trained as community educators in the project. These educators conducted intensive teaching in the community through public meetings and group teaching in the first 6 months of the trial. The impact of these initial activities was assessed through interviews with a random sample of 100 mothers and 50 household heads. This allowed the identification of messages which had not been well understood and further educational methods were chosen to address the areas pinpointed. The community assessment also demonstrated that, in 1994, over 90% of mothers understood a protective role for bed nets against malaria and the ITBN education messages were changed to take account of this. The school programme was evaluated through determining outreach (the number of households accessed), changes in participant children's knowledge, post-teaching assessment of mothers' knowledge and discussions with parent-teacher associations. It was shown that 40% of intervention homes with children in the target age group were accessed, participant children learned the educational messages well (scores increased from a pre-teaching mean of 59% to a post-teaching mean of 92%) and a high level of awareness of the ITBN trial was achieved in these homes (75%). However, specific messages of the education programme were not well transferred to the home (30%).
   The discussion emphasises the need for allocation of adequate resources for education in programmes dependent on achieving a change in community practices. We also describe the value of ongoing communication between programme planners and a target population in maximizing the effectiveness of messages and methods used.

ID DUAL-PURPOSE CATTLE; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES; AMAZONIA; FARM
AB Processes of intensification and diversification of land use in a humid, lowland tropical area of Costa Rica are discussed through the application of Boserup's model of agricultural intensification. Environmental conditions and cultural factors are integrated into Boserup's model to provide a framework for understanding choices between beef and dual-purpose cattle systems, permanent cash crops (black pepper and coffee), forest and off-farm employment in household land use and economic systems. The results indicate that intensification of cattle grazing is possible even on acid, infertile lowland tropical soils, and that small landholders intensify cattle grazing by increasing labor investments in pasture and animal management when markets for dairy products are favorable. As returns to labor from cattle grazing diminish with intensification, farmers diversify into intensive permanent cash crops or off-farm labor. Risk is a key factor influencing intensification and diversification decisions. Trees remain important even on intensively managed farms to meet household subsistence needs and provide environmental services, but overall intensification of land use is accompanied by intensification of forest land uses and substitution of purchased products for forest products. Understanding the processes of land use choice behind intensification of diversification is critical to the development of sustainable land uses.

AB An experiment was conducted during thp rainy season (kharif) 1989, 1990 and 1991 to evaluate the economically and biologically sustainable intercrop association of 'Birsa Gondli'l little miller (Panicum miliare L.) with 'AK 12-24' groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and little miller with 'BR 65' pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.]. Intercropping of either groundnut or pigeonpea with little millet was found beneficial to sole-stand yield of little millet, but it was uneconomical to sole-stand yield of both the intercrops. Among the intercrops, association of little miller with groundnut in 2 : 1, 2 : 2 and 4 : 1 row ratios were found more remunerative, which gave higher monetary advantage of Rs 320/ha and Rs 489/ha respectively than sole little miller. These treatments also accounted for higher net return (212%-232%), net return to Rs/Re investments (Rs 1.27-1.49), net return/day (Rs 16.72-18.31) and finally relative net return (Rs 1.59-1.70) over sole little mill et. Row ratio of 4:1 also accounted for maximum land-equivalent ratio (1.26) and product of crowding coefficient (K 25.43).

AB An experiment was conducted during 1988-1993 on Vertisols to study sustainability of rainy-season (kharif) cropping systems under rainfed conditons. Grain yield of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) Br. remend. Stuntz] (19.64 q/ha) incressed owing to intercropping with pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] (3.58 q/ha) compared with sole pearl millet (17.68 q/ha) showing complimentary effects. Pearl millet yield increased by 17.9% under sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.)-pearl millet system compared with continous pearl millet and by 32.8% under sunflower-pearl millet + pigeonpea system compared with sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-pearl miliet + pigeonpea system. Significantly highest monetary returns (Rs 9,414/ha) were obtained from pearl millet + pigeonpea (2 : 1) intercropping in current-year cropping. Similarly, sole pearl millet also gave significantly more monetary returns (Rs 6,980/ha) than rest of the sole crops. Sustainable value index was the highest (0.62) under pearl millet + pigeonpea (2 : 1) intercropping, followed by sole pearl millet (SVI 0.50), indicating sustainability of these crops during the kharif season on medium deep Vertisols (30-45 cm) of dryland areas.

SO INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION & LIBRARY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The future of Nigerian university libraries is threatened by press underfunding, inadequate collections and facilities. These worrysome problems which have bedevilled the libraries since the 1980s persist due to the continued low level of book production, scarcity of foreign currency to import books and journals, and the continued proliferation of universities despite the economic recession in the country. The Nigerian federal and state governments, which are the sole financiers of the 38 universities in the country, lack the financial resources to fund them adequately. To prevent the collapse of the universities and their libraries, organizations such as the World Bank, oil companies, and banks, are being brought in to assist the governments. The federal government and its central coordinating body for the universities, the National Universities Commission (NUC), are encouraging the universities to seek and achieve sustainability by prudent spending and vigorous diversification of their revenue bases and investments in order to survive. This article examines the issues involved. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited.

DE C-nippon; population; sustainable use; recruitment; Dilijan Reserve
AB Numbers of sika deer (Cervus nippon), resident in the Dilijan Reserve in 1969 (52 animals), 1970 (50), 1972 (1), and 1976 (28) dramatically increased in number until 1981,when the population reached a ceiling, being the number which can subsist in the area - 300 individuals (density - 11-12.5 deer per 1000 ha). Thus, Dilijan Reserve's C. nippon population develops in a way which resembles an S-like log curve equation.
   Actually, Dilijan Reserve no longer has the status of a protected area - nowadays lumbering activities predominate and, inevitably, the unique broadleaf deciduous forest ecosystem will run down to extinction. Such economically valuable species as oak, beech, and sika deer are likely to be the first victims of this large-scale devastation.
   The present article does not reject exploitation of any resource (including sika deer), if necessary. The key question is: how C. nippon can be sustainably utilized, so that the number of culled animals is replenished within the same year and and so that eventually the population size will remain constant?

AB A rich diversity of traditional crops occurs generally in the Himalaya and more particularly in Central Himalaya. Over forty species of fe,od grains are grown in traditional agroecosystems of Central Himalaya, which have been managed by the local farming communities since lime immemorial. These traditional crop varieties hare evolved over centuries and are well adapted to the particular area. A number of edaphic, topographic and climatic factors associated with different selection pressures over centuries of cultivation resulted in immense variations in the crop species.
   The grain and by-product yield of the majority of the traditional crops cultivated across an altitudinal gradient wvere worked out and compared with common food crops (paddy, wheat, mustard) at two points in time (1970-74, 1990-94) and it was found that almost all the traditional crops had slightly higher yields during 1970-74 than between 1990-94, However, common food crops grown during the Kharif season had higher yields during 1990-94 whereas, Rabi season crops exhibited higher yield during 1970-74. The yield of rainfed paddy remained static over the years across the altitudinal gradient. Among the traditional crops cultivated during the Kharif and Rabi seasons in mixed and pure forms at different altitudes were Macrotyloma uniformum (at higher altitude), Parilla frutescens and Vigna mungo (at middle altitude) and Panicum miliaceum (at lower altitude) which were found to be eco-energetically efficient. Avena sativa (oat) and mixed cropping of Fagopyrum esculentum and potato had higher energy efficiency ratios whereas the latter also exhibited a higher monetary output/input ratio. Crops like paddy and wheat with mustard, grown in irrigated land were found to be more ecoenergetically efficient than the same crops grown in the rainfed land. In general, traditional crops possess higher nutritive value than the common food crops. The contribution of traditional crops to the local diet (kg/capita/year) and their energy and protein equivalents were higher during both time periods, It was observed that while exporting these traditional crops, the locals of the region are highly exploited by middlemen. Despite having huge potential, traditional crop diversity of this region has been reduced to a great extent during the last two decades. Besides, the area under cultivation with these crops has been declining rapidly. However, many of these crops possess immense potential to meet the growing food demand and ensure food security of an increasing population. Therefore, a comprehensive programme of conservation through various means and improvement of agronomic yield in their natural habitats is urgently needed.

   analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE socioeconomics; sustainability; system analysis; development; welfare
ID ENERGY; SCALE
AB This paper explores the relationships between economic activity and sustainability, growth, and welfare. The issues regarding the nature of the relationships were framed by Ekins in questions which are addressed empirically across countries and the states of the US. The sustainability issue is addressed by comparing nonrenewable energy throughput, a surrogate for impacts, to the renewable energy throughput in the associated ecosystem. The effect of a changing energy intensity, in developing and developed countries, on socioeconomic variables provides clues to social welfare. In developing countries a rising energy throughput (economic growth) and energy intensity is positively related to public welfare while impacts are generally moderate. The reverse appears to be true in developed countries, i.e. as energy throughput and intensity rise in developed countries and the US states, pollution and impacts also rise while socioeconomic variables worsen, so public welfare begins to decline. Economic development appears to pass through three phases which call be characterized by the nature and extent of its energy use. Each phase exhibits characteristic energy, pollution, structural and socioeconomic trends.

AB The potential of 3-year-old grazed pastures of Stylosanthes hamata, Chamaecr ista rotundifolia and Centrosema pascuorum to contribute to subsequent maize production was investigated in subhumid Nigeria in 1993. All three legume pastures had the ability to give better maize grain yields than native pasture but this was significant only for Stylosanthes hamata and Chamaecrista rotundifolia. For the legume species, maximum yield of maize per kg of N applied was attained at 60 kgN/ha. The subsequent yields of maize could be related to the legume species used, pasture management and the length of the fallow period. Centrosema pascuorum behaved as an annual, and as such there was little legume present after 3 years; crop yield was therefore relatively low. Nevertheless, this species could be useful in 1-year fallow/pasture situations. Maize cropping was economically viable for legume plots only with 60 or 120 kgN/ha and not for native pasture. There were no significant differences in the time required to till or to weed legume pastures as compared with native pasture. Forage legume pastures could also have a positive effect on maize residue yields which represent a fodder resource in addition to the herbage understorey remaining after cropping, the quality of which could be enhanced by the presence of the forage legumes. The use of forage legumes for the promotion of both crop and livestock production in sustainable agricultural systems is discussed. The results of the study are used to highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate legume species, pasture management practices and duration of fallow period in relation to the prevailing farming system to maximize benefits from the legumes.

The proposition will be advanced that although they were very successful short-term adaptations, their long-term chances were compromised by their intensive local land use and the dense network of social obligations both within the settlements and with nearby communities.

AB The conflict between economic optimization and environmental protection has received wide attention in recent research programs for solid waste management system planning. The purpose of this analysis is to apply multiobjective mixed integer programming techniques for reasoning the potential conflict between environmental and economic goals and for evaluating sustainable strategies for waste management in a metropolitan region. The information incorporated into the optimization objectives include economic impacts, characterized by operational income and cost for waste management, air quality impacts from discharges of target pollutants due to waste incineration, noise impacts from various types of facilities operation, and traffic flow increments by garbage truck fleets. The constraint set thereby consists of mass balance, capacity limitation, operation, financial and related environmental quality constraints. Optimal strategies obtained from such an analytical scheme may provide a set of total solutions for long-term waste stream allocation, siting, resource recovery and tipping fees evaluation. The case study in the city of Kaohsiung in Taiwan is included as a demonstration. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB Ashes from the burning of wood and other plant-derived materials have been used as soil amendments for centuries. Although historical interest in land application of ashes declined following the advent of commercial fertilizers and alternative liming materials, additional incentives for this beneficial use have arisen in recent years. The first is from rapidly rising landfill costs for disposal of by-product ashes produced from the paper and electric utility industries. Secondly, the environmental ethic of sustainable management and the concept of recycling have provided incentives to replace nutrients removed from forest and agronomic harvests. Field and greenhouse studies show that wood-fired boiler ashes can be successfully used as a replacement for agricultural lime with additional nutrient benefits. Ash application on forest land is less common, but Scandinavian studies indicate that ashes can enhance long-term productivity of some forested sites. The use of ashes alone or combined with other mill residues, fertilizers, or agricultural wastes could prove particularly valuable for sustaining productivity of intensively managed forests over successive rotations. This overview provides an introduction to a subset of papers presented at the ''NCASI Symposium on Land Application of Wood-Fired and Combination Boiler Ashes.''

AB This paper employs the concepts of the scare and civil society ro explain the development process. It theorizes development as a dynamic and non-continuous process of state-civil society interaction. Ic argues that sustainable development initially requires a strong developmentalist state that allows for the growth of a vibrant civil society. At some point in this process, civil society will muster enough strength to challenge the scare. It this transitional stage is successfully managed, the two forces will reach a balance of power that allows the country co enter the sustainable development stage, also characterized by democracy. The paper illustrates the theory through historical analysis and concludes by drawing our the theory's planning and policy implications.

AB The context of this paper is the interface between sustainability, urban form, municipal Solid waste management infrastructure, and environmental impacts. Collection and haulage systems for solid waste and recyclable materials were analyzed from an air emissions perspective for two hypothetical-cities representing two sustainability extremes. Alternative fuels were also considered to determine if reductions in air pollutant emissions could be achieved. A case study for the municipal solid waste management system for the city of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, was also conducted. Urban form was found to play a significant role in determining emission levels from a municipal solid waste collection and transport system. Urban forms with higher densities have considerably less pollutants generated from collection and transport due to the shorter travel distances. A methanol-fueled fleet for curbside collection provided the lowest air emissions. The air emission results for the case study municipality lay between the two hypothetical cities due to the mix of urban form and residential population densities currently found in Hamilton.

   REVASCULARIZATION; INSUFFICIENCY; EXPERIENCE
AB Purpose: Unequivocal indications for renal artery reconstruction remain the presence of significant underlying renal insufficiency or severe hypertension. Thus surgical intervention for renal artery stenosis in the absence of this clinical picture may well be considered empirical and, as a consequence, treatment recommendations are ill-defined. Our experience with reconstruction of the minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic renal artery lesion in association with primary aortic repair over a 10-year period was reviewed.
   Methods: Thirty-two patients who had atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis greater than or equal to 70% underwent prophylactic renal revascularization between 1982 and 1992. The patients' median age was 63 years (range, 44 to 79 years); 23 (72%) were men and nine (28%) were women. All had preoperative serum creatinine levels less than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl (1.29 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) and were receiving either no antihypertensive medication (22%) or only a single agent (78%). Aortoiliac occlusive disease was present in 38% of this population, and aortic aneurysmal disease either alone or in combination with occlusive disease was found in 62%.
   Results: Operative management included unilateral renal artery repair in 21 patients (66%) and bilateral renal revascularization in the remaining 11 (34%). The median decrease in postoperative serum creatinine level (greater than or equal to 7 days after operation) was 0.81 +/- 0.05% (mean postoperative serum creatinine level, 1.27 +/- 0.07 mg/dl). The 30-day operative mortality rate was 3.1% (1 of 32). Late follow-up was available for 96% of patients (30 of 31; median, 64 months). Kaplan-Meier life table analysis revealed a 5-year probability of survival of 90.2% (95% confidence interval, 0.802 to 1.00). Stability of renal function was assessed by modeling the change in serum creatinine level over time with the intraclass correlation model. A serum creatinine level (mg/dl) = 1.3348 + 0.0011 x time (months) demonstrated minimal deterioration of excretory function during the observation period. Furthermore, the blood pressure of the majority of patients (75%) remained normal either with a single agent or without medication. Recurrent stenosis in one patient required treatment by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
   Conclusions: Adjunctive repair of the renal artery may be an appropriate option in selected patients who undergo simultaneous aortic surgery, even in the absence of severe hypertension or renal insufficiency. Surgical intervention can be accomplished with acceptable perioperative morbidity rates, and stability of renal function is sustainable in the majority of patients.

AB The term sustainability is increasingly used in both popular and scientific literature related to, or associated with the separate term, development. This paper discusses the inadequate nature of this term in relation to purported goals; and provides an alternative point of discussion which establishes a more clearly defined set of planning agendas for a given land unit. interdependent conditions of ecological and socio-economic forces are viewed as the generators of an over-arching geopolitical perspective from which sustainability policies are supported or defeated. Additionally, the concept of land units as containers are considered with regard to questions of input/output, and equilibrium within a landscape, The application of these ideas to varying scales of land units, and implications for planning are discussed.

AB Marriage, as a social institution, particularly among traditional communities is something more than just a regulated sex relation. It is a marker of sustainability in the form of a catalyst that help in evolving family types that are eco-cultural adaptations to communities' ecological and cultural needs. The sustainability characteristics of marriage are clearly reflected among the Jaunsaries, a scheduled tribe inhabiting in the Jaunsari-Bawar region of district Dehradun in the Central Himalaya. A unique people, once mostly adhering to polyandry, the Jaunsaries have undergone remarkable changes in their marriage pattern. Polyandry is fast disappearing, while at present, monogamy dominates. This article is an attempt in understanding the functioning, from eco-cultural perspectives, of marriage types those are disappearing and also presently prevalent among the Jaunsaries through a study carried out in a village inhabited by them.

DT Article
ID MAXIMUS
AB A nine-square mile site for the experimental culture of the giant sea scallop Placopecten magellanicus has been established in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), south of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. The goal of the project is the development of sustainable production practices for the New England sea scallop industry and the promotion of economic growth. In the project, a variety of methods of contained and on-bottom culture methods are being evaluated both biologically and economically.
   The experimental site is only the second in the United States to receive a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) for aquaculture in the EEZ. It is the first project to have been granted exclusive use of an area of the EEZ for aquaculture purposes. It is also the first site to involve floating containment systems designed for full exposure to the rigors of the northwest Atlantic Ocean.
   This article will briefly describe the project and its research agenda. The permitting process required of the project proponents will then be described as it serves as the only example of a fishery management council exercising its role in facilitating EEZ aquaculture. The issues associated with regulating aquaculture under the Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (FCMA) and coping with competing EEZ users will also be discussed.

AB Current interorganizational systems literature focuses on describing the role of information technology in enabling the transition from interfirm competition to cooperation. This article points out that the promise of IT enabled cooperation, if not nurtured, can degenerate into conflict. The objective of this article is to identify possible risks of conflict ill the IOS arena and to suggest strategies for minimizing the likelihood of such conflict. It does so by developing a typology for characterizing IOS along the dimension of interorganization interdependency in interfirm relationships. This typology classifies interorganizational systems into three types: pooled information resource IOS, value/supply chain IOS, and networked IOS. By examining the characteristics of these three types of IOSs the article identifies the economic, technical, and socio-political arguments for potential conflict in these systems. The identification of the risks, in turn, leads to a discussion of possible strategies for containing these risks. The article finally suggests that if the intended benefits of the collaboration are to be realized and sustained, corporate ''statesmen'' need to nurture the cooperation by anticipating these risks and managing them proactively.

TI Irrigation communities of the upper Rio Grande bioregion: Sustainable
   resource use in the global context
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The Rio Declaration in 1992 brought attention to the importance of placing human settlements at the center of planning for sustainable resource management, including the incorporation of the traditional knowledge and practices available from the land-based peoples of the world. There is growing evidence that countries in both the Third World and the West are giving serious attention to alternative models of development, that emphasize community-based management emanating from traditional values and institutions embedded in local cultures. A water rights transfer case study from the upper Rio Grande bioregion in the western United States illustrates the need for policy-makers and the public at-large to consider cultural values alongside economic and ecologic-environmental factors when planning for a common sustainable future. Also, people's democratic institutions, such as the acequia [ditch] organizations of northcentral New Mexico, need to assert their historic rights to life-sustaining water resources by taking concerted actions to preserve the resource base on which they and other stakeholders in the region depend.

TI Soil management for conservation and sustainable rice production in an
   irrigated area of eastern Nigeria
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB An comparison of soil management techniques in the different irrigation zones of Lower Anambra Irrigation Project (LAIP) in eastern Nigeria showed that heavy use of machinery led to increases in bulk density and decreases in field water infiltration rate, The relative proportion of clay in the irrigated fields increased as a result of irrigation, suggesting that mobilized clay from uncemented main and distribution canals is carried and deposited in the rice fields. Both irrigation and the use of machinery have had substantial negative effects on soil nutrient levels, and there is a danger of this process continuing. Soil management for sustainable production in the area should centre on applying organic matter in combination with inorganic fertilizers, monitoring the soil properties on yearly basis before the cropping season for fertilizer and lime recommendations, and varying the depth of tillage to increase or maintain the effective soil depth.

TI A land management based approach to integrated Striga hermonthica
   control in sub-Saharan Africa
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID HERBICIDE; MAIZE
AB Striga hermonthica, an obligate root parasite of grasses, is one of the most severe constraints to cereal production in sub-Saharan Africa. In the recent past, prior to increased production pressure on land, S. hermonthica was controlled in African farming systems by prolonged crop rotations with bush fallow. Because of increasing need for food and concomitant changes in land management practices, however, these fallow rotations are no longer extensively used. Shorter crop rotations and fallow periods have also led to declines in soil fertility which present a very serious threat to African food production. A sustainable solution will be an integrated approach that simultaneously addresses both of these major problems. An integrated programme that replaces traditional bush fallow rotation with non-host nitrogen-fixing legume rotations, using cultivars selected for efficacy in germinating S. hermonthica seeds, is outlined, The programme includes use of S. hermonthica-free planting material, biological control, cultural control to enhance biological suppressiveness, host-plant resistance, and host-seed treatments.

TI Effect of grazing and supplementation in a coconut plantation on cattle
   production, coconut yield and soil fertility
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The effects of grazing the natural herbage growing in coconut plantations on the growth and reproduction of indigenous cattle, as well as on coconut production and soil fertility, were examined in an experiment of 6 years' duration. The growth, reproduction and lactation of the Zebu heifers was poor when no feed supplement was given. Provision of rice straw or, better, rice straw plus concentrates, greatly improved cattle performance, There was also an increase in coconut production, both with grazing alone and with each increment of supplement, associated with improved soil water-holding capacity. It is concluded that a management system based on resources available to local farmers can achieve sustainable improvements of both stock performance and crop production as well as soil fertility.

AB The maximum rate of energy assimilation in lactating Peromyscus maniculatus (100 kJ/d, body mass = 25 g) was lower than in cold-exposed females (115 kJ/d, body mass = 20 g). This pattern differs from that found in a few species of voles and mice, in which lactating females achieve higher rates of assimilation than cold-exposed animals. The results do not support the hypothesis that enery budgets of animals are limited centrally by the rate of energy assimilation from food, irrespective of which metabolic function constitutes the main energy expenditure. The discussion about physiological limits to energy budgets must involve information about the life strategies of the animals.

AB The aerobic capacity model for the evolution of endothermy contends that endothermy arose as a result of selection for enhanced aerobic capacity rather than for thermoregulatory considerations. An implicit assumption of this model is that basal metabolism (BMR) increases with an increase in sustainable activity (i.e., aerobic capacity). We tested this assumption for passerine birds using individuals of 10 different species to determine whether basal and summit (maximum cold-induced) metabolic rates were correlated. Metabolic rates were measured as oxygen consumption by open-circuit respirometry. Regressions of basal and summit metabolism against body mass (log(10)-log(10) transformations) indicated that both BMR and summit metabolism were positively and significantly related to mass. Slopes of the two regression lines were not significantly different, which indicates similar scaling properties for BMR and summit metabolism. Residuals of log(10)-log(10) transformations of summit metabolism and BMR against body mass demonstrated that summit metabolism was correlated with BMR independently of mass (r = 0.869). In addition, analyses generating phylogenetically independent contrasts indicated that contrasts of log(10) BMR and log(10) summit metabolism were both positively and significantly correlated with contrasts of log(10) body mass. Residuals from these regression lines demonstrated that the significant positive correlation between BMR and summit metabolism (r = 0.861) remained when effects of both mass and phylogeny were removed. Thus, metabolic rates of the passerines in this study are consistent with the aerobic capacity model for the evolution of endothermy.

AB To control apple scab disease caused by Venturia inaequalis, aqueous extracts from two sources of spent mushroom substrate (SMS), anaerobically fermented for 7 days and amended with spreader-sticker, were applied at weekly intervals to apple trees (cv. McIntosh) from green-tip to petal-fall and biweekly thereafter. Trials were conducted for three seasons at two locations in Wisconsin. Both extracts significantly reduced (alpha = 0.05) the leaf area affected by scab relative to water and spreader-sticker controls as evaluated by the Horsfall-Barratt scale. Disease incidence was similarly decreased but to a lesser extent. Extracts were not as effective in inhibiting disease as captan sprayed at the same intervals. No difference was detected between extracts with and without spreader-sticker. Higher populations of bacteria, which persisted for at least 1 month after the final spray, were detected on leaves treated with the extracts. No differences were found in total numbers of fungi. Inhibitory activity of extracts, assessed as in vitro inhibition of Venturia conidia germination, was monitored over time for extracts prepared from SMS stored under different conditions. For one source of SMS, neither time nor storage conditions (outdoors uncovered or indoors in sheds) affected inhibitory activity of extracts. Decline in efficacy of the other source was apparent by 13 weeks relative to unstored compost, although not between storage regimens.

AB Remarkable economic achievements have been made in China since the economic reform in 1978. High agricultural and industrial productivity as well as rapid development of the tertiary industry and continouous improvement of living standard have resulted in a jumping power demand The pressing need for updating the current infrastructure, power industry in particular is the key to the sustainable economic growth and continuous industrialisation. The crucial role of rural industry in economic development and the fact of over 70% of the rural population have brought a great opportunity for wind energy development One of the most cost-effective ways to diffuse wind power technology is through technology transfer based on joint venture activities due to the enormous initial capital investment and complexity of wind power technology to ease the severe domestic power shortage. Foreign aid and investment will no doubt have a stimulatory effect on wind energy development in China The future benefits in terms of technology transfer and international trade will easily outweigh the current problems and thus contribute to sustainable economic development in maw years to come.

AB The need for alternative and renewable transportation fuels continues to be high on the nation's agenda Substituting these fuels for petroleum can reduce dependence on foreign oil imports, improve air quality, and mitigate greenhouse gases. Renewable fuels offer the same advantages as nonrenewable alternative fuels, and, in addition, provide an inexhaustible supply. The largest potential for significant quantities of liquid renewable fuels is from the production of biofuels from cellulosic biomass such as wastes and energy crops. Advanced vehicles will provide dramatic fuel efficiency improvements and will likely have electric drive systems. An evolution of vehicles is expected to occur, beginning with an electric vehicle that fills niche markets in the near term, to hybrid vehicles by the year 2000, to fuel cell vehicles after the year 2005. With the combination of renewable fuels and high efficiency, advanced vehicles can move the nation toward a sustainable transportation system.

AB In most developing countries more than 25% of total energy use comes from biofuels. In Ghana, the figure is between 70-80%. Bioenergy is mainly used for cooking and heating, and is also important in rural or cottage industries. As a developing country, Ghana's economic growth remains coupled to the availability and supply of energy. About 29% of this energy is obtained through hydropower and imported petroleum. The two hydropower installations generate about 1102 MW annually mainly for domestic and industrial uses. At the current 3.0% average annual population growth rate, a population of about 35 million is expected by 2025. Coupled with the country's efforts to promote industrialisation, future energy demand is expected to increase severalfold. This paper provides an overview of Ghana's current energy situation and discusses the role of bioenergy in the future energy demand of the country. The paper concludes with a recommendation for a major shift in energy policy to accommodate the conversion of biofuels into versatile energy carriers in a decentralised system to meet the energy requirements of the people and to provide a basis for rural development and employment.

AB New Zealand has the potential to become the first country to be totally dependent on renewable energy sources. Already hydro power supplies 70% of the total electricity demand and geothermal a further 5%. The challenge is to phase out the remaining 25% thermal power generation and to provide sufficient liquid transport fuels from the biomass resources.
   The natural gas fields currently supply over 30% of total energy demand but the reserves are very limited. Wind farming is a feasible alternative using wood-fired power generation and landfill gas plants to meet peak demands.
   There is land available for energy crop production and the climate enables all year round growth such that high crop yields of 20 oven dry tonnes/ha/year appear feasible. In addition the solar radiation of 1 kW/m(2) will enable solar thermal and photovoltaics to make a significant contribution.
   Currently there are no government incentives for renewable energy under the free market economy but a sustainable energy future is feasible in the long term.

AB Mahatma Gandhi said about the Planet Earth that there was sufficient resource to meet everybody's need (in the planet), but not for anybody's greed - nothing could be more appropriate at present in the context of the Global Energy situation. Renewable Energy has now been recognised as the only solution to the problem of sustainable development. Among Asian countries, India would continue to remain one of the major consumers of fossil fuels, because of the fast growth in her economy since the new economic policies were initiated around 1991. With demand far out-stripping supply; shortages of power in India are growing every year with more and more forest covers getting depleted and women everywhere are being affected, directly or indirectly.
   Experts have projected that unless the present level of carbon dioxide emissions coming from fossil fuels is reduced to 60% of the present level there would be a major climatic shift by the middle of 2000 A.D. The Goverment of India has realised that such a reduction in carbon-dioxide emissions would not be possible unless there is a shift from the present fossil-fuel based economy to a Renewable Energy based economy. The contribution of carbon dioxide emissions from the use of renewable energy is the least compared with those from other fuels, and is of the order of 0.001% per kwh, as against 1.2% per kwh for coal and 0.6% per k. wh for oil.

AB Buildings consume a large fraction of most nations' energy budgets. It is thus very important to promote conservation in energy use and the substitution of renewables for conventional fuels, where possible in this sector. Students undertaking courses leading to careers as professionals in the construction industry must be taught about energy and environment considerations. Further, this teaching must have regard to the multi-disciplinary and integrated nature of building design and construction. In addition to improving the education of students, teaching staff who are non-energy/ environment specialists require help in developing their knowledge and so help to optimise impact of the subject. It is also necessary for lecturers to be made familiar with the most up-to-date teaching resources and techniques. Some efforts have been devoted to the development of syllabus and curriculum items for construction related courses. The Sustainable Building Network has recently been established in the UK to co-ordinate a range of activities in this field.

AB Civilization has embraced a highly refined essence of culture for well over 2,000 years. Commerce and quality of life have danced in a delicate and at times bold interplay throughout the evolution of humankind. Yet, never so precariously as it does, today.
   The earth with its abundant blessings and resources sway on a pendulum in orbit between the drive for survival and the corruptibility of commerce. Decisions regarding global resources are now - more than ever - entwined with the very essence of global survival We must put responsible energy products in reach and within budget, today.
   Sound market deployment of building-integrated photovoltaics are focused within core industrialized nations where the technology and related systems may be proven on a broad scale with closely monitored installations primarily self-financed with Solar Bond incentives. The 100 Headrick Solar-Voltaic Dome Power Stations By 2000 Program advances a unique mid-size 2,100 m(2) (21,000 SF) solar array increasing peak output on an acre four times from 60 kWp to 262 kWp (at 1 kWp per 8m(2)) with 3,400 m(2) leasable.
   Formal ceremonial signing of this commitment by leaders of the United States, the European Commission and Japan is an important step to encourage the commercial real estate industries of these industrialized nations to advance this Program assuring photovoltaics timely achieves status as a World Trade Commodity of the 21st Century.

AB Development and dissemination of efficient and economic techniques of harnessing new and renewable sources of energy to bridge the ever increasing gap between the energy demand and supply hi developing countries is a formidable challenge for their governments. Availability of educated and trained manpower at all levels is very crucial for successful implementation of any programmes towards sustainable use of new and renewable sources of energy. Renewable energy education is, therefore, of prime importance. An attempt to analyse several issues involved in this regard is made in this paper.

DE rock phosphate solubilization earthworm; Streptosporangium
AB Phosphorous immobilization is among the recalcitrant problems hampering crop production in the high rainfall acid soils of Nigeria. Applied inorganic phosphorous quickly becomes immobilized and unavailable to plants. Therefore, there is a need to develop cultural methods that foster, fast and efficient recycling of phosphorous, and carbon to satisfy plant demands and facilitate sustainable soil fertility management in these soils. Nine Streptosporangium isolates of Eudilius eugeniae (earthworm) casts were found to be acidgenic, acid tolerant, rock phosphate (RP) solubilizers which could grow on synthetic glucose or carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) N-free or NH4Cl-enriched media, as the sole carbon source. CMC induced production of extracelluar cellulase enzyme and release of reducing sugar in all isolates. Both CNC media were acidified by all isolates. The ability to solubilize RP varied among the isolates and ranged from 800 mu g P/g RP/7 days to 9500 mu g/g RP/7 days. A maximum release of 1040 mu g (glucose equivalent)/ml/7 days was recorded in N-free CMC, while a minimum of 121 mu g/ml was recorded in NH4Cl-enriched CMC medium. These isolates could therefore be exploited in the industrial production of cellulolytic enzymes and microbial phosphate fertilizers which would enhance organic residues and plant nutrients recycling in acid soils of Nigeria.

TI Value, capital and nature: Some ecological implications of Marx's
   critique of political economy
SO SCIENCE & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Marx's critique of political economy is interpreted in terms of the contradiction between: (1) the necessary role of nature, along with labor, as a source of use value; (2) value's rep resentation of wealth by the abstract labor time objectified in commodities. Capitalism's tendency to despoil its natural environment is constituted in the basic relation of capitalist exploitation and the corresponding value form of the products of labor and nature. Marx's analysis thus provides the basis for a coherent historical specification of capitalism's natural conditions and limits -- one that organically relates ecological and class struggles while highlighting the need for alternatives to the market in order to achieve ecologically sustainable production.

AB Effects of early and delayed harvest were investigated in 'Hass' avocado, at Childers, a warm subtropical site (over 4 years), and at Maleny, a cool, mesic subtropical site (over 3 years) in S.E. Queensland. Early harvesting at 25 to 30% flesh dry matter (DM) sustained high productivity (especially at the cooler site), but a delayed harvest up to 4 months later at 35% flesh DM eventually depressed yield (at Childers) and precipitated alternate bearing. Split harvests (early and late) were less detrimental to sustainability of high yields (> 20 t ha(-1)). Where alternate bearing was already entrenched at the start of the experiment at the cooler site (Maleny), early harvest was insufficient to break this pattern. Starch cycling in trunk wood and new shoots followed predictable seasonal patterns, and peak concentrations were reduced by heavy fruiting, Pre-flowering starch concentrations in shoots (Childers) or trunks (Maleny) were directly correlated to the following seasons' yield.

AB There is a growing body of critical literature on health, development and environmental sustainability in a world of finite resources and overburdened ecosystems. The ethics of progress and perpetual development in pursuit of unlimited economic growth and ever-expanding markets are no longer viable, given the constraints imposed on the life-support systems of the biosphere and a finite resource base, which poses the most serious threat to life on Earth. Despite increasing evidence of the linkages between economic growth and environmental deterioration and a rhetoric expressed in a growing body of laws, regulations, accords and global ''agendas'' at the national and international level, there are all too few success stories in reversing or even slowing down the current trends of ecosystem degradation and decreasing cultural and biological diversity. Or. the contrary, there is evidence that environmental stress and deterioration are increasing, and the impact on the mental, physical and social health and well-being of populations is more significant now than in any previous time in history. The fragmentation of countries, the rise of nationalism and ethnic conflict, the decimation of indigenous nations and human rights abuses are often closely interrelated with environmental degradation and development initiatives. This paper reviews some of the concepts and underlying values of the main ''models'' developed by health and social scientists for interpreting this reality, with the aim of stimulating debate that could lead to the adoption of a larger and more comprehensive framework for analysing the interactions between human health, development and environmental change.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Approaches to resource and environmental management based on outdated notions about nature and the development of complex systems must be updated by new approaches that mix leading-edge ecosystem science and management. New approaches should be endowed with an appropriate mix of ecological theory, data, creativity, and flexibility in an overall framework that emphasizes adaptability and experimentation. Guided by societal goals of achieving (or maintaining) ecological integrity and natural resource sustainability, a management framework based on clinical ecology-a prescriptive scientific management regime informed by theory and empirical generalization-may represent the type of approach needed to proceed in an orderly fashion toward resolving many resource and environmental management problems.

TI Integrated solid waste management in urban India: A critical operational
   research framework
SO SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Planning for urban solid waste management within the framework of sustainable development raises several intra- and inter-generational issues such as public health, livelihood of actors in the informal recycling sector, present and future cost to society, conservation of resources both renewable and nonrenewable, and environmental impacts of waste disposal. It is essential that planners seek to address the above issues 'interactively' by exploring various 'soft' alternatives, instead of 'preactively' extending conventional 'hard' solutions. Such an integrated approach, however, should be developed through consensus among various actors. This paper proposes a Critical Operational Research (COR) framework to facilitate consensus/conflict resolution among actors, and also aid in learning. The nonlinear goal programming model developed within the COR framework provides a platform for discussion among actors involved in urban solid waste management. Its utility as a 'learning' tool is demonstrated by applying it to a typical metropolitan city in India. The exercise highlights the limitations of techno-managerial solutions usually adopted in developing countries, and the scope for the informal sector in urban solid waste management.

AB The combined use of earthworm inoculation and organic inputs is considered an efficient way to improve traditional slash-and-burn agriculture in the humid tropics. This study tests the hypothesis that the resistant macroaggregate structure that results from earthworm activities is likely to promote sustainability by favoring water infiltration and soil aeration. Six successive crops (maize [Zea mays L.]-rice [Oryza sativa L.]-cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.]-rice-rice-rice) were grown from March 1990 to January 1993 on a fine-sandy, siliceous, isohyperthermic Typic Paleudult previously covered by forest at Yurimaguas (Peruvian Amazonia). The experimental design included a combination of three organic residue treatments (without residues, with crop residues, and with crop residues plus green manure), with or without earthworm (Pontoscolex corethrurus) inoculation (36 g fresh weight m(-2)). Soil physical properties (bulk density, total porosity, infiltration, sorptivity, soil water tension, and aggregate-size distribution) were measured before clearing and after harvesting each crop. The proportion of macroaggregates (>1 cm) increased from 25.1 to 32.7% in inoculated treatments, whereas the proportion of small aggregates (<2 cm) decreased from 33.2 to 26.1%, and no change was observed in the intermediate (2-10 mm) category. In the control treatment, no significant changes were observed. Earthworm activities significantly increased bulk density (from 1.12 to 1.23 Mg m(-3)), and decreased porosity (from 58 to 53%) and sorptivity (from 0.45 to 0.15 cm s(-1/2)). Soil water tension was also affected by the presence of earthworms through increased water uptake by larger plants and changes in soil structure. Longer term experiments are necessary to confirm that the activity of the earthworm may not eventually have detrimental effects.

AB Effects of alternative farming systems on soil structure need to be quantified to judge the sustainability of the systems. This study was conducted to compare two farming systems by converting ''static'' basic soil properties into a ''dynamic'' assessment using simulation modeling. Increasingly popular biodynamic farming systems use no commercial fertilizers and pesticides but apply organic manure and compost. Soil conditions on four fields on two farms where biodynamic and conventional soil management had been practiced for about 70 yr were investigated with morphological and physical methods. Soils (loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Fluvaquents) were pedologically identical. Four procedures were used to express differences in soil structure as a function of different management: (i) morphological description; (ii) measurement of basic and static soil parameters such as bulk density, organic matter, and porosity; (iii) measurement of soil hydraulic characteristics; and (iv) determination of simulated water-limited yields. The latter procedure provides a criterion that is quantitative, is directly related to a practical aspect of soil behavior, and reflects the highly nonlinear soil-water processes. The WAVE simulation model was used to predict water-limited potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) yields with climatic data of 30 yr. Basic static soil parameters were not significantly different but simulated yields were significantly different and were 10200 and 10300 vs. 9400 and 9700 kg dry matter tuber yield ha(-1) yr(-1) for the biodynamic and the conventional fields, respectively. Simulation modeling of crop yields thus provides a relevant expression for the production potential of the two different farming systems.

AB A land evaluation using unsophisticated data successfully predicted yield ranges of various crops in Burundi. Yields of wheat, pea, bean, maize and potato predicted from data for climate, soil and land use technology were observed yields from farm trials and from seed station and research station trials. The predicted range of field for each crop suitability class enclosed the mean farm yields 13 times out of 16 and yields on seed stations and research stations 10 times our of 15 and 14 times out of 21 respectively. The variability of the observed yields exceeded the predicted range of yields. The method is considered as validated. The method appears to be applicable for multi-year studies at a broad scale, but yield variation according to the weather from year to year is not accounted for. The variances of the yields on farms are greater than the variances in seed station and research station trials.
   Since the method predicts correctly the mean regional farm yields, it could be useful for land use planning, research into optimal regional cropping specialisation, studies on food policy, and for evaluation of economic return and sustainability of different crops.

TI Stress-induced changes in plant gene expression - Prospects for
   enhancing agricultural productivity in South Africa

AB The natural environment of southern Africa is characterised by great climatic diversity and marked inter-seasonal variability in climatic conditions. It is estimated that less than 20% of South Africa by area yields mean annual primary agricultural outputs in excess of 40% of its potential. Environmental stress is the primary cause of the difference between observed and potential agricultural yields. It also accounts for considerable inter-annual variability in yield and thereby poses a threat to food security. Drought, in particular has played a dominant role historically in limiting agricultural growth. Since the adverse influence of abiotic stress on agricultural output leads to an almost continuous drain on state finances, the development of stress-tolerant varieties of agriculturally important crops is likely to be of great economic importance.
   Although plant responses to environmental stress involve adaptation at several levels of organisation, they all must ultimately have a genetic basis. Several genes are now known to respond to different stresses commonly encountered in agriculture. The genetic manipulation of these genes holds considerable promise as a first step towards increasing environmental tolerance and is well within the scope of plant biotechnology currently at our disposal. This review attempts to assess the feasibility of using such an approach as part of a long-term sustainable development strategy in southern Africa and to indicate strategies that might be considered to enhance stress tolerance of crops of agricultural importance. In the light of increasing evidence implicating the existence of a stress response system in plants, it is proposed that overlapping responses to different environmental stresses may be mediated by common cellular signal transduction pathways. Recent studies of signalling cascades in higher plants have identified ion channels, intracellular signalling proteins, and second messengers as critical components mediating early events in signal transduction. In the long term, targeting the genes encoding components of stress-related signal transduction pathways might be more profitable than manipulation of genes involved in intermediary metabolism. Transgenic crops altered as a result of stress-related cellular signalling may display increased ability to adapt to several stresses experienced concurrently in the field Since the molecular details of stress-related signal transduction in plants remain largely unknown, however characterisation of the molecular signals involved in stress perception and the molecular events that specify the expression of stress tolerance will be necessary to provide a sound basis on which such strategies can be founded.

AB This article examines two questions regarding participation in economic policy reform in Africa: how do the circumstances surrounding participation and the ways it occurs influence the economic policy reform process, and can changes to enhance participation lead to improved policy outcomes? The general findings are, first, that the pattern of participation is an important variable in the policy reform process, but that its effects on reform outcomes are strongly mediated by African political and governance factors. Second, increased participation appears to enhance prospects for sustainable reform outcomes, though the weak capacity and responsiveness of the state and the incipient nature of civil society's associational infrastructure in much of Africa limit opportunities for institutionalizing participation. It is important to be aware of participation's limits as well as its potential contributions to economic policy reform in the context of political liberalization, and to recognize the long-term nature of the transition to new modes of state-society cooperation.

AB In 1960 Heinz von Foerster challenged the prevailing Malthusian models of human population growth. He advanced the view that mankind's ability to solve the problems associated with the world's growing population would stay well ahead of the growth in that population. Thus a world which was formerly projected to-be threatened by growing resource shortages was projected to be threatened by a lack of physical space in which to enjoy an abundance. The paper which follows revisits the work and affirms its importance to an understanding of the current debate on sustainability. The-passing years have done much to accentuate the importance of von Foerster's insights. The coalitions of the Internet are seen as a further evolution of the communication coalitions which underlie his view of the population problem.

SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE

DT Article
AB The problem of attention management is described as a major challenge in the transition to environmentally sustainable development paths. The design principle that attention is scarce is very different from a principle of ''more information is better'' when discussing problems of sustainability in technological development. The issue of ''attention management'' is discussed in various contexts, including R&D and innovation management, scientific communities, and technology policy. Given that environmental policies often ''grandfather'' existing technologies, more systemic environmental and technological strategies are called for. These require new models for integration of information from much wider ranges of sources and networks of expertise than is the case for present technological innovations in individual industries and companies.

ID STRUCTURAL-CHANGE; DEMAND
AB The study suggests that the question of whether the world economy can move to a new and sustainable pattern of growth remains open. It is both a question of methods of regulation, economic incentives, and other institutional changes and a question of technological innovations. Although more attention has been paid to incentives and institutions, the potential offered by continuous technological change has been rather neglected. This emerges as a central issue in the ''limits to growth'' debate and its resulting world models. The study argues that, to realize large technoeconomic system transitions, society needs to develop a new model of innovation, combining some features of the much criticized linear model with features of the systemic innovation model.

SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB Technology policies to promote a transition ''away from the carbon atom'' must take into account the systemic nature of technological change in the energy sector. Technological interrelatedness, infrastructure requirements, and lumpiness of energy sector investments result in the need to consider technological change as systemic, i.e., beyond the introduction and diffusion of individual technologies. Consequences of technological advances are ambivalent. On the one hand, technological improvements in existing technologies can slow down the development of new alternatives and radical technological shifts. On the other hand, technological change generates variety within the system of energy supply and end-use technologies, leading to technological pluralism. Thus, technology dynamics are characterized by a complex interplay between irreversibility and diversity. It is on this basis that public technology policy oriented toward sustainable energy development has to be formulated.

TI Application of a surplus production model to a swordfish-like simulated
   stock with time-changing gear selectivity
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
ID HAKE; AGE
AB Should a surplus production model be applied to a stock that exhibits pronounced age structure? Should it be applied to a stock that has experienced changing fishing mortality rates on fish of different sizes over time (i.e., changing selectivity)? These questions are of general interest to those engaged in stock assessment and of particular interest in the assessment of North Atlantic swordfish Xiphias gladius. In an attempt to answer them, we simulated an age-structured population, with fishery, similar to that of swordfish in the North Atlantic. The 30-year simulation included biological characteristics from the literature on swordfish and simulated fishing with increasing mortality of young fish over time; simulated catches approximated the actual catches of swordfish from 1962 through 1991. We fit a lumped-biomass, dynamic surplus production model to summary non-age-structured data from the simulated fishery. The resulting parameter estimates were compared to management benchmarks, including maximum sustainable yield (MSY), computed by age-structured methods from the growth and recruitment characteristics of the underlying simulation. The changing selectivity resulted in a small (<10%) decrease in MSY from the beginning of the series to its end; estimates from the production model were close to these underlying MSY values. Nine additional population trajectories were simulated with the same biological characteristics but other fishing histories; in most cases, the production model provided qualitatively correct estimates of stock status. Two new reliability statistics appear to be of value in judging the quality of production model fits. We conclude that for stocks similar to swordfish, the presence of strong age structure and moderate changes in selectivity should not proscribe the application of simple production models.

AB This paper discusses the vulnerability and adaptation of the agricultural sector of China to global warming. Based on a summarization of Chinese agricultural and general circulation model trends, adverse impacts on China's agriculture caused by a warming and drying climate were identified. Because of limited irrigation potential the sustainable development of Chinese agriculture will be difficult. Six sensitive agricultural areas located on the edges of different agroecological zones, and seven provinces with high vulnerability to the impacts on agriculture, were identified On the basis of an estimation of the potential supply of agricultural products and demand for food, the annual incremental costs for adaptation to climate change would be US$0.8-3.48 billion; without adaptation, the annual agricultural loss due to global warming would be US$1.37-79.98 billion from 2000 to 2050. Adaptive measures discussed include intensive management and the possibility of a tripartite structure of planting that would entail coordinated development of grain crops, feed crops, and cash crops.

AB El Nino events and associated droughts adversely affect freshwater resources on islands in the tropical Pacific region. Particularly vulnerable are low-lying atolls because rainwater collection is the main freshwater source on such islands. During El Nino-ralated droughts, water can be drawn only from the limited freshwater lenses beneath the islands. If drought conditions such as these intensify, the depletion of freshwater resources could affect the habitability of atolls. Avenge climate change in the Pacific region from increased anthropogenic carbon dioxide in a global coupled climate model resembles present-day El Nino conditions as well as the decadal time scale sea surface temperature and precipitation anomalies observed during the 1980s and early 1990s. These anomalies are a consequence of greater warming of sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific than over the western Pacific warm pool with increased carbon dioxide in the climate model. Attendant increases in precipitation in the central equatorial Pacific are also accompanied by precipitation decreases in the northern and southern tropical Pacific (roughly 5 degrees N to 15 degrees N and 5 degrees S to 15 degrees S), as well as in the Australasian and eastern Indian Ocean regions. Associated effects in the midlatitude North Pacific also resemble El Nino conditions and the decadal time-scale signals from the 1980s. Future possible increases of drought conditions in certain tropical Pacific regions, as indicated by the climate model results, could limit the sustainability of atoll populations in those regions, causing migration and increased urbanization, with all the attendant problems, on larger high islands with more stable water supplies.

TI Increasing private sector capacity for policy dialogue: The West African
   Enterprise Network
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustaining policy reforms in democratizing settings calls for increased capacity among stakeholders for policy dialogue. International agencies have traditionally provided support to governments to achieve better policy analysis, design and implementation - essentially a supply-side approach. An example of building demand-making capacity is the creation of the West African Enterprise Network, a voluntary association of over 300 business men and women in 11 countries. With technical assistance support from the US Agency for International Development, networks in these countries have been formed both to promote policy dialogue with government and pursue business ventures, using advocacy tools and strategic planning techniques. The success of the Enterprise Network derives from solving the incentives problem for collective action, building ownership for an advocacy agenda from the ground up, considering sustainability and self-financing issues from the start, applying a facilitative approach to technical assistance, and benefiting from donor flexibility regarding outcomes.

TI Sustaining economic reform under political liberalization in Africa:
   Issues and implications
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Structural adjustment programs in sub-Saharan Africa have resulted in only partial economic successes, but have played a significant role in facilitating political liberalization. Economic reforms can be deepened however, if policies which sustain economic and political reform efforts are more explicitly linked. The gains to be reaped from economic reforms will only be fully realized in conjunction with improvements in governance and expansion of democratic representation. In particular, there are four key dimensions for facilitating the sustainability of economic reform in the context of political liberalization in sub-Saharan Africa: changing government behavior and strengthening government capacity; enhancing the political capacity for effective policy implementation; nurturing civil society and increasing nongovernment organization (NGO) participation; and fostering the necessary institutional foundations for markets.

AB All technological developments are aimed at improving the quality of life of a community of people. Biotechnology is a technology which allows the exploitation of microorganisms, plants and animal cells to take place within an economic framework. Developing countries are looking for programmes achieving sustainable, economical growth conducive to a higher per capita income of the community. Any joint venture which promises social advances and economic benefits will have to be rural-based, This presentation discusses the need for a change in fermentation industry attitudes to allow joint venture capital investment in clean technologies together with the problems developing countries face for the implementation of such technologies.

AB The emergence and acceptance of the concept of sustainable development warrants that the scope of environmental biotechnology be enlarged to address issues like environmental monitoring, restoration of environmental quality, resource/residue/waste-recovery/utilization/treatment, and substitution of the non-renewable resource base with renewable resources. This paper delineates the current and prospective applications in these sub-areas of environmental biotechnology, and documents case studies on environmental monitoring (enteric viruses), restoration of environmental quality (oil spill remediation), resource recovery (hydrocarbon recovery from oily sludges, biosurfactants from distillery spentwash, desulphurization of coal & sour gases), and substitution of non-renewable resources with renewables (conversion of lignocellulosics into value added chemicals).

DT Article
AB Peculiarities of population biology of Microtus socialis are considered. The low ability to restoring their numbers under direct destruction is shown. The life strategy of the vole is use of constant settlements composed of the system of complex burrows. If direct anthropogenous effects (deep ploughing, floodings in watering), leading to the death of animals, are repeated annually, voles leave their constant settlements. The sustainable existence of the species in the disturbed landscapes is possible in large territories in the cases of not so permanent intensive human activity. These areas are formed in the places where forests dissapear due to aridization.

AB By a combined analytical and numerical approach, we investigate the three-dimensional hydrodynamical nonlinear stability of both differential rotation and pure shear flows. Since the high Reynolds number instabilities in question are in essence inviscid, a Navier-Stokes code is generally not necessary for their elucidation. Although our numerical code has little difficulty finding nonlinear instability in shear layers and in rotationally supported disks with constant specific angular momentum (the latter appears to be a new result), there is no evidence of any kind that Keplerian disks are nonlinearly unstable. This stability is hardly unique to a Keplerian rotation law, but is a property of any velocity profile with angular velocity decreasing outward and angular momentum increasing outward. A simple analytic analysis (from first principles) suggests that the key to nonlinear stability in rotationally supported disks is the interaction of correlated velocity fluctuations (which determine the nature of turbulent transport) with the background mean flow. In Rayleigh-unstable disks, outward transport extracts both energy and angular momentum from the mean how gradients and imparts them to the velocity fluctuations; in a Keplerian disk outward transport interacts with the mean angular momentum gradient to act as a sink for azimuthal velocity fluctuations. The first case is linearly unstable; the second is both linearly and nonlinearly stable. In a shear layer, the velocity gradient is a source of free energy, and there are no fluctuation interactions with the mean flow to create a dynamical sink. These flows are nonlinearly unstable, since turbulence, once created, is sustainable. Our formalism is also extremely useful in understanding why nonlinear numerical simulations have been yielding inward transport in convectively unstable disks. When there is overlap, our findings are consistent with well-established results of other investigations, both numerical and laboratory.
   We discuss the effective Reynolds number of the numerical code. We note, however, that the classical Taylor investigation already suggests that to simulate even linear (Rayleigh) instability, and effective Reynolds number in excess of 10(3) is required. We believe that the results of this investigation all but rule out any kind of self-generated hydrodynamical turbulence as a source of anomalous accretion disk transport. In an unmagnetized disk, global nonaxisymmetric instabilities and spiral waves remain, in principle, viable mechanisms.

TI Economy-wide reform and agricultural recovery: Observations of economic
   Darwinism among transition economies
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The fitness of an economy and its prospects for continued prosperity will be measured and determined by its robustness and its ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Some countries in transition are adapting much more easily than others to rapid changes in the orientation of their economy, the common objective of which is to achieve economic growth through the adoption of a range of characteristics generally associated with a market economy.
   Economic growth does not have to be very fast, but it must be efficient and sustainable. Policy adjustments must address political economy concerns, while seeking to achieve macroeconomic equilibrium and price stabilization, competitiveness, efficiency and flexibility, and the protection of the living standards of the most vulnerable population. The process of agricultural sector reform will be determined both by economy-wide policies and sector-specific policies.
   This paper first outlines a taxonomy of the objectives of agricultural sector reform, and then discusses the way in which indirect price interventions (specifically exchange rate and interest rate policies, expansive fiscal policies and industrial protection policies), influence agricultural growth. Lessons of experience drawn from the UNDP/World Bank Trade Expansion Program structural and sectoral adjustment operations in Poland, and the cases of New Zealand and Chile are employed to illustrate not only the constraints that countries face in this regard, but also in identifying targets for further action.
   The third section presents what is called the 'architecture of incentives for agriculture'. In defining a strategy of agricultural sector reform, experience has shown that a structure of incentives can be developed that creates an environment ripe for agricultural growth-incentives relating, for example, to taxation, prices, foreign investment, privatization and demonopolization, decentralization and institutional reform. Special considerations that will require additional attention by policy-makers outside of this structure include the maintenance of GATT-legal principles in trade policies, issues relating to tariffication (including concerns about price risk management, food supply, and the role of food aid), input and credit subsidies as a means to correct for market failures, and the role of regional trading blocks in world trade.

We seek to clarify the meaning and utility of the concept by focusing on forest resources in countries possessing higher levels of per capita incomes. The meaning of sustainable development becomes complex when one asks what social goals are being pursued, what types of stability are permitted, whether amenities and commodities should receive equal consideration, and to what landbase the concept should be applied. A simulation/linear programming model of California's private forest resource is used to demonstrate that strict decade-to-decade 'even-flow' stability of production may result in lower aggregate levels of output over a prolonged planning period, with ending levels of the stock resource that are scarcely greater than when output is permitted to vary over the planning period. The model was also used to show that greater levels of output and ending stocks are possible when the land base for sustainability assessment is not a restrictively small geographical area or a single class of ownership. In the case of National Forests and other public lands, the application of the sustainable development concept is significantly more complex because of the importance of amenity values and because of the inherent conflict between development and the preservation of ecosystems in a pristine state.

AB A multinomial probit (MNP) model is applied to the modeling of adoption decisions by farmers facing multiple technologies which can be adopted in various combinations. This model allows for full investigation of the interactions between decisions to adopt or not adopt several technologies. Estimation is carried out in a Bayesian framework employing Gibbs sampling to circumvent past difficulties encountered in maximum likelihood estimation of the MNP model. The model is estimated for a sample of U.S, apple growers with four possible sustainable production technology bundles. The results show that adoption decisions are most significantly influenced by off-farm labor supply.

AB Many community members reduce their community involvements as they move through midlife. This may be true for community psychologists as well. Yet research evidence suggests that-intellectually, at least-we can function at or near peak levels through our 80s and 90s. How then might we best sustain ourselves and our work through our entire lives? Answers may lie in full exercise of all capacities, in strong support networks, and in actions that meet one's deeper needs, ''the needs of the soul.'' These same principles may sustain community life as well, for some key principles of personal and community sustainability may be similar Applications of these ideas to communities and to community psychology are discussed.

AB Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) fibre can be used as a raw material for paper and textile production. A comprehensive research programme in the Netherlands has concluded that fibre hemp is a potentially profitable crop, having the right profile to fit into sustainable farming systems. This paper presents an appraisal of the crop physiological characteristics and the agronomic potential of hemp. Parameter values of basic crop physiological characteristics such as light interception potential, radiation use efficiency and dry matter partitioning coefficients are given. The effect of crop management decisions such as cultivar choice, sowing date, plant density, and harvest date on the value of these parameters is discussed. A simple crop growth model was used to assess the yield potential of hemp for the climate of the Netherlands. Calculations made for a non-stressed late-flowering hemp crop sown on 15 April and harvested on 15 September give a stem dry matter yield of 17.1 t ha(-1). The effects of advancing or delaying sowing or harvest date on stem yield were calculated. Crop physiological characteristics of hemp are compared to those of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.). Radiation use efficiency and dry matter partitioning coefficients of the two crops are similar. Base temperatures for development and growth are lower in hemp than in kenaf. In a temperate climate with cool springs, canopy establishment will be more rapid in hemp than in kenaf. Hemp seems an excellent candidate to fill the niche for an annual fibre crop in a temperate climate.

AB Many factors associated with welfare of animals kept under extensive conditions differs from those in intensive systems. Across Europe both the welfare of the animals and the sustainability of production are under pressure. This paper concentrates on Scottish hill sheep systems because they provide particularly powerful examples of links between welfare, sustainability and forces to further extensify production, These systems are currently extensive with relatively little daily care of stock, Lamb mortality is taken as an indicator of welfare within the flock. Links are described between level of nutrition of the pregnant ewe, supervision and nutrition during the period of lambing and level of lamb mortality, The impact of reductions in flock income upon the capacity to support fixed costs, particularly those of labour are discussed. In a worked example, a 30% reduction in both flock size and income would need a 74% reduction in fixed costs to achieve the same flock gross margin. Converting this to labour saving would increase sheep to shepherd ratio from 817:1 to 1485:1. The impact of this type of reduction on animal care is discussed. A model considering shepherding at lambing time at different densities of sheep clearly demonstrates how more extensive stocking rates during lambing dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the shepherd and the number of sheep he can provide close attention to during lambing, It is concluded that forces to extensify already extensive systems are likely to lead to possibilities of poorer welfare through reduced animal care. Conflict is predicted between policies which seek to reduce stocking rates for environmental reasons and those that in combination achieve social and animal welfare objectives by attempting to maintain labour.

AB Public attitudes to extensive livestock husbandry systems are favourable and welfare is perceived to be good primarily because animals are free to express their normal behaviour patterns. In many cases, such as agroforestry, this conclusion is fully justified. Nevertheless, there are a number of welfare issues confronting extensive farming, Identification procedures must be non-injurious and those causing suffering (such as fire-branding) should not be used. Steps should be taken to reduce the incidence of parturition problems and, when this is not feasible, the animals should be appropriately supervised. In the case of procedures where public opinion is unfavourable, but scientific assessments suggests that suffering is minimal or readily avoided improved dissemination of information is required. Examples of such problems include velvet removal from male deer, transport of deer and tail-docking in lambs. There is a need to develop integrated measures of welfare that take account of longevity, disease, reproductive success, nutritional and thermal challenges, pain and behavioural freedom. Only with the help of such measures can acceptable practices be defended, unacceptable systems be phased out and the consumer be assured that extensive farming is animal friendly. Extensive farming systems are sustainable only where public attitudes are positive and appropriate premiums can be justified so that the systems remain viable.

AB Humans have selected animals which are more suited for food production or other purposes, since the process of domestication of livestock began, whether this selection was done knowingly or unknowingly. The deliberate selection of improved breeds and strains has been a particularly important feature of agriculture in the last couple of centuries, especially in the industrialised countries. For most of this period, selection has been based on subjective assessment of the merits of animals, but objective tools for selection (e.g. performance recording and statistical methods for evaluation of genetic merit) have become widely used in the last few decades. These tools have been used to a large extent in pig, poultry and dairy cattle breeding, but to a much lesser extent in the beef cattle and sheep breeds common in extensive production systems, However, these extensive systems themselves have changed to a much lesser extent than those in which pigs and poultry are kept, Hence there have been opportunities for natural selection for traits conferring better adaptation to these environments. Additionally there has been some subjective selection for traits thought to confer better adaptation. There is considerable scope for wider uptake of existing objective methods of genetic improvement in the harsher areas of the UK, and elsewhere, However, these methods are likely to be more effective if the genetics of traits conferring adaptation to harsh environments are better understood, and if the most important of these traits are included in the breeding goal, Traits conferring better adaptation may include physical attributes such as litter size, fleece type and the ability to store body fat, some aspects of behaviour, especially maternal and grazing behaviour, and disease resistance, A better understanding of the relationships between production traits and these adaptation traits will also be critical for the development of appropriate, sustainable breeding programmes, This approach should reduce the risk of there being detrimental correlated effects of selection, and may provide opportunities to improve animal welfare.

AB The historical development of the civil nuclear power generation industry is examined in the light of the need to meet conflicting energy-supply and environmental pressures over recent decades. It is suggested that fission (thermal and fast) reactors will dominate the market up to the period 2010-2030, with fusion being relegated to the latter part of the twenty-first century. A number of issues affecting the use of nuclear electricity generation in Western Europe are considered including its cost, industrial strategy needs, and the public acceptability of nuclear power, The contribution of nuclear power stations to achieving CO2 targets aimed at relieving global warming is discussed in the context of alternative strategies for sustainable development, including renewable energy sources and energy-efficiency measures, Trends in the generation of nuclear electricity from fission reactors are finally considered in terms of the main geopolitical groupings that make up the world in the mid-1990s. Several recent, but somewhat conflicting, forecasts of the role of nuclear power in the fuel mix to about 2020 are reviewed. It is argued that the only major expansion in generating capacity will take place on the Asia-Pacific Rim and not in the developing countries generally. Nevertheless, the global nuclear industry overall will continue to be dominated by a small number of large nuclear electricity generating countries; principally the USA, France and Japan.

AB Sustainable cropping systems rely on a minimum of external inputs. In these systems N is largely acquired in animal manures and leguminous green manures. Little is known of how these organic forms of N fertilizer influence the presence and activity of free-living N-2-fixing bacteria. High concentrations of inorganic N in soil inhibit N-2-fixation in cyanobacteria and Azotobacter spp. It is likely that manure and fertilizer applications would result in concentrations of inorganic N capable of inhibiting N-2 fixation and, ultimately, the presence of these organisms. We investigated the effect of synthetic and organic N fertilizer sources on the populations and N-2-fixation potential of free-living N-2-fixing bacteria in the Farming Systems Trial at the Rodale Research Institute. Field plots received the following N treatments prior to corn (Zea mays L.) production: (1) Legume rotations and green manures supplying about 165 kg N ha(-1); (2) beef cattle manure applied at a rate of 220 kg N ha(-1) (plus 60 kg N ha(-1) from 1994 hay plow-down); or (3) fertilizer N (urea and NH4NO3) applied at a rate of 145 kg N ha(-1). Soil samples were collected at two depths from corn plots four times during the growing season, and analyzed for soil moisture, soil pH, numbers of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria and Azotobacter spp., extractable NH4+ and NO3-, and potentially mineralizable N. Soil samples collected in mid-July were analyzed for nitrogenase activity (by C2H2 reduction) and total C and N. Populations of Azotobacter spp. and cyanobacteria were influenced only slightly by treatment; however, cyanobacteria species composition was notably influenced by treatment. Nitrogenase activity in surface soils was greatest in legume-N plots and in subsurface plots levels were greatest in fertilizer-N plots. Populations and activity of free-living N-fixing bacteria appeared to be somewhat reduced in all plots as a result of low soil pH levels and high concentrations of inorganic N across all treatments. Annual applications of N to all plots resulted in high levels of potentially mineralizable N that in turn may have reduced non-symbiotic N-2-fixation in all plots.

AB Since the accident in Seveso, the subject ''dioxin'' is in the debate. The policy concepts of additive environment protection and product/process integrated environment protection are exemplified by the dioxin production in combustion processes. Both policies are justified, as waste combustion, in particular, shows. The meaning of the notions source and sink are defined for persistent chemicals. It is attempted to make clear, what ''Sustainable Development'', the guideline of the Rio conference, means for dioxin policy.

DT Article
AB The fundamental feature common to colonial cities in sub-Saharan Africa was the separation of 'European neighborhoods' from 'African villages'. Residential separation has survived in post-colonial periods even though major changes have taken place in the racial composition of African urban populations. From the standpoint of sustainable urban development, this paper aims to point out the problems this continuing residential separation poses to planners and decision-makers. It is argued that urban economies and societies in sub-Saharan Africa cannot be strengthened unless the two segments of African cities are physically and socially unified.

AB Given that many of the original deciduous forests of North America have disappeared over the last few centuries, our challenge is to preserve remnant forests, restore altered forests, and harvest managed forests in a sustainable manner. To do so, we need to identify macroscale properties that can easily monitor the condition of the eastern deciduous forest as a whole. We offer 10 possible properties: (1) tree size; (2) canopy composition; (3) quantity and quality of coarse woody debris; (4) number of spring ephemeral species in the herbaceous layer; (5) number of typical corticulous bryophyte species; (6) density of wildlife trees; (7) fungi; (8) avian community; (9) number of large carnivores; and (10) forest area. We have assigned to each property a control (or normal) value, an intermediate value, and a heavily altered value. These values are based on the existing literature. These 10 properties would: (1) allow us to recognize, rank, and protect high-priority forest sites for conservation; (2) tell us whether changes in a forest are in the direction of restoration or toward further alteration; and (3) enable us to evaluate different harvesting methods so we can select those that cause the least alteration to forests.

AB Throughout the last three decades of working on environmental and resource problems I have encountered three persistent myths: (1) environment conflicts with employment; (2) production must grow to create scope for financing environmental conservation; and (3) although society would like to save the environment, it is too expensive. Testing these three propositions, individually and mutually, leads to the conclusion that as long as they dominate the environmental debate, the world will drift ever further away from environmental sustainability.

AB A systematic framework of indicators for sustainability is presented. In our approach there is an emphasis on societal activities that affect nature and on the internal societal resource use, as opposed to environmental quality indicators. In this way the indicators may give a warning signal to an unsustainable use of resources early in the chain from causes in societal activities to environmental effects. The aim is that these socio-ecological indicators shall serve as a tool in planning and decision-making processes at various administrative levels in society. The formulation of the indicators is made with respect to four principles of sustainability, which lead to four complementary sets of indicators. The first deals with the societal use of lithospheric material. The second deals with emissions of compounds produced in society. The third set of indicators concerns societal manipulation of nature and the long-term productivity of ecosystems. Finally, the fourth set deals with the efficiency of the internal societal resource use, which includes indicators for a just distribution of resources.

AB This paper offers an ecologically-based view of land and land value, building upon the multiproduct nature of ecosystems and upon landscape ecology, The paper questions the ability of markets to create optimal landscapes, even when traditional methods of internalizing externalities are applied, and concludes that attempting a complete valuation of ecosystems is quixotic. Achieving sustainable landscapes requires both sufficient ecological knowledge and institutions capable of overcoming landscape-scale market failure. Accordingly, the paper examines forms of public and private ownership in the United States to assess how well particular institutional conditions might facilitate ecological adaptation there.

ID PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; QUALITY; WATERS
AB In Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe, small-scale pond farming and experimental cage-culture of Tilapia fishes have been running for some years and there are now plans for large-scale aquaculture. As a basis for deciding on how aquaculture could be developed to improve the chances for sustainable resource use and long-term maximised fish production in the lake, we compare the potential ecological life-support demand of two alternative aquaculture methods. First, the economic and ecological resource demand, expressed in industrial and solar energy units, respectively, were estimated for semi-intensive pond farming and intensive cage farming. Next, the ecosystem areas appropriated by the two farms for production of feed, oxygen, and phosphorus assimilation were estimated. Our estimates indicate that intensive cage farming would require about 17 800 MJ solar energy (Gross Primary Production) to produce 1 kg of fish. The industrial energy input would be more than 1.5-times higher (about 85 MJ/kg) compared to semi-intensive pond farming (about 50 MJ/kg). Intensive cage farming must be supported by ecosystem areas that are all substantially larger than the area of the farm itself. The ecosystem area for feed production is the largest (21000 m(2) m(-2)), but the areas required for oxygen production (160 m(2) m(-2)) and nutrient assimilation (115 m(2) m(-2)) are of special importance since they must be located close to the farm. For semi-intensive pond farming, oxygen production and nutrient assimilation could probably be provided within the pond system, and no external life support from Lake Kariba would be needed. At least from an ecological point of view, semi-intensive pond farming is more sustainable than intensive cage farming because it needs a smaller input of external resources to survive. However, a moderate level of intensive cage farming should not be ruled out in Lake Kariba. Aquaculture has potential to become successful in Lake Kariba, but only if it is developed within a linked economic, social, and ecological framework.

AB The objective of this paper is to test for the sustainability of the current account deficits in the United States and Canada over the 1973-1994 period. Using various unit root and cointegration tests, some of which allow for structural changes, we conclude that the real current account-deficits-to-GDP ratios are not sustainable.

TI Evolution and origin of the ground fissures in Xian, China
SO ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Large-scale extraction of ground water in Xian has resulted in significant drawdown of the phreatic surface and in land subsidence across this ancient capital of China. It has also triggered the rejuvenation of the normal faults in the upper portions of the Quaternary deposits underlying the city, leading to surface rupturing and the development of ground fissure zones across the city. These ground fissure zones are structurally controlled in the sense that they are directly linked to the normal faults in the Quaternary deposits, all trending in an east-northeasterly direction. In essence, they are the surface expressions of the deeper faults under current drawdown conditions. The ground fissures have resulted in extensive property damage along their paths of propagation. This paper describes their occurrence, their possible causative mechanism and the resultant damage. Of necessity, Xian will still be dependent on ground water supply to a large extent in the years ahead. However, ground water extraction will have to be managed in an environmentally sustainable manner, in order to minimize the geological hazards associated with the ground fissures.

AB The application of the precautionary principle to an area of environmental protection, such as nature conservation, requires commitment to the idea that full scientific proof of a causal link between a potentially damaging operation and a long term environmental impact is not required. Adoption of the principle in Government statements related to sustainable development should therefore be seen in this context. The paper addresses the particular case of marine fish farming in Scotland where the principle was advocated but not upheld in practice. In the light of this experience there is a need for educators and philosophers, ethicists and concerned scientists to ensure that the principle is more widely interpreted and understood.

AB Soil and foliar nutrition, crown condition, and wood growth were measured in three mature sugar maple stands in northern Vermont before and after fertilization with base cations (107 kg ha(-1) K, 53 kg ha(-1) Ca and 11 kg ha(-1) Mg) with or without 3000 kg ha(-1) supplemental lime in order to test the effectiveness of such treatments in ameliorating base cation deficiencies in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). Pre-fertilization analyses indicated multiple cation deficiencies in these stands, since foliar K, Ca and Mg were all near or below sufficiency standards suggested for sugar maple, Fertilization with cations in addition to liming elevated soil pH from 3.6 to 4.5 in the first year after treatment, and elevated soil pH was maintained over two additional growing seasons along with significantly improved soil Ca and decreased soil Al. Foliar K, Ca and P concentrations were all significantly improved (P < 0.05) compared with controls for the three growing seasons following the first treatment, while only foliar K concentration showed significant improvement in plots treated with the base cation fertilizer without lime. By the third growing season following treatment, trees in limed plots had significantly less crown dieback than controls or trees in plots treated with the base cation fertilizer alone. Diameter growth showed marginal improvement in the plots treated with cations, annual. diameter growth increased 200% compared with controls in the limed plots, Despite these positive results, the long term contribution of increased soil pH and soil calcium to soil nutrient pools and root distribution remains to be determined, as does the sustainability of growth increases, We conclude that in northern Vermont sugar maple stands on relatively infertile podzols with low pH, base cation limitations may be especially important in controlling sugar maple tree health or growth, while fertilization to ameliorate base cation deficiencies may be effective only at relatively high base cation addition rates.

DE sustainability; forestry economics; ecosystem management
ID DIVERSITY; POLICY
AB Concerns about the sustainability of forest resources and ecosystems have been expressed almost from the beginning of modern studies of forest management by ecologists, biologists, economists, and other specialists, However, the focus of this concern has gone through several transformations, Environmental scientists have emphasized the maintenance of forest ecosystems in the face of different types of human intervention. Economists and forest managers, on the other hand, have emphasized the capacity of forest systems to provide valued ongoing flows of goods and services for human societies,
   This paper takes stock of forest resource and ecosystem sustainability from both ecological and economic perspectives. It seeks to identify how these disciplinary perspectives contribute to a better understanding of sustainability, and where the most significant conceptual and factual gaps are found. Of particular interest are two related themes: how economic efficiency and sustainability may differ in their implications for forest system management, and how criteria for forest system sustainability are related to the scale of management decisions (e.g., individual forest site versus region versus the global biosphere).

AB 1. Whether food intake is determined by the maximum rate at which animals can collect food, or by the rate at which this food can be processed, will strongly affect the organization of their behaviour. We investigated whether the digestive system imposes a constraint on (I) instantaneous rate of food acquisition, (2) total daily food consumption and (3) sustainable maximum energy expenditure in the Oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus. We measured the rate of food processing in captive birds from the cumulative loss of body mass after the consumption of various amounts of mussels, Mytilus edulis.
   2, Mass loss associated with the digestion of food can be conveniently described by a three-parameter model. These parameters are: (1) latency time, the time interval that elapses between the ingestion of the first food item and the production of the first elapses (28.3 min), (2) evacuation rare, the rate with which digested fod is defecated (0.233 g min(-1)) and (3) absorption coefficient, the proportion of the food (fresh mass) which is not defecated (11.3%). The value of all three parameters was independent of the amount of food consumed,
   3, Since the birds absorbed 11.3% of the food, the rate of food processing is slightly higher than the evacuation rate and amounts to 0.263 g min(-1).
   4. Given the energy content of the food (3.58 kJ g(-1) fresh mass) and an assimilation efficiency of 85.4%, the instantaneous rate of energy assimilation is 13.4 W.
   5. An 80-g food storage capacity in the oesophagus enables the bird to continue digestion during most of the high-water roosting period. Consequently, the maximum amount of energy that can be assimilated during a 24-h day with two low-water feeding periods amounts to 1067 ELT, which equals 4.25 times the basal metabolic rare. This figure probably reflects the maximum sustained working level.
   6. Free-living Oystercatchers collect food much faster than they are able to process it. A digestive bottleneck forces them to interrupt their feeding at regular intervals, even when they attempt to collect the maximum amount of food that can be dealt with by the digestive tract. The main implication of such a digestive bottleneck is that a considerable amount of time becomes available for activities other than feeding. In practice, mast of this spare time is spent inactive and we will point out how some evolutionary oddities, such as laziness and individual differences in prey preferences, may have evolved as by-products of a digestive bottleneck.

AB This paper reinterrogates key aspects of social theory-realist and regulationist approaches-in order to develop a conceptual framework within which thinking on sustainable development can be progressed. A modified realist approach and insights from regulation theory are used to consider how the development of the Australian sugar industry has been conditioned in ways which make unsustainable outcomes the norm and how this conditioning might be reversed.

AB This paper examines recent debate concerning the concepts of 'sustainable knowledge' and 'hybridity' in environmental research. Hybrid studies employ local, indigenous knowledge alongside global, scientific techniques to achieve guidelines for sustainable development. The paper discusses the value of indigenous knowledge in testing theories of environmental degradation, and the problems of overcoming socio-political constructions of environmental problems over wide time and space scales, as identified by Regional Political Ecology. The paper focuses on the so-called theory of Himalayan environmental degradation and illustrates the study with a case from northern Thailand. In Thailand, upland shifting cultivators are blamed for causing lowland sedimentation and water shortages, and have been considered by lowland communities to lack awareness of environmental degradation. The study used indigenous knowledge alongside GIS analysis and the Caesium-137 technique for measuring soil erosion to test the assumptions that land shortage has increased cultivation on steeper slopes, and that erosion is a problem for upland degradation. This is the first time these new techniques have been used in testing assumptions related to Himalayan degradation. Results indicated that upland farmers deliberately avoid erosion by increasing frequency of cultivation of flatter slopes rather than steeper slopes, and consequently the problem of erosion is overstated. However, this does not imply that their local knowledge is useful over larger areas, but instead shows the adaptability of local communities and their awareness of environmental risk. It is therefore argued that developing effective management techniques depends on differentiating more clearly between locally-based knowledge about environmental processes; politically-constructed statements about the environmental impacts of other groups; and falsifiable scientific assertions aiming to develop effective management techniques with reference to several communities.

AB Resistance to nematode parasites can be improved by selection, but efforts to include appropriate traits in commercial Livestock breeding programs are only a recent development. Procedures for including resistance in breeding programs are similar to those involving other traits. The steps are described with special reference to sheep, and areas are highlighted where particular considerations exist. Three approaches are described and contrasted: breeding for resistance (reduced parasite numbers, as determined by faecal worm egg count); resilience (production during parasitism); or number of treatments required during parasitism. It is necessary, but difficult, to assess the economic benefits of improving resistance relative to other traits. Disease costs vary widely depending on the prevalence of the disease and on the availability, effectiveness and sustainability of alternative control measures. Costs of treatment and control are relatively simple to estimate for a given situation, but production losses are more difficult. Methods of dealing with this problem are discussed. Breeding for disease resistance usually requires that either selection candidates, or their relatives, are exposed to the pathogen so that resistance levels can be compared. Parasitic diseases generally create no special ethical problems in a breeding program unless natural challenge levels are insufficient to enable discrimination between hosts in their susceptibility. In the longer term, it is desirable that selection criteria for all major diseases be developed that will be informative in healthy animals. Molecular genetic markers offer promise, but simple genetic markers have so far been as elusive as physiological traits to predict resistance in undiseased animals. In the longer term, useful genetic markers will be found and techniques for combining these with phenotypic information need to be developed. Commercial breeding programs for sheep which include resistance to gastrointestinal roundworms are now operating in Australia and New Zealand, and issues related to breeding in the tropics are discussed.

AB Approaches to the control of fasciolosis in ruminants are compared for developed countries, and for developing countries with particular reference to regions growing irrigated rice. In all environments problem definition and investigation are based on one or more of observation, abattoir surveys, faecal egg counts, tracer animals and snail studies. In developed countries each husbandman grazes a large number of animals, controls access to pasture and water, and markets high value products. Strategic and tactical treatments control fasciolosis in these circumstances and will continue to do so while anthelmintics remain effective. In many developing countries subsistence families possess small numbers of animals, feed and water sources are shared by many families, and the products are mainly draft power, fertiliser and meat for local consumption. Consequently the agricultural cycle, and the Life cycles of the parasite and intermediate host, are closely interrelated and there is some scope for controlling infection by modifying husbandry practices. Anthelmintics are not affordable. Recent observations of a major fasciola resistance gene with substantial dominance, in Indonesian Thin Tail sheep infected with Fasciola gigantica, suggest that parasite control by breed substitution, or cross-breeding and selection, is feasible. Such control would be inexpensive to implement, and sustainable. Copyright (C) 1996 Australian Society for Parasitology. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Interest in ways of raising stock without using anthelmintics has been stimulated by the desire for intensive grazing systems to adopt more sustainable methods of internal parasite control and by potential premiums for ''organic'' produce. This requires grazing management systems which are practicable and achieve levels of parasite control sufficient to meet realistic production objectives. This paper will summarise 3 years experience of lamb and cattle production without a recourse to anthelmintics on 2 production systems: a mixed cropping, lamb finishing, and cattle rearing unit and an all grass, mixed-stock, hill country unit in which all non-replacement lambs are sold at weaning. On both units parasite control was almost entirely dependent on integrated grazing management of sheep and cattle and strict systems of grazing management had to be rigidly applied. Acceptable productivity could be more readily achieved in sheep than cattle. Rams selected for resistance to nematodes were also used in both sheep flocks. Their influence on lamb production was equivocal. There is a need for more information on factors influencing parasite epidemiology and for consideration of strategies other than alternate grazing. The impact of pasture species on parasite epidemiology needs to be clarified. Current research indicates substantial differences between grasses in terms of parasite burdens acquired and production losses suffered by lambs grazing them. Grazing management may need to vary with pasture species. Also, specialty forage crops, particularly those containing condensed tannins (i.e. Hedysarum coronarium, Lotus pedunculatus and Lotus corniculatus) hold special promise as a means of countering parasite-induced production losses and dagginess. Using biological control of free-living larval stages and vaccination, may in the long term, also prove useful. Developing effective and acceptable systems for raising stock without using anthelmintics presents a considerable challenge, to parasitologists, as well as to plant breeders, agronomists, and farming systems researchers.

AB Novel parasite control methods are considered under criteria of efficacy, cost, ease of implementation and sustainability, together with a subjective assessment of when they are likely to become available commercially. It is concluded that vaccines, genetically resistant hosts, biological control, anthelmintics directed against free-living stages, and grazing management will probably satisfy all of these criteria, but that most of these methods are at least 5-10 years away from commercial exploitation. The exception is grazing management, which can be used immediately and at low cost, to minimise current use of anthelmintics. Research is required to assess the possibility of control programs based on grazing management that avoid anthelmintic treatment altogether. Extension of such control programs, in a context of declining government enthusiasm for provision of agricultural extension services, may be their greatest barrier to widespread adoption.

AB Soil was sampled from cropping fields in radial patterns from beneath Acacia albida, Parkia bigloboza (Jacq.) Benth. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. near Zaria, Nigeria. Results of analysis show a significant coarsening of soil texture and a decrease in organic matter and cation exchange capacity with increasing distance from all three tree species at a depth of 0-15 cm. Concentrations of nitrogen and some exchangeable cations decreased significantly with increasing distance from beneath acacia and parkia, and soil pH decreased with increasing distance from eucalyptus. The implication of the results for land management are discussed in relation to increasing productivity and soil use sustainability. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB We investigated the changes that occurred in basal and noradrenaline-induced metabolic rate, body temperature and body mass in short-tailed field voles, Microtus agrestis, during exposure to naturally increasing photoperiod and ambient temperature. These parameters were first measured in winter-acclimatized voles (n = 8) and then in the same voles which had been allowed to seasonally acclimatize to photoperiod and ambient temperature (6 months later), Noradrenaline induced metabolic rate, basal metabolic rate and nonshivering thermogenesis were significantly higher in winter-acclimatized compared to summer-acclimatized voles. There was a significant positive relationship between basal metabolic rate and noradrenaline-induced metabolic rate. Body mass was significantly higher in summer-acclimatized compared to winter-acclimatized voles. There was a significant positive relationship between body mass and noradrenaline-induced metabolic rate in both winter-acclimatized and summer-acclimatized voles; however, there was no relationship between basal metabolic rate and body mass in either seasonal group of voles. Body temperature after measurements of basal metabolic rate was not significantly different in the seasonal cohorts of voles. However, body temperature was significantly higher in winter-acclimatized compared to summer-acclimatized voles after injection of noradrenaline. Previously we have found that a long photoperiod was not a sufficient stimulus to reduce thermogenic capacity in winter-acclimatized voles during cold exposure, since basal metabolic rate increased to compensate for a reduction in regulatory nonshivering thermogenesis. Here we found that a combination of increased ambient temperature and photoperiod did significantly reduce thermogenic capacity in winter-acclimatized voles. This provided evidence that the two aspects of non-shivering thermogenesis, obligatory and regulatory, are stimulated by different exogenous cues. Summer acclimatization in the short-tailed field vole is manifest as a significant decrease in both basal and noradrenaline-induced metabolic rate, combined with a significant increase in body mass.

AB The reduction of the waste of raw materials at source using clean technologies, recycling, and good. house-keeping has considerable benefits for both the environment and industry. A demonstration project on wastewater minimization. was completed in. 1995 in the Aire and Calder catchments of West Yorkshire. The findings indicated cost savings for eleven firms of over pound 3 million/annum and further opportunities which, when implemented, could realize another pound 1 million/annum. The reduction in the amount of wastewater discharged either to sewer or river was 27%, with a potential to increase to over 40%. The payback period for 63% of the waste minimization opportunities is less than one year and many involve only a small initial investment. Waste minimization when widely adopted has prospects for cutting industry's costs, reducing demand for water and reducing :he volume of effluent produced.

AB Regulatory pressures arising from the deterioration in the earth's environment have forced firms to incorporate sustainable policies into their strategic planning. One approach to doing sustainable business is to build an environmentally friendly portfolio matrix. This article provides a theoretical framework for formulating a sustainable corporate environmental strategy based on the portfolio approach. The environmentally friendly portfolio matrix is a modification of the traditional product portfolio matrix and combines Environmental Attractiveness with Market Attractiveness. This approach can be used as an analytical tool for both products and strategic business units. Analysing cases of Indian firms in petrochemicals, agrochemicals and other sectors provides evidence that some firms have successfully followed this approach. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

TI Integrated flexibility - Key to competition in a turbulent environment
SO LONG RANGE PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Markets have become global, with competition and pressure arising from various sources and with increasing rapidity. The competitive reality of the 1990s takes for granted many of the old concerns such as quality and low costs as mere starting points in the struggle for survival rather than as an agenda upon which competitive advantage can be built. Faster product development, shorter lead times spanning entire business operations from purchasing and production through to distribution and final consumption are likely to underpin benchmarks for future success. This article considers how to build a platform to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. In particular it considers integration and flexibility and relevant issues when trying to achieve a successful marriage between the two seemingly opposing concepts. We examine the nature of Serco Systems Ltd as a successful operating company of Serco pie and use its experience to illustrate the route to 'integrated flexibility'. The authors propose that an integrated flexibility format allows the bundling together of complex generic strategies in which complex combinations such as pursuit of quality, service and price competitiveness can be successfully followed simultaneously.

ID LANDSCAPE CHANGE; KHUMBU
AB Results of a 1991 field investigation of the nature and extent of historical and contemporary human disturbance in the upper Barun valley, Makatu-Barun National Park and Conservation Area, Nepal, are presented. Forest structure, soils, pollen analysis, C-14 dating of buried wood samples, historical documents, and contemporary land-use trends of herders and mountaineering/trekking groups were assessed. Historical religious texts suggest that pilgrims may have been visiting sacred sires in the valley since the 14th century. Genealogical records indicate that regular seasonal grazing may have commenced in the 17th century with the easterly migration of the Sherpa people from the Solukhumbu region. Results of pollen analysis and C-14 dating suggest that historical anthropogenic disturbances in a dynamic environment, including the possibility of regular burning in a presumed attempt to increase pasture area, could have played significant roles in modifying the upper Barun valley landscapes. A corridor of disturbance related to contemporary indigenous and tourist use (tree harvesting, burning, grazing) was observed along the main valley trail, and impacts appeared to be growing in frequency and magnitude;Increased monitoring of these impacts is recommended, and priority research areas are identified. Support for, and monitoring of, existing park management policies which seek to recognize the rights of traditional users are also suggested as providing the most promising mechanisms for the sustainable conservation of the upper Barun valley's unique physical, cultural, and spiritual attributes.

AB H-mode operation presents challenges for ITER and for reactor application in the areas of performance, accessibility, sustainability and divertor compatibility. Some issues are more severe for ITER, while others are more problematic for an economic fusion reactor producing 3 MW m(-2) of neutron flux to its walls. The problems that are more severe for ITER include the power requirements for the H-mode, and confinement uncertainties. Problems which are more severe for a reactor include capability for high beta* operation, the role of the Greenwald density limit, and divertor compatibility. Within the present ITER concept, it would be very helpful to have a well defined upgrade path for the auxiliary heating systems, including options for strong profile control. The world fusion research programme should maintain a major focus on improving the reactor compatibility of the H-mode, with an eye to the special advantages of H-mode plasmas with strong shaping.

ID WALKING
AB Comparisons were made between the Intelligent Prosthesis pneumatic swing phase control damping systems on the same prosthesis worn by a high level trans-femoral amputee. Speeds self selected by corridor walking (4.3 - 5.5 kmh(-1)) sustainable fur treadmill Comfortable speeds were attained when the subject walked on a treadmill at 2.0, 2.6 and 3.2 kmh(-1) in two tests fur each prosthesis type, Oxygen uptake (VO2), cadence and heart rate were measured over 5 minute walks interspersed with rest periods.
   Spearman's correlation was used to test for differences between prosthesis types at each speed. At the two slower speeds no significant difference was found, but al the higher speed of 3.2 kmh(-1), the IP was associated with a significantly lower VO2 (p<0.05). A two way analysis of variance with replication (ANOVA) demonstrated a significant difference between VO2 for different limb types (p=0.115). A square law function was fitted to the mean VO2 Tor each prosthesis type by the method of least squares regression. ANOVA demonstrated a significant difference between velocity coefficients for the different prosthesis types (p<0.05). Cadence was almost constant during the period of each walk, varying by 1 step min(-1) at most, However the test-retest differences in cadence were considerable.
   It is concluded that there was little difference in energy expenditure between prosthesis types al slower speeds, but at higher speeds (double right arrow 3.2km h(-1)) the IP gave a lower oxygen uptake by about 10%.

DE lifecycle assessment; recycling; economic valuation; waste management
AB Recycling is widely assumed to be environmentally beneficial, although the collection, sorting and processing of materials into new products also entails significant environmental impacts. This study compares the relative environmental impacts of a recycling system (incorporating the kerbside collection of recyclable materials and their subsequent use by manufacturers), with a waste disposal system (in which the waste is disposed to landfill and primary raw materials are used in manufacture), using the technique of lifecycle assessment. The methodology is then extended to incorporate an economic evaluation of the environmental impacts. This combination of lifecycle assessment and economic evaluation can be termed 'Lifecycle Evaluation'. Lifecycle assessment quantifies and evaluates the environmental impacts of a product from the acquisition of raw materials, through manufacture and use, to final disposal. Lifecycle assessment can also provide a framework for the analysis of environmental impacts from systems such as transport, or waste management, as demonstrated in this paper. The results, for a case study of Milton Keynes in Central England, show that the recycling system generally performs better than the waste disposal system in terms of contribution to global warming, acidification effects and nutrification of surface water. An alternative method of analysis is then used, in which an economic valuation of the environmental impacts is carried out. This produces net benefits for recycling, per tonne of material, of pound 1769 for aluminium, pound 238 for steel, pound 226 for paper and pound 188 for glass, and net costs of pound 2.57 for high density polyethylene (HDPE), pound 4.10 for poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) and pound 7.28 for poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET). It is concluded that lifecycle evaluation, the combination of lifecycle assessment and economic valuation, can be applied to a variety of waste management issues such as the appraisal of alternative methods of collection for recycling or an examination of the UK waste management hierarchy. This technique allows impacts to be expressed in homogenous units, and the inclusion of social and environmental impacts that would not normally be addressed within a lifecycle assessment. The approach would also facilitate the evaluation of environmental and social effects at a local level, which are particularly crucial to the success of community recycling schemes. Lifecycle evaluation could provide a powerful tool to aid the development of sustainable waste management and recycling policy.

AB Sustainable development is now an established part of the rhetoric of government policy In Scottish tourism this has been expressed through an initiative on tourism and the environment. Yet Scottish tourism may be more readily associated with scenery, nostalgia and a 'tartan' heritage. This paper discusses the potential for sustainable tourism to become but another part of the touristic portfolio of myths.

AB Current approaches to the regulation of fisheries revolve around attempts to police biologically defined limits. Such approaches are inappropriate and unsuccessful. The inbuilt tendencies of the fishing industry will be to transgress such limits and to perpetuate a condition of unsustainability. Using insights from realism and regulation theory, the paper explores the causes of unsustainability and seeks to demonstrate the need for fisheries policy to target the structures and mechanisms that underlie the tendency for unsustainability.

AB With the collapse of several important fish stocks in recent decades, fisheries have witnessed the limits to productionist strategies of exploitation and stand in need of a more sustainable basis for their future development. Using theoretical constructs from Gramsci and Bourdieu, the paper examines Norwegian fisheries for evidence of sustainable development. It concludes that while the Barents cod crisis provoked a more realistic emergency strategy, the necessary political alliances and consensus approach to sustainable development have not yet been established.

AB High seas fisheries have become an important focus for concern. The failure to impose order in areas of international jurisdiction threatens the viability of the coastal states' attempts to manage resources within their 200 mile limits. The paper analyses the nature of high seas fisheries in the light of different property regimes. It suggests that the new regime, created in the 1990s largely as a result of the UN Conference on Straddling Stocks and Highly Migratory Species, effectively extends the influence of the coastal state into international waters and expresses reservations that effective management cannot be achieved without due respect for the concept of the commons.

AB The development of sustainable fisheries is more likely to emerge where management is legitimated through the integration of the fishing industry in the policy process. Go-management, where responsibility is shared between the state and the user groups, offers a persuasive theoretical model but is difficult to envisage when refracted through the institutional and political cultures of the UK. The paper examines the opportunities and constraints for the delegation of management. functions to fishermen's organizations and attempts to chart a possible course towards the development of co-management in the UK.

AB Fisheries management by individual transferable catch quotas is being promoted as an idea basis for sustainable development in the fisheries. In Iceland, where ITQs have been introduced along with other free marker oriented policies, quota holdings ?re being concentrated on trawler companies and there has lately been a major build-up of offshore fishing capacity, The inshore fleet is being reduced, and many fishing communities are suffering from substantial loss of quota shares. The distributional effects of ITQ management are extensive, and it may be called into question whether the Icelandic fisheries are moving towards sustainable development.

AB Sustainable development refers to an inherently precarious situation in which growth is thought to be enduring, while also compatible with what a finite resource can support. In Newfoundland the fishery has proved unsustainable. The paper examines the circumstances underlying the collapse of the cod fishery in 1992 which gave rise to widespread unemployment throughout the region. It suggests that sustainable development based on fisheries resources is too insecure for the people of regions that depend on them, but this does not mean that a fishery cannot be sustained at some level.

AB The paper examines the ways in which fishing families in Lofoten responded to the cod crisis occurring at the end of the 1980s and to the changes in the regime of fisheries management. It asks whether the fishing population has experienced sustainable development. The vantage point is the study of household strategies in response to hostile changes in their environment, focusing on women's roles within the fishing households. Four strategies are identified: expansion, diversification, retrenchment and withdrawal and the study indicates that the apparently 'successful' Norwegian management regime has resulted in greater instability and uncertainty for coastal communities in Lofoten and has pur the coastal culture under great pressure. It has not resulted in social and cultural forms of sustainable development for the coastal population.

AB The paper assesses the criteria for the success of British urban policy initiatives and concludes that they are too short term, In the search for a long-term measure of success, the paper examines the process of development of new property markets. The concept of sustainable markets is proposed as the ultimate goal of urban policy, To explore the creation of sustainable markets, the paper charts the development of a city-centre housing market in Glasgow created by the Merchant City policy initiative instigated at the beginning of the 1980s, The establishment of new local markets is shown to be a long-term process requiring a period of sustained resale/reletting market activity, The conclusion drawn is that the government has underestimated both the funds required for and the time-dimension to sustainable urban regeneration.

AB An overview and analysis of the current status of information technology (IT) and its role in animal health research and development (R&D) projects in developing countries have been undertaken. This study is based mainly, but not exclusively, on the Nigerian situation and experience, which are considered to be typical of those in the majority of developing countries where IT is still in its infancy, and few individuals and institutions engaged in R&D projects have access to computing and modem, reliable telecommunications facilities. The analysis has emphasised the following: the limited impact of IT on large-scale field projects; the major factors militating against its successful acquisition, application and transfer; short- and long-term needs and priorities for IT; IT inputs for effective implementation of field projects and exchange of R&D information. Of the numerous factors which have hindered the growth and transfer of IT in much of the developing world, the most important are: (1) weak science and technology (S&T) base; (2) shortage of highly skilled front-line scientists, technologists and information professionals; (3) inadequate financial resources. Experience gained from three field projects highlighted the fact that although IT inputs, such as computers, are vital for the efficient management and rapid communication of research information, careful planning of projects, adequate financial and logistic support, availability of skilled manpower and basic infrastructural facilities are indispensable for the effective utilisation of the inputs. A promising and cost-effective method of transfer of IT inputs to those countries which can hardly afford them at present is through the establishment of institutional research links between developed and developing countries. Successful partnerships usually provide, among other things, computing facilities and manpower training for the latter and opportunity for genuine research collaboration. This form of IT transfer is an important step towards increased application of IT inputs in R&D projects, creation of the much needed inventory of databases and information systems on animal health projects in developing countries. Only then can meaningful exchange of R&D information, in an acceptable format and at affordable price. be realised within and between them. A possible role is envisaged for the major international organisations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the United Nations Educational. Scientific and Cultural Organization in ensuring the success and sustainability of these developments.

AB The topic of deforestation is seldom examined from the perspective of prices and responses to resource scarcity. This omission creates important errors in policy. Resource scarcity induces investments-in both commercial and subsistence uses of the forest once prices overcome the costs of establishing property rights, forest management, and the returns from alternative agricultural uses of the land. Therefore deforestation will induce price increases and investments in forestry well before deforestation attains its physical limit. These prices and costs will alter the boundaries among several important classes of forest land: sustainable private forestry, the forested commons, unsustainable open-access forests, and unused residual forest. The greatest impact on the world's forests will come from refocusing the policy dialogue on the cost factors that-determine these boundaries, including agricultural support policies, local concentrations of nonmarket environmental resources, and policy failures that distort incentives to invest in forestry. In locations where reforestation induces large price changes, policymakers must remain attuned to the likelihood that deforestation-induced changes in the prices of forest products and forest policies may cause significant shifts in the activities of the poorest people.

AB With the aim of standardizing a method for mass production of the bio-control fungus, Verticillium lecanii, efforts were made to evaluate the efficacy of aqueous suspensions of neem (Azadirachta indica) cake, castor (Ricinus communis) cake and pongamia (Pongamia pinnata) cake to support the growth of V. lecanii. Results of the experiments revealed that autoclaved suspensions of neem and castor cake can support the growth of V. lecanii. Increased growth of fungal mycelium and sporulation of the bio-control fungus were observed in these botanicals, revealing the possibility of exploitation for the mass production V. lecanii for field use. The production of this bio-control fungus on these botanicals is not only cheaper but also facilitates the easy application of the fungal spore suspension as spray for any targe pest, nursery bed drenching, seed or root-dip treatment against any target nematode pest. Since the substance used is a botanical, the formulation can facilitate the exploitation of desirable properties of the botanicals in the sustainable management system.

AB Oncorhynchus kisutch, O. mykiss and Gracilaria chilensis cultivation in intensive tank systems is feasible. The environmental benefits associated with the development of integrated tank cultivation were established by analyzing previously published and unpublished data on fish production and food conversion efficiency, particle discharges in fish effluents, as well as biomass production, nutrient uptake effiency data of Gracilaria, with special emphasis on ammonium. The results indicate that fish production can reach 30 kg m(-3) during a production cycle, and food conversion can be maintained stably at 1.4 g food g fish(-1) production during the entire cultivation period. The solid particle discharges can be as high as 2.1 g (dry) kg fish(-1) day(-1) during the spring and summer, when salmon cultivation reaches its highest densities. The nutrient that increases most in fish effluents is ammonium, reaching concentrations as high as 500 mu g l(-1), also in spring and summer. Gracilaria production can reach production rates as high as 48.9 kg m(-2) year(-1) and is able to remove 50% of the dissolved ammonium in winter, increasing to 90-95% in spring. These results are integrated into an income-analysis model, adding the extra income for Gracilaria harvesting and internalizing the environmental benefits for a 100-ton salmon production unit, which indicates that an additional total revenue of over US$ 60000, representing around 10% of the total income, is possible.

AB The Arctic Ocean is of increasing interest internationally, as a transportation route, as a resource pool, and as a hotbed of social and governmental change driven by indigenous claims. Unfortunately it is also receiving significant attention internationally because of its role as a possible sink for global transport of contaminants produced by industry and used in a wide range of agricultural and industrial applications. Regional concerns about contamination include identification of sources of production within and beyond the Arctic Region, transport and deposition of a wide range of contaminants by the atmospheric, oceanic and riverine delivery systems, and the expression of ecological effects. Transcending ail of these scientific aspects of this issue are the strongly held concerns at the local level where what is at stake is the future of a sustainable way of life with ancient roots based on harvesting of renewable resources. The North Atlantic Region has already seen the consequences of many of the development pressures which will be brought to bear on the Arctic, such as off-shore oil production. Increased understanding of environmental as well as economic consequences of irreversible development choices is bound to be beneficial to the decision-making process. Finally as the Arctic contaminants issue has shown, the framework used for making development choices everywhere must be broadened to consider the long term global consequences of those decisions.

DT Article
AB Food, warmth, standards of living, transport and future prospects-all depend on society's ability to continue supplying itself with the energy that it has grown to need. This energy is derived mainly from fossil fuels and must be harnessed without harmful disturbance to the ecological and geophysical systems of the biosphere. But-now amplified by a growing population-energy use has become a destructive force: locally, because emissions contaminate air, water and soil; globally, because emissions enhance the greenhouse effect.
   Moreover, society must look beyond these environmental concerns to the inevitable decline in the availability of fossil fuels and the need to find substitutes. This paper examines how lead-acid batteries might assist the transition towards a more sustainable balance between energy, the economy and the environment. Particular emphasis is placed on the advances in materials and cell designs that are required for battery performance to meet this challenge.

TI Revitalising growth in Papua New Guinea's agricultural sector
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS

ID EXCHANGE
AB Agriculture provides a means of livelihood for over 80% of Papua New Guineans and contributes to over 30% of its national income. Although per capita income has not grown much in Papua NEW Guinea (PNG) since the 1960s, there has been a decline in the relative significance of agriculture and a dramatic rise in the contribution of mining activities. The pul pose of this paper is to simulate the government policy and external factors on the agricultural sector using a computable general equilibrium model of the PNG economy. The results show that the resource boom could have a negative impact on the agricultural sector, while exchange rate depreciation and tariff reductions have positive impacts. It is concluded that PNG's best prospects for achieving a broad-based and sustainable growth lie in reinvesting revenues from mining and petroleum in agriculture and rural infrastructure.

ID NDAMA CATTLE; HOST SUSCEPTIBILITY; CHALLENGE; MODELS; ZEBU
AB The application of systems analysis techniques identified a number of key factors which will determine future developments in the Gambian livestock industry, with especial reference to traditionally managed trypanotolerant, N'dama cattle, and the importance of tsetse and trypanosomiasis. Different components of the analysis repeatedly identified the following key factors: human population growth; declining rainfall; loss of tree cover; trends in land-use including increased areas under cultivation, reduced fallowing and reduced access for grazing; livestock numbers; prices for groundnuts (the main cash crop) and cattle; and indicators of national wealth reflecting cash available to invest in livestock or to purchase livestock products. In many areas tsetse and trypanosomiasis appear to be in decline as a result of habitat destruction but they are likely to persist in others where trypanotolerant animals face a high risk of trypanosomiasis infection and active control may bring significant benefits. Several of the identified trends raise doubts concerning the long-term sustainability of traditional grazing on common land, although improved, intensive management strategies can do much to alleviate these problems.

AB Pro-development water managers from a southern Californian jurisdiction secured voter approval for importing water supplies by mediating a six year drought. Through reorganized water management structures, unsustainable technological practices, and ''crisis'' discourses, water managers overcame residents' historic resistance to imported water by defining it as insurance against a ''natural'' emergency, not a social mechanism for growth. The research suggests how the environmental crisis can advance development-oriented state agencies' hegemony. Given the otherwise general advocacy of environmentalism and ''slow-growth'' in the empirical setting, water managers' success in overturning sustainable water development regimes reveals potential contradictions within the ''environmentalist'' landscape.

TI Are the Greek budget deficits too large?
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB We use a residual-based cointegration test suggested by Gregory and Hansen that allows for the determination of a structural break in the cointegration vector to test for the sustainability of Creek fiscal deficits over the 1958-92 period. This relatively recent test leads to a different result from that derived from standard Engle-Granger cointegration tests. The use of the conventional Engle-Granger test implies no cointegration between tax revenues and interest-inclusive government expenditures. On the other hand, using the Gregory-Hansen test we conclude that tax revenues and interest-inclusive government expenditures are cointegrated and a structural break in the cointegrating vector took place in either 1981 or 1983. Our result of cointegration with a structural break is consistent with a strict interpretation of the government's intertemporal budget constraint since it implies a zero discounted value of the public debt. However, since the cointegration-regression slope parameter is significantly less than one (when tax revenues are regressed on expenditure), the undiscounted value of the public debt is different from zero. This means that the government has incentives to default on its debt and, therefore, Greek budget deficit policy is not sustainable.

TI Energy consumption in UK households: Impact of domestic electrical

SO APPLIED ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSERVATION
AB The social-psychological aspects of energy use in UK households have been reviewed. A major survey, which focused an identifying environmental attitudes and beliefs, energy-use behaviour, ownership levels for certain appliances and their utilisation patterns, was undertaken among householders resident in the south-east of England. The results indicate that members of the general public are (i) interested in receiving information concerning household energy use and the associated environmental impact, and (ii) willing to modify their behaviour in order to reduce household energy consumption and environmental damage. Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide end-users with accurate energy-consumption and environmental-impact information, persuasively presented, to stimulate energy-rational and environmentally sustainable behaviour. For each major domestic electrical appliance, the survey data permit estimates of the variations in energy consumption per household and of the aggregate annual consumption nationally.

TI The recreational use of grey whales in southern Clayoquot sound, Canada
SO APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB Many whale species are increasingly the focus of recreational use, and thus spatio-temporal variability in whale populations is a key issue in sustaining and managing whale-watching, The present paper reports preliminary observations on the meso-scale spatial and feeding behaviour of the grey whale (Eschrichtius robustus) in southern Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia, Canada, Whale behaviour at this scale is a key area of concern in the management of whale-watching. During the period 1991-4, the foraging tactics and movement patterns of the whale population were studied, Although the ecology of grey whales is little understood, factors that may underlie their spatial behaviour are discussed, Over the 3-year period, the whales gradually moved further from the main commercial whale-watching port at Tofino, necessitating a significant increase in travel distances for the whale-watching fleet, from only 10 km in 1991 to as much as 30 km in 1994. The implications of this for the management and sustainability of whale-watching are discussed. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and the AM symbiosis are key components in agroecosystems, thus, they have been used as biosensors to evaluate the impact of a Rhizobium meliloti strain, that was genetically modified to improve its nodulation competitiveness, when applied as inoculant. It was found that such a rhizobial strain did not interfere with any of a series of processes related to mycorrhiza formation by the representative AM fungus Glomus mosseae. The parameters tested include spore germination, mycelial growth from the mycorrhizal propagules and AM entry point formation on the developing root system of the common host plant Medicago sativa L. Indeed, the genetically modified Rhizobium increased the number of AM colonization units and the nutrient acquisition ability in the mycorrhizal plant, with respect to the wild type rhizobial strain.

DE degraded Alfisols; subhumid Alfisols; sustainable management practices
AB The subhumid zone Alfisols of Nigeria are fragile, dominated by low-activity clays,; and have inherently moderate to low fertility status. Following intensive use of the soils for crop and livestock production, the soils are being degraded by soil erosion, drought, complete removal of both crop and residues, improper management practices, and overgrazing. The present investigation was aimed at defining the soil properties and arresting their continued degradation. The study area is located in the savanna zone, near Kaduna, Nigeria. The study involved a reconnaissance survey at which four soil units were delineated. Typical profiles were studied in detail, characterized in the field and in samples obtained for physical or chemical analysis. The upland soils (crest to upper, upper to middle, and middle to lower slope positions) have shallow Ap, sandy clay loam and clay loam texture, and are plinthic and mottled in the subsoil horizons. The valley basin soils are loam, have a moderately thick surface horizon, are flooded at a shallow depth of 50 cm, and are mottled even at the surface horizons. Acidity of the upland soils is in the extremely acid range (pH 4.4.-4.8). In the valley basin, soil acidity is in the strongly acid range (pH 5.0-5.1). Organic carbon and total nitrogen values of the soils are generally moderate at the surface but decrease to low and very low values in the subsurface horizons. Cation exchange capacities of the soils are adequate to control leaching losses of soil nutrients, especially at the surface horizons.

AB The ecologically sustainable development (ESD) process represented a significant attempt by the Commonwealth Government to involve pro-environment and pro-development protagonists in a major environmental consultative forum. The government's inclusion of peak interest organisations into an exclusive consultation process resembles a neo-corporatist approach to interest intermediation. However, neo-corporatist theory has been applied almost exclusively to economic policy areas and interest organisations representing capital, labour and the state. Analysing the involvement of select environmental organisations in the ESD process, this paper argues that neo-corporatist theory can be extended to include non-production-based interest organisations. The implications of environmental organisation participation in a neo-corporatist structure are examined, including a discussion of the tension between neo-corporatist and new social movement theories.

AB The land market in part of New South Wales, Australia, has been shown to conserve the soil and promote sustainable agriculture. The market incentive at work is the availability of information on the erosion status of the land. This paper explores the general possibility that provision of market information on environmental characteristics will lead to improvements in environmental quality. In this way the market would encourage landowners to conserve their land, retain native vegetation, improve biodiversity and pursue sustainable agriculture. They would do all this automatically, without government regulations, bans or moratoria, and without a new government agency or new act to implement the policy. The government officers would merely show buyers and sellers in the land market where to obtain, and how to use, the relevant information.

AB The short-tailed chinchilla Chinchilla brevicaudata and the long-tailed chinchilla C. lanigera were once widely distributed along the central Andes and adjacent mountains The high quality of their fur motivated the harvesting of chinchillas for the fur market. Commercial hunting, beginning in 1828, became a common and widespread activity in northern Chile. As market pl ices and the demand for skins increased in Europe and the United States, the number of pelts exported rose steadily. During 1900-09, the number of skins officially exported exceeded half a million per year. The continuous and intense harvesting rate, however, was not sustainable and the number of chinchillas hunted declined until the resource was considered economically extinct by 1917. Concurrently, market prices for the skins increased exponentially over time. A ban against chinchilla hunting in 1929 only increased the demand for skins. The last record for a short-tailed chinchilla sighting in the wild was c. 1953. The long-tailed chinchilla was also considered extinct in the wild, but was ''re-discovered'' in 1975. Currently, in two separate localities in north-central Chile a few scattered colonies of long-tailed chinchillas remain. Although chinchilla protection laws were enacted in 1929, they were not strictly enforced until 1983, with the establishment of the Chinchilla National Reserve. Chinchilla numbers continue to decline and possible causes are considered. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

In The Netherlands, the Dutch government have used a range of new steering instruments which have cleverly enabled innovation to take place within a market economy, This imaginative governmental process uses covenants, network management and above all, demonstration projects to assess the feasibility of innovation, The authors describe the process and consider examples from energy efficient and sustainable housing, highlighting the importance of clear targets.

AB The experience of the Para fishing community in managing its traditional fishing commons is explored. The concepts, methods, challenges to survive, and transformations in the direction of traditional community-based management in coastal fisheries are documented. Some lessons can be extracted from the Para experience that may be useful as an additional perspective in governing new management regimes for sustainable use of fishing commons. Evidence at Para shows that the fishers themselves founded the basis of management, erected an effective organization, constructed the equity share principle, invented and enforced regulations, and meted out the punishments. The delegation of authority in the local community to establish their sea tenure system is considered as a pivotal element in the management of communal property resources.

AB Cropping systems must efficiently use N inputs to be sustainable environmentally and economically. This research was conducted to determine the fate of N-15 fertilizer that was applied to corn (Zea mayr L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), or cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown In a 2-yr, three-crop rotation on Norfolk (Typic Kandiudult) loamy sand. A total of 48, 2.3- by 2.3-m microplots were established, half into plots that received surface tillage (disked) and half into non-dished plots. Corn and wheat received a split application of urea [CO(NH2)(2)] plus ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) solution (UAN) that had a 5 atom percent (ATM%) N-15 isotopic label. Cotton was fertilized with NH4NO3 containing a 5 ATM% label. The amounts of N-15 removed in the harvested portion of treated and subsequent crops, recycled in crop residues, or remaining in the upper 90 cm of the soil profile were determined. Corn, wheat, and seed cotton yields ranged from 1485 to 7410, 1850 to 2270, and 120 to 2510 kg ha(-1), respectively, with significant differences caused primarily by seasonal rainfall or temperature extremes. No-till significantly increased cotton yield, presumably because of water conservation. Crop removal accounted for 20 to 34% of the fertilizer N-15, while another 20% was accounted for by soil profile analysis to a depth of 90 cm. Approximately 50% of the N-15 was apparently lost through denitrification, volatilization, or leaching below the root zone. Most of this loss appeared to occur during the cropping season in which the N-15 was applied. This suggests that for optimum fertilizer efficiency and environmental sustainability, crop production practices on Coastal Plain soils must account for all N sources that plants can draw upon, and should accommodate several fertilizer N management options including split applications, injection beneath the soil surface, and/or using less mobile forms.

ID CULTURAL-ANTHROPOLOGY
AB This article argues that divergent images of community result not from inadequate knowledge or confusion of purpose, but from the location of discourse and action in the context of specific struggles and dilemmas. It supports the view that 'struggles over resources' are also 'struggles over meaning'. It demonstrates the ways in which contests over the distribution of property are articulated in terms of competing representations of community at a range of levels and sites. It suggests that, through the exercise of 'practical political economy', particular representations of community can be used strategically to strengthen the property claims of potentially disadvantaged groups. In the policy arena, advocates for 'community based resource management' have represented communities as sites of consensus and sustainability. Though idealized, such representations have provided a vocabulary with which to defend the rights of communities vis-a-vis states. Poor farmers, development planners, consultants and academics can also use representations of community strategically to achieve positive effects, or at least to mitigate negative ones. Most, but not all, of the illustrations in this article are drawn from Indonesia, with special reference to Central Sulawesi.

AB This paper provides an overview of agricultural and forestry development in the Amazon basin, and presents and discusses the main land use systems in evidence today in that region. These are logging, shifting-cultivation and ranching. The issue of sustainability is addressed, and current Amazonian land use is interpreted in light of ecological impacts and long-run viability. Also considered are the ecological notions of criticality, endangerment, impoverishment and resilience. After addressing the threats of land use encroachment to the forest resource base, the paper identifies sufficient conditions for regional ecosystem sustainability and considers desirable technological and policy-oriented responses in this regard. The paper concludes with a call to future research on land use systems, noting, however, that the greatest challenge is the design of equitable government policy for the adoption of sustainable systems.

AB This paper addresses the relationship between property regimes and land degradation outcomes, in the context of peasant agriculture. We consider explicitly whether private property provides for superior soil resource conservation, as compared to common property and open access. To assess this we implement optimization algorithms on a supercomputer to address resource decision-making of individual households. We find that conditions exist under which private property does not lead to the best environmental outcome. Access to farming technology and off-farm employment opportunities are key factors in this result.

ID TROPICAL DECIDUOUS FOREST
AB Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has recently gained considerable attention as a means to enhance rural incomes and conserve tropical forests. However, there is little information on the amounts of products collected per unit area and the impact of extraction on forest structure and composition. In this paper we estimate the quantities of selected products gathered by the Soligas, the indigenous people in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT) sanctuary in Karnataka, India, and examine the effect of extraction on forest structure and composition. Two sires, distant (DS) and proximal (PS), were identified based on the proximity to a Soliga settlement. The frequency of different size classes indicates that regeneration overall is poor in the area. The two sites show differences in species richness, basal area, and tree mortality. Furthermore, non-timber Sorest product species show a greater deficit of small size classes than the timber forest species, suggesting that regeneration is affected by collection of seeds and fruits from non-timber forest product species. Regeneration, however; may also be affected by other anthropogenic pressures such as fire, grazing and competition with weeds.

ID TROPICAL FOREST
AB Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) depends upon harvesting a small fraction of the total productivity Over-exploitation can lend to a loss of biodiversity, but a low level of extraction, without value addition at the point of origin, is usually not economically feasible for extractors. Extraction and productivity levels per unit area for most non-timber forest products are unknown, nor do we have much information about value addition at various points in the marketing channels. Here we determine extraction and productivity levels for Amla trees (Phyllanthus emblica), which yield fruits that are used for a wide variety of purposes in preparation of various foods, beverages and medicines. We also present preliminary data on the price appreciation of the fruit for one of the processed products. We have determined that the current level of extraction, 60-80% of all fruits at the population level, may have a negative effect on new recruitment. We present a model for value addition that has the potential to enhance income and reduce the level of extraction. This model is currently being implemented by the Soliga community with the assistance of a non-governmental organization.

AB This paper analyses sustainable development in an endogenous growth model which integrates a dynamic specification of both economic and ecological relations and all the interactions between the economy and the natural environment. It is common practice to solve growth models by looking at a balanced growth solution, which is often associated with sustainable development. We derive the conditions under which sustainable development is feasible and optimal. Finally, we discuss some comparative statics of the balanced growth solution and give a numerical example to illustrate the model and to provide further insight.

AB Under the Convention on Transboundary Air Pollution the UN Economic Commission for Europe has produced a series of international agreements to reduce emissions of pollutants contributing to acidification, eutrophication and formation of tropospheric ozone. This includes the Second Sulphur Protocol signed in Oslo in 1994, which took into account maps of critical loads as those levels of annual deposition which are deemed sustainable without adverse effects. This paper describes scientific and technical work undertaken in the course of development of this protocol, and how the approach might be extended in future as attention turns to new protocols on NOx and VOCs.

AB A simple model treating air emissions as cumulative pollutants is used to derive measures of 'green net national product'. The model implies that pollution emissions are properly valued at their marginal social costs in the measurement of green NNP. The level of genuine savings, net savings less the value of resource depletion and pollution emissions, is shown to provide a useful indicator of sustainable development. Recent figures on the social costs of fuel cycles are used to derive genuine savings measures for the UK and other European nations. Several countries had negative genuine savings during the 1980s.

TI Automobile dependence in cities: An international comparison of urban
   transport and land use patterns with implications for sustainability
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB A comparison of global cities over the period 1980 to 1990 reveals large differences in automobile dependence with implications for the future sustainability of cities in different countries. Cities in the United States have accelerated dramatically in their dependence on the automobile between 1980 and 1990, whereas urban transit has remained at very low levels, though with some modest success stories. LIS cities in 1990 have levels of per capita auto use that are some two times higher than Australian cities, the next most auto-dependent cities in the study, and have transit use rates that are the lowest in the world by a significant margin. Toronto, European cities, and modern Asian cities on the other hand have experienced much smaller increases in automobile use with some very large increases in transit use; their car use remains much lower again than in LIS and Australian cities. Developing Asian cities such as Bangkok, while still at very low levels of auto use and high transit use by international standards, are experiencing rapid increases in automobile dependence, which is not explainable by rising incomes alone. This study explores some of the underlying land use, transport, and economic reasons for these different transport patterns. It briefly reviews what the sustainability agenda means for transport and land use patterns in cities and suggests a suite of targets or goals for sustainability by which cities might measure their current directions and plans.

AB Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) evaluates the environmental impacts of policies, plans, and programs. This article examines the use of SEA for sustainable urban development. We first explore opportunities for SEA to promote sustainability principles. Then, we analyze case studies that have applied SEA to comprehensive planning. Our results indicate that SEA can effectively weave sustainability principles into the fabric of urban plans. Finally, we highlight both SEA's potential and its challenges for sustainable urban development. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Inc.

ID SCIENCE
AB The ecosystems of South Florida are unique in the world. The defining features of the natural Everglades (large spatial scale, temporal patterns of water storage and sheetflow, and low nutrient levels) historically allowed a mosaic of habitats with characteristic animals. Massive hydrological alterations have halved the Everglades, and ecological sustainability requires fundamental changes in management.
   The US Man and the Biosphere Human-Dominated Systems Directorate is conducting a case study of South Florida using ecosystem management as a framework for exploring options for mutually dependent sustainability of society and the environment. A new methodology was developed to specify sustainability goals, characterize human factors affecting the ecosystem, and conduct scenario/consequence analyses to examine ecological and societal implications South Florida has sufficient water for urban, agricultural, and ecological needs, but most water drains to the sea through the system of canals; thus, the issue is not competition for resources but storage and management of water. The goal is to reestablish the natural system for water quantity, timing, and distribution over a sufficient area to restore the essence of the Everglades.

DE home-gardening; Bangladesh; provitamin A; fruits; vegetables
AB Background: Vitamin A deficiency is considered to be an important public health problem in Bangladesh. A universal biannual distribution of high-dose vitamin A. capsules has been in place for over the past two decades. This supplementation has been beneficial for preschool children. Bangladesh has been exploring more sustainable approaches for all segments of the population. To support this initiative, Helen Keller International has implemented a home-gardening promotion project since 1993. This project is executed on a large scale and currently reaches an estimated 244 000 families.
   Methods: This paper presents data from 7341 women of reproductive age which were collected as part of the baseline census of a community monitoring system whose objective is to track progress and measure the impact of home-gardening activities.
   Results: Vitamin A intake in this population derived almost entirely from the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Logistic regression analyses showed that maternal vitamin A intake was determined by qualitative indicators of homestead gardens (type of home garden, the total quantity of provitamin A-rich foods produced and the number of fruits and vegetables varieties grown in the garden) after adjusting for socio-economic status.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that traditional production of provitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables in the homestead may provide a valuable contribution to vitamin A intake in communities where alternative dietary sources of vitamin A are scarce.

TI Modelling interactions between inshore and offshore fisheries: The case
   of the east China Sea hairtail (Trichiurus haumela) fishery
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE inshore; offshore; sequential fisheries; interaction; management;
   modelling; hairtail; East China Sea
AB Interactions between inshore and offshore fisheries are studied by mathematical modelling. The results show that various components of a fishery interact closely with each other and managing such fisheries must take into account both specific features of each component and interactions between them, To obtain maximum sustainable yields or net revenues, seasonal closure or exclusion of some components may be necessary. In the case of the hairtail fishery in the East China Sea, operation of both trawl fisheries will reduce the total catch. The maximum sustainable yield and maximum net revenue occurs coincidentally when both trawl fisheries an suspended and the fishing mortality in the inshore seine fishery is controlled at F=1.02, Banning the inshore trawl fishery can increase the total catch without need to raise the efforts of other two components and benefits the inshore seine fishery most significantly. However, above this the fishery remains under pressure unless other components are controlled. Increasing juvenile catches in the inshore seine fishery will lower the total catch and intensify the effect of the two trawl fisheries.

TI Characteristics of Albanian lagoons and their fisheries
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Albania; fishery; lagoon; yield
AB Eight lagoon ecosystems in Albania, covering 10 900 ha, are described, All lagoons have been subjected to many hydrological modifications and drainage work, generally resulting in deleterious effects on their function and productivity, The average total yield of fisheries operating in these lagoons was 48-77 kg ha(-1) year(-1) from 1986 to 1990. Grey Mullet (Mugil spp.), eels (Anguilla anguilla L.), sea bass (Dicentrachus labrax L.) and crabs (Carcinus aestuarii Nardo) account for almost all of the catch. All these lagoon systems are more or less threatened in the long term by sedimentation, siltation of the channels connecting them to the sea, episodes of hypertrophic anoxia, and domestic and industrial pollution. Integrated management plans, also covering the catchment areas, could help to maintain proper functioning and promote sustainable development of these ecosystems.

AB This paper examines a game in which an infinitely lived decision maker with inconsistent preferences makes choices over time. There are typically many subgame perfect equilibria to this game; I describe a refinement of subgame perfection that I term reconsideration-proofness. There is always a reconsideration-proof equilibrium and all reconsideration-proof equilibrium paths provide the same utility to the decision maker. I show that reconsideration-proofness is relevant for macroeconomic policy games by Proving an equivalence result between sustainable equilibria in policy games (as defined by Chari and Kehoe, 1990) and subgame perfect equilibria in intertemporally inconsistent choice problems.

TI Sustainability and environmental assessment - The increasing prominence
   of the natural environment in development decisions
SO GEOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental pollution has been the subject of increasing scientific, public and political concern in recent years. Coolants released into the atmosphere from refrigeration equipment, gases from power stations and chemicals released into water courses from agricultural fertilisers are example pollutants. The possibility that environmental pollution can not continue much longer without highly undesirable consequences has been gaining wider public acceptance. The increase in skin cancer in Australia, and damage to Scandinavian forests as a result of acid rain, are convincing and compelling cases. Hence the concern about the sustainability of some current commercial and industrial practices.
   Interest groups have been active for a long time in the area of environmental pollution, but their views are now becoming much more widely accepted and influential. Two decades ago, scientific studies were largely confined to academic circles, encompassing some of the interests of the geographer; botanist and zoologist. Now, however, such studies feature prominently in the professional world.
   The spread of ecological scientific methods from academic to professional fields of activity has made demands on the decision-making process in town planning and other activities associated with commerce and industry and the development of land. Conflicts of interest between conservation and commercial development have arisen. Shortcomings in the means of control have been exposed. Environmental assessment (EA) is being developed as the main means of transcribing scientific and environmental concerns into the political and professional context. There remains a great deal of scope for the application of the academic and scientific disciplines concerned with the environment to the process of making decisions about commercial development.

TI Wood and timber derived products in comparative life cycle assessment
   studies
SO HOLZ ALS ROH-UND WERKSTOFF
LA German
DT Article
AB Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) aspire to quantify the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle. The technique is used to identify and realize opportunities to improve the environmental aspects of processes, and to compare between products with equivalent function and performance in order to select the environmentally best ones. Especially when the intended application is a comparative assertion, it is inevitable that the key features and methodological framework currently discussed in ISO be accepted and applied to fulfill the specific requirements of transparency, completeness, reproducibility, reliability, and consistency. Because construction affects our environment to a significant extent, building materials and products have been evaluated in LCA studies for several years. In this context, wood and timber based products do have an exceptional position, in that they are produced from a resource which itself is an integral part of the forest ecosystem. It has not yet been possible to quantify the environmental benefits of sustainable forestry to such an extent that they can be used in LCA to underline the environmental benefits of wood with CO2-storage being the exception to the rule. Nevertheless, the examples selected from applications in building construction and power supply lines manifest that timber derived products have an excellent environmental position when compared to alternative products. This is mainly due to the sparing use of fossile energy resources, low contribution to the greenhouse effect, and small waste volume.

AB A survey of birds and mammals in Paspalum quadrifarium grasslands managed with fire, located in Beunos Aires Province, Argentina, was performed. Relative abundances of birds and micromammals, their habitat relations and fire effects, were studied with the aim of providing information for a sustainable management of this ecosystem. The study area has a sustainable management of this ecosystem. The study area had a patchy structure, constituted by three principal habitats: tall-grass (mostly P. quadrifarium), short-grass (Distichlis sp., Botriochloa sp., Stenotaphrum sp., Stipa sp. y Mentha sp.) and marsh (Solanum sp.). Thirty five of the 39 bird species registered in these grasslands, mainly were found in habitats where p. quadrifarium was predominant. Thirteen of these species showed a strong dependence on P. quadrifarium for food, refuge and nesting requirements mainly (Spartonica maluroides, Asthenes hudsoni, Cranioleuca sulphurifera y Cistothorus platensis). Fifteen mammals species were registered. Among micormammals, 3 rodents (Oxymyxterus rutilans, Oryzomys flavescens, Akodon azarae) and the small opossum Monodelphis dimidiata were the more strongly related to the P. quadrifarium grassland. A preliminary account of the effects of grazing after fire, in an experimentally burned area, showed an absence of micromammal captures and a replacement of bird species linked to P. quadrifarium by species that prefer short grasslands (Vanellus chilensis, Milvago chimango, Anthus correndera). Finally, we emphasize the importance of considering the fauna in the management of this agroecosystem.

AB Indonesia has successfully expanded its health system to improve access and quality of care for the population, promote equity, and expand primary health care. More recently, it has sought to undertake policy initiatives to promote involvement of the private sector and to introduce both incentives for efficiency and payment mechanisms which will increase sustainability. Certain public health sector facilities have been given financial autonomy to set prices, introduce and retain user fees, and promote prepayment mechanisms. The autonomous hospitals, Unit Swadana hospitals, have increased revenue sustainability while promoting quality assurance practices. The managers of these hospitals have become adept at introducing business practices into the hospital's operations to promote efficiency. These have attracted private investors to invest in public hospitals.

TI Effects of agricultural land consolidation on erosion processes in
   semi-mountainous paddy fields of Japan
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In semi-mountainous paddy fields of Japan, severe erosion occurs as a result of heavy rainfall or storm. In view of the considerable significance of agricultural land conservation for sustainable agriculture in semi-mountainous paddy fields, this study was conducted to show erosion phenomena and to consider the conservation effects of agricultural land consolidation which is carried out to make field sizes larger, mechanization easier and productivity per unit area higher. As the paddy field surface is flooded, levelling of adjacent surfaces and construction of levee slopes are essential. Also, soils of subsurface layers in paddy fields and levees are compacted to decrease percolation. Erosion in paddy fields occurs mostly on levee slopes, so soil structures in levee slopes were examined to explain erosion processes. The number of erosion events per hectare in consolidated paddy fields was smaller than that in non-consolidated paddy fields. Additionally, soil permeabilty at the toe of non-consolidated levee slopes was lower than that at the top. It was judged that soil structural changes were brought about by percolating water in non-consolidated levee slope. During heavy rainfall, water percolates through levee slopes and increases soil water pressure and degree of saturation in the upper zone of clay deposition. Consequently, these conditions cause erosion phenomena such as slope failures or gully erosions. Therefore, agricultural land consolidation appears to be of importance in modifying soil structural changes and in reducing erosion events. (C) 1996 Silsoe Research Institute

AB This paper identifies some of the priority research that is needed to accelerate integrated pest management (IPM) toward more sustainable crop protection in developing countries. Perhaps the most important need is for research that measures how different IPM tactics contribute to long-term crop stability. Another is for research that critically examines the interactions of different pest control tactics. Researchers especially need to reevaluate the widely accepted view that host plant resistance and biological control are naturally complementary. Experimental data and population genetics models have challenged this view. Researchers also need to reevaluate the view that botanical pesticides, which many developing countries are promoting, are harmless to nontarget organisms. Examples show that some formulations of neem pesticides may negatively affect natural enemies and aquatic organisms. Crops engineered for pest resistance offer new opportunities in future IPM programs in developing countries, but their use opens questions about ecological and human health effects. IPM researchers should team up with ecologists, health specialists, economists, and others and critically evaluate effects of the engineered plants before farmers start planting them widely. Although basic research is essential to answer questions concerning exploitation of IPM tactics for best long-term results, research that builds on farmer practice also is an important need in developing countries.

DE pesticides; regulations; policy; developing countries; third world;
   international; pesticide management; crop protection
AB Current emphasis in integrated pest management (IPM) is shifting to more biointensive tactics (biological control, host resistance, cultural management), relegating the use of pesticides to a last-effort tactic. This logical and appropriate shift away from a pesticide emphasis does not exclude pesticides from the multiple-techniques strategy necessary for a sustainable crop protection system. Intensified agriculture in many developing countries demands such a system. A solution to the recognized pesticide problems of expense, resurgence, and environmental hazards will involve multiple approaches that include the combined use of alternative tactics leading to the avoidance or reduction of pesticide use as well as a direct, frontal attack on the many problems associated with such use. The frontal attack will involve three broad, but essential areas: research, information transfer and training in pesticide safety, and pesticide legislation and regulations leading to an enlightened and enforceable pesticide policy at both national and international levels. This paper discusses existing national policies in developing countries as well as international regulations and policies impacting on national programs. Such policy is an essential component in pesticide management and should be developed in both a biologically rational manner as well as in a socioeconomically sound manner. There must be better coordination of the many organizations involved in pesticide registration, and indeed all aspects of pesticide management, for specific regions of the third world.

AB Syrian qanat Romani (subterranean aqueducts) were studied as part of a broader project examining the role of qanats in a modem world. Fieldwork was designed to: (1) produce a comprehensive map showing the location and current status of all Syrian qanats; (2) determine the relationship between qanat sites, ancient settlements, and ecological zones; and (3) evaluate the degree to which modem water technology has displaced qanat systems and assess the impact of these changes on Syria's ground-water resources. A map showing the distribution and status of qanats across Syria presents a picture of widespread abandonment of recently desiccated qanats, implicating ground-water depletion and underscoring the need for coordinated and sustainable aquifer management in Syria.

AB If an organization cares for nature, this paper contends, it will act so as not to harm the ecosystems it affects, or when it cannot so act at the moment it will commit itself to such action over time. For an organization's commitment to ecologically beneficent performance to be credible, one requires an action plan with specified targets determining the best ecologically beneficent pollution abatement and ecosystem improvement approaches in a situation. To this end the 4 Direct Environmental Performance Measures (EPMs) are generally used: L, pollutant loads; C: pollutant concentrations; I, ecosystem impacts; and R, ecosystem restoration. These direct EPMS are preferred to the indirect social performance indices customary in business ethics discourse, such as O: positioning organizations along the social performance spectrum from reactive to proactive; or E: economic indicators; and T: technology development; for environmental performance improvement is what is at issue. This one ground rule of environmental performance ethic; a second is that reducing harmful impacts or restoring an ecosystem are to be preferred over pollutant load/concentration reduction. The scientific, technical form of Direct EPMs is important, for it reinforces economic and technological development and yields performance-related environmental knowledge, in contrast to subjective perception and social debate. It offers management a model of ecologically beneficent performance that is microscopic in detail and regional in scope. It further suggests good environmental management involves linking ecosystem improvement with economic/technological benefits. An important aspect of this model of good environmental performance is to integrate economic, technical and social concerns with environmental ethics. It shows that economics and ecology should be mutually reinforcing, just as sustainable development suggests.

AB Regional mandates for reduced exhaust emissions, sustainable over the useful lives of vehicles or equipment, are influencing diesel fuel compositions and engine designs. Laboratory and real-world examples are provided to illustrate that both fuel composition and engine design can impact injector deposit formation and injector spray-hole corrosion rates, with associated potentials for deterioration of emissions compliance. Potential impacts of poor lubricity fuels are also discussed. A field test in California of a deposit control additive in trucks with Cummins L10 engines is detailed, including measurements of transient cycle emissions performance using conventional and reformulated fuels.

AB The greatest challenge in land application of biosolids (sewage sludge) for beneficial use is predicting N-mineralization rates so that managers can amend the soil with an agronomic rate of material. We used 11 yr of field-study information from biosolids addition to dryland hard-red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. 'Vona' or 'TAM107') to determine not only the distribution of applied N but also to estimate net N mineralization rates. This stud?, is unique since it involves multiple biosolids application in a dryland summer fallow agroecosystem. We applied five or six applications of biosolids from the cities of Littleton and Englewood, CO (L/E) to Weld loam (Aridic Palenstoll) or Platner loam (Abruptic Aridic Palenstoll) at four locations. This paper focuses on the O (control) and the 56- or 67-kg N ha(-1) fertilizer rate, and the 6.7 and 26.8 dry Mg biosolids ha(-1) rates that we added every crop year, The 6.7 dry Mg biosolids ha(-1) treatment resulted in the following average N distributions: 54% soil residual, 9% grain removal, and 38% unaccounted, At the larger application rate of 26.8 dry Mg biosolids ha(-1) treatment, we found the following average N distributions: 35% soil residual, 2% grain removal, and 63% unaccounted. We estimated a net mineralization of 25 to 57% and a first-gear N net mineralization of 13 to 43% for 6.7 drg Mg ha(-1) and a net mineralization of 62 to 78% and a first-year N net mineralization of 41 to 67% for 26.8 dry Mg ha(-1).

AB A study of seasonal and sexual variations of growth, diet, somatic condition (K-S) gonadosomatic condition (GSI) and hepatosomatic condition (HSI) of corkwing wrasse Crenilabrus melops (L.), and rock cook Centrolabrus exoletus was made on specimens taken from areas on the west coast of Scotland from May 1992 to February 1994. Capture throughout the year was by baited creel, 3-m beam trawl, fyke net or by anaesthetics applied underwater. Corkwing ranged in size from 31-212 mm and 0 . 3-131 . 2 g for males, and 31-203 mm and 0 . 3-103 . 5 g for females. Maximum corkwing ages were 6+ years for males, 7+ years for females. Male rock cook ranged in size from 43-165 mm, weighed 0 . 7-56 . 5 g, and had a maximum age of 8+ years; females ranged in size from 43-138 mm, weighed 0 . 7-39 . 3 g, and had a maximum age of 4+ years. Male growth rates were faster for both species. Male and female corkwing had low K-S values during the period of high GSI values; the trends for rock cook K-S values were more variable, but levels increased after the reproductive period. Maximum GSI values were 11 . 37 and 18 . 94 for male and female corkwing respectively, 9 . 63 and 16 . 63 for male and female rock cook. There was no seasonal HSI fluctuation for male corkwing, levels were higher during the reproductive period for female corkwing and male rock cook, lower during the same period for female rock cook. The diets of corkwing and rock cook were both dependent on epibenthos. Corkwing diet was dominated by gastropod molluscs. The management of sustainable fisheries for corkwing and rock cook is discussed in relation to the growth rates of the two species. (C) 1996 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

TI Tillage intensity effects on corn and grain sorghum growth and
   productivity on a vertisol
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English

ID CLAY SOILS
AB Sustainable production systems and conservation tillage practices are needed to control water erosion on vertisols. Five levels of tillage intensity were tested for 3 yr for effects on growth and yield of corn (Zea mays L.) and grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.] on a Houston Black clay soil (fine montmorillonitic, thermic Udic Pellusterts). Tillage intensity treatments included: chisel plow with secondary tillage; disk only; no-till with residue rakes at planting; no-till with midseason cultivation; and no-till. Corn plant populations were greater in tilled treatments than in no-till treatments in 2 of the 3 yr. Corn above-ground biomass production was generally reduced in no-till treatments early in the growing season, but by silking differences among treatments were not significantly different. Corn yielded 840 lb/acre more on average with tillage than with no-till. Plant population differences accounted for much of the difference in corn grain yields, with low plant populations restricting yield in some years. Grain sorghum populations were not consistently affected by tillage intensity, and biomass production was less sensitive to tillage intensity than corn. Grain sorghum yields were as large or larger in no-till treatments than in tilled treatments, except in one instance where population was reduced.

TI Changes of surface soil nutrients and sustainability of pastoralism on
   grazed hilly and steep land, South Island, New Zealand
SO JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT

DE sustainable agriculture; New Zealand; high country; soil nutrients;
   grazing
AB Soil nutrients in topsoils (0-7.5 cm) on grazed hilly and steep land on 2 high country sheep farms with contrasting climate in the upper Waitaki district, South Island, New Zealand, were compared before and after a 14-15 year period. In addition, effects on soils of 2 farm management systems were compared by sampling similar soils on adjacent farms.
   On a farm with mean annual rainfall of 700-1,000 mm (study area A) that had been fertilised and oversewn, and grazed with about 1.6 ewe equivalents per hectare for 14 years, levels of exchangeable cations (Ca, K, Mg) increased in topsoils on sunny slopes, but there was little change on shady slopes. The Ca increase on sunny slopes was the increase to be expected from the amount of Ca contained in the superphosphate applied but increases of exchangeable K and Mg could not be explained by fertiliser additions. There was an overall 29% increase of CEC, 7.5% decline of base saturation, and decline of soil pH by 0.4 units over the 14 year period.
   On a farm with mean annual rainfall of 500-600 mm (study area B) that had been grazed for 15 years with about 0.6 ewe equivalents per hectare but not fertilised or oversewn, levels of exchangeable cations in topsoils declined. Base saturation values declined from 98% to 73% and pH declined by 0.4 units. Losses of Ca and Mg were greater than could be explained by direct effects of sheep grazing and we conclude that processes such as erosion or removal of vegetation and nutrients by rabbits are important loss pathways.
   In the spatial comparison on land with mean annual rainfall of approximately 1,000 mm, oversewn and fertilised soils (grazed with about 1.6 ewe equivalents per hectare) had higher levels of exchangeable cations, organic C and total N than soils that had neither been oversewn or fertilised (grazed with about 0.6 ewe equivalents per hectare).
   Questions of ecological and economic sustainability arise both on the moister and drier high country. On moister land like area A, if lime can be applied economically, and fertiliser can continue to be applied with positive financial returns, oversewing and fertilising may be sustainable on sunny slopes. The sustainability of pastoralism on shady slopes is more problematical. If on drier land losses of topsoil nutrients such as those measured on area B are widespread, they are considered to be unsustainable. Although the nutrients lost could be readily replenished using modest amounts of fertiliser and lime, the changes have occurred concurrently with declines of organic C and total N. Restoration of organic matter levels is likely to require either reduced grazing, or oversewing and application of fertiliser. Because oversowing and fertilising the drier high country is not financially viable except during periods of high commodity prices, both these options would require major changes in farm management and/or financial assistance with soil conservation measures.

AB A study of Hertzian contact damage in plasma-sprayed alumina-based ceramic coatings on steel substrates has been made. Presectioned specimens are used to identify subsurface micromechanical damage processes within the coating and substrate layers as a function of increasing contact load, from both postcontact and in situ observations, Damage occurs principally by cracking in the ceramic coating and plastic deformation in the metal substrate, along with delamination at the coating/substrate interface. Coating thickness, cycling loading (fatigue), and processing history (coating microstructure) are shown to be important factors in the damage patterns and ensuing modes of failure, Indentation stress-strain curves are used to measure macroscopic mechanical responses, to quantify the maximum sustainable contact stresses and to determine the relative roles of coating and substrate in the net deformation.

   rainfall; savanna; shrubs; trees
ID VEGETATION; ZIMBABWE; DAMAGE; FIRE
AB Evidence from southern African semi-arid savannas suggests that high elephant densities in nature reserves cause the over-utilization of woodlands. Northern Botswana, with its prolific elephant population, is expected to follow such a pattern unless the densities of elephants which could be sustained by indigenous woodlands are determined and maintained at carrying capacity. Above ground biomass production was estimated for mopane (Colophospermum mopane) woodlands, a principal food source for elephants, which grows over much of northern Botswana. Densities of trees and shrubs, dimensions of plants and elephant densities were recorded within stratified plots situated according to a regional rainfall gradient. Mean estimates of above ground biomass (foliage and twigs) were 9.41 and 7.83 t ha(-1) for shrubs and trees respectively. A logistic model described the maximum levels of biomass removal from plants before over-utilization of mopane occurred. Variables incorporated in the model included above ground biomass of mopane shrubs and trees, growth rates of plants and expected off-take by elephants. The model predicted a complete biomass regain within 10 y if no elephant browsing occurs. Intensive elephant browsing in woodlands containing 15 elephants km(-2), however, can suppress biomass production if growth rates of plants fall below 70% of the maximum annual rate. Nonetheless, there was no substantial evidence to suggest that elephants will reduce the biomass of mopane woodlands in northern Botswana below a sustainable level if their numbers are allowed to increase considerably beyond the current estimate.

TI Fuzzy rule-based modeling of reservoir operation
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; STATISTICAL-DATA
AB A fuzzy rule-based model is constructed to derive operation rules for a multipurpose reservoir. The case study of the Tenkiller Lake in Oklahoma illustrates the methodology. Operation rules are generated on the basis of economic development criteria such as hydropower; municipal; industrial and irrigation demands; flood control and navigation; and environmental criteria such as water quality for fish and wildlife preservation, recreational needs, and downstream how regulation. The fuzzy rule-based model operates on an ''if-then'' principle, where the ''if'' is a vector of fuzzy explanatory variables or premises and ''then,'' of fuzzy consequences. The reservoir storage level, estimated inflows, and demands are used as the premises and release from the reservoir is taken as the consequence. Split sampling of historical data (mean daily time series of flow, lake level, demands, and releases) is used to train and then validate the rules. Different performance indices are calculated and two figures of merit, namely, engineering sustainability and engineering risk are developed for evaluating the rules generated by the model, which appears to be easy to construct, apply, and extend to a complex system of reservoirs.

ID AVAILABILITY DATA
AB Using microhistological analysis of feces, we studied the diet of wild greater Rheas (Rhea americana) by comparing plant species frequency in feces with availability. Green material composed 90% of the diet of rheas, followed by seeds (9%), fruits, and fragments of invertebrates and vertebrates. Wild and cultivated gramineous plants were eaten in low quantity throughout the year (11% of the green material), and were not preferred by rheas. Alfalfa and wild dicots were frequent in the diet (89%) and preferred in some seasons. Rheas consume alfalfa in higher proportions during the winter when this plant is not available to large domestic livestock. Therefore, greater rheas would probably compete more with sheep and goats than with horses and cattle. So the conservation and management of rheas for sustainable use could be compatible with traditional cattle ranching.

DT Article
AB The new resource management legislation in New Zealand has been portrayed by some observers as a 'progressive' reconciliation of market liberalism and the principle of sustainable development, This article critically analyses this claim to progress, It is proposed that the Resource Management Act 1991 is, in fact, the product of conflicting political economic agendas (neoliberalism and environmentalism) and that the development and implementation of the new legislation exhibits this inherent contradiction, By use of two examples, we illustrate the conflicts that arise in specific land use policy settings.

TI Reserve requirements, currency substitution, and seigniorage in the
   transition to European monetary union
SO OPEN ECONOMIES REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE European Union; reserve requirements; currency substitution
ID COMMUNITY; AREA
AB This article considers a transition toward European monetary union that combines increased substitution of currencies and greater monetary, financial, and fiscal policy coordination. It explores how such a transition would affect national inflation and interest rates and required reserve ratios when governments depend in part on seigniorage funding for public expenditures. We find that greater coordination of policies would lead to lower inflation and interest rates but higher reserve-requirement ratios. Because higher reserve-requirement ratios could place European banks at a competititve disadvantage, we conclude that the interaction between reserve requirements and seigniorage concerns makes it less likely that the gradualist approach of the Maastricht treaty is a sustainable means of transition to European union.

AB Thirty virgin female white (MF1) mice (Mus musculus) were divided into three groups: an unmated control group; a second mated group, allowed to proceed to peak gestation; and a third mated group, allowed to proceed to peak lactation. Nine unmated animals and eight of each of the two mated groups had their basal metabolism (oxygen consumption at 28 degrees C) measured and were then killed by means of a CO2 overdose, and the wet masses of 14 different body components measured. Body mass of the control animals averaged 26.5 g, not significantly, different from animals in the other two groups immediately postmating. At peak gestation body mass averaged 50.5 g, immediate postpartum mass was 35.5 g, and by the end of lactation it was 38.4 g. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the control animals (0.313 W) was significantly lower than the BMR of both pregnant (0.78 W) and lactating (0.35 W) animals. Food intake of controls was 97.9 kJ d(-1) (3.6 x BMR). At peak gestation food intake was 119.3 kJ d(-1) (2.4 x BMR), and at peak lactation it was 405.5 kJ d(-1) (5.96 x BMR). If BMR had not increased throughout reproduction, the peak food intake would have represented 12.2 times BMR. Morphological changes associated with the reproductive cycle mainly included increases in the masses of the alimentary, tract, liver kidneys heart, and lungs. A principal components analysis revealed four major dominant axes of variability in the morphology. The first principal component was dominated by the combined alimentary, effects and explained 71.8% of the variation in BMR. These data are consistent with the hypotheses that maximal sustainable metabolic rare reflects a link between structure of the alimentary tract, maximal daily food assimilation, and BMR. That is, as mice progressed through reproduction, their increasing food requirements were beyond the capacity of their guts to supply them. This led to hypertrophy of the alimentary tract and associated organs, with a consequent increase in BMR.

TI Housing: Underpinning sustainable urban regeneration
SO PUBLIC MONEY & MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Housing should be a key element underpinning urban regeneration to ensure long-term sustainability. Two issues facing urban areas stand out as we reach the millennium-these are urban competitiveness and the negative effect of large numbers of urban residents who are economically and socially excluded. This article argues that a more strategic approach to city regeneration is required, establishing a vision for the future so that smaller-scale regeneration initiatives have a clear role. Social housing, in particular, can contribute to a city's competitiveness and the revitalization and reintegration of areas of economic and social exclusion. Housing developments can lever in substantial funds, bring local economic spin-offs and, most importantly, deliver increased community cohesion.

AB OVERVIEW: As pressure to improve short-term financial performance has increased, longer-range research programs, particularly those at a corporate level, have fallen victim to cost-cutting initiatives. This development jeopardizes the technology base that sustains the corporation's businesses in both the short and long term. By designing a corporate long-range research program that is explicitly aligned with corporate business drivers, and the strategy of which is guided by management representatives from the major businesses, a credible and sustainable long-range research program can be developed. A key to success is an emphasis on transferring results of the longer-range program to specific business units as those results mature, and a metric to keep track of this transfer. The metric provides visible evidence of the relevance of the program to the business units of the corporation.

AB This paper describes a few Central American experiences related to the development of integrated, participatory health care systems. Theory and analytic method center on the tensions inherent in the dichotomies of professional/popular, center/periphery and biomedical/traditional. Using a framework rooted in the World Health Organization's 1978 call for 'health for all' based on community-oriented primary care, this paper concludes that the underlying conditions necessary for truly integrated local health systems have not yet developed. Except for the cases of Costa Rica during 1978-1982 and Nicaragua during 1979-1990, the political will to create and support such systems has not existed. Perhaps more importantly, the cultural milieu in which Central Americans interact with their society fosters an individualistic, commercial, and paternalistic citizen/society relationship rather than the cooperative, community-oriented and democratic spirit needed for successful development of integrated local health systems. Nevertheless, there are a number of positive examples from which we can learn, and a growing tradition of citizen participation which may lead toward appropriate, sustainable, and truly integrated local health systems.

AB Values attached to natural resources by cultural groups are often overlooked in defining the goals of ecosystem management. Resource values may be especially important when groups compete not only for the use but also the cultural meaning of a common resource. When groups increasingly differ in ethnicity and marginality, the resource values which they attach to that common resource may diverge sharply. As a result, ecosystem management goals may not adequately address the concerns of different ethnic groups who use a natural resource. This is the case with special forest products, an understudied component of ecosystem management. We examined the role of resource values and resource competition in special forest product harvesting in this investigation of North American matsutake or tanoak mushroom (Tricholoma magnivelare) collection in national forests in the Klamath bioregion. Data obtained through picker surveys, field interviews, and analysis of mushroom permits indicated that different ethnic groups varied in their harvesting experience, harvesting patterns, means of resource control, and resource values. These variations stemmed from competing resource use and diverging resource values and revealed how ethnic diversity contributes to resource conflicts and affects forest sustainability.

AB Labile and stable soil organic carbon (SOC) pools of two tropical soils of Belize, Central America, as influenced by land use management, were investigated using a combination of C-14 and C-13 techniques. The sizes and mean residence times (MRT) of the labile pools were found to be in the range of 1.5 to 59.8 g/kg and 5 to 8 yr, respectively, and those of the stable SOC pools, 25.1 to 65.2 g/kg and 250 to 388 yr, respectively. Both the labile and stable SOC pools have significantly shorter MRT than those of the temperate soils. The labile SOC pools of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) in continuous management averaged 12.9 and 19.8 g/kg, respectively, for Xaibe (Lithic Ustropept) and Louisville (Typic Pellustert) soils. Continuous sugarcane management reduced the labile pool to about one-third the size of the corresponding secondary forests. The labile SOC pool is sensitive to changes in management practices and its size represents the intrinsic sustainable soil productivity. A radiocarbon single-plot approach to study the dynamics of SOC pools was developed using the C-14 and C-13 signatures of the soil and those of the CO2 evolved. The results of the single-plot method and that of the paired-plot method agree well within the range of the experimental errors.

AB A great deal of attention has been paid to the needs of the rural poor in their pursuit of economic, social and political development. In this light the merits of rural electrification are often debated with mixed conclusions and conjectures. The positive role renewable energy plays in the drama of human development is enjoying greater receptivity by both policy makers and villagers. However, institutional barriers still inhibit increased adoption of renewable energy technologies. This article argues that the question of how renewable energy services can be delivered to and paid for by the rural and peri-urban populations is answered not so much by the technology selected as by the institutional and organizational structures erected. By addressing financial infrastructure, capacity building, and village empowerment sustainable rural electrification programs are possible. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The resource-based view of the firm is a recent strategic management theory that seeks to identify the resources that may provide firms with a sustainable competitive advantage. This paper has two purposes. First, the paper relates strategic management arguments to parallel lines of reasoning in industrial organization theory and argues that strategic regulation is a major source of sustainable competitive advantage. The second purpose of the paper is to report the results of an empirical test of the resource-based theory on the basis of a longitudinal data set on the postwar history of the Dutch audit industry. A key determinant of this history proves to be strategic regulation, which stimulates demand for audit services and protects rent-producing resources.

AB This article reports on the development and testing of an on-farm pollution control system using soil as a biological filter for trapping herbicide residues. A field site with four shallow surface ditches, underlain with four perforated drain pipes, was used to carry outfield measurements. Polluted water with concentration levels of 100 mu g/L of three commonly used herbicides, atrazine, metolachlor, and metribuzin, was applied to the ditches for 10 days continuously (actual daily application lasted for 4 h); and no water was applied for the following 10 days. This cycle was repeated three times. Water samples were collected both before application and after the water came out of the drains, in an observation chamber. Herbicide levels were reduced significantly (1%) in drainage waters in comparison to the 100 mu g/L level in applied water. In most cases, they were found to be 10 mu g/L or less. Also, the biodegradation of herbicide residues in the soil was found to occur between water applications. Thus, it appears that the system would be self-sustainable in the long term.

ID QUALITY; SYSTEM
AB Land application of liquid animal manures offers the potential for recycling large volumes of slurries by using the nutrients available in the manure for plant growth in place of conventional inorganic fertilizers. A study was initiated to determine environmentally and economically sustainable liquid dairy manure application rates on a year-round forage production system. Treatments based on nitrogen application rates of 200, 400, 600, and 800 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1) were established. This work reports on nutrient concentrations in the soil solution of the vadose zone and in shallow groundwater after three years of land application. A 96-instrument network of high tension soil solution samplers was installed at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m depths and used to collect biweekly samples from June 1991 through September 1994. A network of 72 shallow groundwater monitoring wells was installed at 3 and 6 m depths and used to collect biweekly samples from May 1991 through September 1994. Statistically significant NO3-N treatment effects were observed at the 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m depths. NO3-N treatment effect were not observed at the 3.0 or 6.0 m depths or at any depth for NH4-N, TKN, TN, PO4-P, and TP. Mean annual NO3-N soil solution concentrations ranged from a low of 1.45 mgL(-1) to a high of 22.70 mgL(-1). Concentrations of NH4-N and TMV were low for all depths while PO4-P and TP concentrations were nearly always below detection limits. After three years of study, treatment effects were clearly observed in the vadose zone. If not for very low subsoil permeability, it is likely that treatment effects would have been observed below 2.0 m.

DE Eleais guineensis; palm oil; palm alcohol; smallholder farmer;
   reproductive value; decision-making; sustainability
AB Budgets for palm-oil and palm-alcohol production were constructed to show the economic benefit of each activity to smallholder farmers in southern Benin. The selling prices of oil palms to alcohol distillers, who cut the trees, were approximately equal to the annual fruit revenue for that tree. Since trees produce fruit for several decades, this price seems very low. A life-table analysis of the trees was conducted after converting tree height to tree age and substituting revenue for offspring. Tree reproductive value was calculated assuming a type-I survivorship curve, and the equation was modified by discount rates for future revenues rather than by a fitness term. These discount rates reflect farmer uncertainty about the future. At high discount rates, e.g., greater than 0.1, the present value of the tree was similar to the value of its expected annual fruit production. Farmer interviews and a field study emphasized the relative importance of oil palms in the region.

TI Photovoltaic water pumping and its potential for application in
   community water supply in South Africa
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
AB Photovoltaic pumping (PVP) is an established international technology with over a decade of operational use in the developing world. It can be an attractive technology due to its high reliability, low recurrent costs and utilisation of renewable energy. To date, application of PVP in South Africa has been minimal, with most systems operating on privately owned farms and game reserves. Reasons for this are: relatively high initial capital costs coupled with inadequate financing arrangements, general suspicion of a new technology which lacks a comprehensive support network and the high risk of theft and damage.
   However, in the range where PVP has been shown to be economically competitive, there are an estimated 8500 South African unserviced communities where this technology could be applied. To facilitate sustainable application of PVP for community water supply, it is necessary that a programme of pilot projects he initialised; a set of standards be established within the industry; more detailed research on economic viability be undertaken; and a comprehensive support network be developed.

AB This is the first calculation of an index of biotic integrity (IBI) for the Okavango River to quantitatively assess the biological status of the river. The assessment indicated a definite degradation of the biotic component of the Okavango River. Furthermore isolated problem areas were also identified such as habitat and trophic level degradation, increased pollution and the reduced fish stocks at several localities along the river. Several measures were proposed to counteract this trend to ensure a sustainable fisheries component of the Okavango River in future.

AB WEEDSIM is a bioeconomic decision aid for management of annual weeds in corn and soybean. It was field-tested for 4 yr in Minnesota. The decision aid has two categories of management recommendations: soil-applied plus postemergence (PRE+), based on estimated weed seedbank composition and density; and postemergence (POST), based upon observed weed seedling composition and density. Weed densities, weed control, herbicide use, environmental impact of herbicide use, weed management costs, crop yields, and economic returns that resulted from PRE+ and POST recommendations were compared to those associated with herbicide management systems (HERB) that were standard for the region. After 4 yr of applying WEEDSIM recommendations to the same plots, there were no increases in annual weed densities (seedbanks, seedlings, established plants, or seed production) or decreases in weed control or crop (soybean, rotation corn, and continuous corn) yields, compared to HERB. WEEDSIM recommendations resulted in average annual herbicide applications of 1.1 kg ai ha(-1) for PRE+ and 1.0 kg ai ha(-1) for POST, compared to 3.5 kg ai ha(-1) for HERB. Environmental impact indices associated with PRE+, POST, and HERB were 0.75, 0.71, and 0.54, with the lowest value indicating greater environmental risk than the two higher values. Similarly, average weed management costs were $24, $33, and $77 ha(-1) for PRE+, POST, and HERB, respectively. Based on crop prices of $94 Mg-1 for corn and $220 Mg-1 for soybean, the average gross margins over weed control costs were higher for PRE+ ($509 ha(-1)) and POST ($522 ha(-1)) than for HERB ($455 ha(-1)). In general, WEEDSIM appeared to make management recommendations that adequately controlled weeds, maintained crop yields, reduced herbicide use, decreased environmental risk, lowered weed management costs, and increased gross margins over weed control costs compared to the use of herbicides standard for the region.

TI Economic growth and environmental degradation: The environmental kuznets
   curve and sustainable development
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID TRADE; QUALITY
AB In this paper we critically examine the concept of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). It proposes that there is an inverted U-shape relation between environmental degradation and income per capita, so that, eventually, growth reduces the environmental impact of economic activity. The concept is dependent on a model of the economy in which there is no feedback from the quality of the environment to production possibilities, and in which trade has a neutral effect on environmental degradation. The actual violation of these assumptions gives rise to fundamental problems in estimating the parameters of an EKC. The paper identifies other econometric problems with estimates of the EKC, and reviews a number of empirical studies. The inference from some such EKC estimates that further development will reduce environmental degradation is dependent on the assumption that world per capita income is normally distributed when in fact median income is far below mean income. We carry out simulations combining EKC estimates from the literature with World Bank forecasts for economic growth for individual countries, aggregating over countries to derive the global impact. Within the horizon of the Bank's forecast (2025) global emissions of SO2 continue to increase, Forest loss stabilizes before the end of the period but tropical deforestation continues at a constant rate throughout the period.

AB Beginning in the early 1980s, the Gulf of Fonseca in southern Honduras experienced a boom in aquaculture and became the second largest producer of farm-raised shrimp in the Western Hemisphere. Aquacultural development, however, has been accompanied by concern about: (a) destruction of mangrove forest, (b) depletion of fishing stocks, (c) disappearance of seasonal lagoons, and (d) deteriorating water quality. We demonstrate that environmental degradation resulted from a multiplicity of causes including aquaculture, increasing numbers of fishermen, harmful agricultural practices, and poor governmental policies and regulation. We recommend immediate steps that should be taken to protect the natural environment and create a sustainable aquaculture. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Special classes of models (D- and DD-systems) were proposed to investigate the competition in variable environment. Changeable coefficients at non-linear members of the models are Dirak periodical delta-functions. It was shown on the basis of DD-system theory that in variable environment the multitude of evolutionary stable physiological parameters of population may contain the whole sets of values. Analysis of D-system shows that ''pathological'' event, i.e. nontransitivity of competitive exclusion (A outcompetes B, B outcompetes C, but C outcompetes A) - occasionally occurs in the community of close populations in variable environment. Therefore in ''nontransitive'' communities there is no the ''strongest'' population while the selection takes place on some meta-level - between separate associations of populations. A single association which is characterised by cyclic dynamic of dominant populations, finally survives.

TI Growth promoters in animal husbandry: Between fancy and fact
SO TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR DIERGENEESKUNDE
LA Dutch
DT Article
AB The use of growth promotors, such as steroid hormones, beta-agonists and somatotropins, may result in animal health and welfare risks and raise ethical questions. From this point of view some fundamental statements are discussed.
   Growth promotors do not contribute to an efficient production of essential nutritional needs for man. There is a need for a consistent policy aiming at sustainable agriculture and world food supply. Animal husbandry cannot be regarded as a simple technical-economical enterprise because of the intrinsic biological values involved. If growth promoters are almost exclusively judged on safety criteria than questions of principle are avoided. The choice to use growth promotors cannot be left to self-regulation based on self-interest and/or be made subject to international trade agreements governed by economic considerations only. In the production of food the price for the protection of the environment and the animals ought to be paid.
   It is time to make future oriented choices.

AB When the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown under aerobic continuous culture, an autonomous short-period-sustained oscillation appeared. This oscillation was observed in concentrations of various extracellular and intracellular parameters, such as ethanol, acetate, glycogen, dissolved oxygen and intracellular pH. In this work the synchronization affecter of this oscillation was investigated. Ethanol was found not to be the synchronizer of the oscillation because a pulse of ethanol did not affect the phase or period of the oscillation. The oscillation was dependent on the aeration rate, i.e., the oscillation occurred only between 150 and 600 ml min(-1). However, the oxygen concentration did not influence synchronization as an upward shift in the oxygen concentration of the gas flow did not affect the sustainability of the oscillation. On the other hand, synchronization was stopped by an enhanced gas flow rate, keeping dissolved oxygen tension at the oscillatory condition, suggesting that synchronization was caused by a volatile compound in the culture. A stepwise increase in carbon dioxide concentration of the gas flow rate ceased synchronization, yet the oscillation seem to continue in each individual cell. Oscillatory behaviour of intracellular pH and carbon dioxide evolution rate showed a phase difference of 90 degrees. Based on these facts it is postulated that carbon dioxide, through the influence of its dissociation on intracellular pH, could be the synchronization affecter of the autonomous short-period-sustained oscillation of S. cerevisiae.

TI Cost effectiveness of lowering cholesterol concentration with statins in
   patients with and without pre-existing coronary heart disease: Life
   table method applied to health authority population
SO BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; MORTALITY; DEATH; TIME
AB Objectives-To estimate the cost effectiveness of statins in lowering serum cholesterol concentration in people at varying risk of fatal cardiovascular disease and to explore the implications of changing the criteria for intervention on cost and cost effectiveness for a purchasing authority.
   Design-A life table method was used to model the effect of treatment with a statin on survival over 10 years in men and women aged 45-64. The costs of intervention were estimated from the direct costs of treatment, offset by savings associated with a reduction in coronary angiographies, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and revascularisation procedures. The robustness of the model to various assumptions was tested in a sensitivity analysis.
   Setting-Population of a typical district health authority.
   Main outcome measure-Cost per life year saved.
   Results-The average cost effectiveness of treating men aged 45-64 with no history of coronary heart disease and a cholesterol concentration >6,5 mmol/l for 10 years with a statin was pound 136 000 per life year saved. The average cost effectiveness for patients with pre-existing coronary heart disease and a cholesterol concentration >5.4 mmol/l was pound 32 000. These averages hide enormous differences in cost effectiveness between groups at different risk, ranging from pound 6000 per life year in men aged 55-64 who have had a myocardial infarction and whose cholesterol concentration is above 7.2 mmol/l to pound 361 000 per life year saved in women aged 45-54 with angina and a cholesterol concentration of 5.5-6.0 mmol/l.
   Conclusions-Lowering serum cholesterol concentration in patients with and without preexisting coronary heart disease is effective and safe, but treatment for all those in whom treatment is likely to be effective is not sustainable within current NHS resources. Data on cost effectiveness data should be taken into account when assessing who should be eligible for treatment.

TI An Academic health center community partnership: The Morgantown Health
   Right free clinic
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ACCESS; CARE; AMERICA
AB This article reports the main findings of a descriptive study of the origin, structure, and evolution of the Morgantown Health Right (MHR) free clinic in Morgantown, West Virginia. The study was conducted between 1984 and 1995 to examine the organizational and operational features of this rural academic health center-community partnership. The MHR's longevity and provision of primary care without charge to low-income, uninsured, and underinsured residents of north central West Virginia are a function of its intimate relationship with the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center of West Virginia University. Essential elements of this rural academic health center-community partnership include social commitment and voluntarism, shared community and faculty leadership, joint problem-oriented long-term planning, and interdisciplinary practice and training opportunities for faculty, residents, and students. Financial support for the MHR comes from a variety of public and private sources, and the clinic serves as a prototypic rural free health care provider by virtues of its social and fiscal sustainability. The MHR experience shows that, like inner-city counterparts, academic health center-community partnerships can enhance access to health care for rural underserved populations.

AB This article continues to operationally define and test the resource-based view of the firm in a study of the major U.S. film studios from 1936 to 1965. We found that property-based resources in the form of exclusive long-term contracts with stars and theaters helped financial performance in the stable, predictable environment of 1936-50. In contrast, knowledge-based resources in the form of production and coordinative talent and budgets boosted financial performance in the more uncertain (changing and unpredictable) post-television environment of 1951-65.

AB This paper presents a framework for quantifying and diagnosing constraints to sustainability of farming systems. For a dynamic, stochastic, purposeful system, sustainability is defined as its ability to continue into the future. It can be expressed as the probability of continuation within specified threshold boundaries through a specified future period Long-term, stochastic simulation of a system model serves as a basis for quantifying sustainability. Hypothesized constraints to sustainability can be tested and ranked by sensitivity analysis. Issues that arise when applying the framework to a particular farm include selecting an appropriate time frame, making assumptions about the future behaviour of system inputs, specifying criteria for system failure, and identifying potential determinants of sustainability. A previously published simulation study of Texas lice farms illustrates elements of the proposed approach. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB The stability of the slash-and-burn system is more a function of the total nutrient stock of the entire ecosystem than the net gain of the soil after slash-and-burn. During the first cycle of land exploitation, slash-and-burn releases a large portion of nutrients stored in the above-ground biomass into the soil. Therefore, the gain of nutrient stock in the soil is at the expense of the plant biomass. Published data on slash-and-burn systems are mostly concerned with the changes in soil nutrient status during cropping. Studies dealing with the dynamics of total nutrient stock in the primary forest ecosystem and the subsequent cropping and fallow cycles are scarce.
   Conservation of the total mineral nutrient stock of the slash-and-burn system, starting from the clearing of a primary forest followed by burning, cropping and secondary forest fallow, is possible only in an ideal case of shifting cultivation the equilibrium model. A significant portion of mineral nutrients released from burning may be lost either through erosion and runoff or through leaching (i.e. K, Mg, Ca, nitrate, and sulfate). A portion of the plant nutrients will be removed in harvested crops. Thus, the total mineral nutrient stock in the whole ecosystem gradually declines during the subsequent cycles of fallow and cropping - the depletion model.
   For various social and economic reasons, slash-and-burn agriculture is being rapidly replaced by new or modified crop production systems throughout the tropics. In strongly weathered soils, external inputs of mineral nutrients are required, particularly, those aiming at sustaining high levels of crop or pasture productivity. Although nitrogen can be replenished through biological N-fixation, other nutrients, especially P and K, must be supplied by external sources. Therefore, a sustainable alternative to the slash-and-burn system should be judged not only by the stability of crop yield but also by the efficiency of the agroecosystem to recycle mineral nutrients as a function of time.

AB Alternative solutions to the loss of production potential and to the increasing rural poverty engendered by many slash-and-burn systems require major shifts in the evolution toward greater sustainability. Slash-and-burn practices are the starting point for several evolutionary pathways in agricultural development. The changes cannot be single-factor (such as increasing fertilizer inputs or use of better crop varieties). The transformation of highly complex systems requires substitution of enterprises that are more productive in geographical areas that may be marginal for food and feedgrains. These new systems often require markets for the wide variety of high-value crop and animal products that are most appropriate in highly diverse systems adapted to a range of production environments. The best existing examples of such systems indicate that potential gains in productivity are enormous. The structuring of several systems to enhance biological interaction can increase production efficiencies. Stimuli for change will involve social, political, and economic dimensions. It is essential for effective change in most systems that the planning horizon for farmer investment of both labor and capital be extended to at least 10 years. Several specific examples are presented.

AB Even with changes in the industrial structure and continued improvement in energy efficiency, China's economic development and strong reliance on its indigenous coal resources will lead to large increases in its CO2 emissions in the next century. A number of technical options exist that can provide benefits to China's economic development, help protect the national environment, and also contribute to climate change mitigation. These include improvement of energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy; greater use of energy resources such as natural gas, hydropower, nuclear power, and renewable energy instead of coal; and afforestation. Promotion of these options is in accord with China's strategy for sustainable development and its energy policy, which call for rational resource utilization and environmental protection.

AB Research on country-level carbon budgets provides a quantitative basis for national policy decisions on greenhouse gas mitigation strategies. For many countries, including Russia, the carbon pools and flux associated with the forest sector are important components of the national carbon budget. Russia has 884 mill. ha of forest storing an estimated 42.1 PgC in live biomass, 29.5 PgC in detritus, and 2.9 PgC in forest products. Between 1988 and 1993, carbon stores in live biomass were reduced by 0.5 Pg as a result of the timber harvest (which exceeded carbon accumulation in growing trees), fires, and other natural disturbances. Only a small portion of the disturbed forest carbon pool is instantly released into the atmosphere: the greater part of it is transferred into the detrital pool while some is accumulated in forest products. The lack of data on these key components leads to large uncertainties in carbon flux estimates. Russian forests have significant potential to be managed for the purposes of carbon sequestration. The analysis indicates that forest management measures can increase the future level of carbon storage in Russian forests on a sustainable basis by 2.0 PgC, approximately 2.8%.

AB The quest for social and political equality in late capitalist economy has led to defining women's contritutions in terms of the Western scientific patriarchal model. Challenging the premise of capitalist wage economy brings the devalued assessment of women's labor into focus. In particular, women's ability to bear and breast-feed children has historically been unpaid labor. But understanding the immeasurable contribution breast-feeding makes to subsistence economies may illuminate the significance of holistic approaches to family problems and questions of the earth's survival.

AB We examined the relationship between daily energy expenditure (DEE) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) in birds and mammals. Two models of the relationship between DEE and BMR were distinguished: a ''shared pathways'' model in which DEE replaces BMR in the active organism and a ''partitioned pathways'' model in which DEE includes BMR-that is, BMR is separate from the metabolic pathways that result in activity metabolism (ACT), and DEE = ACT + BMR. The appropriate null hypotheses for the relationship between basal and active metabolism are r(DEE . BMR) = 0 and r(ACT . BMR) = 0, respectively. Correlations of the residuals (d and b) of the logarithms of DEE and BMR from their allometric regressions with the logarithm of body mass were tested against these null models. Using phylogenetically independent contrasts, we found no significant relationship between DEE and BMR in birds, but a strong relationship (r(db) = 0.86) among mammals. Thus, the hypothesis that sustained working capacity is related to basal metabolism is supported for mammals but not for birds. Residuals of metabolic variables from allometric regressions on body mass were greater for mammals than for birds and suggest that mammals are more diversified in their energetic physiology. The idea that sustainable energy expenditure may be pushed to physiological limits in mammals but not in birds is not supported, however, because the ratio of DEE to BMR has a somewhat lower mean and greater variance in mammals compared to birds. The nature of the relationship between DEE and BMR in mammals and the apparent absence of such a relationship in birds remain major puzzles in animal physiology.

TI Liberty, equality, receptive generosity: Neo-Nietzschean reflections on
   the ethics and politics of coalition
SO AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Recently there has been a movement to embrace coalition politics both as an historically fundamental mode of action and as ethically desirable. Yet, as Bernice Johnson Reagon illustrates, coalition politics presents many profound difficulties, both in terms of its possible directions and the type of self capable of engaging in such activity. Laclau and Mouffe, embracing an open-ended development of equality and liberty, expand and clarify the possibilities that a radically democratic liberalism has available for envisioning and sustaining coalition politics. Yet, they illustrate the limits of such a project insofar as they are unable to address adequately the problems posed by Reagon. I argue that only by supplementing (and transfiguring) equality and liberty with an ethic of receptive generosity, suggested by an idiosyncratic reading of Nietzsche's gift-giving virtue, would coalition politics likely be sustainable and ethically desirable. The gift-giving virtue allows us to formulate a vision of the possible grandness of plurality that is ethically more compelling than the logics of identity and difference offered by Laclau and Mouffe.

AB Local markets for country foods have a history in West Greenland dating back to the early 18th century. After Danish colonization in 1721, Greenlanders gradually began selling these foods (West Greenlandic:kalaalimerngit), which included seal, whale, caribou, fish, and birds-first to the Danes and later to other Greenlandic Inuit. This trade was a significant transformation of pre-contact Inuit exchange practices. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the trade was largely between Greenlandic hunters and Danes employed by the colonial trade or by the church. Later in the 19th century, these institutions employed increasing numbers of indigenous Greenlanders. Economic specialization gradually became more pronounced within Greenlandic society, and cash became more prominent in local economies. Greenlandic hunters increasingly sold country foods to other Greenlanders earning wages. These practices continue today, with hunters regularly selling country foods in many towns at the local kalaalimineerniarfik(literally, ''place where Greenlandic foods are sold''), to institutions such as schools or senior citizens' homes, and in larger stores. Today, Greenland's Home Rule government is promoting local country food markets as one strategy for sustainable development. The goals are to promote the use of nutritious and culturally valued foods on a sustainable basis and to provide economic opportunities for local hunters, particularly in outlying settlements. The history of Greenland's system for marketing country foods highlights some issues that may influence the contribution of country foods to sustainable community development in the Arctic.

TI Priorities for conserving global species richness and endemism
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE biodiversity; species richness; endemism; global priorities
AB The Convention on Biological Diversity aims to encourage and enable countries to conserve biological diversity, to use its components sustainably and to share benefits equitably. Species richness and endemism are two key attributes of biodiversity that reflect the complexity and uniqueness of natural ecosystems. National data on vertebrates and higher plants indicate global concentrations of biodiversity and can assist in defining priorities for action. Projections indicate that species and ecosystems will be at maximum risk from human activities during the next few decades. Prompt action by the world community can minimise the eventual loss of species. Highest priorities should be to: (i) strengthen the management of ecosystems containing a large proportion of global biodiversity; (ii) help developing countries complete their biodiversity strategies and action plans, monitor their own biodiversity, and establish and maintain adequate national systems of conservation areas; (iii) support actions at the global level, providing benefit to all countries in managing their own biodiversity. Generally, resources will best be spent in safeguarding ecosystems and habitats that are viable and important for global biodiversity, and which are threatened by factors that can be controlled cost-effectively. Other important criteria are representativeness, complementarity and insurance.

SO BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
LA English
DT Article
DE biological soil amelioration; sustainable cultivation; growth laws; ash
   fertilization; soil productivity; sustainable fertility
AB Before the discovery of plant nutrients, soil amelioration and fertilization was by force of circumstance biological, i.e. done with substances taken from nature. After the discovery of plant nutrients, the chemical concept of fertility displaced the biological one. The defects of chemical cultivation - inefficiency, deterioration in product quality, diminishing productivity of soils and negative effects on the environment - have created an urgent need for the study of fertility as a result of the activity of the biocycles of the ecosystem. With the aid of the advances of modern science, we can understand the defects and deficiencies of the chemical concept of fertility and return the biological concept of fertility to its proper place. This in turn is a good starting point for productive research and developmental work towards an ecologically sustainable agriculture and forestry.

ID DEFORESTATION; GERMINATION; DYNAMICS
AB The traditional milpa agriculture system (slash-burn) of the Lacandon Maya people in eastern Chiapas, Mexico has created and uses a variety of habitat patches including the whole range of seral stages during forest development. This study examines seed bank attributes in habitats associated with slash-burn agriculture and with the more recent expansion of grasslands. We estimated the abundance and floristic composition of seeds in the soil from induced grasslands, milpa fields neighboring early and mature forests, and from secondary forest and mature tropical rain forest (15 samples by site, 2-3 replicated sites per successional stage). A total of 130 species germinated from the soil samples. The seeds of late successional tree species were scarce in all the seed soil samples (<2% of che species). Twenty-five early successional species accounted for ca. 70 percent of all individuals. Soil seed density (but not species richness) increased as milpas and fallows dominated the landscape. Affinity analysis based on presence/absence and abundance data showed a different soil seed bank composition for the grasslands when compared to that of all other successional communities. Our results suggest that current expansion of pastures and agricultural fields modifies seed deposition and storage patterns in the soil that may alter the process of secondary succession. This compromises both the regenerating potential of tropical rain forest in the region, and the sustainability of traditional practices and economic relationships of the Lacandon Maya.

TI Industrial relations in hotels and catering: Neglect and paradox?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT
AB Given that hotels and catering comprise an important part of the service sector representing the changing face of the economy, their neglect in industrial relations discourse about the 'new' industrial relations is no longer sustainable. Previously unpublished data from the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey 1990 (WIRS3) have provided the first opportunity for systematic analysis and evaluation of employment relationship issues in the industry and finds them to be different from those observed elsewhere in the economy. Consequently, hotels and catering can be said to manifest a predominance of 'unbridled individualism' associated with 'poor' industrial relations outcomes which, paradoxically, exist alongside an above average presence of personnel specialists.

TI A management oriented approach to stock recruitment analysis
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID MEASUREMENT ERRORS; FISHERIES
AB This paper describes an approach to stock recruitment analysis in which model parameters relate directly to management. The proposed recruitment curve generalizes earlier models by Ricker, Schaefer, and Beverton and Holt, where a shape parameter gamma determines the curve type. A family including these classical models can be represented analytically in terms of gamma and two management parameters: the maximum sustainable catch C* and harvest rate h*. In particular, the Picker curve can be expressed in terms of (C*, h*), rather than the classical parameters (alpha, beta). We describe the biological and management implications ofthis mathematical transformation and show that it is particularly amenable to a Bayesian formulation. We use simulation-estimation experiments to demonstrate that the new parameter estimates reduce statistical bias problems described in the literature for classical estimates. Furthermore, the new estimates are reasonably robust to the choice of shape parameter, whereas classical estimates are not. By focusing on management parameters (C*, h*) rather than productivity parameters (alpha, beta), the approach here yields estimates with improved statistical properties and direct relevance to policy.

AB For a solution to be accepted, a problem must be perceived. Society has, in recent years, perceived the problem created by certain nonsustainable development practices. Society is increasingly ready to accept the solutions necessary to ensure sustainable development. ''Externalities'' - costs of doing business that are imposed on a third party, are one source of sustainability problems. Consequently, there is a role for the State in ensuring that externalities which damage the environment are minimized. The agri-food research community, as an agent of the State, has an increasingly important role to play in achieving this objective. Driven by environmental concerns and economic pressure, the following trends are expected to dominate agri-food research in the next decade: increasingly multi-disciplinary approaches to research; closer national and international co-operation; globalization of research support (diagnostic) services; the use of production support programs to achieve sustainable practices; and the inclusion of the total cost, including environmental cost, of food production to the market price of the commodity.

AB We are now in the midst of the third wave of concern since World War II about the implications of natural resource availability and environmental change. We are also, in the closing decade of the 20th century, completing one of the most remarkable transitions in the history of agriculture, from a resource-based to a science-based agriculture. As we look toward the future, however, the sources of growth in agricultural production are not as apparent as they were a quarter century ago. In this paper I outline a series of a) biological and technical constraints; b) resource and environmental constraints; and c) health constraints on growth in agricultural production.

AB Aided by a political resolve, the dedication of their scientists, and strong international support, many developing countries made remarkable progress in achieving self-sufficiency in food and natural fiber during the last two decades. However, increasing population and commercialization of agriculture in these countries have put enormous pressure on the resources needed for a sustained growth in agricultural production. Limited arable lands are being overexploited reducing their productivity. Erosion-prone marginal lands are being brought under cultivation. Faulty irrigation practices, coupled with poor drainage, have made many areas less productive than before. Several time-tested stable cropping systems have been given up in favor of new, unstable systems to obtain higher yields per unit area. Indiscriminate use of fertilizers and pesticides has led to serious unforeseen problems adversely affecting the stability of crops. In spite of these setbacks, there is hope of achieving sustainable growth in agricultural production. This can be done by improving land and water management practices; discovering stable, high-productivity farming systems including crops and livestock; evolving better, environment-friendly crop health management practices; using new biotechnology tools; supporting international agricultural research centers sponsored by the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research; involving nongovernmental organizations and government agencies in efforts to educate and support farmers; and most important of all, implementing innovative programs to reduce population growth rates with the total commitment of the concerned governments.

AB A sustainable system of crop production is one that may be used continuously for many years, is soundly based on the potential and within the limitations of a particular region, and does not unduly deplete its resources or degrade its environment, makes best use of energy and materials, ensures good and reliable yields, and benefits the health and wealth of the local population at competitive costs. Plant pathology can and should contribute in each of these respects - by assessing the immediate and potential dangers to crops from diseases, by forecasting their incidence and severity, by deploying the best methods of control in the short and longer term, by evaluating the risks particularly by integrated use of the methods, by exploiting the potential for disease control in new systems of crop production, by recognizing the critical importance of extension and training in getting farmers to adopt the best practices, and by research at the highest levels on pathogens and diseases to provide the scientific base upon which major improvements in the technology of disease control will depend.

AB The adoption of conservation tillage can ensure a soil resource base for future generations. The objectives of this review are to examine principles of conservation tillage, to point out potential problems and to propose solutions. Emphasis will be placed on zero-tillage and its impact on soil temperature, soil water, crop residue decomposition, and weed communities. It is proposed that the future direction of sustainable agriculture is toward low soil disturbance, low input, and energy efficient production systems. Zero-tillage represents a starting point in the evolution of sustainability, and the role of disciplines related to crop protection to achieve this goal is discussed.

AB A review of four comprehensive sources of information reveals that cultural practices, i.e. practices not employing host resistance, pesticides, or specific biological control agents, are important to the management of all of the 50 principal diseases of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and essential to the control of 40. Thirty-one groups of cultural practices contribute to the control of bean diseases. The practices most frequently recommended are rotation, pathogen-free seed, weed control, and tillage. The number of cultural practices recommended per disease ranges from 1 to 15. Several precepts relating to the development and rational use of cultural practices in bean disease control are derived from this quantitative analysis. Control of diseases through cultural practices is essential to sustainable bean health.

AB In contrast to the known mechanistic approach, which is summing up mechanistic details of a process this paper presents a new methodology for the description and modeling of complex systems, which is based on a macroscopic pattern analysis based on formal analogies. The resulting mathematical model consists of a series of model parameters which are described in dependence of a number of significant process variables of the macroscopic process pattern. The methodology is explained in some case studies: the production processes of industrial antibiotics and pilot plant scale biotoxins, the predictability of hurricans and monsoon.

SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY

ID GROWTH-RATES; CONSERVATION
AB The hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is valued for its mottled shell, called bekko in Japan. Populations of hawksbills have declined worldwide, and currently there is a ban on all international trade of hawksbill shell and products (Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). In 1992 the Bekko Association of Japan introduced a fisheries model for hawksbill sea turtles in Cuba. The model estimated a sustainable yield of 5500 turtles from Cuban feeding grounds. We examined the model to determine whether this level of harvest was reasonable. Little biological information is available for hawksbills, so the model contained a number of simplifying assumptions, and several of its parameters were unsupported by data. The population was assumed to be at equilibrium, with a constant number of recruits (1-year-old turtles) and constant annual survival and growth rates. We analyzed the model to see how population size and sustainable yield results were affected by changes in various model parameters, and we found that the model was most sensitive to annual survival probability, which was assumed to be a constant 90% per year for all turtles greater than 1 year old. When we entered growth curves generated by mark-recapture data from other hawksbill populations, the model predicted a wide range of population sizes and sustainable yields. We determined that the assumptions of the current model make it unreliable for predicting sustainable yield of hawksbill, and that much research is needed to produce a more accurate model for management of this endangered species.

AB The increasing scale of international intervention in conflict is generating new pressures on the humanitarian community. Increased expenditure on emergency relief, static levels of overseas development aid and subsequent lack of funds for development are dictating that agencies design relief projects that positively effect developmental reconstruction.
   This paper examines the provision of shelter for refugees and displaced persons in the Republic of Croatia and identifies ways in which it has encouraged and discouraged sustainable reconstruction. It argues that to promote lasting reconstruction, programmes must focus on saving livelihoods as well as lives, thus minimising the long-term psychological and physical impacts of aid on refugees, displaced persons and host communities.

AB The Sustainable Process Index (SPI) is a measure developed to evaluate the viability of processes under sustainable economic conditions. Its advantages are its universal applicability, its scientific basis, the possibility of adoption in process analyses and syntheses, the high sensitivity for sustainable qualities, and the capability of aggregation to one measure. It has proved to be useful in industrial strategic planning. The concept of the SPI is based on the assumption that in a truly sustainable society the basis of economy is the sustainable flow of solar exergy. The conversion of the solar exergy to services needs area. Thus, area becomes the limiting factor of a sustainable economy. The SPI evaluates the areas needed to provide the raw materials and energy demands and to accommodate by-product flows from a process in a sustainable way. It relates these areas to the area available to a citizen in a given geographical (from regional to global) context. The data necessary to calculate the SPI are usually known at an early stage in process development. The result of the computation is the ratio between the area needed to supply a citizen with a given service and the area needed to supply a citizen with all possible services. Thus, it is a measure of the expense of this service in an economy oriented towards sustainability.

AB Emissions of carbon dioxide are classified into three categories arising from the generation of electricity, from mobile sources, and from all other stationary sources by fossil fuel type in a simple 4 x 4 spreadsheet. The selection of these groupings reflects the deep natural divisions in the energy economy. Another column is added to list the primary energy contributed by each fuel and another row at the bottom to account for primary electricity derived from hydraulic, nuclear, and, in the future, other similar sources such as photovoltaics and wind power. The spreadsheet technique is illustrated by linking two selected scenarios, the first for the capture and sequestering of carbon dioxide emitted from coal-based generation and the second for an aggressive co-generation scenario based upon natural gas, with a base oil supply scenario chosen to be sufficient to meet the foreseen 'business-as-usual' needs of the transportation industry until 2030. It is shown that both the sequestering and co-generation options are helpful in meeting a control scenario requiring emissions of carbon dioxide to be stabilized at 6.0 gigatonnes carbon per year (GT C/y) on a world basis by 2010 and thereafter, but that additional measures would be needed to reach a sustainable level of 3.0 GT C/y by 2030.

ID DEFORESTATION
AB The Brazilian Amazon deforestation has been responsible, in part, for the increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere. In 1990, the amount of carbon released to the atmosphere (as CO2) from Brazilian Amazon deforestation was 3.5 % to 4.9 % and 250 % to 360 % of the World and Brazilian annual emission from fossil fuels, respectively. In fact, the forest removal is a major contributor to local, regional and global environmental changes. Today, the deforested lands account for an amount superior to 430,000 Km(2). In addition to increase of the greenhouse effect, the foreseeable consequences of deforestation are : losses of the soil nutrients, surface erosion, decline in water percolation, evapo-transpiration and the annual pluviosity, losses in the biodiversity, etc.. On the other hand, deforestation is halted and replaced with a rational forest management, a reuse of degraded lands for agro-forestry and biomass production for energy and industrial purposes, we can reduce the pressure on forests lands and the net carbon flux will be reversed. In this paper, we argue the possibilities to achieve a sustainable biomass valorisation in the forest and degraded lands in Brazilian Amazon, with a special interest in the job creation, the cost of these strategies and their carbon flow.

AB Biomass has the potential to become one of the largest sources of renewable, sustainable energy in the UK and many other parts of the European Union. However, for biomass to reach its full potential in the electricity market generation technologies must be used that maximise the efficiency of conversion to power. The first generation of these advanced technologies will be expensive but, as the market expands, should provide a route to fully commercial electricity from biomass. This paper examines how the economics of advanced biomass power generation technologies might develop from the demonstration stage to commercial plant and shows how they can produce competitive electricity in the future.

AB Asia's global warming potential (GWP) is large and growing. Asia releases an estimated 8.4 billion metric tons of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) each year from fossil fuel use, cement manufactures and ''land use changes'' while its anthropogenic emissions of methane (emissions derived primarily from wet rice cultivation and livestock - estimates from these being highly unreliable) represent nearly half the global total. These greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent 30% (28.3 billion metric tons) of the global total of CO2 equivalent emitted in 1989, Per capita GHG emissions are low but per-unit GDP emissions are very high (anywhere from two to six times more than in the OECD countries). The countries participating in the Asia Least Cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategies (ALGAS)(1) project account for nearly 70% of the total CO2 emissions and over 80% of the methane emissions in the entire Asian region.
   This paper highlights several key issues that must be considered while developing GHG emissions mitigation options within the context of an overall strategy of moving countries rapidly along a path of sustainable development that increases inter-sectoral energy efficiencies within the economy, enhance sinks, and decrease GHG emissions per capita. In particular, this integrated strategy should promote ''no regrets'' policies and emphasize ''win-win'' options that result in sustainable economic development over and above any GHG abatement benefits that might result from the adoption of such initiatives. This emphasis on long term economic sustainability requires a detailed economic evaluation of environmental impacts of potential ALGAS projects. The GHG emissions mitigation potential of the candidate projects must be evaluated within this overall framework of evaluating anticipated economic and environmental impacts. Part 1 of this paper highlights key issues in economic evaluation of environmental impacts and provides recommendations on how to use accepted evaluation techniques during strategic planning and project economic analysis.
   Project economic analysis incorporates the economic evaluation of environmental impacts. One important set of environmental impacts is that on global climate change through the candidate project's net impacts on GHG emissions. To assess the relative significance of climate change impacts of potential projects, a systematic screening exercise should be adopted during the strategic planning stage. This screening mechanism would allow a comparison of specific climate change impacts relative to other environmental impacts. A monetization of such impacts would then allow an objective assessment of the candidate project's role in mitigation of the impacts of GHG emissions. The special concerns related to development of strategies based on technical estimates and projections of economic parameters that are highly uncertain, are enumerated in Part 1.
   In addition to recognizing specific economic and political considerations while developing such strategies, the importance of private sector participation in pursuing options for abatement of GHG emissions must be acknowledged. Thus, several private sector specific issues must be factored into overall strategy development; these are discussed in Part 2.

AB Replacing fossil fuels with sustainably-produced biomass reduces net CO2 emissions. We express the efficiency of this substitution in reduced emissions per unit of used land or biomass. The substitution costs are calculated as the cost difference between a continued use of fossil fuels at current prices and a use of biomass. The biomass technologies are assumed to be implemented when reinvestments are required. Energy inputs to biomass production and conversion are biomass-based, resulting in a CO2 neutral fuel cycle, while CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are estimated from their complete fuel cycles. Using biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels in electricity and heat production is, in general, less costly and more resource efficient than replacing gasoline or diesel for transportation. For transportation, methanol or ethanol produced from short-rotation forest or logging residues provide larger CO2 emission reductions than other biomass-based energy carriers, and methanol has the lowest emission-reduction costs. An increased biomass use by 125 TWh/yr would eliminate more than half of the Swedish CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, which were about 15 Mtonnes C in 1992.

AB This paper aims at clarifying kg points for realizing sustainable energy supply under restrictions on resource and environment. For this purpose, we first developed a database to estimate life cycle efficiencies and greenhouse gas emissions for various energy systems.
   Then on the basis of this life cycle assessment, we quantitatively define the concept of 'Sustainability Limitations' on resource depletion and environmental emissions. From this concept, present world is judged to be unsustainable both from resource and environmental viewpoints. At the same time, we clarify how far present world is from Sustainability Limitations.
   Then we describe our mathematical model simulating global energy supply and demand in ultra-long term. In this model, the concept of Sustainability Limitations is utilized so as to impose economic incentives to make energy system shift to a sustainable one in long term. Sustainability limitations of resource depletion and CO2 emissions are taken into consideration. As energy resources. this model includes coal, oil, natural gas, other unconventional fossil fuels, uranium and renewable resources. As energy technologies, it includes major technologies of mining, transport, conversion and final utilization. Computed results have shown that present energy system, which is judged to be unsustainable, shifts to a sustainable system in the ultra-long term with appropriate incentives.

ID AMAZONIA
AB Sustainable use of the Amazon forest for timber production is conditioned by the effect of logging on the system's nutrient cycling. This paper reports the results of a soil moisture and soil water chemistry monitoring campaign before and immediately after a selective logging which removed 35 m(3) wood/ha. Soil moisture was measured using tensiometers, and soil water chemistry using suction samplers in five disturbance classes: tractor tracks, clearing centres, clearing edges, forest edges and untouched forest. The results show that the soil under the tractor tracks and clearings contained more moisture than under the untouched forest. The suction samplers extracted substantially more nitrate, ammonium, calcium, magnesium and potassium from the clearing centres, the tractor tracks and the clearing edges than from the forest sites. The results are explained in terms of altered microbial activity, changes in crown interception and uptake by roots.

AB This paper has been presented ar a meeting of the National Research Council in February 1995, in Perugia, Italy. This is a preview of that which is to be the final product of the study: a manual for evaluating the environmental impact of pig-breeding farms. The most important issues in the environment-hog production relationship are discussed. After that, some elements for a sustainable swine production are focused. To solve the pig-breeding/environment conflict is not an easy task. The challenge is to find the right compromises, adopting all possible technologies for minimizing the impact on the environment. Since the first problem is the risk of water pollution due to manure, it is important to study the best solutions from the viewpoint of the watershed, taking into account the interactions and synergies occurring in the drainage system, and especially for the communities at the lower part of the basin. Therefore it becomes more and more of an absolute necessity to plan and manage resources using the watershed as a reference.

The evolutionary slate of soils and soil cover is shown to be changed to a certain extent. To estimate the sustainable state of the soil cover, the concept of homeostasis is proposed for use, as well as the method to determine the boundaries of homeostatic territories.

AB The extension of economic zones and the introduction of a common fisheries policy in the European Union have not had the results expected in fish stock management. Fisheries managers seem to be increasingly sceptical about the prospects of exploiting fish stocks at anywhere near the maximum sustainable yield level. At the same time, biologists no longer provide specific recommendations aimed at achieving the former objective of rational exploitation. This paper describes some of the causes of the declining commitment of fisheries biologists to rational exploitation, and to fish stock assessment in general. It also puts forward suggestions to improve the prospects of effective cooperation between biologists and managers through a restructuring of existing advisory and decision-making bodies.

DT Article
ID LAND
AB Soil is a complex organo-mineral association capable of sustaining all the terrestrial ecosystems on earth. It is a fundamental part of the environment upon which human brings and most other life forms depend, but despite this, soil is a grossly undervalued component of the natural world, Concerned by the lack of impact soil science has had, a group of soil scientists at a meeting in Rennes, concluded that a different, and more broadly based approach to the application of soil science research findings, particularly in Developing Countries, was needed. This approach they called holistic. It was defined as the task of all people concerned with the soil to direct their interest, not just towards the physical, chemical and biological aspects, but also to those environmental economic, social, legal and technical aspects that affect soil :Ise, Subsequently, a workshop held in Harare, conducted in the form of a ''think tank'' explored the ways in which the soil resource could be used on a sustained basis within thr social and economic framework of the countries of Southern Africa, The major issues relevant to ''applied'' soil science were discussed in a holistic manner so that the related issues of education, training, role of agricultural extension services and possibilities of co-operation in science and technology between institutions of the southern African countries and Europe could be identified. Soil scientists have a considerable challenge to face. They must work more closely with practicioners of other disciplines, and also take legal, economic and social conditions into account so that sustainable land management systems are developed and used, At the same time, standards of research in ''pure'' soil science must not be compromised by a broadening of the framework within which the discipline exists.

AB Understanding the nature of change in health care markets involves recognizing that not all communities are alike, and hence not all health care markets look or act the same. In a study of fifteen communities sponsored by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the characteristics and culture of each community interacted with market conditions to influence the magnitude, direction, and sustainability of health system change. A catalyst attuned to a market's context can ignite change, giving the market focus and direction. Recognizing the importance of context to the process of change enhances our ability to understand the consequences of proposed market activities.

AB Experiments were conducted with ''BigSur' broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica) at two sites in Fall 1993 and at two sites in Spring 1994 on a Hayter loam in southwestern Virginia. Our objectives were to determine the effects of tillage main plots (conventional tillage = CT and no tillage = NT) and weed control subplots [no overseeding or preemergent herbicide, oxyfluorofen, red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), 'Dutch' white clover (Trifolium repens L.), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth)] on broccoli yield and weed suppression. In all sites, weed suppression and marketable broccoli yield with NT were equal to or higher than with CT. Overseeded legume living mulches did not affect broccoli yield in any site compared to the control plots and suppressed weeds as well as the oxyfluorofen in three of the four sites. Thus, the NT systems used in these experiments can suppress weeds and produce high broccoli yields. Also, overseeded legume living mulches can be established effectively after transplanting to suppress weeds without reducing broccoli yield. Chemical name used: 2-choro-1-(3-ethoxy-4-nitrophenoxy)-4-(trifluoromethyl) benzene (oxyfluorofen).

DT Article
AB A field experiment aimed at optimizing fertilizer use in different crop sequences, was conducted during 1991-92 and 1992-93 at Mandor (Jodhpur). Double-crop sequences recorded higher annual productivity and net return over monocrops. Pearlmillet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Sr. emend. Stuntz.]-cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) was found more remunerative but less sustainable compared with pearlmillet-Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson] in view of higher cost and risk involved in cumin cultivation. Ail the double crop sequences and wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Fiori & Paol.) grown after fallow responded to 100% of recommended fertilizer level (RFL). Additional manuring with farmyard manure (FYM) @ 5 tonnes/ha in 91 beyond 50% of RFL improved yield of double crops for 3 consecutive seasons. Mustard and cumin grown as monocrops required to be fertilized up to 50% of RFL and additional fertilization (organic or inorganic) did not bring about improvement in productivity any further.

TI Economic implications and decision-making in the face of global warming
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB One way to approach decision-making on the issue of global warming is to attempt to perform a cost-benefit analysis. However an this issue problems of valuation, risk and uncertainty, time-discounting, and equity make cost-benefit analysis so inconclusive and controversial that-far from helping decision-making-it is likely to hinder it. An alternative approach involves accepting that climate stability has to be secured on the grounds of environmental sustainability, and determining in principle to undertake the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions that is necessary to achieve this. The timetable of such abatement will obviously depend to some extent on its costs. The evidence on abatement costs suggests that a 20 percent abatement from 1990 levels of carbon dioxide (the principal greenhouse gas) can be achieved in industrial countries at low or no cost by 2010. Application of the sustainability principle suggests that this is a reasonable first target. If deeper cuts in emissions are deemed necessary thereafter they will be achieved more easily and at lower cost than if abatement in the interim is negligible.

AB Pesticides can contribute to increases in agricultural productivity. Unfortunately, the inherently toxic nature of pesticides makes their use problematic. Even when used properly, pesticides pose potential risks to human health and the environment. When pesticides are used improperly, the health and environmental consequences can be severe. The risks inherent in pesticide use create a dilemma far the international donor community. All members of this community are committed to increasing the well-being of the world's poor, and most hare a commitment to development that is environmentally sustainable. How then do donors reconcile the potential appeal of pesticide use with their concern for environmental quality?
   This article examines ham the U.S. Agency for international Development (USAID) addresses this question anti ham in policies an pest management and the environment have evolved since the agency's creation. Consideration of USAID's policies is instructive, not only because of the magnitude of U.S, foreign assistance, but also because of the health, agricultural, and environmental consequences of these policies and their effects on recipient nations, and because the agency's experiences with the donation of pesticides provides much of the explanation for the agency's current environmental procedures, including those associated with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

AB In 1987 the Brundtland-Commission described '' sustainable development'' as that which meets the needs of the present generation without prejudicing those of the future generations. The practical materialization of this principle leads to growth processes in which the ''future'' has to be taken into account. The time-dependent difference-differential equation y(t) = lambda y(t + tau). e(-delta tau), and related functions, are discussed in which tau is a future time interval, lambda is an endogeneous growth parameter, and delta is the social discount rate. Despite of the linearity of such equations their solutions exhibit a complex behaviour because the ''separation of the future'' leads to a non-linearly coupled system of the real and imaginary parts of the growth parameters and, therefore, one has to be cautious when the ''future'' has to be included in the mathematical treatment of economical processes.

Ideally, what needs to be done? and Practically, what can be done ? are answered here by relying on the cultural theory of Mary Douglas and her colleagues, more especially Aaron Wildavsky and Michael Thompson, both of whom have used the model to address sustainable development. The implications of cultural theory for sustainable development are substantial.
   The article is divided into five sections. The first describes the current controversy over sustainable development. The second sets out the cultural theory model, and the third applies that model to reformulate our understanding of sustainable development. The fourth draws out the implications of a reformulated sustainable development, while the conclusion uses those implications to answer the four questions that started the article.

AB A quantitative method which can be used to gauge the sustainability of existing sociocultural, economic and environmental constructs is proposed. An underlying assumption of the approach is that a co-evolutionary relationship exists between social, cultural, economic and environmental systems and that these cannot be addressed in a reductionist and deterministic manner. The method focuses on both broad trends and patterns of variance in a multivariate data matrix, it allows the identification of dominant trends as well as underlying tensions, does not treat socio-cultural, economic and environmental heterogeneity as statistical noise and can be applied at different administrative scales. Furthermore, it may be used to identify potential sources of human insecurity, factors that may affect the probability of positive human survival, developmental patterns at odds with the established values system of civil society that can be targeted for political action, and to inform public debate. In addition, the method can be used to identify unexpected synergies between variables and may serve as an early warning system for regional planners.

AB A participatory research programme was conducted in the groundnut basin of Senegal, where there was a need to intensify the local farming systems. The research yielded a set of technical references and profitable innovations, which were introduced through specific development actions. The technology transfer aims at the establishment of sustainable farming systems and takes into account the climatic risks and innovation costs. Identification of research themes and implementation of results was based on various analyses: climatic analysis at regional level (establishment of climatic zones) and identification of constraints at farm level. Farmers' interests and the research results were combined to define suitable interventions for each surveyed farm, with the aim of increasing farm income and restoring soil fertility. The research also yielded elements for formulating an appropriate and realistic agricultural policy for the region. Clearly, the development of livestock farming activities is essential in bringing new economic life into the region and increasing the sustainability of farming systems in erratic climatic conditions.

AB Over-population in relation to poor land productivity and cultivation in less fertile lands is resulting in land degradation and deforestation in UP hills. Growing demand of more food production and increasing need for more cash in hand have forced the hill people to cultivate all kinds of land, resulting in the denudation of land resources and soil erosion. These changes resulted in out migration of the area's human resource. A new management system for the revival of natural rt:sources and the sustainable utilization of the area's human population and livestock has been proposed, involving active local participation in order to change the existing land-use to a system based on the soil fertility scale.

AB This article illustrates how poor women were able to move out of poverty and dehumanization through a process of mobilization, conscientization and organization. They also overcame the ill effects of patriarchy and asserted their rights to resources to which they were entitled. The process was catalyzed by the intervention of an NGO, the Working Women's Forum. Elements in a new accumulation process at the base of the informal economy are identified. The process shows how organizations of poor women helped them move from below the poverty line and bare survival to sustainable levels of economic and human development. Through a holistic approach, poor women saved even with their low level of income, invested, created assets, repaid loans, put technological and managerial capability into their economic activities and incorporated social dimensions like primary health care, family welfare and literacy into their lives. From their savings, they created their own bank, the Working Women's Forum Credit Society. The process is now being duplicated with an internally generated momentum in other poor areas around the country.

   This article analyses the developments in the industry since 1975 and its future potential, together with the implications for sugar exports.
   Oil prices are lower now than before the first oil crisis, but production costs of ethanol have also been reducing by an average of 3.4% a year in the Centre-South region. In addition, a true economic comparison should take into account the benefits to the greenhouse effect, pollution reduction in large cities and the employment provided.

ID RESEARCH SUPPORT PROGRAM
AB Today's rapidly changing world offers new opportunities for Departments of Animal Science that wish to expand their international activity. Seeking a relevant role in the definition of sustainable agriculture, internationalizing courses and curricula for all students, supporting private sector enterprises at home and abroad (export promotion), maintaining collaboration with former students, and providing better information to our farmers and citizens about world conditions: these are some of the challenges now facing us. A survey of heads of departments of animal science at universities in the United States revealed that of 64 respondents, almost all report significant international activities. However, only 20% are satisfied with their present activity level, and 80% intend to seek an expanded international role. The expected benefits from international activity most often mentioned were a broadened faculty experience and a better capacity to prepare students for the 21st century. Anticipated problems are related to faculty and departmental recognition, faculty career trajectories, and continuity of work assignments. On balance, respondents overwhelmingly believe that expected benefits outweigh possible problems. Eighty percent of respondents reported a generally supportive attitude from their administration, but 75% indicated that the department itself needs to provide leadership in the search for new international linkages.

AB The long-term sustainability of animal agriculture is examined in an ecological context. As an aid to defining agriculture, animal agriculture, and sustainable agriculture, a broad overview of the structural and functional aspects of ecosystems is presented. Energy output/cultural energy input ratios were then calculated for 11 beef cattle management systems as relative measures of their long-term sustainability. Energy output was estimated by direct conversion of whole body mass of steers to caloric values. Cultural energy inputs were estimated using published forage and cereal grain production budgets in combination with estimated organic matter intakes. Cultural energy inputs included raw materials, manufacturing, distribution, maintenance, and depreciation of all equipment and products used in a 250-animal cow-calf farm/ranch operation. Management systems evaluated included 1) spring calving with slaughter beginning at either weaning (age of calf approximate to 6 mo) or after 84, 168, or 252 d in postweaning finishing lot; 2) spring calving with slaughter beginning at about 18 mo of age after either 0, 42, 84, or 126 d in finishing lot; and 3) fall calving with slaughter beginning at about 14 mo of age after either 63, 126, or 189 d in finishing lot. Estimated efficiencies were < 1.0 in all treatments, even when assumed marketed calf crop was 100%. Product energy output/cultural energy input ratios ranged from a high of .40 in the spring calving --> stocker --> 126 d in finishing lot treatment to a low of .23 in the spring calving --> slaughter at weaning treatment. The low levels of efficiency were found to be largely the result of the interaction effects of the high levels of cultural energy required to maintain a productive cow herd and grow and finish calves in the rather harsh environment of the Northern Great Plains. Results pointedly reveal the high level of dependency of the U.S. beef cattle industry on fossil fuels. These findings in turn bring into question the ecological and economic risks associated with the current technology driving North American animal agriculture.

TI Role of ruminant livestock in sustainable agricultural systems
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE

DE sustainable agriculture; ruminants; nutrient use
AB Ruminants have served and will continue to serve a valuable role in sustainable agricultural systems. They are particularly useful in converting vast renewable resources from rangeland, pasture, and crop residues or other by-products into food edible for humans. With ruminants, land that is too poor or too erodable to cultivate becomes productive. Also, nutrients in by-products are utilized and do not become a waste-disposal problem. The need to maintain ruminants to utilize these humanly inedible foodstuffs and convert them into high-quality foods for human consumption has been a characteristic of advanced societies for several thousand years. Further, ruminant livestock production is entirely consistent with proper agronomy practices in which forages are grown on 25% of arable land to minimize water and soil erosion. Questions have been asked, however, about the use of humanly edible foodstuffs (grains, protein sources, etc.) in ruminant diets. Does their use create a net loss of nutrients for human consumption? What level of their use is necessary or desirable? Does the use of some of these improve the nutrient (e.g. protein) quality or product value? Too often the opponents of animal agriculture evaluate the desirability of animal production on gross calorie or protein intake/output values. However, in many cases the feeds used in animal production are not consumable by humans, and in order to properly evaluate animal production, humanly consumable energy and protein intake should be used for efficiency comparisons. Analysis of the costs/returns of humanly edible energy and protein for a variety of dairy and beef cattle production systems shows that food value is increased with ruminant products, and that net returns of humanly edible nutrients are dependent on the production system used. The efficiency with which ruminants convert humanly edible energy and protein into meat or milk is highly dependent on diet, and hence, on regional production practices. Previous studies suggest that in the United States, dairy production efficiency ranges from 96 to 276% on a humanly consumable protein basis. Beef production efficiency is very dependent on the time spent in the feedlot and digestible energy and protein efficiencies range from 28 to 59% and 52 to 104%, respectively. However, beef production can add to the humanly consumable protein pool depending on the feeding schedule. In addition, the protein resulting from ruminant livestock production is of higher quality with a greater biological value than protein in the substrate feeds. The evidence that ruminant livestock belong in sustainable livestock production systems is convincing.

TI Sustainability issues of US swine production
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE swine; sustainable agriculture; manure
AB The incorporation of livestock into agricultural systems ensures a more sustainable agriculture. Sustainable swine production systems are defined as those that combine production and management techniques to enhance profit and improve the ecological and socioeconomic surroundings. Over the long term, the systems should maintain or enhance the environment and resource base, the quality of life for the producers and society as a whole, the profit level of producers, and the quality of pork produced. Swine production in the United States is rapidly changing to fewer and larger production units. At the interface of sustainable agriculture and swine production are several levels of issues. Four levels of issues are the farm, the rural community, the society or consuming public, and the ecosystem or environment. By examining each level, long-term sustainability issues for U.S.swine production emerge. Some of these issues include swine care and husbandry, producer health, management and production systems, access to markets, information, technology and genetics, producer entrance requirements, specialization, manure utilization, industry structure, pork quality and leanness, and the impact of modern intensive systems on the environment, farms, and rural communities. The challenge beyond identifying issues is to incorporate sustainable concepts into profitable, ecologically based swine production systems. Several major groups of issues are discussed, including swine industry structure change issues, access and entrance issues, manure, by-product and nuisance issues, and pork quality issues. Many of these issues can be addressed. The solutions often rely on increased education, management, or technology applications. These processes provide broad opportunities for animal scientists. Examples of current solutions are quality assurance programs, segregated age rearing techniques, educational and promotional commodity programs, manure management programs, phase feeding, diet manipulation to alter manure nutrient concentrations, young producer assistance programs, producer networking, and environmental awareness activities. There are many more opportunities for improving the sustainability of U.S. swine production, when a long-term, issue-oriented viewpoint is maintained.

DE animal agriculture; adaptive management; ecological agriculture;

ID RESIDUES; SCIENCE
AB The question of sustainability of production and the use of natural resources has become a popular topic. Most scientists agree that current systems are generally non-sustainable. Current rates of resource extraction will lead us to a depleted earth in the future. Sustainability is defined in many ways. For this paper sustainability should be considered the overlap of what is wanted and what is ecologically possible. Attempts have been made to place a quantitative measure on sustainability. However, it should be considered a trajectory or goal, a direction that guides constructive change, rather than a single quantitative measure. Research and extension personnel may have to take a broader look at their efforts and expand their knowledge base in order to address the issue of sustainable production systems. Both natural events and those caused by humans bring about changes in production potential that require shifts in management. Uncertainty and change should be incorporated into adaptive management strategies. Interdisciplinary efforts are needed to confront these issues. Animal scientists need to formulate management systems that are environmentally compatible or face restrictive legislation that will force change. Members of the American Society of Animal Science seem to agree: efficient and sustainable use of natural resources appears in the draft of the Strategic Plan of the Society, and a poll of members revealed that environmental concerns about animal agriculture was a primary issue facing animal scientists.

AB 1. The historical role of agriculture in creating semi-natural vegetation is still not fully appreciated by many ecologists, conservationists, policy-makers or the general public. Nor is the fact that for many European landscapes and biotopes of high nature conservation value, the only practicable, socially acceptable and sustainable management involves the continuation of low-intensity farming. Consequently, too much emphasis is placed on attempting to ameliorate damaging effects of agricultural management rather than supporting ecologically sustainable low-intensity farming practices.
   2. More than 50% of Europe's most highly valued biotopes occur on low-intensity farmland. However, most of this farmland has no environmental policy directly affecting it; most management decisions are taken by farm businesses and determined primarily by European and national agricultural officials. As a result, there continues to be intensification or abandonment of traditional practices, changes which are equally damaging to the nature conservation value.
   3. However, the nature conservation importance of low-intensity farming systems is gradually being recognized. Reforms and reviews of agriculture policy are providing a variety of potential opportunities for maintaining such systems. Unfortunately, initiating change through policy is a slow process. There is therefore also a pressing need to look for other opportunities to maintain surviving systems and, where possible, to reinstate those recently lost.
   4. Although these systems may be considered low-intensity in terms of chemical inputs and productivity, they are usually high-intensity in terms of human labour. Therefore, the processes that make the low-intensity farmed countryside biologically rich and diverse must be understood, but at the same time mechanisms to make life easier and more rewarding for the people who work such farmland must be found.
   5. Ecologists and conservationists should think less of 'remnants of habitat being left amongst farmland' and more of a farmland biotope for which optimum management practices need to be developed. At the same time the current emphasis on site-based conservation should be complemented by strategic initiatives that promote wise management of the wider countryside.

AB Financial, social and ecological cost and benefit criteria were used to examine the sustainability of land-use options on an upland Scottish estate. The costs and benefits of alternative land uses were examined using a psychometric modelling technique based on decision-conferencing, using an expert group of people. Three decision models based respectively on financial, social and ecological criteria were developed, compared and then integrated The management options that emerged from the integrated model as best compromises appeared to be reasonable and feasible within the framework of facts and projections available to the group. The effects of different future scenarios, such as changes in fiscal policy, were also examined using the models. A three-dimensional model constructed from a principal components analysis of the input data produced axes that seemed to reflect certain socio-political archetypes.

A simple model is developed to relate th applied force and observed depression distance to the elastic modulus of the material. A measurement on the proteinaceous sheath of the archaebacterium Methanospirillum hungatei GP1 gave a Young's modulus of 2 x 10(10) to 4 x 10(10) N/m(2). The measurements suggested that the maximum sustainable tension in the sheath was 3.5 to 5 N/m. This finding implied a maximum possible internal pressure for the bacterium of between 300 and 400 atm. Since the cell membrane and S-layer (wall) which surround each cell should be freely permeable to methane and since we demonstrate that the sheath undergoes creep (expansion) with pressure increase, it is possible that the sheath acts as a pressure regulator by stretching, allowing the gas to escape only after a certain pressure is reached. This creep would increase the permeability of the sheath to diffusible substances.

AB Nearshore coastal sand mining may adversely affect coastal development where extractions occur within the active beach-nearshore sand system. In this paper the outer limits of the beach-nearshore system are reviewed, with the inclusion of new data from Pakiri, New Zealand. These include interpretation of nearshore sedimentology, morphology, bedforms and benthic fauna, theoretical estimates of sediment movement, historic evidence of beach-nearshore morphodynamics, measurement of the seaward extent of riphead plumes during or following storm wave conditions, and stratigraphic indications of seabed erosion and deposition. There is convergent data that for east coast Australian and New Zealand moderate to high energy beaches, including Pakiri, the maximum limit of the modern beach-nearshore sand system occurs around the 25 m isobath.
   Recent interpretations of the geomorphology of the Pakiri-Mangawhai sand system, within which shallow marine mining takes place, are re-examined in light of the results of this review. The conclusion that substantial onshore sediment exchange occurs between inner shelf and nearshore environments, and that the Pakiri-Mangawhai sand system is therefore open to sediment inputs, is not sustained. The results of investigations of bedforms, subtidal facies, historic morphodynamics and theoretical estimates of sediment transport thresholds, indicates that the nearshore-inner shelf boundary approximates the 25 m isobath at Pakiri. Significant sediment transport does not occur beyond this depth over the relevant time scales. A re-analysis of the beach profile records, as well as interpretation of barrier morphostratigraphy, indicates that, contrary to most previous interpretations, the Pakiri-Mangawhai coast shows no strong accretionary trend, is at best stable and possibly erosional. We hypothesize that the weak recovery of the Pakiri-Mangawhai coast following severe erosion in 1978 may be a consequence of sand mining.
   In the Pakiri-Mangawhai context nearshore coastal sand mining entails a high risk of adversly affecting coastal processes and landforms.

AB China will face a high rate of economic growth until 2015. The consumption of natural resources has reached an unprecedented scale and waste discharge has also come close to the capacity which the environment itself can bear. Due to the great population pressure, the effect on nature of human activities for survival and development has become increasingly more formidable. By analyzing the historical heritage and the cost of development since 1949 when a new government was founded, this article forecasts China's environmental situation in the next century, specifically before 2030. It also develops a logically consistent conceptual framework for the evaluation of China's ecological and environmental issues. In the assessment model, historical, meteoric and economic methods (including the estimation of short-term environmental pollution, long-term ecological degradation and social effects) have been used to increase the reliability of forecasting.

   contaminated soils
AB Lead has been identified as one of the greatest threats to human health and is one of the common contaminants in many hazardous wastes. In this study, a surplus (waste) material, i.e., sulfur, was employed as a binder to stabilize/solidify lead contaminated soils. Soil samples were collected from a battery recovery plant, which had high levels of inorganic lead contaminant. Results obtained from the study indicated that sulfur binders can be used to stabilize/solidify inorganic lead contaminated soil which may or may not contain organic compounds. However, control samples, which used portland cement to solidify the same contaminated soils, showed that portland cement was also an effective binder. The potential applications of these solidified matrixes are also discussed. Due to the excellent physical, engineering and chemical leaching characteristics, sulfur solidified wastes could be used as construction fills, such as a subbase course in road pavement construction. Under some circumstances, use of the sulfur stabilization and solidification process will be a viable choice, especially where excess sulfur, recovered from various industrial desulfurization sites, becomes a waste product which requires disposal. The excess (waste) sulfur can be used as a stabilization agent for treating lead contaminated soil locally. Thus the two waste materials can be combined and converted into an environmentally stable material for recycling without having to be deposited in a landfill site. This by itself meets the requirements for being a sustainable technology as favored by the emerging world-wide trend of the economy for the future.

The short packet payloads are compressed using optical wavelength division multiplexing techniques, and remain optical from source to destination while traversing the switching nodes, The routing is done with a lean, self-routing hot potato protocol in order to avoid the need for data storage at the switching nodes and to provide a fu;ed node latency equivalent to a few meters of fiber, Sustainable throughput both into and out of the electronic host at each node should exceed 10 Gb/s, Some technical details of the switching nodes and interfaces of the recirculating shuffle network, and the stepped wavelength laser arrays and testbed will be given.

AB This paper studies the positive and normative consequences of distortionary taxation in a monetary endogenous growth model with technological externalities. It is shown that the policy implications obtained from non-monetary growth models may significantly understate the actual effects. In addition. some policies that are optimal in non-monetary models may not be sustainable when money has a role in the economy.

AB Environmental management systems (EMS's) are becoming increasingly important for continued exploration and field development worldwide. The new Intl. Standards Organization (ISO) 14000 EMS series will have a major impact on the competitiveness of the international oil and gas E&P industry, including the whole associated service sector. In clarifying the origins of the comparative strategies, this paper will provide an understanding of existing national EMS's. This will create an international perspective on the management approach needed to ensure that partnership with ISO 14000 will facilitate environmentally sustainable development.

ID EQUITY
AB Nothing inherent in the discipline steers planners either toward environmental protection or toward economic development-or toward a third goal of planning: social equity. instead, planners work within the tension generated among these three fundamental aims, which, collectively, I call the ''planner's triangle,'' with sustainable development located at its center. This center cannot be reached directly, but only approximately and indirectly, through a sustained period of confronting and resolving the triangle's conflicts. To do so, planners have to redefine sustainability, since its current formulation romanticizes our sustainable past and is too vaguely holistic. Planners would benefit both from integrating social theory with environmental thinking and from combining their substantive skills with techniques for community conflict resolution, to confront economic and environmental injustice.

TI A framework for planning sustainable residential landscapes
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The authors present a normative vision and planning framework for protecting landscapes and ecosystems. They suggest that good planning of residential environments requires that planners re-examine priorities and regulations from the point of view of sustaining landscape processes and functions. The health and prosperity of communities over the long term depends upon natural processes and landscape function. Without a healthy environment, human communities face uncertain futures. Planning to sustain landscapes implies not only a new philosophy but also different land-use practices within communities.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION

DT Article
AB The Dutch development of Integrated Environmental Zoning is an advanced effort to account cumulatively for several environmental spillovers from manufacturing, and to manage their impacts on surrounding residential areas. This national policy initiative involves mapping the spatial patterns of pollution within urban areas, information that informs the development of abatement programs and of land-use regulations to locate manufacturing activities and housing in a sustainable manner. In eleven pilot projects testing this system, it has met with enthusiasm but also aroused public concern over identified cases of acute pollution, and political controversy over the required mitigation measures.

DE soil properties; semi arid areas; degradation; statistical difference;
   rehabilitation; fallowing; topsoil; subsoil
AB Land degradation in semi-arid regions of Nigeria is a very serious problem and therefore rehabilitation of degraded lands is essential. This article reports the results of an investigation which was carried out to assess the extent to which fallowing rehabilitates degraded lands in a semi-arid area in northern Nigeria. An inferential approach was used which involved side-by-side comparison of plots located within an area of uniform climatic, geologic and geomorphic characteristics, but which have been under fallow for different periods of time (2, 5, 10 or 15 years). Using a systematic sampling procedure, topsoil and subsoil samples were collected from each of the fallow plots and also from a plot under a plant community of well over 80 years of age which was chosen to serve as the control (fairly natural vegetation). The extent to which the land of each fallow plot had been rehabilitated could be assessed by comparison with the condition of the control plot. The samples were analysed for texture, bulk density, water-stable aggregates greater than 0.50 mm, moisture content, organic matter, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total nitrogen, available phosphorus and exchangeable bases. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique was used to test for significant differences amongst the fallow plots, while Student's t-test was used to compare the mean values of the soil properties of the control with the same properties under each of the fallow plots. The results obtained varied considerably, but in general it was observed that there were decreases in the coarsening of soil texture and bulk density, but increases in other soil properties with increases in the length of the fallow period. However, the changes were generally found to be more significant under the older fallows (10 and 15 years) than under the newer fallows (2 and 5 years). The causes of these trends and their implication for sustainable land development in the area are discussed. It is concluded that for land rehabilitation to be effective in this area, either fallow times must be quite long, or ways of improving the soil's recuperative capacities under short-term fallow should be sought.

DE Zimbabwe; land degradation; soil and water conservation; land husbandry;

AB Based on the results of an erosion damage assessment in Southern Zimbabwe, where mechanical conservation work has been carried out since the 1940s, this paper describes the impact of mechanical conservation systems on processes leading to rill erosion. In a study of a catchment area, it was found that influxes of water from roads and waterways as well as contour ridges that were originally designed to control rill erosion had a major role in the formation of rills. Existing rills and depressions which cause water concentration, siltation of contour drains and over-flowing of contour ridges were the main factors leading to excessive rill erosion. The study showed that particularly during a highly erosive year like 1992/93, the damage due to rill erosion can be excessive, causing an abrupt degradation.
   It is concluded that the present conservation system is insufficient to control rill erosion effectively and is often the cause of this erosion. Effective control of rill erosion is a pre-condition for optimal implementation of land management systems such as conservation tillage. Therefore, an integrated approach to land husbandry must be developed jointly with farmers and promoted in order to improve crop production and sustainable management of natural resources. This should consider improved mechanical conservation as well as agronomic and biological soil and water conservation techniques.

AB The environmental deterioration of the Danube River basin calls for unprecedented cooperation among the ten riparian and seven non-riparian basin countries, the majority of which are undergoing major economic and political transformations after the breakup of the Soviet Union. This paper discusses the recent legal and institutional developments along with the political hurdles leading to a post-Soviet regime for managing the Danube River and promoting sustainable development in the basin. After reviewing the geography and ecology, the conflicts and political issues of the Danube, the current efforts at building cooperative institutions are discussed. The question whether the Danube will be exclusively the responsibility of the basin countries, will include the Russian Federation and other countries of the Black Sea, or will be the responsibility of pan-European institutions in close connection with the European Union is addressed.

TI Profitability and sustainability of peri-urban vegetable production
   systems in Vietnam
SO NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE peri-urban; profitability; sustainability; vegetables; Vietnam
AB Urban populations in Vietnam are growing up to almost four times as fast as in rural areas, fueling the demand for timely supplies of fresh Vegetables to cities. Much of this increased demand, particularly for the more perishable species, is satisfied through peri-urban production which has significantly increased since the change from centrally planned and collective systems to a market economy. Around Ho Chi Minh City farms are small (on average about 0.8 hectare), two-thirds which are defacto owned and with about 60% dedicated to vegetables. Most vegetable farmers also grow rice and/or groundnut, while cabbage is the most commonly grown vegetable crop. Vegetables provide about $1000 total revenues, or $650 added value (returns to labor, land and management) year(-1) farm(-1). Added value day(-1) hectare(-1) of vegetables is double or more than that for rice, providing employment for five or more times the number for rice, despite very high labor use. The negative correlation between farm size and cropping intensity suggests that labor is a factor limiting vegetable production enterprises. One of the major demands on labor is for irrigation. Major input costs relate to organic materials, chemical fertilizers and pesticides, although much variability exists between crops. Pests, and low and variable vegetable prices, were the most commonly cited constraints. The latter is subject to previously unknown market forces, while for the former some integrated pest management practices are being used. There is a clear trough in vegetable supply during August to October following the hot-wet months, and an apparent overuse of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Lack of communal purchase of inputs and marketing limit the success of market-oriented vegetable farms.

AB It has become increasingly clear during the last few decades that meeting the food needs of the world's growing population depends, to a large extent, on the conservation and utilization of the world's remaining plant genetic resources. it is in this context that the International Technical Conference on Plant Genetic Resources takes place in Leipzig, Germany in June 1996. Organized by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, in close cooperation with IPGRI and other partners, the Conference will bring together experts and officials from more than 150 countries to review and finalize the first comprehensive report on the State of the World's Plant Genetic Resources for Food cmd Agriculture (FAG, 1996) and consider for formal adoption a Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. The Conference aims to mobilize global action to safeguard plant genetic resources for future generations and to ensure their sustainable and equitable use.

TI Sustainable agricultural development for small farmers in Nepal: Myth or
   reality?
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Small and marginal farmers in Nepal mostly depend on their farms and the forests for their livelihoods. But continued population growth and increasing demands for food, shelter and cloth have stepped up the pressure on land and other natural resources. Furthermore, there is evidence that farmers have been extending the agricultural production area largely by clearing vast tracts of virgin forest, which are a precious natural resource. This has been creating both environmental and economic problems. Because small and marginal farmers have to survive below the subsistence level, in self-perpetuating dismal conditions, 'sustainable agricultural development' for them remains a myth rather than a reality.

In the past years significant progress has been made for the benefit of environmentally-sound processes and environmentally-friendly products. Currently, forestry is of significant concern in the global framework. The indispensible organic additives are not any more attacked, apart from a few substances. The paper chain is a good example for sustainable development thanks to renewable raw materials used and different cycles (carbon dioxide cycle, recycling of waste paper, closure of white water systems), but also thanks to savings of raw materials and energy.

AB It has long been stressed that diethylcarbamazine citrate must be given at a total dosage of 72 mg per kilogram of body weight in 12 divided doses of 6 mg kg(-1) to obtain maximum effect against Wuchereria bancrofti. However, recent studies revealed that only a single dose at 6 mg kg(-1) could reduce microfilaria (Mf) counts by 90%, and that the effect would persist for 12-18 months. The annual repeat of the single-dose mass treatment was shown to be effective in reducing Mf prevalence and density in large-scale, long-term field trials. The scheme is simple and economic, and could be sustainable in many endemic areas, where health manpower and resources are often not sufficient. Annual single-dose mass treatments can be an effective weapon against human lymphatic filariasis, as discussed here by Eisaku Kimura and Jona Mataika.

AB The note describes a line of inquiry into social, economic, and environmental interactions as a basis for avoiding undesirable outcomes and pursuing promising ones. First it reports empirical results suggesting that the recommendations of the Brundtland Report (which popularized ''sustainable development'' as a social objective), contrary to the document's intentions and claims, would put increasing pressure on the environment over the next several decades. Based on this conclusion, the note argues that: (1) The choice of technology in production facilities and the lifestyle choices of different kinds of households are two areas in which changes can actually be made. (2) If we are able to provide new alternative strategies for changes in lifestyles and technologies, the analytic framework that is described can be used to examine the likely consequences. New concepts and methods are proposed for the systematic description of lifestyles and lifestyle alternatives.

TI Chinese government white paper on family planning
SO POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The long-expected ''White Paper'' on China's population policy was issued by the Information Office of the State Council on 23 August 1995. Entitled ''Family Planning in China,'' the document consists of seven fairly short chapters, bracketed by a ''Foreword'' and ''Concluding remarks.'' The opening sentence of the former (''Excessive population growth is an extremely serious problem facing the contemporary world'') and the closing sentence of the latter (''China, as always, will ... make positive contributions to stabilizing world population and ensuring a happier future for mankind'') characterize the overall tone of the White Paper. Its release on the eve of the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, was probably not merely coincidental: the presentation of China's population policy and the arguments offered as its rationale appear to address primarily an international audience. The opening and closing chapters of the White Paper (Chapters I and VII) and the ''Concluding remarks'' are reproduced below, in the official English translation.
   While the White Paper invokes the Program of Action adopted at the 1994 Cairo Conference on Population and Development, the differences in tone and emphasis between the two documents are striking. The Program (Para. 7.12) states that ''The aim of family-planning programmes must be to enable couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children....'' In the White Paper, responsibility is understood to be defined by the State and is transmuted to obligation to the collective welfare. The need for population programs is given a clearly articulated macroeconomic rationale. It is elaborated in terms reminiscent of classic Malthusian formulations, placing, in particular, special emphasis on population-resources ratios and on constraints imposed by limited agricultural capacity. The aim of the ''strategic policy of family planning'' is described as a need resolutely to control ''excessively rapid population growth.'' Success in that endeavor is necessary in order to bring about ''sustained economic growth and sustainable development, satisfying the daily increasing material and cultural demand of the whole people, and guaranteeing the fundamental and long-term interests of the current generation and their posterity.''
   Criticisms of China's population program on human rights grounds are explicitly acknowledged by the White Paper and are firmly rejected as unacceptable interference with China's internal affairs. Citing the Cairo Program, the White Paper invokes national sovereignty in population matters: ''The formulation and implementation of population-related policies is the responsibility of each country and should take into account the economic, social and environmental diversity of conditions of each country.'' The White Paper notes that rights are never absolute. ''When there is conflict between social needs and individual interests, a means has to be sought to mediate it. This is something that the government of every sovereign country is doing. As China has a large population, the Chinese government has to limit the number of births of its citizens.''

TI US population and sustainable development
SO POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB In 1993 the US government established an advisory body named the President's Council on Sustainable Development. The Council comprises some 30 members drawn from senior levels of the Clinton Administration, CEOs of major corporations, and heads of environmental groups. It includes the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, and the Interior; its cochairs are the Corporate Director of the Dow Chemical Company and the President of the World Resources Institute. The Council's remit is to advise President Clinton on sustainable development, ''the idea that the quality of the country's future rests on integrating the economy, equity, and environment in national policy. ''In February 1996 the Council issued a report, entitled Sustainable America: A New Consensus for Prosperity, Opportunity, and a Healthy Environment for the Future (available from she US Government Printing Office). Chapter 6 of this report, ''U.S. Population and Sustainability,'' is reproduced below.
   The Council lists ten broad goals that together would make for sustainability of US development. They range from the tangible-a healthy environment, access to education-so the elusive-civic engagement, an ethic of stewardship. One of the goals, in so many words, is: ''Move toward stabilization of U.S. population.'' The report notes that the country's present population growth is at a rate equivalent to adding another California every decade. This growth amplifies the effects of consumption patterns and waste generation as threats to sustainability: ''Stabilizing the population without changing consumption and waste production patterns would not be enough, but it would make an immensely challenging task more manageable. In the United States, each is necessary; neither alone is sufficient.''
   The Council's policy recommendations in this area call for more publicly financed family planning services to lessen unintended and teenage pregnancies; public and private sector efforts to generate more opportunities for women; and fostering of personal responsibility. (According to a figure cited in the report-applying an evidently exacting definition of intentionality-60 percent of pregnancies in the United States are unintended.) On immigration, which has become a contentious issue in national politics, the Council adopts a neutral stance. It supports ''creation of policies that recognize both the nation's historic acceptance of immigrants as well as the need to limit population growth,'' but for further details defers to the US Commission on Immigration Reform that was set tip by Congress and is due to report in 1997.
   While ifs focus is on domestic policies, the report occasionally looks further afield. An introductory listing of shared premises and beliefs includes, as item no. 11: ''The United States should have policies and programs that contribute to stabilizing global human population; this objective is critical if we hope to have the resources needed to ensure a high quality of life for future generations.''

The external-cost method shares the connecting cost of user i among all of his correspondents in proportion to their traffic with i. All convex combinations of these two methods are characterized by three axioms: additivity with respect to connecting costs, sustainability (it is not profitable for any subnetwork to duplicate equipment for inside traffic), and no transit (it is not profitable for any three users i, j, and k to make some of the traffic between i and j transit through k).

AB Heightening human impacts on the Earth result in widespread losses of production and conservation values and make large-scale ecosystem restoration increasingly urgent. Tackling this problem requires the development of general guiding principles for restoration so that we can move away from the ad hoc, site- and situation-specific approach that now prevails. A continuum of restoration efforts can be recognized, ranging from restoration of localized highly degraded sites to restoration of entire landscapes for production and/or conservation reasons. We emphasize the importance of developing restoration methodologies that are applicable at the landscape scale. Key processes in restoration include identifying and dealing with the processes leading to degradation in the first place, determining realistic goals and measures of success, developing methods for implementing the goals and incorporating them into land-management and planning strategies, and monitoring the restoration and assessing its success. Few of these procedures are currently incorporated in many restoration projects. The concept that many ecosystems are likely to exist in alternative stable states, depending on their history, is relevant to the setting of restoration goals. A range of measures, such as those being developed to measure ecosystem health, could be used to develop ''scorecards'' for restoration efforts. Generalizable guidelines for restoration on individual sites could be based on the concepts of designed disturbance, controlled colonization, and controlled species performance. Fewer explicit guidelines are available at the landscape scale, beyond nonquantitative generalities about size and connectivity. Development of these guidelines is an important priority so that urgent large-scale restoration can be planned and implemented effectively.

AB The Political Constitution of Chile establishes the right of the people to live in ail environment which is free from contamination. The State has a duty to uphold this right and to preserve nature. With the aim of reconciling this constitutional guarantee with the pursuit of profitable economic activities the concept of 'sustainable development' has been promoted. This mechanism makes it possible to use natural resources and the environment in a rational, effective and efficient manner both at present and in the future, and led to the promulgation of the General Law of Fisheries and Aquaculture No. 18,892 of 6 September 1991 and its amendments.
   This law regulates national fisheries and aquaculture activities throughout the country, and contains eleven regulations applicable to aquaculture. These regulations form a complete procedure of action relevant to the importation of aquatic species, to applicants for aquaculture concessions and authorisations, to the operation of these concessions and authorisations, and to ocean ranching systems.
   Due to the complexity of these regulations, important rules are still under study, while the remaining texts come into force on 1 September 1996. Formulating these rules involves consideration of current national and international regulations, the experience of farmers, the results of technical and scientific research, and bibliographical data. These regulations will form the cornerstone of Chilean aquaculture policy in confronting the challenges of the next century.

AB Low densities of Pontoscolex corethrurus have been introduced into low-input cropping systems at Yurimaguas (Peru) to test their effects on soil fertility under field conditions for six successive cropping cycles. Earthworm biomass was sustained at 40g m(-2) fw (ca. 3 g ash-free dry mass) on the average with peak values of 80 g at harvests 2 and 3 in treatments receiving an application of legume green manure. At the 6th harvest, earthworm biomass was significantly lower in the treatment with no organic input than in treatments with crop residues and legume green manure. Earthworm activities did not prevent C and nutrient stocks from being significantly depleted although P, K and Ca concentrations tended to be higher than in non-inoculated treatments at the 6th harvest. Plant production was significantly increased by 36% due to earthworm inoculation in a traditional low-input rotation (maize, rice, cowpea, rice, rice, rice) with variation between -43 and +78%, depending on the crop and climatic conditions. In a continuous maize culture that received fertilizers for the last three crops, grain production was increased by 2.45-fold on average, due to earthworm inoculation. These results demonstrate that the maintenance of active earthworm populations was favourable to crop production during the time scale of our experiments (3 y). Longer term experiments are required to test the sustainability of the positive effects observed. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd

TI The educational psychologist and school organization development in the
   reconstruction of education in South Africa: Issues and challenges
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY-SUID-AFRIKAANSE TYDSKRIF VIR
   SIELKUNDE
LA English
DT Article
AB In South Africa, as the myriad of 'apartheid holy cows' are buried, so the opportunity for reconstruction takes on an unprecedented challenge. The renewal of South Africa's dishevelled education system is central to the country's renaissance. Against this backdrop, this article briefly describes some current positions on systems thinking and educational psychology service delivery in the South African context. Derived mainly from a formative evaluation of a Cape Town-based teacher in-service project which focuses on whole school development, three substantive issues related to school organization development are raised. They are the issue of effecting a paradigm shift from a positivistic to a systemic worldview; the issue of the relationship between power and organization development, and the issue of sustainability of organization development. These issues are discussed with particular reference to the challenges that they present to educational psychologists as school organization development consultants in South Africa's education reconstruction process.

TI Cost/benefit analysis of a sorghum hybrid resistant to sorghum midge
   (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae)
SO SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
LA English
DT Article
ID GERMPLASM LINE; REGISTRATION; MANAGEMENT
AB The economic benefits resulting from the use of sorghum cultivars resistant to sorghum midge, Stenodiplosis sorghicola (Coquillett), were compared with the research and development costs. In 1984 dollars, the cost to develop the technology was approximately $2,720,000. For each dollar invested in research and development of a sorghum midge-resistant sorghum hybrid, the value of benefits to increased crop yields from the use of the resistant hybrid ranged from $24.2 at a 5% discount rate (the interest rate used to determine the present value of annual benefits and/or costs collected over time) when no insecticide was used to $2.7 at a 20% discount rate when insecticide was applied five times. The average value of benefits to increased crop yields at zero, three, and five insecticide applications at discount rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20% was $9.9 for each dollar spent to develop the technology. The intangible benefits that accrue to society as a result of the development and use of insect-resistant sorghum were not estimated. Important benefits from the development and deployment of sorghum midge-resistant sorghums include reduced crop production costs and greater yield, as well as enhanced sustainability of the sorghum production system and the conservation of natural and biological resources.

AB Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) engaged in implementing small and micro enterprise (SME) projects in underdeveloped nations are often interested in achieving sustainability beyond the project phase. This article identifies several key aspects of a ''sustainable'' institution and provides a sample of analytical tools for designing or monitoring SME efforts. The authors provide a definition of sustainability that considers both the continuity of the implementing agencies as well as the continuation of project benefits.

TI The ecological impact of time
SO TIME & SOCIETY

DT Article
DE time; time-scale; rhythm; ecology; sustainable development
AB The increasingly technical nature of the industrial way of life has brought about dramatic changes in the temporality of socio-environmental problems. Local, shortterm, acute disturbances in the environment have turned into global, long-term, chronic perturbations, and yet both the scientific and socio-political solutions offered for environmental problems are usually of a distinctly short-term nature. Despite the centrality of the time factor, time in all of its multiple expressions - as tempo, temporality, timing and rhythm, and so forth - has not yet received the attention it deserves. This paper suggests that the failure to engage with time has hastened the environmental crisis to its present proportions. Inclusion of the time factor in ecological (as well as in social and economic) discussions thus has worldwide consequences not only for humanity's understanding of and relationship with nature, but also for proposed solutions to the environmental crisis.

AB Visitors to publicly owned national parks, wildlife reserves and other natural areas pay entrance fees and other charges for their access and use, What principles and criteria contribute to an appropriate pricing policy? The answers to this are complex because of multiple pricing objectives, visitor categories, visitor activities, fee instruments and philosophical positions, In this review paper, these issues are examined from the perspective of public agencies that are working to improve their pricing practices, Pricing is a potentially powerful tool to move towards greater efficiency, fairness and environmentally sustainable management, To date, this tool is underutilized.

AB This paper examines three themes in the development of tourism in Estonia since independence in 1991: the role of tourism in integrated rural development, the symbolic imagery of contemporary tourism and its sustainability, It draws attention to conflicts between the economic advantages of an expansion in tourism and its sociocultural and environmental influences, In particular, it argues that the benefits of rural tourism may not be as large as has sometimes been suggested, and that many of these will accrue more directly to the urban sector of the economy.

AB In order to support the development of sustainable tourism throughout Europe, the Tourism Unit, DGXXIII of the Commission of the European Communities funded a number of projects in this field during 1995. This report explains one of these projects, which involved the development of educational resources to examine the issues in and approaches to sustainable tourism management and the practical application of these ideas in different European contexts, and then the dissemination of these resources to tourism educators throughout Europe. The project involved collaboration between the University of Deusto (Ana Goytia), Spain; Loughborough University (Inn Henry and Guy Jackson), UK; Sheffield Hallam University (Bill Bramwell), UK; and Tilburg University (Greg Richards and Jan van der Straaten), The Netherlands. The resources on sustainable tourism management are being disseminated through the network of the European Association for Tourism and Leisure Education (ATLAS).

TI Aflaj water resources management: Tradable water rights to improve
   irrigation productivity in Oman
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Traditional surface irrigation systems of aflaj provide more than 60 per cent of the fresh water supply in the Sultanate of Oman and irrigate around 55 per cent of the cropped area. Over the years, these systems have set traditions for intertemporal water resources allocation and a process of users rights established on ownership and/or rent basis. A management structure has been generated to organize, maintain and distribute aflaj water resources. This article examined the system of trading water rights in order to identify opportunities for improved water use and distribution. Evaluation of the system revealed potential flaws which hinder efficient aflaj water resources use, and which arise from the traditional social rules of water rental and pricing, interregional water immobility, lack of development within the on-surface distribution system, and the speculative mortgage option generated by the water exchange system. Specific actions are recommended to improve the use and distribution of aflaj water resources. These include restructuring of the aflaj management, improvement of the operation of water tradable system, sustainable use of aflaj water and specific actions of aflaj water sustainability. Careful considerations, however must be given to prevailing social rules and habits governing aflaj management.

DT Article
DE playa; soil characteristics; Southern High Plains; nitrogen; phosphorus;

ID DRAWDOWN; MARSH; LAKES
AB We evaluated effects of moist-soil management on soils of eight playa wetlands for 2 years. Moist-soil management involves timed drawdown and irrigation of wetlands to promote germination, growth, and seed production of mudflat annuals for use by wintering waterfowl. Moist-soil management reduced soil resistance for germination (P = 0.02), raised pH closer to neutrality (P = 0.002), but had no effect on soil moisture in the top 4 cm of soil (P = 0.16; influence on soil moisture in the root zone is unknown) or on salinity measured as conductivity (P = 0.51). Moist-soil management did not affect nitrogen and phosphorus levels in playa soils over 2 seasons (P = 0.61). As a percentage of available nutrients, more soil nitrogen was lost during the wetter year compared to the dryer year (P = 0.02) - a trend that was reversed for soil phosphorus (P = 0.004). More nitrogen was lost in the wetter year (P = 0.02); whereas, more phosphorus was lost in the dryer year (P = 0.004). This indicates potential changes in limiting nutrients depending upon local precipitation events. Apparently, nutrient cycling is rapid in playas, producing large amounts of biomass despite having lower soil nutrient pools compared to other inland freshwater wetlands. Moist-soil management is a sustainable and compatible practice for playa wetlands because it enhances naturally occurring events.

AB The water-quality characteristics of a new system for the integrated culture of fish (Sparus aurata L.) and seaweed (Ulva lactuca L.) were examined, Seawater was recirculated between intensive fishponds and seaweed ponds, The seaweed removed most of the ammonia excreted by the fish and oxygenated the water. A model consisting of several tanks and a pilot consisting of two 100-m(3), 100-m(2) ponds were studied, In both, the metabolically dependent water-quality parameters (dissolved oxygen, NH4+-N, oxidized-N, pH and phosphate) remained stable and within safe limits for the fish during over 2 years of operation, The design allowed significant increases in overall water residence time (4.9 days), compared with conventional intensive ponds, and produced a high yield of seaweed in addition to the fish, The design provides a practical solution to major management and environmental problems of land-based mariculture.

AB Medicine and public health sciences are applied sciences. The research upon which these are based is mission-oriented and as such they are underlain by advocacy. Ecological sciences, by way of parallel, involve managing ecological systems so they can remain healthy to support productive natural processes and the human population. In any ecosystem, however, renewal has associated with it naturally occurring background levels of diseases and death. These are normal in all biological systems. 'Sustainable development' has been focused on commodity-based, managed systems where the goal is to ensure that the needs of growing human populations are met, producing healthy people. This objective is deemed by the Ecological Society of America to be too narrow. Priority should rather be given to the sustainability of natural ecosystems, otherwise the biosphere that sustains all life forms is neglected. Epidemiologists concerned with the health of populations need to recognize that human health and the health of natural systems have entwined destinies. Some convictions about limits, about the role of disease, degeneration, and death in healthy, that is, stable and sustainable human ecologies, ought to be embedded into any ethics for epidemiologists.

AB Varanus mertensi is a semiaquatic lizard that lives near permanent water in northern Australia. During the wet and dry seasons, we measured the field metabolic rate (FMR) and water flux rates of animals in the field and standard metabolic rates across a range of body temperatures (18-96 C) in the laboratory. We combined these data to divide the FMR into energy expended during periods of rest and activity. The FMR was significantly higher in the wet season (120.7 kJ kg(-1) day(-1)) than in the dry season (81.1 kJ kg(-1) day(-1)). There was no difference in the water flux rate between the wet (63.2 ml kg(-1) day(-1)) and dry (66.5 ml kg(-1) day(-1)) seasons. The FMR during the wet season is greater than that predicted for a similarly sized iguanid lizard, but the 95% confidence interval around the mean FMR in the dry season overlaps the predicted iguanid value. The calculated percent of the FMR devoted to activity is high for both seasons (70-73%) compared to other lizards, as is the calculated sustainable metabolic scope (3.4-3.7), When compared to terrestrial varanid lizards living in the same area during their active seasons, V. mertensi does not show any quantitative differences in FMR or water flux. Varanus mertensi does differ from these terrestrial species in not having an inactive period during the dry season, and we suggest that this is related to the continual availability of food and water in its habitat.

TI Groundwater recharge in the Victoria Nile basin of east Africa: Support
   for the soil moisture balance approach using stable isotope tracers and
   flow modelling
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID WATER
AB Across equatorial Africa, increasing demand for groundwater has raised concerns about resource sustainability and has highlighted the need for reliable estimates of groundwater recharge. Recharge investigations in this environment are typically inhibited by a shortage of good quality meteorological and hydrogeological records. Moreover, when recharge studies are attempted they tend to rely on a single technique and frequently lack corroborating evidence to substantiate recharge predictions. In recent studies undertaken in the Aroca catchment of the Victoria Nile basin in central Uganda, the timing and magnitude of recharge determined by a soil moisture balance approach are supported by stable isotope data and groundwater flow modelling. The soil moisture balance study reveals that recharge averages in the order of 200 mm year(-1) and is more dependent on the number of heavy (more than 10 mm day(-1)) rainfall events than the total annual volume of rainfall. Stable isotope data suggest independently that recharge occurs during the heaviest rains of the monsoons, and further establish that recharge stems entirely from the direct infiltration of rainfall, an assumption implicit in the soil moisture balance approach. Deforestation over the last 30 years is shown to have more than doubled the recharge estimate. Aquifer flow modelling supports the recharge estimates but demonstrates that the vast majority (over 99%) of recharging waters must be transmitted by the aquifer in the regolith rather the underlying bedrock fractures which have traditionally been developed for rural water supplies.

AB With the collapse of fisheries in many parts of the world causing widespread economic harm, attention is focused on a possible cause and remedy of fishery collapse, Economic theory for managing a renewable resource, such as a fishery, leads to an ecologically unstable equilibrium as difficult to maintain as balancing a marble on top of a dome, A fishery should be managed for ecological stability instead-in the analogy, as easy to maintain as keeping a marble near the base of a bowl, The goal of ecological stability is achieved if the target stock is above that producing maximum sustainable yield and harvested at less than the maximum sustainable yield, The cost of managing for ecological stability, termed ''natural insurance,'' is low if the fishery is sufficiently productive, This cost is shown to pay for itself over the long term in a variable and uncertain environment, An ecologically stable target stock may be attained either with annually variable quotas following current practice or, preferably, through a market mechanism whereby fish are taxed at dockside if caught when the stock was below target and are untaxed otherwise, In this regulatory environment, the goal of maximizing short-term revenue coincides with the goal of ecological stability, thereby also maximizing long-term revenue, This new approach to fishery management is illustrated with the recently collapsed Newfoundland fishing industry. The Newfoundland cod fishery is expected to rebuild to an ecologically stable level in about 9 years and thereafter support an annual harvest of about 75% of the 1981-1990 average.

ID SOIL; CLAY
AB Waterlogging and salinity are reducing the productivity of irrigated agriculture on clay soils in south east Australia. We compared five drainage treatments: (1) undrained control (Control); (2) mole drains (Mole); (3) mole drains formed beneath gypsum-enriched slots (GES) (Mole + GES); (4) shallow pipe drains installed beneath GES (Shallow Pipe); (5) deep pipe drains (Deep Pipe). The experiment was set out on a vertisol and our measurements were made during the growth of an irrigated onion crop.
   Over the 3 months before the spring irrigations commenced, the perched water table on the Control was less than 400 mm below the soil surface for 27% of the time, whereas the shallow drainage treatments (Treatments 2, 3 and 4) reduced this time to less than 4%. During the irrigation season, the perched water table on the Mole + GES treatment rose above 400 mm for 3% of the time. The perched water table on the Mole treatment was above 400 mm for 14% of the time, compared with 19% of the time on the Control. The Deep Pipes were less effective in reducing the depth to the perched water table, both before and during the irrigation period.
   Mole drains increased the gas-filled porosity above the drains. However, the gas-filled porosity remained below reported levels for optimum root growth. Although the drains effectively drained excess water, and lowered the water table, the hydraulic gradient was insufficient to remove all of the water from the macropores. Gypsum enriched slots above the mole drains increased the gas-filled porosity in the slots but the drainable porosity in the undisturbed soil appeared to be inadequate for optimum root growth, even though some drainage occurred near the slots.
   Discharge from the shallow drainage treatments averaged 58 mm for each irrigation, and was considerably more than the amount required to drain the macropores. The mole channels were in reasonably good condition at the end of the irrigation season, with at least 70% of the cross-sectional area of the channel open.
   Shallow subsurface drains increased onion yield by about 38%. For each day the water table was above 400 mm, the yield declined by 0.23 tonnes per hectare. Farmer adoption of shallow subsurface drainage will depend on the long-term economic benefits (influenced by the longevity of the mole channels and yield response) and the need to develop more sustainable management practices.

AB Changes in the populations of 28 species of birds typical of farmland habitats were assessed using data from seven Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) routes surveyed in southern Quebec over the last 25 years, Aerial photographs taken in the 1960s and 1980s covering 82 stops along these routes were interpreted to evaluate changes in the rural landscape. Based on the crops grown at these stops in 1992, four types of agricultural landscapes were identified: cash crops, forage crops and pastureland, crops and livestock raising, and heterogeneous landscape. An intensive bird census of these stops in June 1992 showed that species richness and abundance are greater at stops with a heterogeneous landscape than at those characterized mainly by cash crops, Cash crops (corn, wheat soybean) now cover more surface area than in the 1960s, whereas numerous dairy farms have disappeared over the past 25 years because of abandonment, urbanization and industrialization. These changes in the crops grown in the most productive agricultural regions of Quebec appear to be responsible for fluctuations in populations of a number of farmland species in the St. Lawrence Lowland. Many species associated with dairy farming, such as the Savannah Sparrow, Bobolink, Brown-headed Cowbird and Eastern Meadowlark, show decreasing population abundance, while other species such as the Ring-billed Gull and Rock Dove appear to be benefiting from the introduction of intensive agriculture.

TI Economic indicators to assess the sustainability of conservation farming

DE sustainability; conservation farming; economic indicators
AB Multiple criteria for sustainability, such as the five pillars in the FAO/IBSRAM (International Board for Soil Research and Management) Framework for the Evaluation of Sustainable Land Management (FESLM), raise difficult assessment and evaluation problems. Economic viability is included as one of the pillars in this FELSM and is essential for the sustained adoption of conservation farming projects. However, even specifying economic viability and obtaining operational and predictive indicators for it is difficult because, for one thing, the economic viability of a farming system depends upon a variety of attributes. These include the level of economic returns, the instability and uncertainty of returns, and in monetary economies, the associated financial requirements for the farming system, the availability of finance and its implications for the financial liquidity of the farm. In all economies, the amount of investment required to adopt a sustainable conservation farming project will be a major consideration. As a rule, economic viability is also related to the sustainability of the natural productivity of soils and other natural resources on which economic production partially depends, so economic indicators depend in part on non-economic factors, and a holistic approach is needed. Taking such factors into account, as well as the difficulty of predicting the future economic sustainability of conservation projects, this paper critically reviews suggestions made in the literature for developing appropriate indicators of sustainability, such as those of Lynam and Herdt (1989), as well as break-even analyses and the scope for applying various forms of cost-benefit analysis. Illustrations are drawn from the IBSRAM/ACIAR project investigating land management on vertisols and on sloping lands, e.g. in Australia and The Philippines.

AB The northern Guinea savanna in Africa (NGS) with a season length of 151-180 days and an altitude below 800 m has long been recognized as highly suitable for crop production and animal husbandry. At present, land use intensity and farming as well as livestock systems vary widely across the zone. Subsistence farming and traditional pastoralism are present as well as intensive, market-oriented production of cash crops and highly integrated crop-livestock systems. This article presents an approach for addressing the challenge of technology development and transfer in the NGS. It is based on an analysis of the evolutionary change of agricultural systems. Exogenous and endogenous determinants have been identified for the formation of, at present, four agricultural systems, five major resource domains and at least ten major farming domains in the NGS. The domains cluster areas of similar resource endowments and development potential which are at a similar point along generalized evolutionary pathways. The additional differentiation of farmer domains integrates changes in equity and externalities into the concept. Resource degradation, biotic constraints and issues of equality are briefly analyzed according to the framework.

AB Correlative and experimental approaches were used to determine the sources of phosphorus (P) that supply the labile P pools in nine soils from traditional Mexican agroecosystems. A correlation analysis was undertaken on phosphorus fractions, particle size fractions, soil pH and organic matter contents. Labile inorganic P (labile Pi) fractions correlated significantly with soil HCl-extractable Pi concentrations and soil pH. No significant correlations were found between labile phosphorus and any organic phosphorus pools or particle size fractions.
   Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) was grown in small quantities of soil and then P fractionations were carried out on the alfalfa-depleted and original soils. Alfalfa consistently depleted labile inorganic phosphorus fractions in all soils, and in five of the nine soils, inorganic phosphorus associated with calcium phosphate minerals and/or Al or Fe hydrous oxides were significantly depleted under cultivation. The bicarbonate extracted organic phosphorus fraction was significantly depleted in one soil, but no other organic phosphorus fractions were significantly depleted by the alfalfa treatment.
   These results suggest that inorganic P fractions are critical sources of phosphorus in the traditional agroecosystems studied, and that soil calcium phosphate contents may in part determine where continually cultivated agriculture can be sustained without the use of synthetic fertilizers.

AB Microalgae are potential purveyors of various natural substances of commercial value. Their use is based upon their relatively efficient photosynthetic machinery and is associated with the availability of appropriate sites, surplus CO2, nutrients, solar irradiation and heat.
   For production to meet sustainability criteria while maintaining a competitive edge, a series of cumulative conditions must be observed, along with the prerequisites of quality and naturalness. These include complete utilisation of biomass produced, media recycling, attractive yearlong production rates, low risk of contamination, low costs for biomass harvesting and for the delivery of the active principles(s) obtained as efficacious and stable ingredients. These are ever present criteria in the work developed by the authors' group, and illustrative examples will be presented briefly.
   A lengthier presentation is given on the onset and peculiarities of carotenogenesis in a Chlorella sp., as well as on the evaluation of carotenoid pigments thus obtained as ingredients in the food chain, namely by inclusion in a finishing feed in order to ensure colouring of rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) muscle.

AB The article estimates the total costs of a comprehensive program aiming at protection and sustainable management of all tropical moist forests to be USD 2.25 bill, annually in 20-30 years. As a central issue the program includes area-dependent payments to concessionaires as a compensation for additional costs related to the implementation of sustainable forest-management practices, It is argued that economic incentives at production level are far more efficient than trade measures. We suggest a development scheme based on existing organizations and consisting of a triangular arrangement with units for support, monitoring and implementation; The needed funds can be raised by an export tax of around 1.5% if levied on all timber products, Simulations using a general equilibrium model clearly demonstrates that taxes on both temperate and tropical timber products are preferable to taxes imposed solely on tropical producers.

ID COMMUNITY
AB This investigation examined the cultural context of forest onchocerciasis in several communities in the Dja-Lobo Division of southern Cameroon. The study sought to elucidate behaviors that would enhance or diminish health status relative to forest onchocerciasis and other filarial infections, and to make culturally sensitive and appropriate recommendations regarding the development of health education materials and the long-term sustainability of the ivermectin distribution program in Dja-Lobo. The study consisted of two sequential components; the first was a qualitative study of a few severely affected villages and the second was a quantitative study of 212 randomly selected heads of households from eight villages. The Boulou and Baka peoples in these communities defined general filariasis (minak) as small worms under the skin, identified flies as important transmitters of the illness, and indicated that blindness and other skin and ocular problems were a consequence of the illness. Illness of the Dja (referring to an illness found near the Dja River) was another illness that was closely linked to onchocerciasis; local people indicated it was transmitted by the black flies found near the Dja River, resulting in severe itching and leopard skin. These and other cultural-behavioral data on filariasis were used to implement a health education and distribution program.

SO ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
LA German
DT Article
AB The lack of harmonization among the fields of environmental policy, energy policy, and economic policy in Germany is obvious. Returning to a basic consensus in energy policy, with an unbiased evaluation of all energy resources, is an indispensable step for all those to whom ecology is a truly serious concept. The positions of all energy resources must be assessed with a view to national and international developments. No sources of primary energy must be excluded from that review. Nuclear power remains one of the important options in the energy mix especially from the points of view of CO2 avoidance and preventive protection of the climate. A leading industrialized nation, such as the Federal Republic of Germany, ought to be able, in the more and more important discussion about globally sustainable development, to return to a consensus across all political parties at least about the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle. Or should the philosopher; Sir Karl Popper, finally be proven right in his statement that those wanting to establish a paradise on earth must be careful not to create hell?

SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER

AB Tourism, in Australia and globally, is a growth industry. With this growth has come concern for the implications of tourism for resources and for people exposed to the periodic influx of visitors. As a result, the tourism industry has experienced increased scrutiny in regard to environmental management and efforts are being made to achieve more sustainable forms of tourism development. Reflecting this trend, a number of beach resorts along the Australian coast are now being designed and operated on ecologically sensitive lines, and there is increasing evidence that tourism developers are seeking effective ways of monitoring and evaluating their environmental performance. Environmental auditing is seen as a useful approach for determining the extent to which coastal resorts are in compliance with regulatory requirements and environmental standards and policies. In this paper, a conceptual and systematic framework and procedures for an environmental auditing program, within which a series of activities can be carried out and decisions made, are presented. These, then, help define a set of desired conditions and the management actions necessary to maintain or restore those conditions. The need to improve the process of monitoring and evaluating the environmental performance of tourism development, and to incorporate the results of such monitoring and evaluation into decision-making processes, will become even more crucial in the future. The challenge facing Australian tourism development is to endorse an effective self-monitoring and evaluation process before mandatory compliance measures are imposed by regulatory authorities from outside the industry.

AB Recent interest in soil tillage and residue management has focused on low-input sustainable agriculture. In this study we investigated the effect of three tillage systems (no-till, chisel plow, and moldboard plow) and four residue placements (bare, normal, mulch, and double mulch) on the activities of four amidohydrolases (amidase, L-asparaginase, L-glutaminase, and urease) in soils from four replicated field-plots. Correlation coefficients (r) for linear regressions between the activities of each of the enzymes and organic C or pH and between all possible paired amidohydrolases were also calculated. The results showed that the effects of tillage and residue management on pH in the 28 surface soil (0-15 cm) samples were not significant. The organic C content, however, was affected significantly by the different tillage and residue-management practices studied, being the greatest in soils with no-till/double mulch treatment, and the least with no-till/bare and moldboard/normal treatments. Within the same tillage system, mulch treatment resulted in greater organic C content compared with normal or bare treatment. The activities of the amidohydrolases studied were generally greater in mulch-treated plots than in non-treated plots, and were significantly correlated with organic C contents of soils, with r values ranging from 0.70*** to 0.90***. Linear regression analyses of enzyme activities on pH values (in 0.01 M CaCl2) of the 28 surface soils showed significant correlations for L-asparaginase, L-glutaminase, and urease, with r values of 0.74***, 0.77***, and 0.72***, respectively, but not for amidase (r=0.24). The activities of the four amidohydrolases studied in the 40 soil samples tested were significantly intercorrelated, with r values ranging from 0.72*** to 0.92***. The activities of the four amidohydrolases decreased with increasing soil depth of the plow layer, and were accompanied by a decrease in organic C content.

TI The use of renewable resources: Possibilities and limitations
SO CHIMIA
LA German
DT Article
AB The quest for sustainable development of economically and ecologically attractive technologies is stimulating interest in better utilization of biomass and agricultural materials as renewable resources for chemicals, fuel, and polymers. In comparison to 'biodiesel' fuel, involving high energy consumption in biomass conversion, incineration of biomass, especially of agricultural wastes, represents the preferred route to energy production combined with reduced total carbon dioxide emission.
   Carbohydrates and plant oils are attractive renewable raw materials for the production of a wide range of chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and novel biodegradable surfactants. Plant cells are being converted into chemical reactors to facilitate exploitation of feedstocks such as fatty acids. Although price/performance ratio typical for commodity plastics are not met, biopolymers are being introduced as components of packaging and lightweight materials, e.g., natural-fiber-reinforced composites for automotive applications. Illustrated by selected examples, this overview highlights prospects and limitations of renewable resources and agricultural feedstocks in energy technology and chemical industry.

ID STATISTICAL POWER ANALYSIS; RANGE CONDITION; MANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY;
   EXTINCTION; THRESHOLDS; VIEWPOINT; FISHERIES; SCIENCE; ECOLOGY
AB We describe broadly applicable principles for the conservation of wild living resources and mechanisms for their implementation. These principles were engendered from three starting points. First, a set of principles for the conservation of wild living resources (Holt and Talbot 1978) required reexamination and updating. Second, those principles lacked mechanisms for implementation and consequently were not as effective as they might have been. Third, all conservation problems have scientific, economic, and social aspects, and although the mix may vary from problem to problem, all three aspects must be included in problem solving. We illustrate the derivation of, and amplify the meaning of, the principles, and discuss mechanisms for their implementation.
   The principles are:
   Principle I. Maintenance of healthy populations of wild living resources in perpetuity is inconsistent with unlimited growth of human consumption of and demand for those resources.
   Principle II. The goal of conservation should be to secure present and future options by maintaining biological diversity at genetic, species, population, and ecosystem levels; as a general rule neither the resource nor other components of the ecosystem should be perturbed beyond natural boundaries of variation.
   Principle III. Assessment of the possible ecological and sociological effects of resource use should precede both proposed use and proposed restriction or expansion of ongoing use of a resource.
   Principle IV. Regulation of the use of living resources must be based on understanding the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem of which the resource is a part and must take into account the ecological and sociological influences that directly and indirectly affect resource use.
   Principle V. The full range of knowledge and skills from the natural and social sciences must be brought to bear on conservation problems.
   Principle VI. Effective conservation requires understanding and taking account of the motives, interests, and values of all users and stakeholders, but not by simply averaging their positions.
   Principle VII. Effective conservation requires communication that is interactive, reciprocal, and continuous.
   Mechanisms for implementation of the principles are discussed.

DE agriculture; carrying capacity; population; environmental impacts;

AB There is a wide spectrum of views on possible futures for world agriculture, with a clear division between neoclassical and ecological economics approaches to the issue. An incremental approach, characteristic of neoclassical economics, focuses on steady yield increases as a result of technological progress and increased input use, In this view, there are no inherent limits to growth and therefore an optimistic view tends to be taken of future production potential. By contrast, an analysis based on the concept of carrying capacity emphasizes environmental limits to system growth. This paper reviews estimates of carrying capacity as well as trends in land use, yields, and environmental impacts of agriculture. Demand projections are made for the year 2025 based on population momentum and a slow rate of increase in per-capita consumption. The global system is seen to be approaching carrying capacity limits over the next 30 years, with more severe stresses at a regional level, and widening food deficits in developing nations. Strong yield growth in China, South Asia, Africa, North America, and Europe will be necessary to avert global shortfalls, but resource and environmental factors pose serious constraints in all these areas. The pressure to increase yields is therefore in conflict with the requirements of long-term sustainability. This indicates the need for regional models of sustainable agro-ecosystems which balance yield requirements with ecological constraints. In addition, demand-side issues of population policy, efficiency in consumption, and distributional equity become increasingly important in a world of constrained agricultural growth.

AB This study summarises the development of a framework in which changes in the management strategies of sheep grazing systems in temperate Australia can be evaluated in terms of their impact on greenhouse gas emissions and financial viability.
   An exploratory study of a sheep grazing system at Hamilton, in western Victoria, indicates that reducing emissions from some sheep grazing systems in temperate Australia by 20% over the next 15 years will require a similar (i.e. 18%) reduction in stock numbers providing that no other management or technology is used to reduce emissions. This reduction in stock numbers will reduce both farm operating surplus and net cash income by about 15.5 to 17%. The reduction in net cash income represents a direct reduction in the general welfare of the farmer. However, economically viable reductions in emissions may be able to be achieved through changing the time of lambing. Spring lambing resulted in returns per unit emissions which were 15 to 20% greater than those for autumn lambing. Surveys suggest that about two-thirds of all flocks in the area lamb in autumn. Therefore, there exists an opportunity to reduce emissions by the order of 15 to 20% from the region without substantial economic penalties.
   Overstocking resulted in both increased net methane and nitrous oxide emissions and reduced profitability. The relatively small reductions in stocking rate needed in such situations will reduce greenhouse emissions significantly and also may have the effect of reducing soil and vegetation degradation, thereby improving the sustainability of these enterprises. Implementation of these stocking rate recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could thus be achieved as part of overall sustainable farming.

TI Women and the cooperative provision of care: The example of the 'Fukushi
   Club' in Japan
SO ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY
LA English
DT Article
AB The provision of personal care has become a critical problem for industrial countries. The care crisis particularly affects women as the main providers of care and the main receivers of care among the elderly. This paper looks at a model of cooperative care provided by the Fukushi Club, set up by the Seikatsu Club Consumers' Cooperative in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It asks whether the Fukushi Club is successful in its aims of empowering both care receiver and care provider; recognizing the 'shadow work' of women in the provision of care; and establishing a sustainable model of cooperative care.

AB Financing problems triggered the wave of electric power sector reforms in Latin America and the Caribbean, The reforms, in turn, have changed the functioning of financing in the power sector, Financial institutions have continually adapted their instruments, existing sources of capital have stepped up investing in the sector and new financial sources have emerged, This paper reviews the evolution of financing and its interplay with legal and structural reforms and property rights changes in the electric power sector of Latin America and the Caribbean, It classifies sector development in the region by reform strategies, and their consequences for financing, Finally, it conducts an assesment using criteria such as sector financing, sector efficiency, general economic efficiency, economic development objectives and the environment, It finds that the different reform and financing strategies have distinctive impacts on the sustainable development of the sector through their impacts on the choice of generating technology and fuel, on the contribution of cogeneration and renewable energy sources, on participation of national capital and national human capital formation, and on rational use of energy.

AB Increased interest in environmental change issues has led researchers to consider more integrated approaches to change dynamics. This paper examines change in terms of land degradation in north-central Botswana from both biophysical and human perspectives. Although seasonal and periodic droughts were prevalent, analysis of rainfall data over the past 70 years revealed no downward trend. However, indicators of declining productivity such as soil erosion, loss oi vegetation cover, and a declining groundwater table were amply evident. The GIS analysis oi remotely sensed data has shown that complete vegetation recovery after drought is not laking place, particularly in the south-central part of the study area. These areas contained the highest human and livestock population densities. The local people acknowledged facing increasing resource depletion and indicated drought as the main cause. Pressures on available resources, particularly during drought periods, appeared to have impeded the regenerative capacity oi the natural vegetation cover, thereby inducing land degradation. This situation may not easily be rectified because oi widespread poverty and inappropriate local perceptions oi the solutions. Both of these hinder the adoption oi sustainable land management.

DT Article
DE cultural theory; empowerment; Isle of Harris; sustainability
AB In 1991 Redland Aggregates Ltd. put forward a proposal to embark upon the largest mining project in Europe, the chosen location being the remote island of Harris and Lewis in the Western Isles of Scotland. The proposal sparked off an impassioned debate between planners, conservationists and developers, while the local residents have attempted to come to terms with an operation on a scale previously inconceivable on the island.
   This paper attempts to examine the proposed development from a sociological angle - it is less concerned with justifying or condemning the project on economic or political grounds and more with analysing the roots of the various viewpoints held by those involved, willingly or unwillingly, in the debate. From this analysis arise implications regarding different perspectives on the environment and different interpretations of the term sustainable. It is argued that these diverse perceptions are grounded in different interpretations of the environment, shaped by the cultural and historical context within which the groups or individuals that hold these views exist and interact. Ultimately, the paper makes a plea for a wider recognition of the diversity of meanings and interpretations implied by the term 'environment', a broader definition of the term 'development', and an expansion of the concept of sustainability to incorporate the variety of situations and perceived needs of different cultures.

AB Existing and novel Bacillus thuringiensis toxin-coding genes may be utilised in transgenic oilseed rape to control many of the important insect pest species on the crop, worldwide. Location-specific ecological crop assessment must be used to evaluate the need and possibilities for managing resistance evolution in the target pests, and to ensure sustainability of the control strategy. In some cases, at least, it appears that durable control could be attained in oilseed rape by an integrated control approach, including the use of transgenic crop and among it, about 10% of non-transformed seed to provide refugia for susceptible insect genotypes. Seed mixtures or strip intercropping would be easy to handle also in practice.

SO FOOD POLICY

AB The renewable natural resources sector in Africa is of particular importance because of the relatively high proportion of livelihoods that it supports in comparison to other developing regions. Threats to these livelihoods arise from the relative fragility of the sector in the context of continuing, rapid, population growth, Key concerns include the need for agricultural intensification in the context of systems that are often located in marginal areas; the demands made by rapid urbanization which contribute to the difficulties in developing sustainable systems; and access rights to key resources such as water, The policy and institutional environment can exacerbate difficulties since trends towards greater democracy often prove destabilizing or deflect the political agenda towards short-term expediency rather than longer term strategies that are essential to the RNR sector, Structural adjustment has not yielded the expected benefits and it has become increasingly apparent that the private sector alone will not be able to meet growth and distributional objectives, It appears that a broader-based strategy is needed including not only government institutions at national and local levels, but also NGOs and community organizations, and even regional and international bodies (e.g. for research), Sub-Saharan Africa has probably suffered more than most regions from an overdose of dogma; what is really required is a flexible, pragmatic approach that recognizes the legitimacy and complementary roles between both public and private sector.

AB The Canadian Standards Association is in the final stages of developing a standard for the certification of a Sustainable Forest Management System. Certification requires an independent third party verification, commonly called an audit, to ensure that all components of the certification standard have been met. Auditors of these systems face a number of challenges, including determining the right mix of technical and auditing skills, developing an audit process that can adapt to changes in science and interpreting performance criteria. Another key issue is choosing the proper balance between systems evaluation and field verification.

AB Menominee Tribal Enterprises (MTE Ltd., Keshena, WI) forest products were certified as sustainably managed in 1992 in recognition of their past performance and commitment to sustained-yield community based forestry. Their forestry operations are planned and coordinated at the Menominee Forestry Center and ret,resent the cooperative efforts of three agencies: (1) Menominee Tribal Enterprises, (2) Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and (3) the Bureau of Indian Affairs. After 140 years of harvesting, about 63% of the productive forest land (55,850 ha) within the Menominee reservation is thought to be fully stocked today and includes many impressive stands of large white pine, sugar maple and red oak. In October 1995, Menominee foresters organized a tour of the Reservation forests and explained their forest management practices. In this paper, some highlights of what was observed and learned during the lour are described, including the Menominee's approach to forest management and their main forest management activities.

DE sustainability; forest management; criteria; indicators; national
   inventory
AB Canadian forestry is facing currently a concentrated attack on Its practices to the extent that our markets are being threatened. To counter this threat and deal with public environmental concerns, Canada has developed a series of criteria and indicators that will quantify those forestry practices which have an effect on the sustainability of our forests and all their attendant resources. This approach will require inventory information that is not currently available. A national multi-resource inventory designed specifically to provide information at the national level will be needed and is feasible and cost-effective. A cooperative multi-agency approach such as that used by the recent BC Resource Inventory Committee is recommended as a starting point. Technical experts from relevant and interested federal and provincial agencies should be invited to participate in formulating and expediting such a program.

AB This paper argues for the development of a poststructuralist political ecology, While political ecology studies the relationships between society and nature in contexts of power-particularly from the perspective of political economy-this study, it is proposed, must include a consideration of the discourses and practices through which nature is historically produced and known. The paper examines the complex cultural and discursive articulations between natural and social systems established by capital and technoscience, particularly through discourses of sustainable development and biodiversity conservation. The paper concludes with the implications of the analysis for imagining alternative productive rationalities in conjunction with social movements. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

TI A hopeful path for development in Africa
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Africa faces many more barriers to development over the next two generations than any other global region. Food supply, population growth, city expansion and political stability are especially troublesome. A strategy is proposed here for using new, low-cost information technology for erasing the educational deficit and accelerating food production. Hope for doing this quickly lies with the rapidly expanding women's NGOs. Acceleration of the education of girls has the highest priority, because more education is needed in Africa than elsewhere to achieve fertility at replacement levels. To be sustainable, an African society should be service-oriented, with much reduced emphasis on manufacturing capital goods. It would be very knowledgeable about economizing, and so would need to achieve a relatively low CDP. The principal aim would be for society members to declare themselves to be happy, and feel they have a high quality of life. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

TI From wasteland to wonderland: Opencast mining, regeneration and the
   English National Forest
SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article
ID COAL
AB In this paper we examine the outcomes of restructuring within the British coal mining industry in the English countryside and an attempt by the Countryside Commission to regenerate an ai;ea of the rural East Midlands through a forest project of sustainable development. In this particular area, deep-mine coal production has collapsed resulting in high levels of unemployment and large parcels of derelict land, while an expansion of opencast coal (and other mineral) extraction has led to considerable landscape despoliation. We examine critically the Countryside Commission's project of the National Forest in this area, involving the planting of thirty million trees over an area of almost 200 square miles. The Forest is seen as an example of sustainable development, bringing together economic growth-based around timber production and the encouragement of tourism and 'green' business- and environmental enhancement. However, the National Forest will be planted on private land, some of which is controlled by major mineral companies, with relatively little public ownership of this so-called 'national asset'. The paper draws on recent research carried out by the authors which has explored a series of important land use conflicts surrounding the sustainability of the Forest alongside on-going processes of opencast mining within its boundaries and also tensions associated with public access within a privately-owned forest.

TI Moroccan khettara: Traditional irrigation and progressive desiccation
SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB A 300 km network of khettara (qanat) subsurface irrigation channels was excavated in the Tafilalt basin beginning in the late 14th century. More than 75 of these chains provided perennial water following the breakup of the ancient city of Sijilmassa. Khettara continued to function for much of the northern oasis until the early 1970s, when new technologies and government policies forced changes. Data on origins, maintenance, and current use were collected from archival sources, aerial photographs, Landsat imagery, and from interviews. Insufficient water resources and unsustainable practices have dramatically lowered the watertable, drying up khettara. This has resulted in a loss of local control over water resources, abandonment of a sustainable irrigation system, and progressive desiccation. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Managers have recognized the strategic importance of quality in current competitive markets. With no universally accepted definition of quality, managers, customers, and researchers communicate with difficulty. We describe and organize sets of quality definitions into a continuum, illustrating the relationships between definitions. We describe the impact of each of these descriptions upon the attainment of a sustainable competitive advantage for the firm. The quality definition continuum can serve as the basis for understanding some principles of total quality management implementation and success.

This hyperbolic power-duration relationship can be described as: (P - empty set(PA)) t = W', where P = power output, t = time to exhaustion, and empty set(PA) and W' are constants. Eight volunteer male subjects, aged 24 +/- 2.6 yr, with no competitive cycling training took part in this study and each undertook thirteen tests on a Lode BV Excalibur Sport V1.52 cycle ergometer over an eight week period. The first exercise bout was a 30 W . min(-1) incremental cycle at 50 r . min(-1) to volitional fatigue. This allowed the identification of a range of power outputs that would be used to construct and examine the power-duration relationships for each subject at 50, 90 and 110 r . min(-1). At both 50 and 90 r . min(-1), power outputs of 30 W above and below and 60 W above the highest work rate, as well as the maximum work rate achieved during the incremental exercise test were chosen, while at 110 r . min(-1), the power outputs chosen were 25 W above and below as well as 50 W above the highest work rate achieved during the incremental exercise test and also the maximum work rate achieved during the incremental exercise test were chosen. These four work rates for each pedalling frequency were chosen because they would have exercise times to exhaustion in the range of 1-10 minutes. Each exercise bout was preceded by four minutes of unloaded cycling and then the work rate was adjusted quickly to the desired load setting by the previously programmed computerised ergometer. The results of this work indicate that for the group of subjects studied, pedalling a cycle ergometer at 50 r . min(-1) allows subjects to pedal for a significantly greater time than when pedalling at either 90 or 110 r . min(-1). empty set(PA) at 50 r . min(-1) was significantly greater than when pedalling at either 90 (F-(1,F-21) = 7.47, p < 0.01) or 110 r . min(-1) (F-(1,F-21) = 10.83, p < 0.0005). There was no significant (p > 0.22) difference between empty set(PA) at 90 and 110 r . min(-1), F-(1,F-21) = 1.36. W' however, was not significantly different when the data for 50 r . min(-1), 90 r . min(-1) and 110 r . min(-1) were compared (F-50 r . min-1 (1,F-21) = 0.95; p > 0.41; F-90 r . min-1 (1,F-21) = 0.79, p > 0.53; F-110 r . min-1 (1,F-21) = 0.78, p > 0.53). Our hypothesis, that endurance performance was reduced when recreational cyclists pedal at a high cadence when compared to a low cadence was correct. Maximum sustainable power output during cycle ergometry was higher at 50 r . min(-1) than at either 90 or 110 r . min(-1). At the intermediate cadence endurance was better than at the high but worse than at the low cadence. in conclusion, during endurance cycling, recreaional cyclists should pedal at lower rather than higher cadences.

AB This research analyzed new venture start-up activities undertaken by 71 nascent entrepreneurs. Nascent entrepreneurs are individuals who were identified as taking steps to found a new business bur who had not yet succeeded in making the transition to new business ownership. Longitudinal data for the study comes from a secondary data analysis of two representative samples, one of 683 adult residents in Wisconsin (Reynolds and White 1993) and the other of 1016 adult residents of the United States (Curtin 1982). These surveys were conducted between 1992 and 1993, and the nascent entrepreneurs were reinterviewed sir to 18 months after their initial interview.
   Three broad questions were addressed: (1) What activities do nascent entrepreneurs initiate in attempting to establish a new business? (2) How many activities do nascent entrepreneurs initiate during the gestation of the start-up ? and (3) When are particular activities initiated or completed?
   Between the first and second interview, 48% of the nascent entrepreneurs reported they had set up a business in operation. Over 20% had given up and were no longer actively trying to establish a business. Almost a third of the respondents reported they were still trying to establish a firm.
   As a way to summarize the results and as a springboard toward some insights into the implications of this research for practice and future research, we developed the following activity profiles of the three types of nascent entrepreneurs studied. These profiles are offered as a combination of both fact and some intuition about the findings.
   STARTED A BUSINESS Nascent entrepreneurs who were able to start a business were more aggressive in making their businesses real. They undertook activities that made their businesses tangible to others: they looked for facilities and equipment, sought and got financial support, formed a legal entity, organized a team, bought facilities and equipment, and devoted full time to the business. Individuals who started businesses seemed to act with a greater level of intensity. They undertook more activities than those individuals who did not start a business. The pattern of activities seem to indicate that individuals who started firms put themselves into the day-to-day process of running an ongoing business as quickly as they could and that these activities resulted in starting firms that generated sales (94% of the entrepreneurs) and positive cash flow (50% of the entrepreneurs). What is not known is how successful or profitable these new firms will be over time. For example, 50% of the firms that were started had not reached positive cash pow and these firms mar have been started by individuals who were foolhardy and rushed into operation of a business that would nor be sustainable.
   GAVE UP. The pattern of activities for the group of entrepreneurs who gave up seem to indicate that these entrepreneurs discovered that their initial idea for their businesses would not lead to success. The finding that the activity of developing a model or prototype differentiated individuals who gave up from those who were still trying would suggest that those who gave up had ''tested'' their ideas out and found that they would nor work according to their expectations. Nascent entrepreneurs who gave up seemed to be similar in their activity patterns compared with those who started their firms, that is, individuals who gave lip pursued the activities of creating a business in an aggressive manner at the beginning of the process. Put as the business unfolded over time, these entrepreneurs decreased their activities and then ceased start-up activities. This group of individuals might be seen as either having the wisdom to test their ideas out before jumping into something that might lead to failure or lacking the flexibility to find more creative ways to solve the problems that they were confronted with.
   STILL TRYING. It would seem that those who are still trying are not putting enough effort into the start-up process in order to find out whether they should start the business or give up. Those still trying had undertaken fewer activities than individuals in the other two groups. The still trying entrepreneurs were devoting their short-term efforts toward activities internal to the start-rtp process (e. g., saving money and preparing a plan) and less effort toward activities that would make the business real to others. The still trying entrepreneurs may be all talk and little action. Or these still trying entrepreneurs might be involved in developing businesses that take longer for these particular opportunities to unfold. (It should be noted that there was no industry effect across the three groups.)
   Our advice to individuals considering business start-up is that the results seem to provide evidence that nascent entrepreneurs should aggressively pursue opportunities in the short-term, because they will quickly learn that these opportunities will either reveal themselves as worthy of start-up or as poor choices that should be abandoned. Individuals who do not devote the time and effort to undertaking the activities necessary for starling a business may find themselves perennially still trying, rather than succeeding or failing.
   What entrepreneurs do in their day-to-day activities matters, The kinds of activities that nascent entrepreneurs undertake, the number of activities, and the sequence of these activities have a significant influence on the ability of ascent entrepreneurs to successfully create new ventures. This study suggests that the behaviors of nascent entrepreneurs who have successfully started a new venture can be identified and differentiated from the behaviors of nascent entrepreneurs who failed. We believe that future studies will more precisely identify the kinds of behaviors appropriate for certain new venture conditions. If such contingency information can be generated, entrepreneurship research is likely to have significant benefits for entrepreneurship practice, education, and public policy.

AB Electronic information transforms relationships among the elements of traditional publishing, creating new opportunities and new challenges, especially for the long-term sustainability of information. The most prevalent popular metaphor, the information highway, is somewhat misleading. A new model-information ecology-can bring new thinking to bear on these challenges. Exploring this model suggests that current government information dissemination institutions and practices must transform themselves if access to valuable public information is to be maintained and expanded.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB An overview is presented of the various types of municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) residues produced, their characteristics and their leaching properties, It is established that short- and long-term leaching and release of contaminants constitute the most important potential environmental problems related to disposal of MSWI residues. A set of basic principles of waste disposal or leachate management strategy which takes the specific properties of the various types of residues into account and which may lead to sustainable waste disposal solutions is presented and discussed. Application of these principles to MSWI residues indicates that an environmentally sustainable disposal solution for MSWI bottom ash and air pollution control (APC) residues in the long term should be based on a controlled contaminant release strategy, i.e. a strategy which allows the leachate to leak into the surroundings at a controlled and environmentally acceptable rate. Leachate collection and treatment is therefore only required when such a disposal strategy is not feasible or during an initial stage of disposal. Landfilling of bottom ash is less problematic than landfilling of APC residues in terms of practical implementation of the disposal strategy and management of the leachate. Monofilling and separate management and disposal of MSWI bottom ash and APC residues are generally recommended.

AB Irrigation system planning and management of a semiarid region in Indian Punjab is imperative for sustainable agriculture. For the management of soil and water resources of these regions, three nonstructural management models have been developed and linked together to aid in planning the optimum allocation of land and water resources to achieve the objective of maximizing return in the command area of a canal distributary. A ground-water simulation model uses the mass-balance approach to simulate water-table depths. The seasonal crop water response models are developed to compute crop yields. Interseasonal irrigation system planning models maximize net annual return through conjunctive use of surface water and gypsum-treated sodic ground water to achieve an optimal cropping pattern using a linear programming algorithm. The linear programming models are operated at five water mixing indexes (mixing of surface water and poor quality ground water in different proportions) and seven probability of exceedence levels where rainfall, crop water requirements, and canal water supply are assumed as random variables. These random variables are fitted well to the gamma probability density function.

AB The materials presented in this paper are the result of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Advanced Research Workshop on ''Sustainability of Irrigated Agriculture (Sustainability of Water Resources Utilization in Agriculture),'' which was held in Vimeiro, Portugal between 21 and 26 March 1994. The workshop was cosponsored by the Science and Technology for Development (STD) program of the European Union, Centre International de Hautes Etudes Agronomiques Mediterraneennes (CIHEAM) Centre Technique de Cooperation Agricole et Rurale (CTA), Institut Francais de Recherche pour L'ingenierie de L'agriculture et de L'environment (CEMAGREF) and Junta Nacional de Cienifica e Tecnologica (JNICT). The purpose of that workshop was to provide in-depth discussion on irrigated agriculture among researchers and professionals of different disciplines coming from both developed and developing countries. The workshop objective was to integrate existing science and technology into improved irrigation system performance and agricultural water management, and to provide recommendations for future research directed toward sustainability of water use in agriculture. A total of 43 papers were presented and discussed under the following topics: sustainability of world irrigation systems; water management and water policies; sustainability of indigenous water and soil conservation systems; irrigation water management and scheduling; on-farm irrigation systems; irrigation scheme management; sustainability and environment concerns; and technological transfer. The research priorities presented in this paper evolved from group discussions and are based on a common understanding of the challenges that our generation faces to ensure sustainable agricultural development, both in developed and developing countries. The priorities were established by voting of the workshop participants.

AB The objectives of this study were to identify a Site Conservation Threshold, the point at which accelerated erosion occurs, and to examine the usefulness of the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model in determining the Site Conservation Threshold on a clay loam upland rangeland site, Sixteen sample sites were chosen to represent a wide range of species composition, ground cover, biomass and apparent soil stability to determine which of these factors could be used to evaluate the site conservation status of a clay-loam upland ecological site on a southern Arizona semi-arid desert grassland, A Site Stability Rating based on observable vegetation and soil-surface characteristics (i.e. ground surface cover and distribution of plants) was developed, A Site Stability Rating was estimated for 100 quadrats per sample site and averaged for the entire sample site, The Water Erosion Prediction Project model was used as an objective index of soil stability to assess the degree of site protection, The Soil Conservation Service soil loss tolerance value (T) was used with the sediment yield predicted by the WEPP model to establish a threshold value for the Site Stability Rating, The objective measures of standing biomass, basal cover, average distance to the nearest perennial plant, and frequency of quadrats with no rooted perennial plant showed strong relationships to the subjective Site Stability Rating, Site Conservation Thresholds were identified for standing biomass (750 kg/ha), basal cover (8%), average distance to the nearest perennial plant (15 cm), and frequency of quadrats (20 X 20 cm) with no rooted perennial plant (13%).

AB This study focuses on Plan Sierra, a large nongovernmental organization located in the north central section of the Dominican Republic. Plan Sierra has successfully promoted the we of soil and water conservation technologies to upland farmers since 1979. This research is based on data collected from interviews with 161 Plan Sierra farmers regarding the relationship between planned outreach communication channels, adoption, and sustained we of conservation practices. The analysis identified a statistically significant association between farmer interaction with Plan Sierra and the three outreach communication channels wed to gain the adoption and maintenance of soil and water conservation practices.

AB Four tomato production systems were compared at Columbus and Fremont, Ohio: 1) a conventional system; 2) an integrated system [a fall-planted cover-crop mixture of hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth,), rye (Secale cereale L.), crimson clover (Trifoliurn incarnatum L.), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) killed before tomato planting and left as mulch, and reduced chemical inputs]; 3) an organic system (with cover-crop mixture and no synthetic chemical inputs); and (4) a no-input system (with cover-crop mixture and no additional management or inputs). Nitrogen in the cover-crop mixture above-ground biomass was 220 kg . ha(-1) in Columbus and 360 kg . ha(-1) in Fremont. Mulch systems (with cover-crop mixture on the bed surface) had higher soil moisture levels and reduced soil maximum temperatures relative to the conventional system. Overall, the cover-crop mulch suppressed weeds as well as herbicide plots, and no additional weed control was needed during the season. There were no differences in the frequency of scouted insect pests or diseases among the treatments. The number of tomato fruit and flower clusters for the conventional system was higher early in the season. In Fremont, the plants in the conventional system had accumulated more dry matter 5 weeks after transplanting. Yield of red fruit was similar for all systems at Columbus, but the conventional system yielded higher than the other three systems in Fremont. In Columbus, there were no differences in economic return above variable costs among systems. In Fremont, the conventional systems had the highest return above variable costs.

AB In the Netherlands historically almost all natural conditions in the coastal zone have been highly influenced by man. In 1990, the Government adopted a new coastal defence policy for the Netherlands for the enduring safety and sustainable preservation of the functions and values in the dunes by ''dynamic preservation of the coastline'' at its position in 1990 (''the base coastline'').
   Because of the natural flexibility of a dune coast, some allowance is made for movements of the coastline. Permitting sand drifts or even the formation of dune breaches and tidal inlets are some of the possibilities.
   The paper gives an overview of the value of existing dune breaches and tidal inlets and their potentials, and criteria for engineering tidal inlets. It ends with some conclusions and recommendations for implementing the possibilities of environmental engineering in the foredunes.

ID MECHANISMS; SUCCESSION
AB In the process of dredge mining, employed since 1977 on the Zululand coast, heavy minerals are extracted from the dunes after the complete removal of the existing vegetation. The tailings are then reshaped to approximate their original contours, covered with topsoil and revegetated with a cereal cover crop, together with indigenous seeds of long-lived (woody) species. The existence of stands of different ages over a recorded period provided an opportunity to study changes in species composition and vegetation dynamics. Five random 10 x 10 m quadrats were sampled in stands of age 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 years respectively, and cover data were used for multivariate analysis using TWINSPAN and DECORANA. Importance values of each species, and total and mean species richness were also calculated. Pre-mined and mined soil samples were analysed for trace elements, organic matter and pH. Recently rehabilitated areas of 4 to 5 years were dominated by Acacia karroo, but species richness showed a progressive increase with age of rehabilitated stands, with more woody species in the older stands and a slight decline in dominance of A. karroo. TWINSPAN classified older and younger stands into distinct groups which were related to a chronological succession gradient, also shown by the DECORANA ordination. Some soil nutrients of rehabilitated areas compared favourably with the pre-mined topsoil and subsoil, but percentage organic matter content was still higher in natural dune forests. Increases in soil nutrients suggest that nutrient retention and the establishment of substantial soil flora and fauna are occurring, providing evidence for the sustainability of the soils. From this study it appears that successional changes follow the facilitation pathway, and rehabilitation will eventually lead to the restoration of the dune forest.

AB The present and future of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) in Europe is discussed with an emphasis on nature conservation. The position of nature conservation in physical planning and in legislation is discussed within the historical perspective of the Netherlands. With regard to the present position of nature conservation in planning and legislation, differences in Europe between the northwest, the south and the east are discussed. The roles of various organisations (such as NGOs, GOs, Universities and the European Union) in ICZM is briefly mentioned. The paper advocates a strong position for nature conservation in integrated coastal zone management if it is to be developed on a sustainable basis.

AB A delay-difference model for a sex-structured population with delayed recruitment is presented. Constant-effort harvesting is introduced for examining the model's sensitivity to harvesting. Linear analyses about the steady states are performed under various parameter choices. The effects of the delay period, the survival parameter, and the harvesting effort on population stability are examined. It is shown that differences in the male and female delays to recruitment can give rise to very different stability diagrams. Our analyses indicate, for example, that a population with equal male and female delays to recruitment is the most robust to recruitment failures. Possible forms that the male and female recruitment functions could take are suggested and evaluated. Finally, the very encouraging result is obtained that maximum sustainable yield is attained at a stable steady-state population level.

AB The starvation-stress response (SSR) of Salmonella typhimurium encompasses the physiological changes that occur upon starvation for an essential nutrient, e.g, C-source, A subset of SSR genes, known as core SSR genes, are required for the long-term starvation survival of the bacteria, Four core SSR loci have been identified in S, typhimurium: rpoS, stiA, stiB, and stiC, Here we report that in S, typhimurium C-starvation induced a greater and more sustainable cross-resistance to oxidative challenge (15 mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 40 min) than either N- or P-starvation, Of the four core SSR loci, only rpoS and stiC mutants exhibited a defective C-starvation-inducible cross-resistance to H2O2 challenge, Interestingly, (unadapted) log-phase S. typhimurium rpoS and stiA mutants were very sensitive to oxidative challenge, Based on this, we determined if these core SSR loci were important for H2O2 resistance developed during a 60 min adaptive exposure to 60 mu M H2O2 (adapted cells), Both unadapted and adapted rpoS and stiA mutants were hypersensitive to a H2O2 challenge, in addition, a stiB mutant exhibited normal adaptive resistance for the first 20 mins of H2O2 challenge but then rapidly lost viability, declining to a level of about 1.5% of the wild-type strain, The results of these experiments indicate that: (i) the rpoS and stiC loci are essential for the development of C-starvation-inducible cross-resistance to oxidative challenge, and (ii) the rpoS, stiA, and, in a delayed effect, stiB loci are needed for H2O2-inducible adaptive resistance to oxidative challenge, Moreover, we found that both stiA and stiB are induced by a 60 mu M H2O2 exposure, but only stiA was regulated (repressed) by (reduced form) OxyR.

ID KARAKORAM; HIGHWAY
AB In the Hindukush, Karakorum, and northwest Himalaya the struggle for subsistence by mountain farmers is based on agriculture and animal husbandry in the form of mixed mountain agriculture. This study analyses the seasonal pastoral migrations to alpine pastures as a strategy for utilizing the natural resources in the Rupal Valley, south of Nanga Parbat (8,126 m).
   Traditionally, this strategy of resource management was sustainable, but increases of population and livestock as well as external innovations are rapidly effecting change throughout the region. However, the results of this development vary according to the potential for off-farm employment and access to modern infrastructure in each valley In Hunza, approximately 100 km north of Rupal, the utilization of alpine pastures decreased following a significant reduction of the male workforce and, after the introduction of cash crops and fodder cultivation, cropping patterns changed.
   Agriculture in the Rupal Valley during the last 20 years is characterized by an increase in animal husbandry and pastoral movements. Although there is also off-farm employment, it is more likely that animal husbandry will remain an important part of the agro-pastoral economy and there is potential for its commercialization.

AB Drought is a normal, recurrent feature of climate that affects virtually all countries to some degree. The number of drought-induced natural disasters has grown significantly since the 1960s, largely as a result of increasing vulnerability to extended periods of precipitation deficiency rather than because of an increase in the frequency of meteorological droughts. This increase in drought-induced natural disasters has resulted in a considerable growth of interest in drought mitigation and preparedness worldwide. The purpose of a national preparedness plan is to reduce societal vulnerability to drought through the adoption of preventive, anticipatory policies and programs. This paper describes a ten-step planning process that nations can follow to develop a drought preparedness plan. This process, originally developed in 1987, has been the basis of discussions at training seminars on drought preparedness for developing nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It has also been adopted, with appropriate modifications, by state or provincial governments and by municipalities. The process is intended to be flexible so that governments can add, delete, or modify the suggested steps, as necessary.

AB The Fleet continues to require high performance systems that can operate with dependability in the seas' unforgiving environments and under hostile action. Those demands are not new. What has changed is the urgent priority formerly assigned to national defense issues. The arguments for continued superpower military strength are now roiled in politics along with unsettled budgets and uncertain force level projections. Current expectations revolve about indefinite fiscal and operational issues (difficult funding constraints and broadband threats). In the actual event of ''doing more with less,'' a practical response is to apply the creative power available from sound engineering judgement and the crucible of experience to the immediate needs of the Fleet. The attempt to shorten the path between advanced development effort and Fleet use has been tried occasionally in the past, often, without exemplary results. The Sustainable Hardware and Affordable Readiness Practices (SHARP) program, is a generic R&D effort under OpNav sponsorship that has been working steadily on sensible solutions to product engineering problems. Armed today with fast-time, large-scale computation abilities and modern tools for technical problem solving coupled with specialized engineering knowledge, it has been refreshed and is underway satisfying existing Fleet needs. The relationship between fully responsive engineering services and current operational needs is always demanding. The connection between advanced engineering development (6.3 category funds) and immediate Fleet usage brings added complexity and challenge, both technical and organizational. Illustrative examples of affordable engineering solutions to ''retain, revise, replace or retire'' questions are presented within the context of both Fleet realities and budgetary limitations. The discussion covers legacy system support, civil/military considerations and Fleet maintenance issues. It describes the substantial and critical payoffs in cost, schedule and performance that are possible when product engineering professionals can concentrate their diverse talents upon operational urgencies.

DE hypercompetition; Japanese beer; new product development; organizational

ID SUSTAINED COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; STRATEGY
AB In the mid-1980s, the Japanese beer industry, a stable oligopoly in which competition had traditionally been limited to well understood nonprice dimensions, experienced an outbreak of new product ''h!ypercompetition'' which saw a ten-fold increase in the industry's new product introduction rate, produced a major shake-up in firms' competitive positions, and forced firms to transform themselves in fundamental ways in order to compete effectively. Surprisingly, this hypercompetition occurred despite heavy government regulation of the industry. Driving it were a variety of demographic, dietary social, economic, and distribution trends which affected demand for beer, plus the existence of a major player, Asahi, on the edge of bankruptcy and therefore sufficiently desperate to risk a frontal attack on the industry leader, Kirin.
   At the firm level, substantial internal change and the building of new organizational capabilities were required both to initiate and respond to hypercompetition. Examining in detail the process and difficulty of overcoming inertia and effecting change within the Asahi and Kirin organizations, two distinct types of hypercompetition-appropriate capabilities are identified. One is specialized capabilities, which allow a firm to compete effectively on the competitive dimension that a particular round of hypercompetition is based on (such as new product development). The other is general capabilities which allow a firm to efficiently carry out the continual recombination and reemployment of resources which a hypercompetitive state, in which shifts in the nature of competition are frequent and continuous, requires. Both types of capabilities are shown to be difficult to build and imitate, and for this reason to be potential sources of sustainable advantage.
   The paper identifies three broadly defining characteristics of hypercompetition: (1) continuing, nonmarginal change in the nature of competition (2) required nontrivial organizational change, and (3) significant effects on firm performance and competitive position. Conceptually, it is argued that hypercompetition is Schumpeterian in nature, featuring recurring and fundamental competitive change, but that hypercompetition is most accurately seen as a particular combinaSchumpeterian, Industrial Organization, and Chamberlinian competition, with Schumpeterian instability weakening, but not replacing, the more stable aspects of Industrial Organization and Chamberlinian competition.

AB To identify what is needed to sustain local democracy we need a model of democratic government and an idea of the kind of social and economic context that is supportive of democracy. Local democracy requires a combination of a liberal democratic model of local government and the prerequisites of democratic stability: economic development, equality, political culture and the development of civil society. However, a number of factors, non-local as well. as local, may undermine local government and local democracy, especially centralization, economic decisions, external conflicts, dependency on civil servants, the dilution of elected representation, formalistic participation, skewed representation, class conflict and official attitudes. However, democratic local government can contribute to economic development, the reduction of inequality, a democratic political culture and the development of civil society, thereby strengthening local democracy.

AB A preliminary assessment was made of the thermal behaviour of an earth-sheltered building, located in Taos, New Mexico, using monitored data obtained during a limited number of days in June 1995, when measured diurnal ambient temperatures ranged from 4 degrees C to 35 degrees C. The Tas degrees dynamic model was used to predict the thermal performances of the building, using hourly weather data for Los Alamos, USA, and the south-eastern region of the United Kingdom (UK). The earthship was found to overheat during the summer in New Mexico and was predicted to do so in the building modelled for the south-eastern region of the UK. This implies that some external shading would be beneficial to reduce solar gains during the summer. The building located in new Mexico was predicted to achieve comfort conditions during the working day for most of the remainder of the year. There was a need for some space heating in winter and also during the evenings if the building was used out of office hours, or as a dwelling. The simulations for the UK climate indicated that the building should only require a relatively small amount (ie., 325 kWh) of space heating during the winter months. The energy thrift and recycling of materials aspects of this design could contribute to future sustainability.

AB This paper describes the application of fractal dimensioning and self-similar geometric patterning properties to the strategic harvest of solar energy. Specifically, the paper examines application of fractal principles at the scales of community, building, component, and material surface. Using fundamental geometric properties as the ''simple rules applied repeatedly'', one can maximize (at differing scales) the opportunity for differentiating and managing the energy harvest to fit user(s) need. The paper discusses the use of fractal patterning as a means of dimensioning and scaling the ''ratios of transparency'' - the formal geometric expressions of conversion potential resulting from surface roughness condition(s). Roughness in fractal terms is a relative factor ranging in application from community-scale constructs on the land (which can mimic natural physiography) to the microscopic geometry of PV semi-conductor surfaces. Specific illustration at the scales cited can be correlated to the spreadsheet inventorying of energy harvest potentials. Fractal patterning provides an opportunity for treating strategies of energy harvest - embodied in community, building, component, and material surface - as seeds for a new urban form.

AB In several well publicised designs for 'green' office buildings, the zone of mediation between inside and outside has been increased by the addition of a second building envelope. When interpreted as exemplars of sustainable architecture, the addition of a second wall in these buildings is questionable both biophysically and psycho-culturally. More constructive design strategies acknowledge the wider biophysical contexts of the human ecosystem, the prudent use of material and energy resources throughout a building's life, make realistic use of climate, and promote psyche-cultural needs arising out of ecologism.

The major growth region for the next decade is SE Asia and particularly the cities of South China for which Hong Kong is a role model with its dense urban construction Recent Hong Kong energy legislation addressed the thermal transmission of the envelope without integrating building services energy consumption while planning legislation determines plot ratio but does not restrict overall building height in most areas of Hong Kong. A recently constructed high-rise commercial building has been analysed and proposed modifications computer modelled to evaluate options to extend daylight deeper into the space using extra interior height, alternative glazing and an external lightshelf. The commercial programme Lightscape, recently developed, is being assessed as a design tool to visually simulate the interior lighting, the illumination levels and daylight factors verified against scale physical models.

AB The environmental consequences of options for the manufacture, application, disposal, reuse and recycling, applicable to the Full range of currently conceived advanced window systems, are discussed. Advanced window systems may incorporate, singly and in various combinations: evacuated contiguously-sealed glazing, electrochromics, thermochromics, photochromics, aerogels, xerogels, inert gas filled double glazings, low infra-red emittance coatings, diffractive daylight deflectors, holographic daylight deflectors refractive daylight deflectors, toughened glass.
   The primary impetus for the development of such systems is that their use enables buildings to incur minimal energy use by reducing window heat losses and/or the displacement of electric lighting by enhanced daylighting The energy savings associated with advanced glazings displace the combustion oi fossil fuels directly and indirectly; environmental benefits thus ensue. However these benefits map be offset by the impact of energy embodied from manufacture and the negative impacts of the extraction and disposal of constituent materials. Over their total life-cycle the environmental impact for advanced glazing systems and their associated means of manufacture, system fabrication and the tenable reuse, recycling and disposal options are unknown. The usefulness of life cycle analyses during the research and development stage is discussed.

A scientific analysis of settlements at Leh (Ladakh) and Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) presents their appropriateness in terms of thermal performance. Principles of architectural design evolved in these settlements when applied to modern buildings, illustrated through two projects designed by the author, suggest how low energy architecture, that is, sustainable, can be developed in the modem context, basically by way of architectural design.

AB Regional and Local Plans are being required by central government to respond to the protocols of RIO 1992. This is an onerous task involving potentially massive technological, social and cultural change. In parallel to this externally imposed requirement, is an ever growing view, now being adopted by an increasing number of sectors and interests within western society that not only the natural environment is degrading, but also the population's general quality of life is degrading; and even within certain commercial sectors, diminishing returns are directly related to a poorer physical environment.
   This paper describes a 'bottom up' popular initiative set in motion to assist the cultural, social and commercial regeneration of a western European town. Embryonic concepts of sustainability developed within this initiative are described as is an attempt to develop the concepts in respect to Regional and District Plans.

AB The consensus of the '92 Rio summit was that all development should aim for sustainable development. The major growth region for the next decade is SE Asia, particularly the cities of South China for which Hong Kong is a role model. Current buildings are heavily dependent on ail-conditioning while planning legislation plus cost factors have inhibited the use of external shading devices and building codes have failed to introduce comprehensive integrated standards for energy conservation. Photovoltaics an a renewable energy resource without harmful effects on the environment. The technology is maturing and high efficiency low-cost cells starting in commercial production. Opportunities exist for photovoltaic arrays as shading and cladding panels in high-rise construction. Hong Kong's solar radiation has been analysed, and the power potential of photovoltaic cladding and shading of a commercial building simulated. A 12 month study of photovoltaics has been set up to monitor real values in the urban context. Changes in present energy generation strategies are discussed, through NFFO and DSM, to assist the take-up of photovoltaics in buildings as well as the need for legislation to maintain solar access.

AB Fisheries social research has attracted increasing attention in recent debates concerning alternative approaches in the design of fisheries management systems. This essay examines case study and fisheries social research literature with a view to highlighting conceptual-analytical strengths, shortcomings, and lessons with respect to management concerns. II is argued that effective and sustainable management regimes require that central consideration be given the principles of social justice and distributional equity. Approaching these goals, in turn, requires that research and management design attend to issues such as local-level social structures, gender/ethnic relations, and the distribution of socioeconomic power and material benefits.

AB Drawing upon insights from research on agriculture and fisheries, interview data, and information from industry and government sources, this article provides evidence to account for the resilience of small producers in the Irish salmon farming industry. Although group marketing, unpaid family labor, and a local infrastructure have supported small firms, such production may be undermined by conflicts with the more powerful tourism industry. These conflicts point to the place of small firms in the sustainable development of the salmon aquaculture industry. The article concludes with public policy recommendations that may enable salmon farming to coexist with other user groups in the marine environment, and in the process provide for a balance between social equity and environmental integrity in the management of fisheries resources.

AB This article describes a community-based approach to salmon restoration and management in Willapa Bay, Washington. Willapa Bay is an area rich in natural resources, historically oriented toward extraction activities, and with increasing threats to its fishery resource. Members of the community have rejected the traditional blend of agency and industry decision-making control over the resource and are conducting a process that includes a diverse set of participants. The article describes the process as it nears the end of the planning phase and beginning of the implementation phase of salmon restoration. It identifies obstacles to achieving sustainable salmon management. including lack of coordination and consistency among fishery managers, limited participation by important stakeholder groups that leads to political roadblocks, and unavailability of important scientific and socioeconomic data and analysis. It also describes the long-term goals of consistent, adaptive, and participative salmon management in Willapa Bay.

AB The isolated desert city of Jaisalmar (Rajasthan, north-west India) now receives over 200 000 visitors per year, mainly as the result of the promotion of camel safaris to the Thar desert. Jaisalmar has a camel surplus because of mechanized farming, with animals redeployed into the safari business, Considerable profits are generated for camel owners and safari operators but these are directly returned to the local community either to finance a larger family or to buy more camels, This industry now controls the Jaisalmar economy but poor regulation threatens its sustainability with worrying implications for employment and environmental management.

AB Communication is the cornerstone of ecosystem protection and sustainable development efforts in the binational Great Lakes region of North America. Great Lakes environmental protection, remediation, and pollution prevention efforts bring together individuals from across The public sector, business and industry, citizens groups, and academia. The region is now working to enhance communications between these groups and the rest of the world, through the Internet-based Great Lakes Information Network (GLIN). Diverse regional data, information, and human resources located at key agencies and organizations are accessible via GLIN. These online resources span environmental quality, human health effects and other research, resource management, transportation, demographic, and economic data, as well as other resources in the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada. Federal, state, provincial, and regional agencies and a range of citizen, business, and research organizations are cooperating with the lead agency, the Great Lakes Commission, in developing GLIN into the region's shared Internet resource. GLIN resources are accessible to users of ubiquitous Internet research tools including World Wide Web and Gopher. Statistical information on usage and the region's response to ongoing efforts to build the GLIN system and solicit contributions of data and information indicate that we can continue to build GLIN into a truly regional resource which enhances communication among researchers, policy makers, students, and the general public.

AB Heartwater (HW) is the name given to the acute, febrile disease of ruminants caused by infection with the obligate intra-cellular rickettsia Cowdria ruminantium. The effect of losses associated with HW and dermatophilosis are an important constraint to the sustainable use of non-indigenous breeds, but recent advances in heartwater and dermatophilosis research provide optimism that integrated control of these conditions can be achieved in west Africa. The relevant advances in HW research are in methods for monitoring the status of animals at risk of developing heartwater, which allow the veterinarian and owner to identify control strategies for herds and individual animals, and developments in the field of vaccination. This paper seeks to provide information that may assist the veterinary services in west Africa in assessing and identifying opportunities for HW control. Recommendations for the activities of key institutions place an emphasis upon the isolation and identification of west African strains of Cowdria for inclusion in inactivated or live vaccines, and the need for donor support to enable field trials of integrated control methods for HW and dermatophilosis.

TI Impact of shifting cultivation on diurnal squirrels and primates in
   Mizoram, northeast India: A preliminary study
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB The impact of human land-use practices on tropical forest ecosystems is a major area of research in conservation biology. In India, an important region containing extensive tropical evergreen and semi-evergreen vegetation is in the Eastern Himalaya and the hill states of northeast India(1,2). Traditional slash and burn shifting cultivation or jhum practised by indigenous tribal peoples is the dominant form of human land-use in the hill tracts(3,4). Some authors have labelled jhum cultivation as primitive and destructive of forests and biodiversity(5,6). Recent studies, however, have suggested that it can be a sustainable form of land-use, compatible with specific conservation goals, if fallow periods are sufficiently long(7,8). This study examines the impact of jhum cultivation on three arboreal squirrel and four primate species by comparing species densities in successional jhum fallows of known age with primary evergreen and semi-evergreen forests in Mizoram state, northeast India. The results emphasize the need to maintain mature forest and late-successional (greater than or equal to 25 yr) vegetation for conserving several arboreal mammal species.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The assimilative capacity of a river, that is the so-called allowable pollution loading in a river basin, is a problem of water quality management involving optimization subject to constraints of standards of water quality and their models. This study is an up-to-date evaluation of assimilative capacity in a river basin with consideration of the imprecision of the water environment, i.e. water quality and river flowrate. The purposes of this study, in comparison with crisp linear programming (LP), is to select and evaluate four well-known fuzzy linear programming (FLP) approaches and to apply them to the assimilative capacity of a river basin. Tou-Chen River Basin in Taiwan. The results show the models of assimilative capacity of FLP are better than those of a crisp one, which reflect the flexible characteristics of the former approaches. The emphases in this paper are on how to formulate problems of assimilative capacity of a river according to FLP models and on how to solve them according to algorithms of crisp LP. Furthermore, the results of river analysis serve as criteria for regulatory agencies to implement the control of pollution sources and to accomplish finally the sustainable use of water resources.

ID BORNE DISEASE-CONTROL
AB In the past 15 years, there has been a dramatic resurgence of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever worldwide, with increased frequency of epidemics and geographic expansion of both the mosquito vectors and the viruses. The reasons for this resurgence are not well understood, but include uncontrolled and unplanned urbanization, increased movement of people and viruses by airplane and lack of effective control of Aedes aegypti, the principal mosquito vector of dengue viruses. The recommended method for Ae. aegypti control during the past 20 years has been ultra-low volume (ULV) application of insecticides, a method which targets the adult mosquito. Lack of efficacy of the ULV approach led to a reevaluation of recommended strategies for prevention and control of epidemic dengue and ultimately, resulted in development and widespread use of community-based, integrated approaches to Ae. aegypti control. This chapter reviews the use of community participation for controlling Ae. aegypti via larval source reduction and critically discusses programs in four countries from the standpoint of effectiveness and sustainability. It is concluded that a combination of vertically structured centralized and community-based approaches should provide short-term success as well as long-term sustainability.

AB This study specifies a procedure to quantify the determinants of sustainable crop production, and applies the method to wheat cultivation in the Tarai of Nepal. Three aspects of sustainability were considered. First, the fertility of the land was found to have deteriorated owing to long-term practices incompatible with soil and drainage conditions. Three-quarters of the farmers had reduced land fertility and for one-third of them the wheat yield was at least 20% lower than for farmers who applied farmyard manure to every crop and adopted a rotation consistent with soil and drainage conditions. Secondly, the study found that it was possible to improve resource-use efficiency in wheat production to give 25% higher production at current levels, type, and quality of farm resources. Resource-use efficiency was significantly related to farm management practices such as crop stand, variety, disease, and land preparation quality, and socio-economic factors such as off-farm job opportunities, poor plot accessibility, and migration. Thirdly, the increasing population pressure on land, decreasing livestock number per cropped area, and diminishing fuel wood sources, significantly reduced farm-based nutrient cycling because farmyard manure had to be used for fuel, This had implications for the higher use of the fossil-based inputs in crop production.

AB Background: Some interventions to reduce the risk of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that target youths have resulted in short-term increases in self-reported condom use. However, long-term intervention effects have not been assessed.
   Study Question: Can a theoretically and culturally based, AIDS-risk reduction intervention delivered to naturally formed peer groups increase self-reported condom use among African-American early adolescents at 6 and 12 months of follow-up?
   Methods: A randomized, controlled trial of a community-based intervention delivered in eight weekly sessions involved 76 naturally formed peer groups consisting of 383 (206 intervention and 177 control) African-American youths 9 to 15 years of age. A theory-based, culturally and developmentally tailored instrument that assessed perceptions, intentions, and self-reported sexual behaviors was administered to all subjects at baseline (preintervention) and 6 and 12 months later.
   Results: At baseline, 36% of youths were sexually experienced, and by 12 months of follow-up, 49% were sexually experienced. Self-reported condom use rates were significantly higher among intervention than control youths (85% vs 61%; P<.05) at the 6-month follow-up. However, by 12 months, rates were no longer significantly higher among intervention youths. The intervention impact at 6 months was especially strong among boys (85% vs 57%; P<.05) and among early teens (13 to 15 years old) (95% vs 60%; P<.01). Self-reported condom use intention was also increased among intervention youths at 6 months but not at 12 months. Some perceptions were positively affected at 6 months, but the change did not persist at 12 months.
   Conclusions: High rates of sexual intercourse underscore the urgent need for effective AIDS-risk reduction interventions that target low-income urban, African-American preteens and early teens. A developmentally and culturally tailored intervention based on social-cognitive theory and delivered to naturally formed peer groups recruited from community settings can increase self-reported condom use. The strong short-term improvements in behaviors and intentions followed by some relapse over longer periods argue for a strengthened program and research focus on sustainability.

DE Africa; agroforestry; development; dryland farming; environmental
   hazards; research education
AB For quite some time now, Africa has faced food shortages that are largely due to deterioration of agricultural environments and high population growth rates, leading to a combination of production pressures. The agricultural problems are particularly pronounced in dryland farming, and the means to mitigate them have to be mainly of a low external input nature. A case study from Kenya of an integrated research education approach holds much promise for contributions to solve such food production problems in the drylands of Africa and other low external input sustainable agriculture (LEISA). The approach emphasizes interdisciplinary research education of local scientists by problem-oriented research in tackling environmental hazards facing the farmers. Six primary sequential steps, from problem identification via field quantification to the contributions to solutions, are distinguished as essential. In the Kenyan example, it was possible to give a ''weather advisory,'' that is, an extension message with strong agroclimatological components, on the biophysical and economic limits of alley cropping Cassia siamea with maize in a semiarid environment. Adaptation requirements of some commercial instruments under tropical conditions were also covered. Such a range of subjects is essential if research education is to contribute to protection from environmental hazards in dryland farming.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Strategies are needed for reconciling competing demands at the regional level when areas are to be selected for protection and there are associated costs, possibly equivalent to forgone development opportunties. As an alternative to the fixed scaling (or weighting) of costs and benefits required by cost-benefit analysis, multi-criteria analyses allow the exploration of alternative weightings and a summary trade-off curve to determine preferred solutions. For alternative sets of areas, total cost could be plotted against total represented biodiversity, but a more consistent approach should look at trade-off space at the level of individual areas. For a given weighting, an area is assigned protection if and only if its contribution to total biodiversity, CB, exceeds its equivalent cost, EC (in biodiversity units). Because CB for a given area depends on which other areas are also protected, it can be more or less than EC. Here we develop an iterative strategy for selecting areas, such that, for a given weighting, an area is in the final protected set if and only if its final CB value is greater than its EC value. Sensitivity analysis is used to identify those areas that: (1) are assigned protection even when low weight is given to biodiversity, or (2) are not assigned protection even when high weight is given to biodiversity. This approach is applicable in principle to any surrogate measure for biodiversity; here examples are presented in which environmental data are summarized as an environmental space.

AB The article traces the history of the international regulation of biological diversity, especially microbial diversity, and considers international policy guidance, as well as the work of the IUCN and UNESCO and early legislative efforts to preserve biological diversity. The article analyses the provisions of the Convention with particular reference to the preamble and the Convention's jurisdictional scope, conservation and sustainable use, access to genetic resources, transfer of technology, biotechnology, financial resources and the financial mechanism and other institutional mechanisms envisaged by the Convention. The article also examines how the Convention has been implemented with particular reference to bilateral agreements and looks at the implications of the Convention for culture collections and some key areas of concern which continue to exist.

AB Laboratory studies were conducted to determine C and N dynamics during the decomposition of ryegrass straw under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. A K-C of 0.61 was developed for the chloroform-fumigation extraction method to estimate microbial biomass C. These estimates showed that the C and N requirement of the thermophilic biomass was approximately 50% of the mesophilic biomass. There was no relationship between chloroform-fumigation microbial biomass estimates and plating of microorganisms from straw on specific media. Mineralized C was measured as 185 and 210 g kg(-1) straw in the 25 degrees C and 50 degrees C treatments, respectively. The efficiency of microbial substrate use, on a total straw basis, was 34 and 28% in the 25 degrees C and 50 degrees C incubations, respectively. The level of soluble C declined more slowly than total C mineralization at both temperatures, indicating that a portion of the labile C was not readily biodegradable, The addition of N decreased the rate of C mineralization at both temperatures. The reduced N requirement of the thermophiles explains why rapid degradation of the high C:N residue occurred without additional N or the need for the addition of a low C:N ratio substrate. Additional inoculum did not affect the decomposition process. We conclude that the promotion of thermophilic biomass activities, through composting for example, may prove useful in upgrading agricultural wastes for introduction into sustainable cropping systems.

AB Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) shows potential as a sustainable herbaceous energy crop from which a renewable source of transportation fuel and/or biomass-generated electricity could be derived. In 1992, a new research program focused on developing switchgrass as a biomass energy feedstock was initiated by the U.S. Department of Energy in five of the southern United States. The multifaceted multi-institution research addresses breeding for improved biomass yields, regional field rests, cultural practices, physiology and tissue culture. Recent progress is highlighted in this paper. Preliminary results from the breeding program indicate that recurrent restricted phenotypic selection could lead to development of new cultivars. A technique for regenerating switchgrass plants via tissue culture has been proven and new populations of regenerated plants have been established in the field. Performance trials at three regional cultivar testing centers in Virginia, Alabama and Texas have shown that 'Alamo' switchgrass has higher biomass yield and broader adaptability than other cultivars rested. Research on management practices designed to maximize biomass yield has shown that multiple harvests of switchgrass may reduce total seasonal yields in some instances and that responses to fertilizer inputs vary with the environment. Seed dormancy often retards rapid establishment of competitive stands of switchgrass. Our research has indicated that seed dormancy can be modified, resulting in increased seed germination and a greater number of switchgrass plants. Research on the physiology of switchgrass has shown that lowland and upland ecotypes differ in photosynthetic rate but not in respiration rate. Findings in each of these areas can contribute to development of switchgrass as a sustainable bioenergy crop. Future research will address molecular biology techniques for exploiting genetic variation, explore canopy architecture and carbon allocation patterns affecting biomass yield, elucidate key factors in successful establishment of switchgrass and provide technology transfer that facilitates scale-up of switchgrass production for commercial energy production.

AB Partial replacement of fallow with legume green manures has the potential to improve cereal production and agricultural sustainability in the northern Great Plains. This is possible if N gains by annual legumes and enhancement of soil N availability are optimized. The objectives of the study were to (i) determine the N distribution in different vegetative components of four annual legumes; (ii) estimate their ability to accumulate N through fixation; and (iii) compare the N uptake of the cereal crop that follows legume green manure with that of cereal grown on fallow or of cereal receiving N fertilizer. Black lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), Tangier flatpea (Lathyrus tingitanus L.), chickling vetch (Lathyrus sativus L.), and feedpea (Pisum sativum L.) were grown in rotation with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Nitrogen concentration in legume nodules was several times greater than in any other plant part. However, N concentration in legume shoots was, on average, 27% greater than in legume roots. Total legume N content (% x mass) ranged from 41 to 126 kg ha(-1) in years of low weediness. In those years, below-ground legume N content ranged between 2 and 29 kg ha(-1) and averaged 7, 8, 17 and 6 kg ha(-1) for black lentil, Tangier flatpea, chickling vetch and feedpea, respectively. Estimates of N-2 fixation varied between 6 and 69 kg ha(-1) and averaged 18 kg ha(-1) for black lentil, 16 for Tangier flatpea, 49 for chickling vetch, and 40 for feedpea. Within 3 mo of green-manure incorporation, average net N mineralization across years was greatest after black lentil and chickling vetch (38 kg N ha(-1)). The average 49 kg N ha(-1) lost through cereal grain harvest was balanced by gains through symbiotic N-2 fixation when chickling vetch and feedpea were used as green manure, but black lentil and Tangier flatpea replaced only about 35% of the N removed in the grain.

ID COASTAL AREAS; MANAGEMENT
AB This article presents an analysis of a survey of the current state of marine protected area (MPA) management and describes possible factors associated with their perceived success throughout the tropics. Considerable progress has been made in the establishment of MPAs in both developing and developed nations, but the formulation and implementation of management plans has lagged behind. Funding, expertise, and lack of information have constrained planning and management of MPAs in several tropical nations. Despite the promotion of ecologically sustainable development and the involvement of local communities or stakeholders within protected areas, few countries incorporate these principles in the management of MPAs. Tropical MPAs are considered to be of limited success by area managers. Several interrelated factors, such as strategic planning and reliance on coastal resources and zoning schemes, may influence the success of these areas.

TI Command and control and the pathology of natural resource management
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID ECOSYSTEMS; SCALE
AB As the human population grows and natural resources decline, there is pressure to apply increasing levels of top-down, command-and-control management to natural resources. This is manifested in attempts to control ecosystems and in socioeconomic institutions that respond to erratic or surprising ecosystem behavior with more control. Command and control, however, usually results in unforeseen consequences for both natural ecosystems and human welfare in the form of collapsing resources, social and economic strife, and losses of biological diversity. We describe the ''pathology of natural resource management,'' defined as a loss of system resilience when the range of natural variation in the system is reduced encapsulates the unsustainable environmental, social, and economic outcomes of command-and-control resource management. If natural levels of variation in system behavior are reduced through command-and-control, then the system becomes less resilient to external perturbations, resulting in crises and surprises. We provide several examples of this pathology in management. An ultimate pathology emerges when resource management agencies, through initial success with command and control, lose sight of their original purposes, eliminate research and monitoring, and focus on efficiency of control. They then become isolated from the managed systems and inflexible in structure. Simultaneously, through overcapitalization, society becomes dependent upon command and control, demands it in greater intensity, and ignores the underlying ecological change or collapse that is developing. Solutions to this pathology cannot come from further command and control (regulations) but must come from innovative approaches involving incentives leading to more resilient ecosystems, more flexible agencies, more self-reliant industries, and a more knowledgeable citizenry. We discuss several aspects of ecosystem pattern and dynamics at large scales that provide insight into ecosystem resilience, and we propose a ''Golden Rule'' of natural resource management that we believe is necessary for sustainability: management should strive to retain critical types and ranges of natural variation in resource systems in order to maintain their resiliency.

AB Natural scientists are being encouraged by environmental and developmental agencies to define and operationalize the concept of sustainability in a ''scientific'' manner. Such an approach is fraught with dangers because values, opinions, and social influences are an inextricable part of science, especially applied science. Natural scientists' attempts to define sustainability, particularly to decide what should be sustained, cannot therefore be value-neutral. They simply end up shifting value judgments to different levels by choosing either a single obvious objective, an arbitrary range of objectives, or an arbitrary method of aggregating different preferences. This lack of self-reflectiveness on the part of scientists has important consequences for the direction of research and its political implications. Natural scientists should heed lessons from earlier cases of scientists' involvement in policy and redefine the terms of reference before shouldering their social burden. The dilemma of pursuing objective science in a value-loaded and socially charged discourse can be resolved by properly understanding the role of analysis and by pursuing a socially grounded pluralistic approach to problem definition and research methodology.

AB Many populations of threatened American ginseng (Panax quinquefolium) and vulnerable wild leek (Allium tricoccum) have declined and gone extinct because of overharvesting in Canada. We assessed the impact of harvesting on populations of these species in stochastically varying environments and estimated their extinction thresholds and minimum viable populations. With both species we used four transition matrices taken from the literature in stochastic population projections under various harvesting regimes. For American gingseng the mean population growth rate (<(lambda)over cap>) declined with increasing harvesting rate (h) according to the number of years between harvests (t(r)), as -0.54 h t(r)(-0.90). When plants with more than two leaves are harvested every 5 years, a harvest rate of approximately 30% was sufficient to bring the <(lambda)over cap> below the equilibrium value of 1.0. Extinction thresholds, the minimum number of plants needed to rebuild a population, varied from 30 to 90 plants, and the minimum viable population size was estimated at 170 plants. Only a dozen populations known in Canada exceed 170 plants, so most populations could not support any harvesting without serious threats to their long-term persistence. For wild leek, two harvesting strategies were identified from confiscated, illegal harvests from Gatineau Park (Quebec): (1) ''choosy'' harvesters collect fewer but larger bulbs, and (2) ''busy'' harvesters collect numerous but smaller bulbs. These data allowed simulations of more-realistic harvesting strategies. The rate of the decline <(lambda)over cap> along the harvest gradient was faster for wild leek than for ginseng and varied with harvesting strategies. At harvesting rates between 1 and 8% the probability that <(lambda)over cap> falls below the equilibrium value was less than 5%. The extinction threshold of wild leeks was estimated at 140-480 plants and the minimum viable population at 300-1030 plants, according to the threshold chosen. Remnant wild leek populations in Quebec rarely contain more than a few hundred plants, indicating the serious threat commercial harvesting represents for this species. For both species we found that the whims of a stochastically varying environment significantly reduce sustainable harvest levels.

AB A preliminary assessment of the utilization of plant species was undertaken within an Amerindian community at Kurupukari, Guyana. A total of 120 plant species of 46 plant families, covering 246 different plant uses were identified. Plant uses were divided into six utilization categories; 64 species for medicinal, 53 for technological, 43 edible, 20 for timber, 14 for construction and two species was with miscellaneous uses. Of the 120 plant species, one species was recorded with five different use categories, two with four and 13 with three. A further 23 species were identified as having multiple uses. Of the 20 commercial timber species, five species were also shown to exhibit some form of non-timber product use, emphasising the under-utilization of species extraction. The dual extraction of both timber and non-timber resources form the same tree as a more effective sustainable utilization of available forest resources is also discussed.

TI Hydrogen as a future transportation fuel
SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A smooth transition from a petroleum-driven transportation system to clean-burning automobiles with the performance and range of today's gasoline cars is plausible using high-efficiency hydrogen-fueled hybrid-electric vehicles. The introduction of hydrogen (H-2) vehicles will reduce U.S. dependence on oil imports, virtually eliminate automotive urban air pollution, accelerate the development of cost-effective renewable energy, and help stabilize greenhouse-gas emissions. Based on an economic and technical analysis, H-2 vehicles, when first introduced, can be cost-competitive with battery-powered electric vehicles. As market penetration increases, H-2-vehicle fueling costs would become competitive with the fueling costs of today's gasoline Vehicles (5 cent/mi). Hydrogen production at filling stations, vehicle fleets, and homes would circumvent many start-up issues and would use existing natural gas and/or electricity energy infrastructures to begin the transition towards a clean, flexible, sustainable, and secure transportation fuel.

AB We present a goal programming (GP) model designed to capture multiple objectives involved in sustainable energy-environment management in an urban area. The basic structure in the GP model is a Reference Energy System (RES) that maps the optimal flow of intermediate forms of energy from supply side to demand nodes at the end use level in the four major economic sectors, viz., domestic, transport, industry, and services and commercial. The sustainability objec tives include: (a) meeting minimum useful energy demand of each end use in different sectors, (b) maximizing the capacity utilization of power stations and the stock of modal fleet, (c) minimizing expenditure on energy within the budget limits, (d) minimizing emissions of different pollutants with respect to the 1990 loading, and (e) minimizing over-utilization of energy resources. The relative weights of importance of each of the goals and sub-goals have been elicited from experts using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The integrated urban model is used to assist in developing an effective sectoral energy plan and is applied to the city of Delhi (India) to examine the effects in the year 2001 under two scenarios. In the first scenario, the possibilities for improving efficiency and abating pollution are ignored. The second scenario illustrates the effect on emissions by improving device, technology and economic efficiency, while reducing urban traffic congestion. Around 10% energy savings is possible in Delhi under scenario 2, with consequent emission reductions of lead (33%), CO (24%), HCs (21%), SPM (17%), SO2 (12%), NOx, and CO2 (10% each).

AB This paper describes how most global U.N. Conferences have failed to address the causes of the problems they are discussing - especially the inappropriate institutional framework where the imperatives of the ''money world'' take precedence over the living world of people and where control over productive resources is increasaingly wrested away from local people and communities (and governments) by large and generally unaccountable corporations. It also describes the routes to a more just and sustainable society, and how civic society must reclaim the power it is losing to the money world. This includes the ways in which the United Nations Habitat II Conference can and should align itself with this process.

AB This paper summarizes information on geomorphology and physical resources as a part of the Jordan Badia Research and Development Program. The research focused on the issue of the environment in arid lands as an aid to providing practical options for sustainable development, for the benefit not only of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan but of other arid regions of the world. The research is significant in that there is a need to identify usable natural resources and establish a framework for their effective exploitation and management in a marginal, fragile environment, which is sensitive to change. Pressure for development of the Badia stems from the fact that the great majority of the population in Jordan is compressed into less than 10% of the country by environmental constraints. It is hoped that the Jordan Badia Research and Development Program will provide the required framework to ease current environmental pressures, encourage migration to the Badia, a sparsely populated region, and establish economically and ecologically self-supporting communities. This paper discusses the following areas that are related to the sustainable development of the Jordan Badia with special emphasis on the Safawi area in the northern Jordan Badia; geomorphology, including landform, processes, and hazards; geology and physical resources; hydrology; surface water and water engineering; and groundwater.

AB This paper surveys recent work on the sustainability of fixed exchange rates, It considers a dynamic version the Barro-Gordon framework, in which the level of a state variable (in this case debt) determines the pay-offs available to the government at each point in time. Multiple equilibria and self-fulfilling runs are possible, but only at certain levels of debt. A surprise devaluation can either increase or decrease future expected devaluation relative to a no-devaluation situation.

SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Surveys of the relationship between pests and diseases and crop sustainability in several areas of Kenya, Nigeria, and other regions of Africa indicate that the production of numerous crops has declined sharply as a result of major pest and disease outbreaks, and others are threatened with major decline because of a surge in virulence of an endemic pest or disease, the introduction of a virulent exotic pest or pathogen, or because a system of control used previously has collapsed. Many of the crops that have declined were already experiencing reduced economic demand. In other cases, crop sustainability has been preserved by vigorous farmer responses or by the intervention of national and international research institutions. Most pests and pathogens, however, remain within tolerable bounds most of the time, though this often requires the use of chemical or cultural controls, or the availability of adequate land to compensate for losses. As land availability declines, more strenuous management efforts may be needed to sustain productivity.

AB This study examines forest management behaviour at the estate level by comparing the uneven-age stand and even-age stand management methods. A production function and forest dynamics function are derived for the forest management of a Mexican estate and these functions are analysed. Lastly, the dynamic forest management behaviour is analysed. The production functions exhibit both increasing and decreasing marginal returns to management effort. The dynamics of the growing stock volume are linear functions of the lagged volume and management effort. The even-age stand method is more efficient in the economic sense than the uneven-age stand method. In the context of reasonable sustainability requirements its potential cannot be employed efficiently, which may affect the estate structure, markets for forest management services and inputs, and fluctuation of the forest management activity.

TI Integrated regional assessment of global climatic change: Lessons from
   the Mackenzie Basin Impact Study (MBIS)
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper outlines the potential role integrated regional assessments of global climatic change scenarios could play in building better links between science and related policy concerns. The concept is illustrated through description of an ongoing case study from Canada-the Mackenzie Basin Impact Study (MBIS). As part of the Government of Canada's Green Plan, the Global Warming Science Program includes a study of regional impacts of global warming scenarios in the Mackenzie Basin, located in northwestern Canada. The MBIS is a six-year program focussing on potential climate-induced changes in the land and water resource base, and the implications of four scenarios of global climatic change on land use and economic policies in this region. These policy issues include interjurisdictional water management, sustainability of native lifestyles, economic development opportunities (agriculture, forestry, tourism, etc.), sustainability of ecosystems and infrastructure maintenance. MBIS is due to be completed in 1997. MBIS represents an attempt to address regional impacts by incorporating a ''family of integrators'' into the study framework, and by directly involving stakeholders in planning and research activities. The experience in organizing and carrying out this project may provide some lessons for others interested in organizing regional or country studies.

TI Economics, ethics, and climate policy: Framing the debate
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID GREENHOUSE; EMISSIONS; COSTS
AB This paper examines the economic and ethical dimensions of climate policy in light of existing knowledge of the impacts of global warming and the costs of greenhouse gas emissions abatement. We find that the criterion of economic efficiency, operationalized through cost-benefit analysis, is ill-equipped to cope with the pervasive uncertainties and issues of intergenerational fairness that characterize climate change. In contrast, the concept of sustainable development-that today's policies should ensure that future generations enjoy life opportunities undiminished relative to the present-is a normative criterion that explicitly addresses the uncertainties and distributional aspects of global environmental change. If one interprets the sustainability criterion to imply that it is morally wrong to impose catastrophic risks on unborn generations when reducing those risks would not noticeably diminish the quality of life of existing persons, a case can be made for significant steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt.) is increasingly recognized as a valuable fuelwood throughout Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. Know ledge of the distribution of nutrients among biotic and abiotic components is an important step in developing prescriptions for managing these stands for sustainable productivity.
   Eight Q. gambelii stands were sampled for concentrations (%) and accumulations (kg ha(-1)) of total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (Na), and sodium (Na) among aboveground and belowground biomass components and the upper 30 cm of soil. Highest concentrations of N, P, and S occurred in oak leaves, understory leaves, and the Forest floor layer. Generally highest concentrations of Ca, Mg, K and Na occurred in the soil.
   The greatest proportion of the total capital of individual nutrients was contained in the soil (82%-99%). Aboveground components of live biomass, standing and down-dead, and forest floor contained 10%, 14%, and 8%, respectively, of total capitals of N, P, and S. The forest floor had the largest accumulation (63%) of total nutrients (N, P, S, Ca, Mg, K, and Na) of live and dead aboveground components. Nutrient accumulation in live biomass was heavily weighted to the belowground component. The dense system of roots, rhizomes, and lignotubers comprising 56% of total biomass contained 62% of the total accumulation of nutrients in live biomass.
   Low levels of total P in the soil and accumulation of 14% of the ecosystem total of P in aboveground biomass components suggest the need for a better understanding of the role of P in productivity of these stands in development of prescriptions for management of residues after harvest.

ID TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper reports a study into the relationship between the strategic use of information technology in financial service organizations and the strategic context within which such use is made, Using an obtained sample of 46 per cent of all major banks, building societies and insurance companies in the UK, we evaluate the extent to which the financial services industry is, in general, strategically orientated in its utilization of information technology (IT) to support marketing, We find a good degree of integration of marketing and IT groupings with the strategic planning process but document a high degree of strategic ambiguity and lack of strategic time frame for such investment decisions, These results, coupled with a general reliance on traditional cost benefit appraisal methods are, we argue, indicative of a short-term, rather than strategic, focus for information systems use. We conclude that, within the UK financial services industry in general, the strategic vision does not seem to exist to enable the majority of those firms adopting IT innovations to support marketing to gain sustainable strategic advantage.

AB 1. An improved understanding of fishing effects is required to assess the sustainability of existing fishing practices and to determine the ecological implications of offering fishing concessions in marine reserves.
   2. The effects of fishing were investigated in six Fijian fishing grounds (qoliqoli) subject to different fishing intensities.
   3. A visual census technique was used to determine the structure and biomass of the shallow-water reef fish communities targeted by the fishers.
   4. A supervised voluntary logbook scheme was used to assess the size and composition of yield from the qoliqoli.
   5. The fish communities in the least intensively fished qoliqoli were significantly different from fish communities elsewhere. The significance of these differences was attributable to the greater biomass of invertebrate feeding and piscivorous fishes in the least intensively fished qoliqoli.
   6. Annual yields of herbivorous fishes ranged from 0.3 to 5.2% of the biomass estimated by visual census. There were no significant differences in herbivore biomass among qoliqoli subject to different fishing intensities.
   7. The biomass of invertebrate feeding fishes was significantly higher in the least intensively fished qoliqoli. The biomass of invertebrate feeding/piscivorous fishes was significantly higher in the two least intensively fished qoliqoli.
   8. In the two least intensively fished qoliqoli the estimated annual yields of invertebrate feeding and invertebrate feeding/piscivorous fishes did not exceed 4% of the biomass estimated by visual census. However, yields of these trophic groups approached 20% of biomass in the intensively fished qoliqoli where biomass was significantly lower.
   9. The fishing effects observed were primarily attributed to significant differences between the fish communities in the least intensively fished qoliqoli and all others. Thus, at higher fishing intensities, the biomass of target species provided a poor index of relative fishing pressure.
   10. The results suggest that the annual removal of 5% of fish biomass may cause significant structural changes in reef fish communities. Thus, it is important to ensure that fishing concessions and poaching activities are carefully regulated in marine reserves.

TI Seven deadly sins in confronting endemic iodine deficiency, and how to
   avoid them
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
LA English
DT Article
AB Iodine deficiency is a problem for almost all countries of the world. Goiter is its most obvious consequence, but others do more damage, particularly effects on the developing brain. In 1990, most countries and international agencies pledged the virtual elimination of iodine deficiency by the year 2000. The technology for the assessment and implementation is sufficient to attain this goal, but translating its potential into success requires careful planning. This article reviews seven major errors that frequently occur in iodine supplementation programs and offers suggestions for their avoidance. They are 1) unreliable assessment of iodine deficiency: the best indicators are urinary iodine concentration, thyroid size (preferably by ultrasound), blood spot thyroglobulin levels, and neonatal TSB determinations; the best group for surveys is schoolchildren; 2) poor iodine supplementation plan: iodized salt is the preferred supplement; its effective application frequently requires extensive changes in salt production and marketing, and poor handling of these changes will endanger the iodization program; other measures include iodized oil, iodized water, and iodine drops; all are occasionally useful, but the long range solution should generally be iodized salt; 3) exclusion of relevant stakeholders: the program should include not only health authorities but other arms of the government as well (education, commerce, agriculture, and standards), the salt industry, health professionals, and the iodine-deficient community itself; 4) inadequate education: an understanding of the effects of iodine deficiency and the means for its correction is essential at all levels, from government to affected population; 5) insufficient monitoring: the best instruments are urinary iodine levels, iodized salt use, and thyroid size, measured in representative groups at regular intervals with public reporting of results; 6) inattention to cost: the expense of iodization must be recognized and apportioned fairly; and 7) nonsustainability: for permanent success, an iodization program must be fair to all relevant parties and accompanied by a regular system of appropriate monitoring. Only with careful avoidance of these seven ''deadly sins'' can the goal of sustainable elimination of iodine deficiency be achieved.

DE Haematobia; cattle; traps
ID IRRITANS; CATTLE
AB A newly developed Haematobia spp. trap is described, and results are presented from field trials to reduce populations of adult horn fly, Haematobia irritans L., on 5 dairy farms in western Florida and Alabama during the summer of 1992. We compared Ay infestations on milkers subjected to trapping, versus either dry cattle on the same farm or milkers on a nearby farm, without the trap but where traditional born fly control practices were used. Results gave 96.9% (95% CI, 93.8-98.4) reduction compared with dry cattle with a mean count of 228 per animal, and 90.2% (84.5-94.5%) compared with milkers on the control farms with a mean count of 113. Trapping removed the need to use insecticides to control this pest on milking dairy cattle and so offers a practical, environmentally acceptable, safe, and sustainable means of horn fly control on cattle which pass through the trap regularly.

DE Phyllocnistis citrella; petroleum spray oil; integrated pest management;

AB The efficacy of 3 petroleum spray oils and abamectin plus oil for the control of the citrus leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton were compared with conventional broad-spectrum pesticides, cartap and methomyl, in a commercial orange orchard in southern China. No differences were found among the 3 oils in the number of mines per leaf sampled 4 d after the application of 3 sprays at an interval of 6-7 d. A narrow-range oil applied at a rate of 500 ml/100 liters of water provided control of leafminer equivalent to cartap and methomyl. Abamectin Dirts petroleum spray oil at a rate of 1.5 g (AI) plus 500 ml/100 liters of water, respectively, provided complete control of leafminer. The dose response of citrus leafminer to narrow-range petroleum spray oil, water emulsion indicated that concentrations >0.5% oil provided little additional protection. No phytotoxicity was observed with any of the oil treatments. Results are discussed in terms of a sustainable, integrated pest management system.

AB Searching for new biologically active compounds from natural sources starts, obviously, in the field. Plant, microbial or animal materials to be sought and investigated may be selected through a number of approaches. No matter what selection criterion(a) is (are) used, the first step in obtaining the organism concerned is to undertake field collecting work to search for and to collect the organism. Good knowledge on the ecogeographic distribution and precision in the taxonomic identification of the organism(s) sought are crucial if the field work involves the search for a pre-determined organism or set of organisms. Such knowledge and precision during field work are of secondary importance, however, if the search and collection are based on biodiversity or ethnomedical uses, since accurate taxonomic identification may be made at a later date, in a Museum or Herbarium environment. When an individual or institution from a biotechnologically developed country wishes to obtain indigenous raw biological material from a biotechnologically less developed country, an agreement for the procurement of such raw material may be negotiated. Since the effort to search and develop a biologically active compound(s) from natural sources is a long-term process that involves teamwork between field and laboratory scientists, the success of the endeavor will depend in large part on the continued flow of raw material from the field. Goodwill to maintain such a flow may be achieved through appropriate scientific and monetary compensations, both in real-time and in long-term sharing of the benefits of discovery. Only with the prospect of financial return to the supplying country will there be an incentive for the protection of the natural resources towards sustainable use and development, as well as to allow time for continuing explorations and discoveries.

AB Glare PLC has had a significant involvement with Natural Product Source Materials for all of its commercial history and, most recently, has pursued this interest by use of such materials as templates for new lead discovery. Through the expertise and facilities in its Natural Products Discovery Department, Glare extracts relatively small quantities of plant material (typically 200-250 g dry weight) and cultures microorganisms from environmental samples (typically 10-50 g). Extracts and fermentation broths are screened in order to detect bioactive principles (BPs). If the potency, selectivity and specificity of the BP is acceptable, isolation, purification and structural elucidation follows. It is most unlikely, in our experience, that the BP itself will become a drug; it is much more likely that we shall need to initiate a medicinal chemistry synthesis program in order to try to produce a molecule that has both the essential biological and desirable chemical properties to become a drug development candidate. This synthetic process is often a long one and our confidence that such a process is worth undertaking is greatly improved if the BP is novel. An essential component of any medicinal chemistry strategy is that it allows us to obtain secure intellectual property rights through patents. Acquisition of product claim protection, the strongest form of patent protection, is of great importance. Safety testing and clinical development of the candidate drug can take 7-10 years, and often more, during which patent protection is constantly eroding. Recognizing that acquisition of Natural Products Source Materials is an issue of growing concern, Glare Research and Development Ltd. (GRD), in the early part of 1992, implemented a policy for plant supply. This policy was subsequently modified to embrace source materials such as environmental, soil and marine samples from which fungi, micro- and macroorganisms may be obtained. As a direct consequence of this policy, Natural Product Source Materials supply agreements are only concluded with national and international organizations who possess the expertise to identify and collect the samples. It is equally important that our suppliers have the authority, which must be provided to GRD in writing, to collect such materials and to provide them to GRD for extraction and screening purposes. Such materials must be from sustainable and accessible sources. We will not seek to collect any endangered species. Though ethnomedical information can be helpful, it is not essential. Plants must be taxonomically classified. We reimburse the supplying institute for their efforts and their expertise, and recognize an obligation to offer a royalty to the institute in the event that drug discovery, with subsequent commercialization, owes its origin, however indirectly, to a material that it provided. In discussions with the institute, we insist that 'a fair proportion' (>40%) of that royalty be used for the direct benefit of the people in the collection source area In this context, GRD recognizes the importance of local training and education.

AB The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity marks a basic change in the international status of genetic resources. Prior to the Convention, these resources were considered to be the 'heritage of mankind.' Although the intent of this open access regime was to ensure the widespread availability of genetic resources for agriculture and industry, commercial use of the resources provided no additional economic incentive for conservation by source countries. The Biodiversity Convention corrects this policy failure by establishing that states have sovereign rights over their genetic resources, thereby enabling market incentives to complement various multilateral mechanisms that might directly fund biodiversity conservation. A number of obstacles face countries that are translating this broad right to regulate access into specific policies, laws, and regulations designed to meet conservation and development objectives. A review of these obstacles and of trends in technological development suggest that nations and developing country institutions should take a set of actions to develop access legislation and Material Transfer Agreements, establish biodiversity 'cooperatives' and intermediary institutions to facilitate information exchange, develop minimum standards for access legislation, and require that prior informed consent of local communities be obtained by all biodiversity collectors.

AB Brazil is a gene rich country, host to 24% of known primate species, between 10 and 15 million species of insects, and 22% of the world's higher plant species. The debate over how and by whom these resources should be protected has intensified over the last few years due to a growing awareness of the links between sustainable utilization of natural resources, conservation of biodiversity, and economic development. Within this context the pharmaceutical exploitation of natural products for drug development has a prominent place. For a significant portion of Brazilian society, fair cooperation is welcome and can facilitate drug discovery. Nevertheless, the complexity of the consequences of patenting and utilization of natural resources calls for a thorough cost/benefit analysis in order to promote policies that can ensure significant and long term benefits for the country.

AB The property, usage, and access to genetic resources, is today one of the primary topics in international business, as a result of the strategic importance of the resources for the biotechnology industry. Internationally, the sovereignty that each country has over its natural patrimony is recognized. However, the new laws of international marketing have obligated countries in the process of development, such as Colombia, to adopt and copy a concept of intellectual property on living resources that does not have anything to do with the country's sociocultural. identity, and sometimes even does not take into account its material enjoyment. The new juridical movement that treats genetic resources as private property produces a cultural conflict between indigenous populations, Afro-Americans and peasants, because for them the genetic resources are an element of community life. In these communities, knowledge is freely transmitted; it is an understanding that they have to conserve their agricultural customs and the relationship that they have with the environment. They do not recognize the term 'property' according to patenting laws. These elements have to be considered, respected and guaranteed in the laws that recognize the genetic resources in the country. On the other hand, not even countries that are pioneers in biotechnological development can adopt a concept about patents that is in agreement with the particularities that the living materials possess. This is obviously the reason for the numerous discussions on the legal interpretation, as well as complicated debates in court. Confronting that situation, there are countries rich in biodiversity, such as Colombia, but which do not have a proper concept and are not economically strong in the international context. These countries have to copy inadequate protection policies that do not take into account all their rights. This paper describes some of the technical, juridical, and sociocultural difficulties which Colombia has to confront, in order to set a guideline on patenting living organisms, and on the access and usage of the genetic resources.

AB Situated in Southeast Asia, with a tropical monsoon climate, Vietnam is covered by tropical rain forests over one-quarter of its surface. Forests have been extremely important in the country's economy and they will be essential in its future development. Forests contribute directly to the economy through the provision of building materials and energy and indirectly through foreign exchange earnings, which amount to about US$200 million annually. Forests play a key role in the conservation of biodiversity. They protect watersheds and thus contribute to flood control and water management in the highly productive delta regions. In order for the forests to contribute to the national economy, strong forest management institutions and proper policies are necessary. Forest land use and exploitation should be strictly controlled, and effective programs must be developed. The potential of the forests can only be realized on a sustainable basis through significant changes in current practices.

AB In October, 1993, 16 months after the United Nations approved the International Convention on Biodiversity held in Rio de Janeiro, June, 1992, the Philippine Congress ratified and adopted the Convention. This is a manifestation of the full support of the Philippines for the principles and policies adopted by the UN body on the conservation of biodiversity, sustainable development of biological resources and equitable sharing of benefits between users and owners of biodiversity resources. The Philippine scientific community has long recognized the need for and importance of a national guideline and policy with regard to the collection of plants and animals in the Philippines for scientific or commercial purposes. A series of consultative meetings were held by representatives of government agencies, non-government organizations, private organizations, academic and private persons concerned with biodiversity conservation to formulate national guidelines that regulate the collection of plant and animal specimens in the country. Guidelines were unanimously adopted by various government agencies and academia and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed on September 28, 1990. Very recently a new document was drafted, specifically to serve as a guideline for those who desire to undertake sample collecting in the Philippines for biodiversity prospecting. The document is now being reviewed by government departments and agencies and will be presented to the President of the Philippines for signing as an Executive Order (EO). Once signed, this EO will serve as a national policy for bioprospecting in the country. The Philippines is one of the countries in Southeast Asia that has endorsed the adoption of regional guidelines on the collection of plant and animal organisms for drug development. The ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (1985), The Manila Declaration (1992) and lately, the Melaka Accord (1994), all of which were signed by various countries in Asia, are manifestations of this interest.

   Tanzania
AB Tanzania is endowed with a rich natural resource. The biodiversity comprises over 10 000 plant species, a rich fauna and marine resources. The collection of biological resources is guided by a set of formalities, namely: (i) entry visas, (ii) research permits, (iii) designation of a relevant collaborating host institution or organization, and (iv) eventual joint field work with the collaborating host institution. A facility exists whereby an institution within the country can collaborate with a technologically developed institution or country through mutual research agreement in short and long-term programs. In such a case, Tanzanian scientists collect and export biological materials for drug testing by the collaborating partner. The research agreement is based on the understanding that benefits of the discovery are shared among all parties, namely, the host country's collaborating institution(s), government and indigenous cultures. Rules and regulations governing biodiversity prospecting fall under the categories of (a) floristic resources, (b) fauna or animal substances and (c) marine biological resources. The collection and export of CITES-listed organisms is governed by a separate policy package. Various national institutions are directly involved in overseeing the implementation of these policies. In this paper, these are reviewed to accommodate new conventions concerning research management policies on biological diversity and the sustainable utilization and conservation of these resources.

AB Adult rainbow trout (mass 600-1500 g; length 40-44 cm) were held in the laboratory for up to 28 days at seasonally appropriate temperatures. The maximal sustainable aerobic exercise level (involving slow-twitch muscle activity alone) was determined by following muscle recruitment patterns using electromyography. The mean (+/- S.E.M.) speeds recorded for maximal sustainable aerobic: exercise were 0.52+/-0.02, 0.81+/-0.06 and 0.39+/-0.02 BL s(-1) (body lengths per second) for animals swimming at their acclimatisation temperatures of 4, 11 and 18 degrees C, respectively. Thus, fish acclimatised to 11 degrees C reached the highest maximal sustainable (purely aerobic) levels of exercise. They had similar stride lengths to the 4 degrees C animals, but generated less thrust per stride, as indicated by increased tail-beat frequency. Acclimatisation to 4 degrees C led to an increased mass of slow muscle and more effective tail beats (greater stride length at lower frequencies), relative to animals at higher temperatures. Fish acclimatised to 18 degrees C had the lowest stride length and a reduced aerobic swimming capacity.
   Sustainable levels of aerobic exercise were reflected in unchanged values for mean heart rate and arterial blood pressure between rest and imposed, graded exercise. Radiolabelled microspheres were used to determine cardiac output (Vb) and regional blood flow distribution simultaneously in fish, both at rest and while swimming, for each acclimatisation temperature. Fish acclimatised to 11 degrees C had the greatest scope for increasing Vb. This resulted in a significant hyperaemia in slow muscle upon exercise (10-fold increase), without an active redistribution of flow from other tissues. Maximum Vb at 18 degrees C did not differ significantly from that at 11 degrees C but, because resting Vb was higher, the scope was reduced and was similar to that found at 4 degrees C. Specific blood flow to the active muscle was also reduced and this, together with decreased blood oxygen content and reduced slow muscle mass, may limit aerobic swimming performance at 18 degrees C.

AB Having outlined the conceptual design and planning capability in the previous two papers, the final contribution in this trilogy describes the application of WaterWare to the River Thames basin in England and Rio Lerma in Mexico. Examples are given of the real-world problems that can be addressed using this system. These include water-resource assessment, reservoir site selection, decontamination of groundwater, estimation of sustainable irrigation abstractions and derivation of required effluent-quality standards. The requirement in both cases is to provide the analytical tools to be used by the agency staff themselves for planning purposes.

ID NORTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; SPRING WHEAT; WATER STORAGE; NO-TILL; YIELD;
   SORGHUM
AB Water is the driving variable in Great Plains agriculture and sustainability depends on efficient use of incident precipitation. Spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (SWF and WWF) farming systems, as currently practiced, are not economically sustainable without government subsidies. This paper synthesizes information regarding the water use efficiency (WUE) of intensified cropping systems in cultivated dryland agroecosystems and proposes solutions to ensure sustainablity. Decreasing tillage and maintaining crop residue on the soil is requisite to improved efficiency. No-till fallow efficiency, the percentage of the precipitation stored during fallow, reached 40% in the early 1970s. However, scientists in the 1980s and 1990s still report fallow efficiencies no greater than 40%, indicating that other major system changes must occur if progress is to continue. Residue levels in the Great Plains usually are < 3 tons/acre and this probably has capped fallow efficiency near 40%. No-till management of crop residues after spring or winter wheat harvest increases soil water storage in the first portion of the fallow (July to May) compared with conventional fallow management, but the soil in the late fallow period (June to September for winter wheat and June to May for spring wheat) gains no more water, and may even lose water relative to the quantity present in the spring. Overall system efficiency is best evaluated by calculating grain WUE values. Modern no-till wheat-fallow (WF) systems, even with maximum fallow efficiencies, only had average grain WUE of 104 lb/acre per in. for spring wheat and 140 lb/acre per in. for winter wheat. WUE for 3-yr cropping systems, like winter wheat-corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow or winter wheat-sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]-fallow, increased WUE in Central and Southern Great Plains. Three year system WUE averaged 180 lb/acre per in., a 28% increase compared with WF. In the Northern Plains, continuous spring wheat systems averaged 122 lb/acre per in., a 15% increase compared with SWF. Individual crops within systems had the following potential WUE values: corn = 245 lb/acre per in., grain sorghum = 225 lb/acre per in., prose millet (Panicum miliaceum L). = 195 lb/acre per in., spring wheat = 216 lb/acre per in., and winter wheat = 150 lb/acre per in. Maximum system efficiency depends on choosing the most efficient plants for a given geographic area. Intensified cropping systems improve our ability to use precipitation efficiently. However, adoption of higher intensity cropping systems depends more on economic outcomes and government programs than on WUE or environmental effects.

AB Soil organic carbon levels have declined 24 to 60% on many Great Plains soils since initial cultivation. Integrated crop and livestock systems could help reverse this trend, therefore we examined the extent of use, the factors affecting use, and the potential for this system. The 1992 U.S. Department of Commerce data indicate that land in integrated systems is limited to less than 10% of the agricultural land. However, expiration of the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has created interest in integrated systems. Economists report that after CRP contracts expire, perennial forages and livestock systems may be the most profitable; however, a survey of growers indicates that 63% of all CRP acres will go back to crop production. Recent research in Wyoming shows that returning CRP land to production using wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow practices quickly degrades soil quality. A doubling of grazing fees would mean an 18% reduction in demand for public land, which could mean more options for CRP acreage after contract expiration. Exemplified successful systems are the Australia wheat-sheep (Ovis aries L.) system, perennial legume-wheat rotation in southern Alberta, grass community establishment on marginal Wyoming cropland, and an alternative (organic) farming system in South Dakota. Benefits include the opportunity for soil quality improvement, economic diversity, and pest control. However, tradition, lack of managerial experience, and necessary alteration in farm-ranch infrastructure may slow adoption. Generally, dryland integrated systems are agriclimatic zone specific, and represent a potential ecologically and economically sustainable form of agriculture. Scientists and producers have to identify and develop appropriate integrated systems that fit the natural resource base.

AB Management of fertilizer N in dryland cropping systems in the semi-arid Great Plains is important to the economic and environmental sustainability of these systems. As producers shift from the traditional tilled winter wheat (Triticum aestivium L.)-fallow (WF) cropping systems to those that include summer crops in the rotation, N management becomes more important because yield losses as a result of underfertilization become greater. Fertilizer N rate is more important in obtaining optimum yields of dryland crops than N placement in drier environments, while placement becomes more important as rainfall increases. Soil testing is an accurate method of quantifying the residual soil nitrate-N level in the root zone. However, a combination of soil testing, fertilizer N experiences of the producer, and projected N requirement (expected yield) are the best factors producers can use in determining fertilizer N rates. If soil testing occurs early in the spring/summer fallow period preceding planting, a correction to the fertilizer N recommendation should be made to account for N mineralization that occurs between soil sampling and planting. This can prevent overfertilization. Dryland systems appear to have a soil-plant N buffer capacity that prevents inorganic N accumulation at fertilizer N rates that exceed optimal N requirements to meet crop needs. Recent research has reported N buffering in the range of 21 to 76 lb N/acre per yr for annually cropped dryland wheat production systems. This means that the application of from 21 to 76 lb N/acre per yr did not result in an accumulation of inorganic N in the soil. This concept should be evaluated on additional datasets, and, if found to be applicable to a range of conditions, it could have an effect on establishing environmentally safe fertilizer N rates for dryland cropping systems.

AB Herbicides have played a vital role in dryland agriculture in the Great Plains since their introduction in the late 1940s. Herbicides have reduced the amount of tillage required for crop production. Reduced-tillage leaves crop residues at the soil surface, which results in greater soil water capture and retention, and reduces soil loss to wind and water erosion. Despite the benefits provided by herbicides, their future role in agriculture is uncertain. Trends including a decline in the introduction of new herbicides, the potential loss of older herbicides, a rapid increase in the number of cases of herbicide resistance in weeds, a dramatic increase in the capability to detect pesticides in the environment, and rising public concern about the effects of pesticides in the environment may indicate a reduction in herbicide use in the future. In order to retain herbicides as effective tools in sustainable crop production, strategies to maximize the efficiency of herbicide use must be developed and implemented. These strategies should include the use of crop rotation, competitive crops and cultivars, fertilizer placement technology, residue conserving tillage, biological control agents, and precision application technology.

TI Measuring sustainable cotton production using total factor productivity
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Continuous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production was examined using data from Alabama's long-term Old Rotation experiment (c. 1896). Index values were used to examine trends in productivity and sustainability for 95 yr. Treatments studied were those receiving (i) no N fertilizers and no winter legumes for 95 yr, (ii) only winter legumes as a source of N, and (iii) chemical fertilizer N. Three sets of index numbers were calculated from all inputs and outputs involved in the production systems: (i) total factor productivity (TFP), which accounts for all direct production inputs, but which does not consider production externalities; (ii) productivity relative to a base plot; and (iii) total serial factor productivity (TSFP), which accounts for all direct production inputs as well as externalities of soil erosion and pesticide use. Viewed from the 95-yr perspective of the Old Rotation experiment, all three treatments fulfill at least one criterion required for a system to be considered sustainable. Output per unit of input is higher in 1991 than in 1896, even when externalities are valued. None of the systems showed a linear trend in output or TFP over the life of the experiment; productivity cycles are present in all three systems, despite a positive overall t;end. An average annual rate of TSFP growth of 1.8%/yr was attained. Accounting for erosion and pesticide externalities reduced the annual productivity growth rate by 0.2%/yr. The system that has neither an organic nor a chemical source of added N was less productive and less sustainable than the two other systems, with a 0.3%/yr TSFP growth rate. The plots using organic and chemical sources of N had similar productivity impacts. Valuing soil erosion and pesticide externalities had only a modest effect on measured productivity. The most dramatic single event to affect the productivity of cotton farming was the introduction of the mechanical cotton picker. The impact of this technology was powerful enough to offset the effect of many other changes in the system.

TI Management alternatives for protecting Crassostrea virginica fisheries

SO JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Crassostrea virginica; Perkinsus marinus; oyster management; fisheries
   management
AB We review management of oyster stocks infected by Perkinsus marinus, comparing previously published recommendations with current practices, with emphasis on the public fishery in the Maryland portion of Chesapeake Bay. The epizootiology of perkinsiasis is described, particularly the spread of the disease into low salinity areas. We also describe recent attempts to develop a policy and management framework for restoration of oyster populations that have been depleted by P. marinus and Haplosporidium nelsoni. It is apparent from experiences in Gulf of Mexico estuaries, Long Island Sound, and Maryland that strong recruitment can, to some extent, offset the impacts of P. marinus on oyster fisheries. Although improved management practices so far have had very limited success in maintaining harvestable stocks in the Chesapeake, it is clear that the recruitment potential of oyster populations has not been diminished to a critical point. Strategies designed to enhance and supplement natural recruitment, along with maintaining growing areas as free from P. marinus infections as possible, currently offer the most promise for maintaining harvestable stocks. In combination, new developments in research, management, monitoring, and policy are cause for guarded optimism, both for larger, sustainable harvests and for restoration of some of the ecological functions of healthy oyster populations.

AB Purpose: We examined how transurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts, performed for infertility, affects semen quality in patients with azoospermia and oligo-asthenospermia.
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was done of 46 cases of transurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts for ejaculatory duct obstruction, confirmed by transrectal ultrasound. Clinical course and semen quality were assessed by semen parameter indications.
   Results: In 65% of the patients transurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts improved semen quality (greater than a 50% increase in total motile sperm count) and 20% initiated a pregnancy an average of 6.1 months postoperatively. Statistically significant increases in total motile sperm count were achieved in men with azoospermia and those treated for oligo-asthenospermic indications; the improvement also was shown to be sustainable. Complications occurred in 20% of the men.
   Conclusions: Significant and durable semen quality improvement can be achieved after transurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts for all surgical indications. In most unsuccessful cases the reason for failure is unclear.

SO JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA

DT Article
AB There is an increased awareness world-wide of the need for cost-effective, functional and sustainable groundwater abstraction. There have been recent reviews and updating of the technology involved, but less attention on integrating technical aspects with economic and management options. This is vital when assessing monitoring, operation and maintenance strategies. A key element in strategy development is the evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the options available. This paper discusses the issues involved and describes a spreadsheet-based methodology for evaluating the cost effectiveness of various monitoring and maintenance strategies for the management of water supply boreholes. Case studies are presented to illustrate the working of the method and issues arising from its use.

ID DYNAMICS
AB This paper reports on the growth of an isolated elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) population that became established naturally in a large block of shrub-steppe habitat in eastern Washington. Habitat quality in the area was high as was the potential for achieving maximum or near-maximum rates of sustained population growth. Nearly 20 years of trend data on the population yielded an overall rate of increase of 20% per year. A high annual survival (0.98) was calculated. An initially high calf-cow ratio was reduced in later years of the study, but causes could not be determined. The reproductive and survival data indicate a maximum rate of increase of 24% per year, and the data were used to show that a feasible maximum sustainable rate for elk may be as high as 28%.

AB We estimated litter size, birthrate (proportion of F with young in mid-Jun), and survival of young to winter for lynx (Lynx lynx) in southwest Yukon between 1990 and 1992. Radiocollared females were located shortly after parturition to count young, and relocated in winter to count the number of surviving young from tracks. Hare (Lepus americanus) density, as estimated by pellet transects, peaked at 7.4 hares/ha in 1990 and began to decline in winter 1990-91. Reproducing lynx faced a declining food supply in spring 1991. Litter size averaged 5.3 (n = 12) for adults (>2 yr) and 4.2 (n = 5) for yearlings in 1990, and all females monitored had litters in mid-June. Adult litter size was 4.9 in 1991 (n = 15) and 16 of 19 adult females (84%) had litters in mid-June. None of 7 yearlings retained litters in 1991. In 1992 none of 7 adult or 3 yearling females retained litters. Minimum survival estimated from track counts was 0.63 in 1990 and 0.75 in 1991 for kittens of adult mothers. Survival was 0.26 in 1990 for kittens of yearlings. Recruitment to 1 year of age was 2.8 kittens per adult female, and 0.55 kittens per yearling female in 1990. In 1991 recruitment was 3.2 from adults and 0.08 from yearlings. Lynx recruitment went from a peak in 1990 to zero reproductive output in 1992. Adult females managed to recruit young the year after the hare peak, but recruitment from yearlings virtually ceased in the first year of the hare decline. Recruitment from yearlings was surprisingly low, even in the peak hare year. If this observation describes other lynx populations, it has serious ramifications for trapped populations, which are often composed largely of yearlings. Population models which have based yearling recruitment on in utero data probably have overestimated recruitment and sustainable harvest.

AB A survey of the dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti was undertaken using funnel traps to detect immature stages (larvae and pupae) in flooded disused mine shafts and wells in Charters Towers, Queensland, Northern Australia. The town has a history of dengue fever since 1885 when goldminers were the first recorded victims. During the latest dengue epidemic in 1993, 2% of the population had laboratory-confirmed dengue virus Type 2, despite source reduction of Ae.aegypti breeding-sites at ground level or above. This led to suspicions that dengue vector Ae.aegypti breeding-sites might be below ground level. When surveyed in March 1994, Ae.aegypti immatures were found in 9/10 wells and 1/6 mine shafts. The water in wells and mines had similar characteristics - except that turbidity was higher in the mines, which more often contained predators of mosquito immatures.
   The copepod Mesocyclops aspericornis was collected from water in 1/10 wells and 2/6 mine shafts. Laboratory predation trials resulted in 95.5-100% predation by 25 copepods/l on Ae.aegypti first-instar larvae up to 200 larvae/l. Five wells containing Ae.aegypti in the survey were inoculated with fifty indigenous M.aspericornis, and five wells (one positive and four negative in the survey) were left untreated as controls. Nine months later, in December 1994, Ae.aegypti had been eliminated from all five treated wells but all untreated control wells contained Ae.aegypti, except for one well that contained a natural population of M.aspericornis. The role of wells and mines as winter/dry season refuges of Ae.aegypti in northern Australia is reviewed, and we recommend the use of M.aspericornis as a cost-effective, environmentally acceptable and persistent agent for the sustainable control of Ae.aegypti, especially in inaccessible breeding sites.

SO NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL

AB Ecosystem management strategies are said to redirect resource management efforts away from producing utilitarian outputs and toward maintaining desired conditions on the land This shift in emphasis is intended to preserve the ecological integrity of managed landscapes by sustaining biophysical systems. It is equally crucial that management agencies maintain socially acceptable (i.e., politically sustainable) landscapes, as the former goal cannot be achieved without the latter. To achieve both goals simultaneously social and ecological management objectives must be integrated. A barrier to integration has been the lack of a common language for the social and biological sciences. The concept ''habitat'' describes both social and biophysical aspects of ecosystems. The habitat concept can be applied to human uses of natural areas. Based on research conducted in western Oregon forests, a prototype ''habitat suitability index'' is proposed for each of three common forest uses: hiking, camping, and scenic viewing.

AB Many rural communities, particularly those in the western United States, are undergoing rapid social and economic change as they shift away from economies based on resource commodities (particularly wood products). As these changes occur, communities are searching for ways to maintain their viability. Protected natural areas represent potential economic development, either through the influence their presence has on business location decisions, or through their potential to provide opportunities for wildlife viewing. In this latter role, entrepreneurs can capitalize a growing market that is willing to spend money on information and wildlife-viewing supplies, equipment, and expertise. The example of Montana demonstrates the significance of wildlife viewing in terms of tourism and potential economic impact.

AB Interest in more rational and objective approaches to weed management has increased considerably in Canada and elsewhere. Cost/benefit issues, environmental concerns, and the development of weed resistance to herbicides have cast doubt on the rationality and sustainability of prophylactic herbicide use. The concept of an economic threshold for weeds and the broader concept of integrated weed management have considerable potential as practical agronomic tools in Canadian crop production systems. A large number of experiments have been conducted to determine the impact of weeds on crop yield, but the models developed from these studies have been put to little practical use. Constraints to the practical implementation of these concepts include a lack of realistic sampling procedures to assess the impact of weeds on crops over large areas, and a lack of information on the long-term implications of seed production by uncontrolled weeds. Weed ecologists conducting weed interference experiments should define their objectives better, and should provide guidelines on how their findings can be used at the farm level. Emphasis should be placed on the effects of the crop on the weed rather than the weed on the crop. There is also a need for greater coordination of research activities among weed ecologists. The establishment of standard protocols for long-term studies across locations and years would enhance the relevance and precision of weed interference models, and lead to the development of user-friendly decision support systems specifically adapted to aiding rational weed management decisions in Canadian crop production systems. The development of such systems will be essential to the implementation of weed thresholds and integrated weed management.

TI Housing and environmental policy in the UK
SO POLICY AND POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Since the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the development of a 'green' housing policy for the UK has received considerable attention. Even though there appears to be a consensus that a more environmentally sustainable housing system is both necessary and desirable, the British government has emphasised market mechanisms to tackle environmental problems. This article critically examines this approach to environmental policy in the UK, especially in the area of energy conservation, and argues that market based mechanisms lead to uncoordinated and ineffectual initiatives that increase social inequalities.

AB The paper proposes two axioms that capture the idea of sustainable development and derives the welfare criterion that they imply. The axioms require that neither the present nor the future should play a dictatorial role.
   Theorem 1 shows there exist sustainable preferences, which satisfy these axioms. They exhibit sensitivity to the present and to the long-run future, and specify trade-offs between them. It examines other welfare criteria which are generally utilized: discounted utility, lim inf. long run averages, overtaking and catching-up criteria, Ramsey's criterion, Rawlsian rules, and the criterion of satisfaction of basic needs, and finds that none satisfies the axioms for sustainability.
   Theorem 2 gives a characterization of all continuous independent sustainable preferences. Theorem 3 shows that in general sustainable growth paths cannot be approximated by paths which approximate discounted optima. Proposition 1 shows that paths which maximize the present value under a standard price system may fail to reach optimal sustainable welfare levels, and Example 4 that the two criteria can give rise to different value systems.

Intensity of animal exploitation, potentials of performance and breeding intentions and measures are to be subordinate to these premises of useful interaction between animal and plant production of enterprises. Management and marketing conditions also influence the development of symbiotic effects of integrated animal and pant production of tropical agriculture enterprises.

   analysis; developing countries
AB In the wake of increased environmental and sustainability concerns associated with agricultural development, developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choice between the short-run technological gains and the long-run environmental conservation. A dynamic investment decision model is developed to optimize the use of scarce public investment funds in the management of irrigation water supply, depth to water table and soil salinity. Four major classes of investments with different impacts on the hydrological balance within the Indus basin are considered: (a) expansion of the surface irrigation network, (b) public drainage projects, (c) tax and subsidy policies designed to influence the rate of private groundwater exploitation and (d) investment in improving the efficiency of the existing canal system by reducing conveyance losses. The crop area lost due to water logging and salt accumulation is treated as a damage cost of increasing the application of surface irrigation water. The resulting optimality conditions from the model are used to assess the development and operation of public drainage projects. The model results are compared for areas underlain by fresh and saline groundwater. The model is also used to analyze recent policy debate which has focused on the use of incentives such as subsidized credit, energy subsidies, and electrical grid expansion to accomplish the transfer of tubewell operation from the public to the private sector. Optimal switching conditions for such transfers are derived. The results show that a private farmer's optimal decision will diverge more from the societal optimal decision as more externalities from surface irrigation are accounted for.

AB The goal of this research was to determine whether crop management practices could substitute for a herbicide for managing mixed populations of green and yellow foxtail in hard red spring wheat. Crop yield and foxtail growth were measured in two years of field research in North Dakota. Spring wheat yields were as great or greater when early seeding date or 2x seeding rate were substituted for POST diclofop(3) at 0.75 kg al ha(-1) for managing foxtail in spring wheat, Yield of spring wheat competing with foxtails was greater for the high seeding rate (2x = 270 kg ha(-1)) than both the normal (Ix = 130 kg ha(-1)) and low (0,5x = 70 k ha(-1)) seeding rates for early or middle seeding dates, but not for the late seeding date, For both early and middle seeding dates, wheat yield at the 2x seeding rate without diclofop was equal to or greater than that of the Ix seeding rate with diclofop, Late-seeded wheat did not yield well in competition with dense foxtail stands for any treatment combination, Early and middle seeding dates favored the relative increase of green foxtail over yellow foxtail in wheat, whereas late seeding favored yellow foxtail over green foxtail, Economic analysis demonstrated that early seeding date was the most critical factor in determining the stochastic dominance of treatments without diclofop over treatments with diclofop. Seeding rate was much less important than seeding date in determining the ranking of treatments in stochastic dominance analysis.

AB Integrated weed management (IWM) research has focused on how crop yields and weed interference are affected by changes in management, e.g., tillage, herbicide application timing and rates, cover crops, and planting patterns, Acceptance of IWM will depend on recommendation of specific strategies that manage weeds and maintain crop productivity; such research will and should continue, However, IWM needs to move from a descriptive to a predictive phase if long-term strategies are to be adopted, Linking management changes with crop-weed modeling that includes such components as weed population dynamics and the ecophysiological basis of competition will help predict future weed problems and solutions and the economic risks and benefits of intervention, Predictive approaches would help incorporate IWM into models of the processes that occur in agricultural systems at wider spatial and temporal scales, i.e., in agroecosystems comprised of the interactions among organisms (including humans) and the environment, It is at these larger scales that decisions about management are initiated and where questions about the long-term consequences and constraints of IWM and agriculture are often asked, These questions can be addressed by agroecosystem health, an approach that integrates biophysical, social, and economic concerns and recognizes that agriculture is part of a world with many complex subsystems and interactions, Indicators are used to examine the status of an agroecosystem, e.g., whether or not it contains all that is necessary to continue functioning, Indicators include soil quality, crop productivity, and water quality; all of these are related to the rationale of IWM, hence IWM can he linked to agroecosystem health, Ancillary effects of using IWM relate to other indicators such as diversity and energy efficiency, Linking IWM to agroecosystem health has at least two benefits: (1) predictive models within IWM can be incorporated into larger agroecosystem models to explore hitherto unforseen problems or benefits of IWM, and (2) the relevance and benefits of IWM should become clearer to the public and government agencies who otherwise might not examine how IWM promotes many of the larger social, economic and environmental goals being promulgated.

AB Leptolegnia caudata and Aphanomyces laevis (Saprolegniales: Oomycetes) were found for the first time as naturally occurring parasites of mosquito larvae, causing high mortality in Anopheles culicifacies larvae. Artificial inoculation under laboratory condition revealed L. caudata more pathogenic, caused 100% mortality within 7 days of inoculation as compared to A. laevis (70% mortality after 10 days). None of these is pathogenic to any crop and have no toxic effect on aquatic fauna, and thus, can be proposed as mosquito control agents, alternative to chemical insecticides. Mass culture of these pathogens, preferably L. caudata can be applied in major larval habitats for long term, non-hazardous, economically sustainable control of malarial vector A. culicifacies, thereby malarial transmission.

TI Farming systems dynamics: Impact of increasing population density and

   The case of Sukumaland, Tanzania
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
DE farming systems; sustainability; Tanzania; rural development
AB The changes in agricultural production systems over the period 1875 till 1990 have been analysed for three districts belonging to Sukumaland, Tanzania. The analysis is based on historic information for the early period, on data from agricultural studies conducted in 1945 and 1961, and on recent field studies in 1990-1992.
   Increasing population densities and therefore decreasing availability of agricultural land per capita has occurred generally. In addition, there exist important agro-ecological differences between the three districts that have also been responsible for the present diversity in farming systems. Among these, differences in rainfall and the relative availability, quality and type of land resources, as related to toposequential land units, are of major significance. Together these factors determined the potential and subsequently the changes that have occurred during the past 50 years in the major land use systems and crops for the various parts of Sukumaland.
   In anticipating the direction of agricultural developments and consequently the sustainability of actual and future agricultural systems, differences in the principle agro-ecological factors of soils in relation to the topography (landscape units) should be considered more closely. Such information should be used to complement the broad socio-economic considerations on which most policy decisions, including development aid, are currently based.

TI Assessing ecological sustainability of slash-and-burn agriculture
   through soil fertility indicators
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The objective of this study was to assess the near- and long-term impact of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture on soil fertility in the village of Kembera, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Soil fertility is widely viewed as one of the key limits to sustainable production in slash-and-burn agroecosystems. A chronosequence of sites ranging from currently cultivated swiddens to a 28-yr fallow was surveyed. Organic C, cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, nitrate, extractable basic cations, available and total P, and extractable Al were measured as indicators of soil fertility Inferred short-term trends point to significantly improved soil fertility conditions after burning in currently cropped swiddens relative to falloffs. During the fallow, soil organic C, CEC, nitrate, total P, and extractable basic cations all manifest positive associations with fallow length after 3 to 11 yr of fallow; No declines in soil parameters were detected between plots based on the frequency of past slash-and-burn activity Therefore, there is no evidence that slash-and-burn agriculture in Kembera has degraded these soil resources. While the results of this study suggest that slash-and-burn agriculture in Kembera has been ecologically sustainable, recent changes in socioeconomic factors influencing farmer's land-use decisions cast doubt upon the future sustainability of this agroecosystem.

AB The fast development of a modern economy in Changzhou City is speeding up urbanization. However, in the process, certain problems are unavoidable. This paper analyzes three of the main problems for Changzhou: the unsuitable infrastructure; the decrease in cultivated land; and declining environmental quality. The authors suggest better ways to solve these problems, and the article presents several reasonable strategies such as integrated planning for the city as a whole; developing the urban infrastructure; controlling the decrease in cultivated land by restricting built-up areas; and raising the quality of the environment by paying attention to pollution treatment.

AB Water shortage and pollution are universal problems that are especially acute in the developing countries. They are becoming so serious as to pose a threat to human existence. How to solve these problems is of major concern to both scientists and governments. This article introduces the general conditions of water resources, the main water-related problems, and strategic measures for sustainable development, protection and utilization of water resources in Changzhou, a city in the Yangtze River Delta, China. Water-resources protection areas, particularly the sources, are defined through legislation. Various measures are taken to control water pollution and overexploitation of groundwater. Both water-supply projects and sewage-treatment projects have begun to be implemented. Solutions to the problem of solid waste are also discussed. Prices of the products and services provided by these public services must be increased because lower prices have led to excessive demand, a deteriorating water environment, and insufficient funds to cover efficient, environmentally-sound disposal methods.

AB The paper provides some general information on Gaborone, Botswana's capital city. The city's growth, environmental problems and administrative structures are explored within the context of sustainable urban development. Sustainable development is viewed as comprising economic, environ-mental and political concerns. It is argued that the city's path towards sustainability is greatly shaped by the country's development strategy and administrative structures. The development strategy is defined as urban biased and administrative structures, highly centralized with minimum involvement by nongovernmental organizations and community-based organizations in the decision making processes. The main conclusion drawn is that Botswana's efforts towards the realization of sustainable develoment-as contained in the country's National Conservation Strategy-have not yet been adequately incorporated into the country's urban planning practice.

TI SHHA - Botswana's self-help housing agency: A success story, but is it
   sustainable?
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB Botswana's Self-Help Housing Agency is a success story in terms of achieving its goals, i.e. to provide an effective means of access to affordable housing for low-income groups and to upgrade the existing squatter settlements. This paper acknowledges the success of SHHA in the provision of housing units, but raises questions of sustainability of the program as well as that of the built environment. Given that the SHHA program is financed by Donor Agencies, the government should rake direct responsibility for housing the less-privileged in the same manner as does the Botswana Housing Corporation (BHC). Planning for social mix is not sustainable if only the standards of the facilities provided at SHHA are upgradable. While immediate finance available to the SHHA residences does not allow for elaborate development the infrastructure provided by government should be adequate to serve individual family efforts or infrastructure should be able to cope with incremental developments as they are being made by the families. Given the right preconditions, such as security of tenure, realistic building standards, and access to financial and technical resources, people in low-income groups could contribute substantially to own housing. However, the government's housing policies' definition of the housing problem is questionable. The main aim of these policies has been the eradication of a backlog of specific housing units. However, a definition of housing problems in purely numerical terms is too narrow. Therefore, the performance of housing policies and housing environments must be assessed by their influence on the quality of life in the broadest possible sense. Factors such as the influence of housing on the wealth of people for whom it is intended and on overall environmental quality must also be considered. Perhaps most important of all is the availability of meaningful choice in relation to different priorities coupled with the opportunity for people to play roles in deciding issues which directly affect their lives.

AB Cross-sectional anthropometric measurements were taken between 1987 and 1990 in 673 children aged 0-6 years in Imesi ne village, Nigeria. The height and weight curves obtained fall behind corresponding growth curves in the same community three decades previously. Mid-upper arm circumference values indicated moderate to severe malnutrition in 25.8% of children aged 1-5 years. The heights of 67.1% and weights of 59.7% of the children fell below the third percentile of a Nigerian equivalent of an international reference population standard. Possible reasons for deterioration of the nutritional status of children in the community include the prevailing adverse socio-economic conditions, changes in child rearing practices over the years, persistence of unsatisfactory living conditions and failure to sustain the implementation of innovative programmes previously introduced into the community. It is suggested that present programmes aimed at promoting the health of rural communities should be reviewed to improve sustainability and should be backed up by measures to improve socio-economic and living conditions.

TI Reservations about governments producing balance sheets
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION

AB There are, in my view, exaggerated expectations of the benefits to flow from the widespread adoption of accrual accounting by general government agencies. These benefits are said to include:
   more accurate measurement of costs and revenues;
   a greater focus on outputs rather than inputs;
   a more efficient and effective use of scarce resources;
   a better indication of the sustainability of government policy;
   improved accountability by governments to their constituents;
   better financial management by public service managers;
   greater comparability of management performance between jurisdictions; and
   a complete coverage of all relevant transactions and stocks.
   In theory, this breathtaking range of achievements is expected to flow from a simple change in the timing of recording of transactions, from the point at which cash changes hands to the point at which an event occurs which eventually leads to cash changing hands. (More is said on this simplifying proposition later, under the heading 'The Narrow Issue'). In reality, the therm 'accrual accounting' has become code for a much wider-ranging set of changes, and this brief paper comments sceptically on a number of them.

DE ecotourism; nature tourism; protected areas
AB Ecotourism is expected, by the tourism industry and academics, to grow rapidly over the next 20 years. Much has been written about ecotourism, often with missionary zeal, but there is little consensus about its definition. It is argued here that conservationists and protected area managers should adopt a definition of ecotourism which contributes to the maintenance of biodiversity and an appropriate definition is suggested.
   Ecotourism is not merely an alternative to mass tourism, nor is it the only alternative. The literature on nature tourism and the environmental impacts of the industry dates back to the late 1970s. Tourism is now the world's largest industry and it has an increasing impact on protected areas. Our understanding of these mechanisms, their ecological impacts and our capacity to manage tourism in protected areas lags behind the growth of tourism to protected areas.
   A rapid growth in nature tourism and tourism to protected areas has coincided with a shift in protected area management strategies towards integrated development. Tourism is one means available to protected area managers seeking to increase the economic value of a protected area and to offer sustainable opportunities for economic development to local people.
   This paper argues that potentially conflicting commercial, protected area and development interests all contribute to the emergence of ecotourism and have been doing so for many years. Ecotourism needs to be tightly defined if it is to benefit conservation. Protected area managers should consider how they can take control of nature tourism to the parks they manage and convert it into ecotourism for the benefit of conservation and the livelihoods of local people.

AB The paper discusses the sustainability of the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve in the context of Costa Rican ecotourism. While the history of the Preserve is somewhat unique, the analysis of visitation, financial, ecological and economic factors provides a convincing case that tourism at the Preserve is sustainable. The experience of the Preserve is also put in the context of Costa Rican ecotourism, particularly to the national parks. The paper concludes that the Preserve has played a very important role in the development of Costa Rica as an ecotourism destination. Nonetheless, the failure of experience at the Preserve to inform recent changes in national park pricing policy reveal that Costa Rica has yet to fully capitalize on the experience gained and lessons learned at the Preserve.

AB Samples of alluvial soil from mixed sandstone shale and slate and of Taiwan clay were collected from two sites, both managed under a similar crop rotation scheme. The fields were further divided into sections which were managed under either conventional farming or sustainable farming practices. When the soil samples were collected in April 1989, after 1 year of operation under conventional or sustainable practices, the nitrification activities of both soils managed under sustainable practices had improved dramatically compared to the conventional practices. The nitrifying activities in Taiwan clay samples collected in April 1993 which had been managed with chemical or with organic fertilizer were not significantly different. However, nitrifying activity in the alluvial soil was higher under sustainable than under conventional practices. Numbers of NH4+-oxidizing bacteria were not significantly different in any of the soil samples irrespective of the different management practices. In contrast, higher numbers of NO2--oxidizing bacteria were detected in both soils managed sustainably. The results also indicated that the composition of NH4+-oxidizing bacteria differed in the alluvial soil when managed with different kinds of fertilizer.

AB Both male and female Loligo duvauceli exploited off Mangalore exhibited allometric growth. The growth rate and asymptotic length (males = 41.5 cm; females = 24.5 cm) showed distinct differences between sexes. Females grew at a faster rate (K = 1.15 +/- 0.086 yr(-1); P < 0.05), while males grew slower (K = 0.92 +/- 0.078 yr(-1); P < 0.05) but reached a larger ultimate size and age. The life-span is estimated to be 3.2 years for males and 2.6 years for females. The total average annual stock was estimated as 1088 tons and the average exploitation ratio for the period was above 0.7 for both sexes, but showed a declining trend. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated as 877.3 tons and this could be achieved by a 35% decrease in fishing effort. Studies revealed the need for regulation of the fishery by raising the age at first capture (from 0.3 to 0.8 yr for males and from 0.5 to 0.6 yr for females) by increasing the cod-end mesh size of the trawl net by 80%.
