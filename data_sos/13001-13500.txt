TI Collective action and learning in developing a local monitoring system
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE monitoring; collective action; learning; community forestry; Criteria
   and Indicators
AB One of the challenges communities face when managing forests is the lack of a systematic and transparent monitoring system that can be used to monitor their resource management strategies and communicate their successes to Outsiders. This paper argues that monitoring efforts will be sustainable only if the system has been developed by the communities in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders., with the aim of enhancing their learning and understanding, rather than for compliance purposes. The paper describes processes used by a People's Organisation in Palawan, Philippinesto develop their monitoring system with the support of several key stakeholders. These include the development of a monitoring framework and arrangements (including who collects data. what data to collect. and how to collect it) and negotiation on how to collaborate in this effort. Results indicate that the development process has brought together a range of community groups and stakeholders with different interests, objectives, and mandates for collective action and learning.

AB In attempting to eliminate disease caused by drinking polluted surface water, millions of shallow surface wells were drilled into the Ganges delta alluvium in Bangladesh. The latest statistics indicate that 80% of Bangladesh and an estimated 40 million people are at risk of arsenic poisoning-related diseases because the ground water in these wells is contaminated with arsenic. The clinical manifestations of arsenic poisoning are myriad, and the correct diagnosis depends largely on awareness of the problem. Patients with melanosis, leuco-melanosis, keratosis, hyperkeratosis, dorsum, non-petting edema, gangrene and skin cancer have been identified. The present article reviews the current arsenic contamination of ground water, hydrological systems, groundwater potential and utilization and environmental pollution in Bangladesh. This paper concludes by clarifying the main actions required to ensure the sustainable development of water resources in Bangladesh.

AB Objective: The American College of Nurse-Midwives implemented a 4-year Domestic Violence Education Project (DVEP) with the goal of educating all midwives in the USA to respond appropriately to abuse experienced by the women they serve. Method: A four-pronged set of objectives was used that included policy, basic preservice education, continuing education and activism/advocacy. Result: The success of this project is the sustainable impact on education of student midwives and a continued commitment to this issue. Conclusion: The full impact of the DVEP on practicing midwives may not be measurable for some time.

AB This article presents the heuristic 'Restrictions and Options' that was created in an interdisciplinary research team to identify restricting and supporting factors regarding sustainable ways of actions for different institutional and individual actors in the need-field of nutrition. The heuristic format is first presented on a general level. Then it is combined with two different approaches: first, with a systemic constructivist approach to organization theory, and second, with the ipsative theory of action (psychology). Its abilities are illustrated by examples from two research projects.
   The heuristic tool was developed to help identify relevant factors that restrict or support sustainable development in two empirical settings and also could be used to compare the findings. Combining the two approaches remains for future research.

DE investment appraisal; transport planning; sustainable transport; road
   transport investment; transport economics; development planning
AB In many developing countries, the determination of a ranking of investments designed to improve and extend the road system is a commonplace prerequisite of planning for the transport sector as a whole and the road sub-sector within it. A major objective of determining investment priorities is to secure the greatest efficiency in the use of resources allocated to the sector and, for this reason, any system of assigning priorities must rely upon conventional investment appraisal techniques producing quantifiable measures of worth. Exercises of this kind, in which road investments are identified and ranked, are usually undertaken to produce a road sector investment plan. The implementation of such plans is, however, often compromised because of perceived deficiencies with a methodology which places undue reliance on investment appraisal and fails to properly address the issue of public interest and sustainability. This paper attempts to produce a pragmatic set of ground rules which, while mindful of the need to promote economic efficiency, allow for other factors to be embraced in a more holistic methodology.

DT Article
DE domestic recycling; solid waste management; attitude; motivational
   factors
ID PREDICTORS; BEHAVIORS; PROGRAM
AB Solid household waste management in Malaysia has reached a critical stage. Increasing population, urbanization and changing patterns of lifestyle have instigated the phenomenon. The 15 000 tonnes of garbage produced daily are thrown into 230 landfills nationwide, where 80% of them have only two years of life span left. Although recycling programmes were launched as early as 1990, only 5% of the wastes are recycled. The purpose of the present research was to ascertain the current management of household solid waste, attitude and motivational factors towards recycling. Data were collected using interview survey on 150 households in an urban residential area. The findings demonstrated that the respondents had very low awareness and knowledge regarding local domestic waste management. Separation of organic and non-organic wastes was rarely practised by 76% of the respondents. Most waste was thrown away, except for newspaper and aluminium cans which were regularly recycled, while furniture, and electrical items were reused by giving away or trading-in. The attitude of the respondents towards recycling was modest. Of the five motivational factors, intrinsic satisfaction and individual commitment were more important reasons for recycling than convenience, economic motivation and societal commitment. The results of the study indicated that, in order to overcome the solid waste crisis, the conscience of the individual needs to be raised through environmental awareness and concern, inculcation of sustainable consumption practices and education on waste management.

TI Debt-for-nature swaps: Potential applications in Nepal
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE debt-for-nature swaps; Nepal; biodiversity; social indicators
AB Debt-for-nature swap is a mechanism that facilitates creditor nations or lending institutions to cancel or forgive a certain amount of foreign debt owed by a developing country in return for allocation of resources in local currency or interest-bearing bonds for environmental conservation projects to be conducted in the debtor nation. Additionally, swaps assist in a small but measurable way in reducing the burden of debt and make a significant difference in the protection and promotion of sustainable usage of natural resources. The purpose of this paper is to associate the potential applicability of debt-for-nature swaps in Nepal. Nepal is a prime candidate because of the following factors: the relatively heavy indebted status and high cost of debt servicing that exceeds the country's repayment capacity; a deficit ridden economy; the ongoing environmental degradation primarily in the areas of deforestation and loss of biodiversity and natural habitat; the country's inability to otherwise provide adequate resources for environmental conservation, especially with regards to enforcement in protected areas; and the country's demonstrated commitment towards environmental conservation. A general assessment indicates that conducting swaps in Nepal is feasible and the potential for a high degree of success exists.

AB This paper examines the contribution of secondary resources harvested from a savanna ecosystem to household income in Thorndale village, South Africa. The valuation of these resources provides a key tool for adopting sustainable development practices. The study shows the relevance of the dependence of rural people on secondary resources and implications for social and economic equity. Fuelwood, edible herbs and thatch grass contributed 80.6% ($492.53) of the total gross direct-use value ($559.46) of all the resources per household per annum. The net direct-use value of eight directly harvested resources was $455.11 after accounting for the opportunity cost of labour. The value of secondary resources traded amounted to $126.62 per household, equivalent to 22.6% of values from direct consumption, suggesting a high degree of dependence of villagers on natural resources harvested for household consumption. There were high relative direct-use values for fuelwood (44%) and edible herbs (25.9%) reflecting the high energy requirement, and substitute for cultivated vegetables, respectively. It was generally perceived that resources were in short supply probably due to the level of dependence, and as a coping strategy.

TI South-to-north water transfer schemes for China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB South-to-north water transfer schemes are considered a strategic and ambitious approach to resolving water shortage problems in the north of China. This paper discusses the proposed south-to-north water transfer schemes, which would deliver water from the south of China to the water-short north of China. The three potential water transfer routes are discussed in detail, emphasizing the different water regimens of the water export and water import regions, political and institutional implications, and environmental protection. A water balance study conducted according to the principle of integrated water resources planning and management has shown that, without water transfer, the water deficit in the north of China will continue to be an obstacle to sustainable development from now to 2050. Also, the analysis on the asynchronism-synchronism for the two regions concerned has implicated the uncertainty of future water resource availability in the water transfer regions.

TI Construction of Third World women's knowledge in the development

SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID GENDER
AB Despite the vast literature that questions the separation between indigenous and scientific knowledge, rural Third World women continue to be indigenised and their knowledge upheld as the new path to sustainable development and biodiversity. By drawing on ethnographic examples from Kumaon Himalayas in India, this paper examines the construction of women's knowledge and asks how, in practice, women's knowledge is produced, circulated, and shared. It draws attention to the politics of knowledge and argues that women's knowledge is a product of everyday practices of labour and livelihood which are shaped by culturally contingent relations of power and authority. By describing everyday conversations, meetings, and explanations, the paper shows that there is a great deal of informal exchange between women and men which mutually shapes their knowledge and confronts the idea that women's knowledge is distinct. Moreover, women's knowledge, it is argued, is not a neatly packaged information box but a set of relations shaped in contexts of social inequalities, local histories of conflict, and colonial and postcolonial interventions. While the attention to women's knowledge is welcome, the paper cautions against looking at women as embodiments of special knowledge and makes a call for examining the cultural politics of power and authority that marginalises women and their knowledge.

DE water management organisation; legislation; institutional framework;
   Europe
AB Water management nowadays is experienced as an area of conflict, increasingly determined by the conflicting demands of the different water users, including nature. The World Water Council therefore initiated a worldwide appraisal of national water resources management policies and practices. The European Regional Working Group (ERWG) of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) was engaged to prepare the European Sector Vision on Water for Food and Rural Development.
   As a result the ERWG delivered a study with a condensed portrayal of continental water policies complemented by 15 national reports, which for the first time provided a comprehensive insight into the water management of the various contributing countries, including political and legal mechanisms, expected environmental challenges, requirements of the users, and organisational and institutional solutions.
   Modem water legislation pursues the target of balancing the requirements of human needs and nature conservation by sustainable planning and public participation, the cornerstones of the Water Framework Directive of the European Union. The ERWG study demonstrates the different systems and mechanisms developed by European countries to meet this target. With a view to the future unifying of Europe, national regulations have to be harmonised and transformed into a European water policy. Organisational structures like basin administrations, water management associations, technical-scientific societies, and private and co-operative facilities will have an increasing role.
   This paper highlights the findings achieved by the ERWG study and will give an impression of the manifold solutions. Experience, gathered in Spain, France, Slovenia and Hungary will provide knowledge for the development of environmentally sound and market-oriented water management systems.

AB The food-producing regions of the world increasingly rely on irrigation from groundwater resources. Further increases of groundwater use can adversely affect the sustainability of irrigated agriculture and put food security at risk. Sustainability of irrigation at field scale with groundwater is obtained if groundwater recharge is in equilibrium with tubewell extractions and capillary rise. Traditional information on phreatic surface behaviour does not explain the processes causing a phreatic surface to decline or incline. In this study, the physically based numerical model Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) was applied to compute soil moisture content and vertical soil water fluxes in the unsaturated zone for the cotton-wheat and rice-wheat cropping system of Punjab, Pakistan. SWAP has been calibrated and verified with in situ measurements of soil moisture content and evapotranspiration fluxes measured by means of the Bowen ratio surface energy balance technique. Accurate data of the soil hydraulic properties are critical for the calibration of the soil moisture distribution. With knowledge of the van Genuchten-Mualem parameters available, SWAP could be applied to assess recharge and capillary rise for most field conditions, including basin irrigation. The results under Pakistani conditions show that deep percolation cannot always be estimated from root zone water balances. An annual recharge of 23.3 cm was computed for the cotton-wheat area. Sustainability of irrigation with groundwater is obtained if a reduction in irrigation with groundwater by 36% is obtained. An annual recharge of 38.9 cm is estimated in rice-wheat systems, and a reduction of 62% in groundwater extraction is required to reach sustainability of groundwater use at field scale. Such information cannot be obtained from classical phreatic surface fluctuation data, and unsaturated zone modelling therefore provides additional insights for groundwater policy making.

ID DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENT; AGRICULTURE
AB Water quality is a pivotal environmental indicator of sustainable land management and environmental 'health'. Hazards to water resource use at the farm and catchment scales have far-reaching physical, biological, environmental and socio-economic impacts. These impacts are exacerbated by on-site and off-site agricultural and non-agricultural activities. A prototype water hazard management decision support system that uses an integrated framework to identify, by origin, hazards and related best water management practices guidelines is proposed. The system recommends best management guidelines with respect to the inherent water resource use mitigations. The system has been calibrated by and applied to expert knowledge and experimental and survey data from Kiumbu Catchment in central Kenya. Suggestions are made for the inclusion of GIS capabilities for the production of water resource assessment maps and other spatial water quality indicators. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB After a century of major technical advance, essentially achieved by and for the industrialized countries, the evolution of the food sector in southern countries should no longer be thought of in terms of a "headlong pursuit." In the present context of demographic growth, urbanization, poverty and disparities, environmental degradation, and globalization of trade, new priorities have emerged, and new ethical questions have been raised, mainly related to sustainability and equity. This paper analyses these ethical concerns in the following terms: can the model of food sector development initiated by the industrialized countries be applied to the entire world on a sustainable and equitable basis, given the effects of this development with regard to the energy consumed, the changes in dietary behavior and related nutritional problems, the new demands in terms of food safety, the questions of biodiversity, ownership of knowledge, cultural identities, gender issues, and Man's relationship to food and Nature?.

AB 1. Habitat requirements of solitary bees include nesting sites, food resources and nesting material. We used translocation experiments to establish foraging distances and measured foraging trip duration to analyse how solitary bees cope with the distance between nesting sites and suitable food plants in different habitat types.
   2. Maximum foraging distance between nesting site and food patch was 150-600 m for the 16 bee species examined. Foraging distance was correlated positively with body length. Mean foraging trip duration, measured for seven bee species, ranged from 6 to 28 min and was also correlated with body length. In a study of the polylectic species Osmia rufa, we found a significant decrease in foraging trip duration with increasing number of plant species. Logistic regressions showed that the oligolectic Megachile lapponica nested in trap nests with a probability of 50% if the distance between trap nest and food patch was less than 250 m. The oligolectic Chelostoma rapunculi utilized trap nests when the distance to the nearest food patch was less than 300 m.
   3. These experiments showed that solitary bees have a rather small foraging range so local habitat structure appears to be of more importance than large-scale landscape structure. All requirements for sustaining viable populations must be within this range. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain and restore a dense network of habitat patches in landscapes to ensure long-term sustainability of wild bee diversity and their ecological function as pollinators.

AB The production of edible protein of animal origin as the principal objective of livestock husbandry served as the basis for the nutritional and ecological calculations undertaken here. The nutritional parameters calculated were the amount of gross energy and crude protein required per kg of dietary protein from milk, beef, pork, poultry meat, rabbit, meat and eggs. The competition for food between farm animals and humans was assessed by determining the amount of concentrate required per leg of edible protein. Emissions of N, P and methane per kg of dietary protein formed the basis for ecological considerations. The results of nutritional and ecological calculations for different livestock species and categories are determined primarily by yields. As yields increase the proportion of the maintenance requirement allocated to the product or unit of edible protein becomes relatively smaller; this reduces the amount of energy and protein required and increases their conversion efficiency. At daily yields of 30 kg milk, 1000 g gains in beef catte, 700 g In pigs, 40 g in broilers and a laying performance of 80%, the production of 1 kg edible protein from milk, beef, pork, poultry meat or eggs requires a gross energy of about 0.4; 1.2; 0.6; 0.25 and 0.35 GJ, respectively and 3.4, 9.0, 6.0, 3. 0 and 3.5 kg of crude protein, respectively. N emissions per kg of edible protein for the five protein sources amount to about 0.35, 1.2, 0.8, 0.3 and 0.4 kg; calculated P emissions were about 50, 180, 120, 40 and 60 g, respectively. At the stated yield levels, protein production from milk, poultry meat or eggs is, therefore, more efficient both nutritionally and ecologically titan that from pork and beef. Competition for food with humans is greater in the production of protein from non-ruminants pigs, poultry) than ruminants; this parameter is also dependent on the proportion of by-products from agriculture and food production. in the daily ration and on the animals' yields. The global aim of a sustainable and ecologically acceptable production of protein of animal origin can be achieved by reducing livestock herds, increasing animal performance and utilising feeding stuffs in animal nutrition that are unsuitable for direct consumption by human beings.

TI Does compressing Australian suburbia achieve ecologically sustainable
   development?
SO JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB It has been claimed that urban consolidation contributes to ecologically sustainable development by reducing embodied and operational energy demands, by, among other things, reducing lot and house size. Using typical built examples, the energy embodied in the construction of three smaller scale detached, semi-detached, and attached two-story Australian house types have been calculated and compared to larger detached houses. It was found that, in proportion to area, the embodied energy of each type is similar, with little difference between each of the smaller scale types and larger detached houses. While "compressed suburbia" satisfies general urban consolidation benefits such as increasing density, its contribution to ecologically sustainable development is problematic.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS

AB This paper examines some of the paradoxes and dilemmas facing firms in the extractive sector when they attempt to take on a more stakeholder-responsive orientation towards issues of environmental and social responsibility. We describe the case of Shell and the Ogoni and attempt to draw out some of the lessons of that case for more sustainable operations in the developing world. We argue that firms such as Shell, Rio Tinto and others may well exhibit increasingly stakeholder-responsive behaviours at the corporate, strategic level. However for reasons of strategy, lack of competency or institutional will this increasing level of corporate responsiveness may not be mirrored effectively in dealings between subsidiary business units and their most important direct stakeholders: for example local communities and in the developing world. We contrast the struggles of Shell to replicate its corporate stakeholder-responsiveness at the local level in Nigeria with the experiences of other firms that seem to have developed managerial capabilities at a somewhat deeper level throughout the firm with consequent benefits both for stakeholders and the business.

AB As we continue to enjoy economic growth and development in the latter part of the twentieth century, there is an abundance of disposable income for consumers to spend. Americans are spending more and more of these dollars in leisure activities. However, relatively little is known about which factors influence consumers' behavioral intentions (i.e., loyalty, word of mouth, willingness to pay a price premium) in this area. It appears that in this extremely attractive and growing services segment, academics, as well as practitioners, would benefit from investigating the relationships between the physical environment (i.e., servicescape) and several other key service constructs (i.e., positive effect, enduring involvement, service quality, waiting time, and value) on consumer behavioral intentions. With a better understanding of the servicescape's role in consumers' purchase decision processes, practitioners should be able to make adjustments in their marketing plans that should help to provide them with a sustainable advantage over their competition. This paper is intended to expand our understanding of how the servicescape influences behavioral intentions. A model is developed and tested on a sample of sporting event customers. The results support the model and lead to some interesting managerial implications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
AB This essay assesses the role conservation biologists play inside and outside government in efforts to protect British Columbia's ancient rain-forest ecosystems. An epistemic community of government-entrenched conservation biologists has largely been absent or ad hoc, playing a negligible role in conservation. The Clayoquot Sound Scientific Panel is a partial exception, with the important advisory role it played to the BC government regarding sustainable forest management in the region. Instead, a mission-oriented, transnational "civic" scientific community has emerged around the Y2Y Conservation Initiative, Conservation Area Design plans for the BC's coastal rain forests and efforts to promote a meaningful Species at Risk Act at the federal level. A transnational advocacy network of Canadian and American conservation biologists is using "civic science" in concert with environmental organizations to develop and implement a vision of ecosystem-based land-use planning and species protection, and this provides valuable lessons on the potential and limits of scientific power in civil society as well as government institutions.

AB An integrated methodology, based on the combination of a marine water quality model and multicriteria analysis, is proposed as a new tool for addressing economic and environmental issues for coastal areas. The model consists of three interacting components (terrestrial, hydrodynamic and biological submodels), which are used to evaluate the likely environmental impact of various economic development scenarios. Multicriteria Analysis combines the model outputs with socioeconomic values for the coast and through assignment of different weights/priorities by the user provides a ranking system for these scenarios. The Gulf of Gera, Island of Lesvos, Greece, a semi-enclosed and shallow system surrounded by a cultivated and inhabited watershed, was used as a case study for this method. Four scenarios concerning the development of tourism, the construction of agricultural greenhouses, the cultivation of woody plant species and the development of animal husbandry were tested against the present condition of the watershed (which is primarily dominated by olive oil production). The trade-off between increased profits and environmental impacts for these development scenarios was illustrated using Cluster and Principal Component Analysis. The results of these analyses showed that tourism and animal husbandry balance profits and environmental degradation most effectively and represent the most favorable future development strategies for the study area. The present approach can be used as a supportive tool for policy-planners and decision-makers to quantify interrelated socio-economic and environmental issues for the sustainable development of coastal areas.

AB To achieve sustainable coastal management and planning, the interaction between fine-grained - in particular, vegetated - intertidal environments and incoming waves needs to be better understood. Previous studies have established that wave attenuation over saltmarshes can be significantly greater than over unvegetated intertidal surfaces. However, detailed, quantitative information on the effect of marsh elevation in the tidal frame, marsh width, seaward marsh edge configuration (e.g. cuffed versus ramped marshes), seasonal changes in marsh surface roughness (e.g. creek density, vegetation composition) and incident wave conditions, however, has been lacking. Based on a 10-month-long wave/tide dataset from two sites on the Dengie marshes, eastern England, this study addresses the effect of (i) marsh edge topography; (ii) marsh width; (iii) inundation depths; and (iv) seasonal changes in marsh surface vegetation cover on wave height and wave energy dissipation. Directional waves and water levels were recorded at 21 locations across both shallow-sloping and cliffed (cliff height of ca. 1.5m) intertidal profiles. In addition, changes in marsh surface vegetation cover and composition were recorded on a seasonal basis.
   Wave height attenuation over 310m of the shallow-sloping profile averaged 92 % over the monitoring period. Further analysis shows that the most rapid reduction in wave heights occurs over the most seaward 10 meters of permanent saltmarsh vegetation, where wave height attenuation averaged 2.1% and 1.1% per meter at the shallow-sloping and cliffed site respectively. Across the mudflat and the saltmarsh as a whole, wave height dissipation rates were significantly lower with an average of 0.1% and 0.5% per meter respectively. The presence of a saltmarsh cliff increased average wave heights by up to 0.5% per meter. Observed wave height attenuation showed a seasonal pattern at both sites (average wave energy attenuation near the marsh edge was highest in September - November and lowest in March - July) and appears to be linked to the cycle of seasonal vegetation growth.
   The study provides criteria for the assessment of the wave dissipation potential of marshes characterised by different widths, edge configurations and slopes, variability of water depths, and seasonal variations in vegetation cover/density.

TI Integrated Coastal and Marine Management in Northern Regions:
   Reconciling Economic Development and Conservation
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE integrated coastal and marine management; shipping and navigation;
   offshore hydrocarbon development; circumpolar arctic
AB There will be increasing pressure on northern coastal and offshore regions for resource extraction as resources become scarce in more accessible regions. Marine navigation and transportation is likely to increase in response to economic development, and as ice cover reduces and the ice free season extends as a result of climatic changes: This article considers how economic development within northern coastal and marine regions may be reconciled with conservation. Integrated coastal management may be a useful process to reconcile economic development and conservation values.
   Existing, developing and de facto approaches to integrated management for northern coastal and marine regions are examined in the context of scenarios for economic development and conservation. These scenarios include marine shipping and hydrocarbon exploration and production for coastal and offshore waters of Alaska, northern Canada, and the North Sea. These approaches to integrated management are one means of considering marine resources and their utilization with a sustainable development framework. These approaches may also be a means of reconciling marine protection and other sectors such as shipping, hydrocarbons and fisheries.
   The article concludes that approaches to integrated management which reconcile economic and conservation values will be complex and consultative. The approaches will need to consider the interests of local peoples and communities, the needs of ecosystems and migratory communities, and environmental impacts and mitigation of development. The success of different approaches for reconciling economic development and conservation may be gauged by the range of issues and interests considered in these processes.

AB Substitutability between environmental and man-made goods plays a major role in the sustainability debate. The notion of substitutability covers a continuous spectrum, with perfect substitutability at one end and poor substitutability at the other. In this paper, it is shown that, if economic growth sustains, a sharp distinction emerges between perfect and poor substitutability, without any intermediate interpretation of substitutability. If poor substitutability prevails, environmental resources will eventually constitute the major part of total consumption value. We relate our results to "Baumol's disease," and assess the implications of this phenomenon for the compensation of environmental losses. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB Sustainability embraces socio-economic and bio-ecological dimensions or attributes. This paper presents a conceptual framework for quantifying sustainability on the basis of efficiency theory commonly used in economics. The conceptual model is implemented using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Sustainability is measured for a sample of Dutch sugar beet growers. The average technical efficiency was only 50%. A positive correlation was found between technical efficiency and sustainable efficiency. Differences in efficiency among farmers were persistent within and between years. We conclude that there is considerable scope for improving the sustainability of arable farming by better management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   capacity; environmental management system; grouping combination
AB Industrial estates (IE) are today perceived as an integral part of development strategies of many countries worldwide. The environmental impacts from a concentration of large number of industries in a small area or unplanned IE, can pose a serious threat to both local and global sustainable development initiatives. The formation of ecologically balanced industrial systems can result in numerous environmental and economic benefits. This paper examines the relevance of industrial symbiosis and carrying capacity concepts and proposes an integrated approach towards IE planning in India based on grouping combinations of industries based on carrying capacity, formation of green industrial townships, development of environmental impact assessment guidelines for IE and implementation of environmental management systems.

AB The sustainability of wildlife resources in Africa is threatened by poaching for trophies and meat as well as changes in land use. In order to motivate local people for sustainable wildlife management, efforts to transfer decision-making power as well as benefits from central to local level have been made in several countries. Such efforts have not yet been seen in Kilombero Game Controlled Area, which is the area covered by the present study. The paper documents the importance of wildlife to local people, explores local people's perceptions on wildlife management and identifies constraints to sustainable wildlife management. A total. of 177 household interviews in 5 villages and 129 interviews of pupils in schools have been conducted. The majority of pupils reported that their latest meal of meat was from a wild animal, and the most common species was buffalo. Apart from availability of cheap wildlife meat, advantages from living close to wildlife include the use of various parts of animals for, e.g. medical and ritual uses, and various plant products from wildlife habitats. Disadvantages include damages to crops, predation on livestock, and injuries to humans. The estimated loss of yield due to raiding by wildlife amounted to 21.9 and 47.8% of the harvest of rice and maize, respectively. Traditional wildlife management in Kilombero includes few rules to avoid resource depletion, because depletion has traditionally not been a problem due to low hunting technology and low human population. Government management includes strict rules, with hunting quotas as the main instrument, but the government has failed to enforce the rules. Ongoing discussions on new approaches to wildlife management like co-management and community-based management were largely unknown to the villagers in the area. Both poaching and agricultural expansion threaten the sustainability of Kilombero Game Controlled Area. It is suggested that transfers of decision-making power and benefits to local people is necessary in order to achieve sustainable management. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We examined aerobic performance traits in male and female tarantulas (Aphonopelma anax). Reproductive fitness in these males relies heavily on locomotory searching to locate receptive females, which are fossorial and sedentary. Because of this dimorphism in life history, we predicted that selection in males would enhance their ability to sustain high levels of aerobic metabolism (compared with females) to support increased locomotory activity during the mating season. Rates of carbon dioxide production were measured in an enclosed variable-speed treadmill. Steady-state rates of carbon dioxide production increased linearly within the range of sustainable aerobic speeds for both males and females. Although there was substantial variation in physiological performance traits among individuals, there were no detectable intersexual differences in maximal rates of carbon dioxide production, maximal aerobic speed, minimum transport or factorial scope.

TI Genetic diversity in natural populations of Piper cernuum
SO JOURNAL OF HEREDITY

ID DIFFERENTIATION; DISTANCE; BATS
AB Piper cernuum is a native plant of the Brazilian Atlantic rain forest. This work studies the distribution of allozyme diversity in P. cernuum natural populations in order to establish a strategy for sustainable management and conservation. Leaf samples were collected in two Brazilian states. High divergences among populations (F-SR = 0.380) and low divergences among regions (F-RT = -0.069) and among gaps of the same population (F-GT = 0.062) were found. No association between the geographical variation and the genetic distance was detected. An excess of heterozygotes was detected in the populations (F-IS = -0.170), suggesting selection in favor of heterozygotes. The results, and the fact that the species depends on constant gap formation for maintenance of its dynamism, suggest that the founder effect is largely responsible for the structuring of populations. For sustainable management, the maintenance of plants/reproductive branches in the gaps is of major importance. The genotypes produced in these gaps are responsible for the establishment of new gaps and are the foundation for new populations, maintaining the dynamics of allele movement.

TI A paradigm shift in irrigation management

   issues; risk
ID DEFICIT IRRIGATION; WATER
AB In coming decades, irrigated agriculture will be called upon to produce up to two thirds of the increased food supply needed by an expanding world population. But the increasing dependence on irrigation will coincide with accelerating competition for water and rising concern about the environmental effects of irrigation. These converging pressures will force irrigators to reconsider what is perhaps the most fundamental precept of conventional irrigation practice; that crop water demands should be satisfied in order to achieve maximum crop yields per unit of land. Ultimately, irrigated agriculture will need to adopt a new management paradigm based on an economic objective-the maximization of net benefits-rather than the biological objective of maximizing yields. Irrigation to meet crop water demand is a relatively simple and clearly defined problem with a singular objective. Irrigation to maximize benefits is a substantially more complex and challenging problem. Identifying optimum irrigation strategies will require more detailed models of the relationships between applied water, crop production, and irrigation efficiency. Economic factors, particularly the opportunity costs of water, will need to be explicitly incorporated into the analysis. In some cases the analysis may involve multi-objective optimization. The increased complexity of the analysis will necessitate the use of more sophisticated analytical tools. This paper examines the underlying logic of this alternative approach to irrigation management, explores the factors that will compel its adoption, and examines its economic and environmental implications. Two important concerns, sustainability and risk, are discussed in some depth. Operational practices for implementing the new approach are contrasted with current, conventional irrigation practices. Some of the analytical tools that might be employed in the search for optimum irrigation strategies are reviewed. Finally, the limited and largely intuitive efforts that have already been made to implement this new paradigm are discussed.

AB Prescision agriculture (PA) is providing an information revolution using Global Positioning (GPS) and Geographic Information (GIS) systems and Remote Sensing (RS). These technologies allow better decision making in the management of crop yield-limiting biotic and abiotic factors and their interactions on a site-specific (SSM) basis in a wide range of production systems. Characterizing the nature of the problem(s) and public education are among the challenges that scientists, producers, and industry face when adapting PA technologies. To apply SSM, spatio-temporal characteristics of the problem(s) need to be determined and variations within a field demonstrated. Spatio-temporal characteristics of a given pathogen or pest problem may be known but may not be the only or primary cause of the problem. Hence. exact cause-and-effect relationships need to be established by incorporating GIS. GPS, and RS-generated data its well as possible interactions. Exploiting the potential of PA technologies in sustainable ways depends on whether or not we first ask "Are we doing the right thing?" (strategic) as opposed to "Are we doing it right?'' (tactical).

AB The International Vitamin A Consultative Group (IVACG) was established in May 1975. Since then, IVACG has actively led the campaign against vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD). It operates through a network of policy makers, program administrators, and scientists interested in resolving the problem of VADD. Through its international meetings, IVACG provides a forum to exchange new ideas, to discuss research findings and their policy implications, and share experiences with program interventions. It provides technical guidance through state-of-the-art publications on VADD. More than 30 technical references have been developed. IVACG collaborates with international organizations in developing and establishing policy guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of VADD. During its 25 years, IVACG has given careful consideration to the role of vitamin A in infections, morbidity and mortality; assessment methods for use in the field and laboratory; other micronutrients and their interaction with vitamin A; bioavailability of vitamin A in foods; various interventions including supplementation, fortification and dietary diversification; the link between science and action; and sustainable control of VADD. IVACG is recognized as a credible source and galvanizing force in the field. It should continue to identify important research and policy issues and provide policy recommendations upon which others can act. Greater emphasis should be placed on integrated and multisectoral strategies, taking into account a community's overall needs for social, economic, and ecologic development.

AB The XX International Vitamin A Consultative Group (IVACG) meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February 2001 celebrated 25 y of progress in prevention and control of vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD). Programmatic themes included the following: 1) intervention innovations, 2) integration of vitamin A interventions, 3) the increased risk to health of women who are deficient, 4) measurement of progress and impact and 5) programmatic sustainability. The history of IVACG was remembered and the growth of the group from a meeting of 30 to 40 persons in 1975 to nearly 600 delegates from 63 countries was described. Successful adaptation to new challenges and scientific advances, in moving science to practice, was noted. Guidelines for indicators and interventions were reviewed. A set of revised recommendations were made, including the following indicators for assessment (and, for some, outcome evaluation) of VADD: 1) under-five mortality rate >50 as a surrogate indicator to trigger action, 2) maternal night blindness >5%, 3) rapid dark adaptation worse than - 1.11 log cd/m(2) and 4) serum retinol <0.7 mumol/L (>15%) in young children (<6 y). Key recommendations for specific interventions were to double the existing dose of prophylactic vitamin A supplementation to 50,000 international units (iu) at the three Expanded Programme on Immunization contacts for young infants (<6 mo) and to two doses of 200,000 iu each for women within 6 wk after delivery; to support fortification as a valid and necessary strategy to combat VADD; and to recognize that food-based approaches should include promoting breast-feeding and consuming animal products, because promoting plant-based foods alone will not eliminate VADD in young children due to the low bioefficacy of dietary beta-carotene. This meeting clearly set the agenda for the twenty-first century and called for successful implementation of integrated approaches that will eliminate VADD.

AB In this paper, we report on three case studies of South African manufacturing firms that made significant efforts to implement shopfloor improvement teams. Following Meredith's [J. Operat. Manage. 16 (1998) 441] suggestion to use case studies as a basis for theory formulation, insights from the cases were used to extend existing theory by generating hypotheses pertaining to the timing and sustainability of performance gains following the implementation of performance improvement teams, focusing, in particular on ongoing performance improvement teams. Because of the richness of the case study data, we delve deeper than other studies into the actions of teams and management to better understand how and why successful performance improvement teams evolve as they do. Stated in temporal order, our main hypotheses are: work team engagement is positively associated with early implementation credibility-building activities; both outcome-orientation and substantive participation are positively associated with a rapid rate of performance gains; and team institutionalization is positively associated with sustaining performance gains. The findings of the case studies and the associated hypotheses are summarized in a time-phased framework for work team implementation. Limitations and directions for further research are discussed.

AB This essay draws from the emerging positive psychology movement and the author's recent articles on the need for and meaning of a positive approach to organizational behavior. Specifically, the argument is made that at this time, the OB field needs a proactive, positive approach emphasizing strengths, rather than continuing in the downward spiral of negativity trying to fix weaknesses. However, to avoid the surface positivity represented by the non-sustainable best-sellers, the case is made for positive organizational behavior (POB) to take advantage of the OB field's strength of being theory and research driven. Additional criteria for this version of POB are to identify unique, state-like psychological capacities that can not only be validly measured, but also be open to development and performance management. Confidence, hope, and resiliency are offered as meeting such POB inclusion criteria. The overall intent of the essay is to generate some positive thinking and excitement for the OB field and 'hopefully' stimulate some new theory building, research, and effective application.

AB Sustainable growth in mature areas of the oil sector must focus on finding additional value and reducing life cycle costs. The Northern Business Unit of Shell U.K operates nine fields in the U.K sector of the North Sea, producing oil and gas from both offshore platform and subsea facilities. Intelligent well technology, in particular downhole flow control, has been identified as having significant value adding potential for those fields.

AB We present two findings: (i) in the absence of compressibility of (cold) neutrals, the instability triggered by neutral drift due to gradients in plasma, density and magnetic field and (ii) the equilibrium pressure-gradient- (PG-) driven instabilities with and without neutral dynamics. The results of detailed analysis suggest that on account of neutral dynamics the growth of these instabilities is suppressed by a neutral perturbational effect. Suppression of PG-driven instabilities is highlighted and the critical wavelength for sustainable growth is found. The physics involved in the mechanism of instabilities is discussed. The endeavour in these investigations is justifiable in its usefulness for understanding the phenomena pertinent to partially ionized plasma (PIP). The stability analysis presented here may be useful for understanding the plasma processes in 'deep' coma (very near to the nucleus of coma), at the edges of a plasma column, near a divertor region and in the ease of sublimating gas from a cloud.

AB Knowledge of livestock population dynamics is important to better understand functional attributes and development potential of pastoral production systems. With a focus on the Borana system of semi-arid Ethiopia for 1980-97, the main objectives of this research were to: (1) Characterize cattle population trends; (2) determine associations of rainfall and stocking rate with change in cattle numbers; and (3) estimate economic losses from cattle mortality. We predicted that the regional cattle population trend would consist of a "boom and bust" cycle with long periods of gradual herd growth punctuated by drought-induced losses. We expected that cattle losses would occur when high stocking rates were combined with large rainfall deficits. Such observations would refute the idea that cattle numbers were erratic and purely controlled by rainfall variation, as predicted by non-equilibrium theory. Cattle dynamics were quantified using herd histories from interviews of 56 households living in 4 sites. Data were aggregated to portray regional cattle population trends and quantify economic losses. Regression analysis was employed to assess associations of rainfall variation and stocking rate with cattle dynamics using 2 approaches: (1) Regional using aggregate herd data, empirical rainfall records, and calculated estimates for stocking rates; and (2) local using site-specific herd data along with recall of rainfall and stocking rate dynamics. Overall, results confirmed that cattle numbers followed a boom and bust cycle. Average cattle holdings dropped from 92 to 58 head/house-hold between 1980 and 1997, respectively. Droughts in 1983-5 and 1991-3 resulted in the deaths of 37 to 42% of all cattle, respectively, up to 15-times higher than net sales. Over 17 years our target population of 7,000 households lost 700,000 cattle with a capital asset loss valued at USD 45 million. Statistical results were more difficult to interpret. Our regional approach indicated neither rainfall nor stocking rate were significantly associated with cattle mortality. We felt this interpretation was erroneous, however, due to a probable-but unmeasured-decline in key grazing resources that lowered carrying capacity, increased herd instability between successive droughts, and undermined relationships among model parameters. Our local approach was somewhat clearer in that results indicated cattle losses were significantly and consistently associated with rainfall deficits, and occasionally associated with high stocking rates that varied by site. We were concerned, however, about respondent bias and possible error in these results. We concluded that the strongest information we had was simply the aggregate pattern of herd dynamics. When aligned with empirical rainfall records and augmented with data from another dramatic cattle crash in 1998-9, we make the case that stocking rate indeed appears to influence the likelihood that a dry year will reduce cattle numbers. We concluded that the Boran live in a dynamic and productive equilibrial system where land-use change has interacted with rainfall variation to create a vicious cycle of massive cattle losses every 5 to 6 years. Improving human welfare under such circumstances should focus on creating a virtuous cycle based on more timely livestock sales, alternative investment of revenues, and sustainable economic diversification.

SO JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE casual sex; gay relationships; intimacy; monogamy; trust
ID COUPLES
AB Anthony Giddens argues that late modernity is characterized by a democratization of intimate relationships and that gay men and lesbian women appear to be an expression of that movement. This paper is based on interviews with 20 New Zealand men - representing 11 gay couples - who discussed issues of monogamy, trust and sexual behaviour negotiations in their relationships. Overall, they had conventional notions of relationships, romantic love and monogamy that prompted decisions to discard condoms for anal sex as proof of their love for each other. They simultaneously believed that monogamy was not sustainable. Generally, the relationships were marked by 'infidelity' anxieties and a reluctance to disclose sexual encounters outside the relationship and to discuss or negotiate their possibility. These experiences serve as reminders to not assume that gay relationships are necessarily as democratic and open as Giddens suggests - pertinent when regarding the development of programmes aimed at reducing HIV transmission within relationships.

TI Beyond red and school: Gender, tradition and identity in the rural
   eastern cape
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Rural development policies in South Africa changed in the 1990s. The new framework combined poverty alleviation strategies with an attempt to shift rural communities away from subsistence-oriented agriculture to more market-oriented development options. While many of those who are currently assessing the impact of these policies in rural areas have focused on the extent to which they have contributed towards the creation of 'sustainable livelihoods', relatively little attention has been given to their impact on rural social relations and identity politics. This paper seeks to fill this gap by focusing on transformations in gender relations and identity politics in one rural location in the Eastern Cape. It argues that, although the new initiatives have been unevenly implemented and have not significantly reduced poverty in this area, they have nevertheless activated new discourses around identity and development. The paper traces these changing discourses by comparing and contrasting the polarised identity politics associated with the introduction of agricultural betterment in the 1950s and the increasingly hybrid identities and strategies constructed by rural women, in particular, in response to the new development opportunities. The paper concludes by investigating the implications of these responses for gender and power relations in the village.

AB The Phoenix Strategy is a way to encourage. and facilitate significant user controlled improvements in existing housing, improvements that make old houses more like new ones. The strategy is based on an analysis of relevant experience in several countries, most notably Israel, and relies on public facilitation and private management and financing. It has worked well in low- to high-density residential areas with moderate- and middle-income households. It has benefitted the residents, the neighborhoods, and the public treasury, and contributed to environmental goals. This article suggests how the Phoenix Strategy may be used as a powerful tool to prevent or halt neighborhood deterioration and to promote sustainable urban development.

AB The effect of stocking prawns Macrobrachium rosenbergii at increasing densities in ponds with Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus reared at low density was evaluated. Twelve 0.01-ha earthen ponds were stocked with 1 tilapia/m(2) and 0. 2, 4, or 6 post-larvae prawn/m(2). Three replicates were randomly assigned to each prawn density. Postlarval prawns were stocked a week prior to tilapia juveniles and both were harvested 175 d after the beginning of the experiment. Tilapia final average weight, survival, production, and food conversion rates did not differ significantly among treatments (P > 0.05) the averages were 531 g, 67%. 3,673 kg/ha. and 1.91, respectively. Prawn survival rates did not differ for the three stocking densities (mean 90%). However, final weight and production were significantly different (P < 0.05) as follows: 34,0, 23.0, and 14.7 g and 639, 909. and 818 kg/ha. respectively for 2, 4, and 6 prawns/m(2) densities. Stocking densities up to 6 prawn/m(2) did not affect tilapia production and required neither additional feeding nor significant changes in management. The polyculture system allowed an increase in total production with the same amount of supplied feed, thus improving the system sustainability.

AB Changes at several trophic levels in Otsego Lake from the 1930s to present are described relative to changes in the planktivorous fish community. Prior to the late 1980s, cisco (Coregonus artedi) was the dominant planktivore. The alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) appeared in 1986 and subsequently became dominant. Two patterns emerged when we contrasted the pelagic flora and fauna under those two dominant planktivore populations. When cisco were the primary planktivores, cladoceran size and biomass was significantly greater in the epilimnion (primarily Daphnia pulex) than in the hypolimnion (primarily Bosmina coregoni). Phytoplankton were dominated by net and large nannoplankton (>0.03 mm), with cyanobacteria uncommon until late summer. From 1973-1988, mean summer chlorophyll a was 2.3+/-1.2 (S.D.) ug.L-1 (range 0.68-4.2). Mean summer Secchi transparency was 5.2+/-0.5 m (range 3.8-7.8). A real hypolimnetic oxygen deficits (AHOD; a measure of oxygen consumption during periods of stratification) were 0.076-0.080 mg.cm(-2).day(-1). Since alewife have dominated, Daphnia have become rare in the lake. Mean cladoceran size in the epilimnion and hypolimnion (essentially all Bosmina) is much more uniform and reduced from prior size distributions. Phytoplankton abundance has increased, as has the mean summer chlorophyll a (6.4+/-1.5 S.D ug.L-1, range 3-8.7). The dominant algae are now smaller nannoplankton (<0.03 mm) and cyanobacteria. Mean summer Secchi transparency decreased substantially to 3.2&PLUSMN;0.3 m (range 2.5-4.0) and AHOD increased (range 0.090-0.102 mg.cm(-2).day(-1)). Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and cisco have declined, while lake trout (Salvelinus namycush)have increased. All changes have occurred despite significant efforts to reduce non-point source nutrient loading to the lake. While the establishment of alewives has enhanced the production of Otsego Lake's salmonid fishery to date, it has increased the challenge to those interested in managing the lake in an ecologically sustainable manner.

AB Performance of three exotic species of Leucaena (L diversifolia, L. shannonii and L. leucocephala) and one local selection of L. leucocephala was evaluated on sodic soil sites (pH 8.6-10-5) in order to select promising species for biomass production and reclamation of these soils. There were significant differences among three species with respect to their field survival (47.7-95.5 per cent), growth in terms of stem volume (40.8-118.6 m(3) ha(-1)) and biomass production (24-70 Mg ha(-1)) after eight years of growth. L. leucocephala was rated as the most promising species irrespective of seed source, followed by L. shannonii. L diversifolia could not perform well on these hostile soils. A definite improvement in physicochemical properties of soil particularly in surface layers (0-5 cm) was observed after eight years of plantations as compared to the same at uncultivated site. The soil pH and sodium content decreased followed by an increase in organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content. However, efficiency of different species varied greatly to ameliorate these soils depending on quantity and quality of organic matter lying on the floor. L. leucocephala, irrespective of seed origin, showed greater promise for afforestation of sodic soils because of its potential to produce higher biomass per unit area and greater efficiency to ameliorate fertility status of these soils. The study revealed that matching of species to soil conditions is very important for a successful plantation programme and sustainable development of degraded soil sites.

ID REFERENCE SERVICES; MAIL; WEB
AB The World Wide Web has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance navigation and communication over the Internet. Within the past few years, numerous Web-based digital reference services have been established by libraries. The goal of this study is to identify user needs as reflected in the queries they submit to these services. The study is user-centered and seeks to evaluate digital reference services from the users' perspectives. To address these issues, the paper examines digital reference questions received at a large university library in the Southeastern United States (SeU) from January to March 2001. Content analysis and descriptive statistics are used to analyze the data. Findings suggest that questions received by the digital reference service simulate questions received by traditional reference services; that digital reference service reaches only a small segment of the target population; and that the question submission form needs to be redesigned to better identify and prevent the loss of valuable user information. If the library is to succeed in delivering digital reference service and in defining the roles of reference librarians, it must enhance the quality of service to users in order to have a sustainable, competitive advantage in the provision of information in the digital realm.

AB Globally, the penetration of POWDER COATINGS in the Industrial Paints sector is 6%. The deepest penetration is in Europe with just over 9%, of which Italy leads, also worldwide, with the highest degree, 15%. Follow Asia-Pacific, North America. In ten years time, global penetration of powder coatings will reach the 10% level. Penetration of powder coatings is much different in the individual European countries. By the year 2010, penetration of WATERBORNE industrial coatings will reach a level of over 30%. The European Waterborne Industrial Coatings Industry was over 500,000 Tonnes in 1999 and will reach the one million Tonnes mark by the year 2010. Overall, the penetration of Waterborne Coatings in the Industrial Paints sector is currently around 20%. When considering individual market segments, penetration varies from 3% to 70%. Selected industrial coatings sectors, having low penetration of 3% in 2000, will reach up to 15% by the year 2010 at the expense of solvent borne paints and other non-environmentally-friendly systems. Main resin systems include: acrylics, epoxies, alkyds/polyesters, polyurethanes, PUDs, 2K-PU, alkyd emulsions and other. The paper will also cover an in-depth analysis of the inter-competition between solvent borne coatings, waterborne, powder coatings, radiation cureables. The increasing use of a combination of environment-friendly technologies such as powders / WB: powders/radcure (UV, EBC) and WB/radcure will be considered. Chemical intermediates and additive manufacturers have been developing novel raw materials both for waterborne paints and powder coatings.

AB Measurement is a key decision tool for a sustainable growth. In order to cope with this goal, total quality of measurement should be pursued at all operative levels, ranging from company or laboratory, through national and macro-regional levels, up to an international dimension. In the paper, a framework for achieving required measurement quality is proposed and discussed. For each operation level, subjects involved are identified, concerned actions are considered and integration and harmonisation are addressed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID THROMBIN-RECEPTOR; MOLECULAR-CLONING; MECHANISM; CELLS
AB Inflammation is a process culminated by cellular components and soluble mediators act in concert to evolve a sustainable process to impart distress in vascularized tissue. The role of thrombin receptors in neutrophil degranulation is not fully understood. Thrombin-mediated signaling has been shown to occur at least in part by a family of G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs). Protease-activated receptors-1 (PAR1) is the prototype for understanding on the fundamental signaling mechanism and related characterization. The inference of thrombin receptors and various synthetic ligand formulations on neutrophil degranulation ascertained an enormous disparity in the response by human donors. Based on the previous reports and supposition in perpetuity, it is hypothesized that thrombin through its receptor, and its subtypes, may very improbably have any functional role in PMN degranulation.

AB Farfantepenaeus notialis is an important resource for fisheries in Cuba. For this reason and for a sustainable exploitation it is important to study their population structure and genetic variability. We report and characterize microsatellites as genetic markers from this species. Fifteen microsatellite polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed and tested in some individuals from different populations. Seven pair of primers showed reliable amplification products and five were polymorphic. The allele number ranged from 4 to 33, and the observed and expected heterozygosities were relatively high with values between 0.63 and 0.74 and 0.56 and 0.81, respectively. Departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed for all loci.

TI Western urban water demand
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL

DT Article
ID SIDE MANAGEMENT POLICIES; RESIDENTIAL DEMAND; PRICE; CONSERVATION
AB Increasing concern with sustainability issues has raised questions regarding western water use. Efficient water allocation,requires policy tools based on the value of water in alternative uses: agricultural, environmental, residential, and. others. Agricultural. values are fairly well established. Environmental values are recognized as "non-market" and estimated with various alternative techniques. Residential uses are normally thought to be market determined, but these markets are often restricted, allowing the possibility that water charges may not accurately reflect the value. of water. This article reviews the history of urban residential water data analyses in order to address this and related issues arid to ascertain the efficacy of extant databases. We then investigate. the viability of estimated demand relationships and the robustness of these estimates to potential policy needs. We also discuss relevant conceptual issues for effective water policy formulation and their role in remedying data inadequacies and provide.,; some. gross; estimates for water prices that include all relevant costs. Finally, we. synthesize the data review and conceptual issues to identify the. requirements for broadening the urban-residential water database. Efficient water pricing in environments where water is "scarce" relies on rules that modify extant pricing practices to ;include a scarcity value. The process has implications for empirical analyses; therefore, we sketch some alternatives for conducting these analyses that could assist policy makers in making difficult water pricing decisions.

AB Quantitative tabular and non-linear mathematical response functions between sheepgrazing carrying capacities, S and P fertiliser rates, S and P soil tests, stocking-rate, stocking-method, irrigation, and year-to-year climate variation, were derived from empirical measurements reported previously. The best fitting of the fertiliser response functions was a polynomial quadratic response with the square root of S and P fertiliser rates. Reliability factors were associated with each of the estimates. The model multipliers show that carrying capacity increased up to a x 4.8 increase with S and P fertiliser, x 1.2 with K and micro-nutrient fertiliser, x 0.6-1.2 with annual climate variation, x 3.3 with irrigation, and x 0.6 for set-stocking compared with mob-stocking.

DE sustainable management; harvest planning; soil frost; delayed skidding
ID ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; HARDWOODS; COMPACTION; 2ND-GROWTH
AB Forest harvesting is likely to have greater impacts on site productivity than any other activity during the rotation. We determined effects of commercial, winter-logging of four aspen-dominated stands on site disturbance and development of regeneration on clay soils in western Upper Michigan. A large skidder caused deep rutting on 20% of a site in a thinning that removed 7.8 m(2) ha(-1) (34 ft(2) ac(-1)) of basal area, and on 38% of a clearcut site. After the first growing season, 45% of the clearcut had no aspen regeneration, and 82% had less than the recommended minimum of 15,000 (15 k) suckers ha(-1) (6 k ac(-1)). Options that can be utilized to minimize logging impacts include: (1) excluding riparian areas and poorly drained inclusions from cutting units; (2) dry season harvesting; (3) plowing snow from (or packing the snow on) skid trails and landings, permitting them to freeze; (4) felling with delayed skidding until trails and landings have frozen; and (5) application of best management practices (BMP) recommendations such as progressive (back-to-front) harvesting. Each of these should have minimal effects on logging costs and may be economically advantageous. As an interim guide, a minimum of 7.5 cm (3.0 in.) of soil frost is recommended for small equipment and 15 cm (6.0 in.) for large equipment. BMP guides could be effective in communicating management objectives to foresters, sale administrators, contractors, and operators, increasing their awareness of (and sensitivity toward) soil disturbance and thus, contribute to sustaining future productivity.

ID FOREST
AB The National Association of State Foresters conducts surveys of silviculture nonpoint source (NPS) pollution control programs to measure progress and identify needs. The 2000 survey results are summarized here for the nation and for the 20-state northeastern region. Current emphasis of NPS pollution programs is on education, training, and monitoring. Educational efforts are used to make more landowners aware of their responsibilities to control pollution during timber harvesting and to make the public and lawmakers more aware of effective pollution control procedures for forestry. Training of foresters, loggers, and landowners in NPS pollution control expanded during the last 4 yr in part due to forest industry's Sustainable Forest Initiative and increased logger accreditation and forester licensing programs. Several states reported improved compliance and performance in controlling NPS pollution as a result of certification and licensing programs. Recommendations are made to continue the progress in NPS pollution control in forestry.

DT Article
DE biodiversity; census; global; research; biogeography
AB As an introduction to the entire volume, this article outlines the relationships among the five elements of the Census of Marine Life (CoML) that create new knowledge: (1) The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), a marine component of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, links marine databases around the world to provide an Internet accessible, dynamic interface for comparing species-level, geo-referenced biodiversity data in relation to ocean habitats. The entire CoML field project data will be managed in and accessible through OBIS. (2) The History of Marine Animal Populations (HMAP) is a unique new synthesis of historical and biological research that will document marine biodiversity, globally, up to 500 years ago, before significant human impact, and store it in formats compatible with modem data in OBIS. (3) The Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research Working Group 118 monitors and recommends advanced marine technologies, ready to be routinely used in CoML field projects. (4) CoML Initial Field Projects develop and calibrate these technologies in selected regions to facilitate and accelerate global biodiversity research. As calibrated technologies and protocols are adopted in many regions, qualitative and quantitative biodiversity discoveries accumulate. (5) The Future of Marine Animal Populations (FMAP) program will insure that the data in OBIS are suitable for modeling and predicting changes in global biodiversity in response to fishing, pollution, and climate change challenges. It will make datasets available for hindcasting and forecasting analyses linked to physical ocean observations and assist in documenting the impacts of conservation efforts on sustainability.

DE image collection optimization; remote sensing; imaging satellites
AB Imaging satellite systems represent a high capital cost. Optimizing the collection of images is critical for both satisfying customer orders and building a sustainable satellite operations business. We describe the functions of an operational, multivariable, time dynamic optimization system that maximizes the daily collection of satellite images. A graphical user interface allows the operator to quickly see the results of what if adjustments to an image collection plan. Used for both long range planning and daily collection scheduling of Space Imaging's IKONOS satellite, the satellite control and tasking (SCT) software allows collection commands to be altered up to 10 min before upload to the satellite.

TI Transparent and caring corporations? - A study of sustainability reports
   by the Body Shop and Royal Dutch/Shell
SO ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID DISCOURSE; BUSINESS; GREEN
AB This article analyzes sustainability values reports published by The Body Shop International and by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group. The authors show how corporate discourses expressed in these precedent-setting texts both reflect and influence sociopolitical struggle over the meanings and practices of sustainable development. Specifically, the authors examine metaphors of transparency and care used to describe corporate rationales for increasing stakeholder communication, including reporting. Drawing on distinct discursive domains of business accountancy and personal ethics and sentiment, these metaphors promise to reconstruct the interface between the firm and society. Exploring the quite different assumptions on which each of these metaphors relies and their implications for corporate practices of sustainable development, the authors consider whether sustainability values reporting and the dialogue that it claims to facilitate can promote more democratic and socially and environmentally responsive corporate decision making, even as they impose new forms of managerial control.

ID SYSTEMS; ASIA
AB Poverty is a rural dilemma and continues to be a persistent multidimensional problem. It is associated with poor farmers, small farm systems, the landless, resource endowments, the socioeconomic environment and externalities, Over 75% of the poor live and work in rural areas, trapped in a poverty-adaptation-fragile lives-little hope-low life expectancy complex, with an enduring hope for self-reliance and a more comfortable life tomorrow. Since agricultural growth is central to improved livelihoods, strategies that focus on promoting such growth are critical: improved efficiency in natural resource management (NRM), of which animals are a part, can directly contribute to productivity enhancement and reduced poverty. It is estimated that approximately 678 million of the rural poor keep animals, within which the largest ownership of animals is seen in mixed crop-animal systems. The role and contribution of animals is discussed with reference to household benefits - current, medium-term and long-term savings, increased productivity of mixed farm systems, sustainability of agricultural systems and the environment, and enhancement of social stability. Mile large ruminants (buffalo and cattle) are very valuable for agriculture and farm security, milk and beef, ploughing and dung production, small animals (goats, sheep, chickens, pigs and ducks) are particularly important for nutritional and household security. The link between gender and animals is emphasized, especially the implications of the very strong relationship between women and children and small animals. This paper describes in detail characteristics of poor farmers and small farm systems. It discusses opportunities for NRM, and presents examples of data from different categories of animals and the extent of their contribution to total farm income, which in Asia ranges from 7-69%. It is concluded that improved animal production systems can increasingly make a significant contribution to improved human welfare, rural growth and reduced poverty. To achieve this, however, much more investment in agricultural research and development is necessary that can target less-favoured rainfed areas, coupled with participatory and interdisciplinary approaches, effective public-private sector partnerships, and commitment to purpose.

DE food security; sustainable food production; Sub-Saharan Africa
AB Falling world grain stocks, rising grain prices and the poor economic situation of Africa have, since 1995, made food security a major issue. Structural adjustment programmes, the crushing burden of debt, the collapse of commodity prices and mismanagement of national economies have rendered African people even poorer in terms of per capita income and quality of life than they were in the first decade after the attainment of independence. Yet Africa is rich in many ways - for example, in virgin land for agriculture and in mineral resources, including energy. It is rich above all in its people and their determined spirit to face all disasters, natural and man-made. In line with this spirit, Africa is moving ahead on a new consensus that food security through enhanced agricultural production is the continent's most fundamental development issue. Although the economic plans of successive African governments have stressed the goal of food self-sufficiency, the food sector has received little investment or political priority. Africa continues to rely on food aid and food imports, which consume a large part of its meagre export earnings. The increasingly limited capacity to purchase food abroad and the bitter experience of depending on emergency aid are honing a clear determination that Africa must marshal the resources to grow its own food and so release the creative energies of its people to contribute fully to their own development and well-being. Top priority should be given to food security during this process, as no country can consider itself free until it has the wherewithal to provide for the basic needs of its people.

AB Living fossils are taxonomic groups surviving for a long time without any remarkable morphological change. Most of them retain low taxonomic diversities. Although some of them have survived in refuges to avoid predators and competitors, not all living fossils live in refuges. The survival of these groups, therefore, should be discussed in the context of biological interaction. I carried out computer simulations of a model food web system, in which each species feeds on others according to its feeding preference. The system evolves via evolution of species. In the simulation, some clades, like "living fossils," survived for a long time with low species diversities. Such clades consisted of species with low evolutionary rates, which result in high predation pressure and intraclade competition for food. Nevertheless, the clades sustainably utilize prey clades and are consequently provided with sufficient food. In addition, because of the low species diversities of the clades, predators of the clades soon become extinct through lack of food. This study strongly suggests that in an evolving food web system, the low evolutionary rates of living fossils allow the long survival of those groups with low taxonomic diversities.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB This paper examines practical and regulatory implications, including both costs and benefits, resulting from implementation of EPPO's new resistance risk analysis guideline. Crop-protection companies operating in Europe are preparing risk analyses and management strategies, and are monitoring for resistance. However, this is a complex and expensive process involving technical, commercial and regulatory functions. The actual cost of filling these data gaps is consequently greater than many would have anticipated. The agrochemical industry has a vested interest in managing resistance and is committed to maintaining the essential contribution of crop-protection products to sustainable agriculture. However, with increasing regulatory costs, it is important that regulatory authorities concentrate requirements for resistance risk analyses, management strategies and monitoring where these are most needed. Should these requirements be applied indiscriminately, crop-protection companies will have to consider whether or not it is economically justifiable to make these investments, or whether to remove less profitable uses from product labels. In such situations, minor crops stand to be disproportionately effected. One year after publication, it is too early to measure the guideline's impact on selection pressure. It is already clear that the guideline represents an unprecedented step forward in the regulation and harmonisation of resistance management. There are, however, valid arguments against regulation of resistance management. One of the most important criticisms that is levelled against the latter approach is that, with the best motivation and with appropriate use restrictions on labels, these actions alone do not solve the problem. It is critical that all stakeholders in the crop protection process are made aware of the importance of resistance management and of complying with prescribed strategies.

ID ROTATING MAGNETIC-FIELD; CURRENT DRIVE
AB The shorting of open field lines where they intersect external boundaries strongly modifies the transverse electric field all along the field lines. The modified electric field is found by an extension of the familiar Boltzmann relation for the electric potential. This leads to a prediction of the electric drift. Flow generation by electrical shorting is applied here to three aspects of elongated field-reversed configurations: plasma rotation rate; the particle-loss spin-up mechanism; and the sustainability of the rotating magnetic field current drive method.

AB A field experiment in western Kenya assessed whether the agroforestry species Tithonia diversifolia (Hemsley) A. Gray, Tephrosia vogelii Hook f., Crotalaria grahamiana Wight & Arn. and Sesbania sesban ( L) Merill. had access to forms of soil P unavailable to maize, and the consequences of this for sustainable management of biomass transfer. The species were grown in rows at high planting density to ensure the soil under rows was thoroughly permeated by roots. Soil samples taken from beneath rows were compared to controls, which included a bulk soil monolith enclosed by iron sheets within the tithonia plot, continuous maize, and bare fallow plots. Three separate plant biomass samples and soil samples were taken at 6-month intervals, over a period of 18 months. The agroforestry species produced mainly leaf biomass in the first 6 months but stem growth dominated thereafter. Consequently, litterfall was greatest early in the experiment (0-6 months) and declined with continued growth. Soil pH increased by up to 1 unit ( from pH 4.85) and available P increased by up to 38% (1 mug P g(-1)) in agroforestry plots where biomass was conserved on the field. In contrast, in plots where biomass was removed, P availability decreased by up to 15%. Coincident with the declines in litterfall, pH decreased by up to 0.26 pH units, plant available P decreased by between 0.27 and 0.72 mug g(-1) and P-o concentration decreased by between 8 and 35 mug g(-1) in the agroforestry plots. Declines in P-o were related to phosphatase activity (R-2 = 0.65, P < 0.05), which was greater under agroforestry species ( 0.40-0.50 nmol MUB s(-1) g(-1)) than maize (0.28 nmol MUB s(-1) g(-1)) or the bare fallow (0.25 nmol MUB s(-1) g(-1)). Management of tithonia for biomass transfer, decreased available soil P by 0.70 &mu;g g(-1) and P-o by 22.82 &mu;g g(-1). In this study, tithonia acquired P-o that was unavailable to maize. However, it is apparent that continuous cutting and removal of biomass would lead to rapid depletion of P stored in organic forms.

AB A 3-year field study in central Maryland evaluated foliar disease in fresh-market tomato grown using combinations of four bed strategies and three fungicide programs. Bed strategies included uncovered beds with or without a composted dairy manure amendment or beds covered with black polyethylene or hairy vetch mulch. Fungicide programs included no fungicide, weekly fungicide, or fungicide applications scheduled according to the TOMCAST disease predictor. In plots with hairy vetch-covered beds, early blight caused by Afternaria solani, Septoria leaf spot caused by Septoria lycopersici, and defoliation were lower versus uncovered beds each year. Early blight and defoliation were lower in beds covered with vetch versus polyethylene mulch in 2 of 3 years. Disease severity, defoliation, and marketable yield were similar for the weekly and TOMCAST fungicide programs, with 40 to 50% fewer sprays using TOMCAST. Marketable yield was similar among bed strategies except for higher yields in covered versus uncovered and unamended beds in a relatively wet year and lower yields in vetch versus polyethylene beds in a dry year.

TI How can political liberals be environmentalists?
SO POLITICAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB It is often assumed that neutralist liberalism and environmentalism are incompatible because promoting environmentally friendly policies involves endorsing a particular conception of the good life. This paper questions that assumption by showing that one important version of neutralist liberalism, John Rawls's 'justice as fairness', can allow two kinds of justification for environmental policies. First, public reason arguments can be used to justify conceptions of sustainability and environmental justice. Second, comprehensive ideals (including non-anthropocentric ideals) can be used to justify more ambitious environmental policies when two conditions are met, namely, the issue under discussion does not concern constitutional essentials or matters of basic justice; and the policy is endorsed by a majority of citizens. Rawls's willingness to allow this second kind of justification for environmental (and other) policies is defended against two objections, which claim that Rawls's democratic liberalism' is incoherent. The first objection - the 'justice' objection - is that to spend public money promoting comprehensive (environmental) ideals is inconsistent with the 'difference principle'. The 'justice' objection depends on a common Misunderstanding of the difference principle. The second objection - the 'neutrality' objection - claims that 'democratic liberalism' is inconsistent with Rawls's commitment to neutrality. The 'neutrality' objection is unconvincing because 'democratic liberalism' is 'fundamentally neutral' whereas the leading alternative is not.

SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT

ID ENVIRONMENT; GROWTH; LIFE
AB Despite our pretensions to science, modern industrial society is as myth-bound and mystical as any that has preceded it. Our prevailing cultural myth includes a dangerous vision of global sustainability and poverty reduction centered on unlimited economic expansion, "free" trade and technological fixes. This paper dissects the modern myth, exposing its conceptual flaws and practical failings. It then proposes an alternative conceptual framework for development derived from ecological economics and ecological footprint analysis. The new framework recognizes that the human enterprise is a subsystem of the ecosphere whose growth is constrained by biophysical limits. If humanity is to seize control of its destiny it must arise above wishful thinking and tribal instinct. Global society needs a new cultural myth rooted in humanity's unique claim to intelligence and self-awareness in the face of danger. Human security depends on equitable development-not growth-within the means of nature. Sustainability with social justice can be achieved only through an unprecedented level of international cooperation rooted in a sense of compassion for both other peoples and other species.

AB Poverty cannot be ended by overall economic growth for two reasons. First, growth is becoming increasingly uneconomic, especially in affluent countries. That is, the costs of growth now approximate or exceed its benefits. Second, poverty is partly a relative matter, and growth cannot help this. The costs of reducing poverty should be taken from rents collected on the contributions of nature, which should be the common property of all.

AB Soil fertility has been the basis of all past civilizations. The current agricultural system supplements declining soil fertility with petroleum, which is being rapidly depleted. This system reflects the deeply entrenched Baconian-Cartesian mindset. It impoverishes farmers and damages their health, while enriching agribusiness. It is an economic failure, surviving only on massive government subsidies. An evolutionary-ecological worldview can direct us to sustainable agriculture capable of providing adequate resources for all.

AB The relationship between waste and the civil engineering profession has long been recognised. However, in coming years that relationship may become increasingly significant, precipitated by a mixture of European and UK Government pressures translated into a hardening price regime driven by budgetary, regulatory and fiscal instruments. The backdrop to those drivers lies in growing scientific evidence emphasising the need for significant improvements in resource efficiency within the framework of the UK economy. This paper addresses those trends with particular reference to the profession, the waste sector and the countryside-a geographic context which is especially important given the far-reaching review which the Government is now undertaking on the role of rural areas in general and the context of specific industries and professions within it.

DE buildings structure and design; research & development; water supply
AB Water is a precious and limited resource. The demand for water is projected to increase in the future while the supply may be adversely affected by global factors such as climate change. This results in an increasing need to use water more wisely. The Government and the water industry are encouraging the adoption of water conservation measures. One component of these water conservation measures, among many others, is to use rainwater and greywater (water from sinks, baths and showers) as a source of water to reduce water consumption. This paper provides an outline of the main considerations for the use of rainwater or greywater, identifying its contribution to sustainable water management and discusses the issues that need to be overcome to encourage the wider uptake of the technology. The matters outlined in this paper are expanded upon in a series of reports available from CIRIA.

TI Sustainable coastal defences - The use of timber and other materials
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER

DE maritime engineering; recycling of materials; sea defences
AB Sustainability is becoming an increasingly significant consideration for all engineers, particularly those operating on our fragile and beautiful coastline. Considerable progress has been made towards developing more sympathetic solutions to coastal flooding and erosion problems, which integrate environmental and social considerations into engineering solutions. However, one area in which there is still much more to do is the sustainable use of materials. The use of tropical hardwoods in coastal defences brings attention to this issue in the context of public concern over the international depletion of rain forests. This paper addresses the use of timber, as well as discussing other initiatives and research which are now under way on behalf of the Government and the engineering profession. It shows that significant advances have been made over the past five years in delivering practical guidance to empower engineers to adopt more sustainable solutions, but that that there is still a long way to go, particularly in the use of waste materials.

AB Armed conflict can lead to the collapse of many of the institutions which constitute the framework of a viable society. Their reconstitution in whatever form requires strategies which lead to sustainable solutions. Effective infrastructure forms the backbone to the recovery process. This paper describes the development of theory to support the establishment of sustainable infrastructure programmes in post-war areas. It contains adapted extracts from an extensive research project into post-war infrastructure in East Timor and North Maluku undertaken by the author.

DE coastal wetlands; estuary; flood risk; managed realignment; restoration;
   salt marsh; sea level rise; sediment recharge
AB Restoration of reclaimed marshes in the United Kingdom, referred to as managed realignment, is both a scientific and a political issue. A cross-party House of Commons report to Government stressed that provision of long-term sustainable coastal defenses must start with the premise that "coasts need space" and that government must work to increase public awareness, scientific knowledge, and political will to facilitate such a retreat from the almost sacrosanct existing shoreline. Government, in turn, has agreed with the basis of the report but is aware of conflicting interests, not least the European legislation, which has designated large areas of reclaimed marshes as Special Areas of Conservation that cannot legally be restored to their former tidal processes. Against this background, it is essential that scientific research provides convincing arguments for the necessity for managed realignment, the location, extent, and type of marshlands that need to be restored to provide sustainable flood defenses, maintain and enhance conservation status, and ensure a healthy functioning estuarine system. We examine the political and scientific issues involved, discuss model predictions and field experiments into realignment techniques, and outline the preliminary results of such experiments showing the evolution of restored intertidal wetlands in the United Kingdom.

AB The West Indian Topshell Cittarium pica is artisanally collected on rocky shores along the Caribbean Coast of Costa Rica. There are neither data on the state of its exploitation nor exist any regulation of the fishery. From October 2000 to March 2001, the population dynamics of this species were studied at an unexploited and two exploited sites to determine the present impact of the fishery on the resource. Average population density with 14 ind./m(2) about three times higher at the unexploited than at the exploited sites. Length-frequency histograms showed a strong shift towards smaller specimens at the exploited sites, which is also reflected in significantly higher rates of total mortality (Z = 4.05 and 4.47) when compared to the unexploited site (Z = 1.47). Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated as k = 0.19-0.28 (yr(-1)) and L-infinity = 104 mm. No significant differences were found among sites. From these values a range of the growth performance index Phi was computed (Phi = 3.31-3.48) which lies at the lower end of the values reported for other tropical marine gastropods. The size at first maturity for both sexes combined was estimated as 29.20 +/- 1.14 mm. Exploitation rates >0.6 for both exploited sites and a large fraction of small specimens (<30mm) in the catches suggest overexploitation and recruitment overfishing. Based on the estimated maximum sustainable yield we recommend regulative measures for the fishery such as a control of a minimum landing size of 40 mm and a closure of the fishery during its reproductive period (from July to November).

AB This article proposes three states in an actor-network and a global/local distinction among actants. This theoretical framework is applied to two invention networks: one created by an inventor of solar heating systems and another created by a designer who wanted to create an environmentally sustainable furniture fabric. Both solar inventor and fabric designer wanted to develop technologies that would improve the environment and also make money. The article concludes by considering whether invention networks that intend to turn "good into gold" have to evolve a shared representation or whether it is sufficient for a new design to serve as a boundary object for actants.

AB Adequate interpretations of the complex social processes that contribute to the transformation of aquatic ecosystems and subsequent conflicts over water demand an interdisciplinary perspective. In this special issue, we focus on the multiple causes of conflicts over water, sensitive to the complex interrelations between and within social and ecological phenomena that result in transformed and Contested environments. The cases presented here-representing research carried out in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey, and the United States-emphasize three interrelated themes: the need to account for multiple spatial and temporal scales in analyzing conflicts over water and water-related resources; the complex character of environmental (or ecological) conflict; and questions of sustainability. Ultimately, inure incisive understandings of the multiple causes of conflicts over water and aquatic resources are contingent on the integration of multiple disciplinary perspectives. This understanding will in turn promote uses of water and water-related resources that sustain rather than degrade aquatic socioecological systems.

AB While ecosystem management has been widely accepted as a key to addressing ecological crisis find conflict over aquatic resources, this article argues that the success of this approach may be threatened by the unarticulated assumptions of property rights embedded in the interstices of the law. Drawing on a history of conflict and cooperation in the management of natural resources, the article identifies different ways in which legal premises may be used to advance or retard the implementation of systems of aquatic resource management. Finally, the article calls a closer understanding, within the law, of the relationship between the biological and ecological characteristics of a particular aquatic resource and the legal rules required to manage it in a sustainable way.

AB While many accounts of water and conflict focus on the possibility of future interstate conflict resulting from changing quantities and qualities of freshwater, a multiscalar approach helps to demonstrate the manifold, complex, and reciprocal relations between uses of water and social/political conflicts. Using Turkey's Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) as a demonstration of the complex interrelations between water uses and social conflicts, this article illustrates the multiple temporalities, spatialities, and modalities of water and conflict geographies. Explicit attention to the historical and geographical dimensions of water and conflict in specific settings helps to complicate our understanding of these relationships, points to the importance of intrastate and local scales as potential sites of conflict (including the role of nonstate actors), and enriches discussions related to "sustainability" of water resource uses over time.

AB This paper reviews information from the literature and case studies to investigate whether productivity in organic systems is restricted by the supply of available N during the major phases of crop growth. Organic systems have the potential to supply adequate amounts of available N to meet crop demand through the incorporation of leys, N rich cash crop residues and uncomposted manures. However, this is seldom achieved because leys are only incorporated once every few years and organically produced crop residues and manures tend to have low N contents and slow mineralization rates. N availability could be improved by delaying ley incorporation until spring, applying uncomposted manures at the start of spring growth, transferring some manure applications from the ley phase to arable crops, preventing cover crops from reaching a wide C:N ratio and better matching crop type with the dynamics of N availability.

AB On organic farms, where the importation of materials to build/maintain soil fertility is restricted, it is important that a balance between inputs and outputs of nutrients is achieved to ensure both short-term productivity and long-term sustainability. This paper considers different approaches to nutrient budgeting on organic farms and evaluates the sources of bias in the measurements and/or estimates of the nutrient inputs and outputs. The paper collates 88 nutrient budgets compiled at the farm scale in nine temperate countries. All the nitrogen (N) budgets showed an N surplus (average 83.2 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). The efficiency of N use, defined as outputs/inputs, was highest (0.9) and lowest (0.2) in arable and beef systems respectively. The phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) budgets showed both surpluses and deficits (average 3.6 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), 14.2 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1)) with horticultural systems showing large surpluses resulting from purchased manure. The estimation of N fixation and quantities of nutrients in purchased manures may introduce significant errors in nutrient budgets. Overall, the data illustrate the diversity of management systems in place on organic farms, and suggest that used together with soil analysis, nutrient budgets are a useful tool for improving the long-term sustainability of organic systems.

AB The article seeks to further understanding of the conditions conducive to achieving durable peace in the context of protracted conflict in Africa. It provides a critical look at the existing literature, and uses comparative evidence from selected cases to develop an alternative analytical perspective on the issues. Evidence from four cases of protracted African conflicts (Angola, Mozambique, Sudan, and Uganda) point to the centrality of substantive and distributive questions (distribution of political power, membership in the political community, and resources) as the loci around which the sustainability of peacebuilding efforts revolve. The arguments and evidence challenge some widely held views about war and peace in Africa, and some of the policy prescriptions based on those views. Troubling questions are raised about the efficacy of prescriptions in the areas of political and socio-economic reconstruction championed by the major donors and United Nations agencies, and about the role of the global political economy in African conflicts.

AB In a world with an exploding human population and declining non-renewable resources, three kinds of intellectuals weigh in as inquirers into the human prospect. Two agree that the European-North American-Japanese path of development cannot be sustained. The third scholar studiously avoids being drawn into the discussion as he advances a recipe for right livelihood, which ignores economic considerations by advancing a moral argument. Systems thinking, a form of reductionism, it is argued, must remain subordinate to a dialectical approach to solving our problems. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

TI Sustainable development issues and strategies for Alberta's oil industry
SO TECHNOVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE sustainable development; oil industry; Alberta
AB This paper discusses the sustainable development issues for the Alberta oil industry and suggests strategies for its long-term survival. While oil and gas are finite resources, Alberta's massive non-conventional reserves are a virtual assurance that it can meet all the fossil fuel demands for Canada and its export market in the foreseeable future. This makes it a sustainable resource in practical terms. Despite its large economic contribution, this industry will face many challenges to remain viable over the next 50 years. Large investments will be required and it must improve its public consultation process and environmental record if it is to become sustainable. In recent years, stakeholder pressure, tougher regulations and better enforcement has made the industry more environmentally friendly, but its track record suggests that continued regulation will still be required.
   There is a growing realisation that sustainable development can no longer remain a low priority for those organisations with aspirations for long-term survival, and this makes it a bone fide strategic issue. Concern over environmental protection has become a critical issue for the industry, and must be addressed in terms of the natural regenerative capacity of the environment, and the legitimate need for an economically viable sector. As such, sustainable development inextricably links environmental protection with economics and stakeholder interests.
   In the longer term, competition from less polluting alternate fuels is likely to intensify and this will force contraction of the industry and a loss of market share. This smaller, more competitive environment of the future will likely favour those companies that can best integrate growth with a low cost strategy and environmental protection. As such, size is likely to be important insofar that it usually correlates with financial resources and the ability to achieve economies of scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lymphatic filariasis is associated with considerable disability related to the intensity and frequency of acute adenolymphangitis (ADL) attacks. The global programme for elimination of lymphatic filariasis emphasizes the need to combine transmission control with alleviation of disability. Footcare aimed at the prevention of secondary bacterial infections is the mainstay of disability alleviation programmes. We evaluated the efficacy and sustainability of an unsupervised, personal footcare programme by examining and interviewing 127 patients who had previously participated in a trial that assessed the efficacy of diethylcarbamazine, penicillin and footcare in the prevention of ADL. During the trial period these patients had been educated in footcare and were supervised. During the unsupervised period, which lasted 1 year or longer, 47 patients developed no ADL, and ADL occurred less frequently in 72.5%. Most patients were practising footcare as originally advised, unsupervised and without cost, which proves that such a programme is sustainable and effective.

ID DEMAND
AB Water use assessments are a necessary prerequisite for sustainable water resources management and planning in river basins, federal states, or countries. For reasons of transparency, flexibility, ease of update, and the possibility to generate scenarios of future water use, such assessments are best carried out by applying a water use model. To support water resources planning in two federal states of semi-arid Northeastern Brazil, Ceara and Piaui, the regional-scale water use model NoWUM was developed. It computes withdrawal and consumptive water use for each of 332 municipalities, distinguishing five water use sectors: irrigation, livestock, households, industry, and tourism. The model is suited to simulate the impact of global change and of management measures on water demand Using NoWUM, the present-day water use situation in Ceara and Piaui is assessed. In addition, the impact of inter-annual climate variability and long-term climate change on irrigation requirements is considered. Scarce and uncertain input data lead to a high level of uncertainty in the model results. It is likely that water use in the most important sector irrigation, is underestimated, while industrial water use is possibly overestimated. With some modifications, NoWUM has the potential to be applied for water use assessments in other data-poor regions of the globe.

AB The increasing gap between the supply and demand for water in the Economic and Social Commission of Western Asia (ESCWA) member countries: Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen) can be attributed to the limited availability of surface water mining of fossil groundwater sources, and water pollution mainly of shallow aquifers, deficient institutional structure, poor management processes, and inapt allocation of financial resources. The non-sustainable use of natural water resources to meet the escalating water demand has also contributed to the depletion and deterioration of water quality and quantity. To meet water supply shortages in the domestic sector, water desalination has been entrenched as a viable option for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which includes the following countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates. The objective of the paper is to investigate the role of water desalination in meeting the water demands in the ESCWA member countries. The significant role of desalination is highlighted with emphasis in evaluating not only its production trends, processes, and costs, but also its capacity in the provision of water demands. Water desalination has become a major and staunch water source for a number of large urban centers. For such countries such as Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar and the coastal zone areas of Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), If and Saudi Arabia, desalination represents one of the most feasible and strategic alternative options for their current and future domestic water supply requirement. Given the high consumption rate from this source and its high production cost, fundamental efforts must be integrated and invested in both research and development programs to implement comprehensive conservation measures that would lead to a reduction in the consumption rates. Parallel to these achievements, efforts should be directed within the context of integrated management of water resources, to identify alternative potential water resources, to meet future water challenges.

ID NINO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; SEVERITY INDEX; UNITED-STATES; DURATION
AB The temporal and spatial characteristics of droughts are investigated to provide a framework for sustainable water resources management in a semi-arid region. Using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) as an indicator of drought severity, the characteristics of droughts are examined in the Conchos River Basin in Mexico. This basin is important to both the United States and Mexico, because the Conchos River supplies approximately 80 percent of the flows of the Lower Bravo/Grande River above the binational reservoirs of Amistad and Falcon. The temporal and spatial characteristics of the PDSI are used to develop a drought intensity - areal extent - frequency curve that can assess the severity of a regional drought in the basin. The analysis of the PDSI suggests that the Conchos River Basin had a severe drought in the 1990s, which the basin has not experienced before. Based on this analysis, the recent drought that occurred in the 1990s has an associated return period of about 80 to 100 years over the basin.

AB Water resources management in karst areas is a very complex task, especially with regard to solving the problem of floods and protection against pollution. This is also true for flood protection of Vrgorsko polje, which is the subject of this paper Complexity of water system and socio-economic characteristics in the broader area requires integral problem solving through analyses of several alternatives with different technical and technological features as well as different socio-economic and ecological impacts. In this paper, an elaborated integral approach to problem solving is presented as well as system analyses and the procedure of multicriteria selection of an optimum solution for karstic polje flood protection. The problem was successfully solved using the procedure with two basic steps. The first step analyzed possible basic solution concepts while the second analyzed engineering solutions in compliance with the adopted concepts. The results confirm the validity of this approach, which resulted in the elaboration of a flood protection project that was acceptable for all participants in the system.

AB Africa faces major problems in its water resources sector manifested in the periodic droughts and floods and compounded by population growth, urbanization, and environmental degradation. Africa has a large number of shared rivers, lakes, and aquifers, and the uses and protection of most are not regulated by any agreements between the riparian states,. Where such agreements exist, they do not encompass all the riparians. A number of instruments were concluded by the African leaders with the view of addressing these problems. The most recent of those instruments is "the Abuja Ministerial Declaration on Water: A Key to Sustainable Development, 11 which was adopted in April 2002 and which establishes the African Ministerial Conference on Water This article reviews the water resources problems in Africa and analyzes the various attempts to address them, including the Abuja Declaration.

AB Weed scientists face complex and difficult challenges Within our discipline, we must increase the sustainability of current weed management approaches and help respond to invasive plants as a component of global change There also are major challenges that we share with other agricultural disciplines, such as mounting comprehensive efforts to address the problems of current agriculture We believe that any effective response to these challenges will require public work, ie, projects in which a diverse group of people work together-across lines of difference (professional, cultural, etc)-to produce broad-based, systemic innovations that meet complex challenges We propose that weed scientists should join relevant public-work projects by practicing "public scholarship" We define public scholarship as original, creative, peer evaluated scholarship evaluated intellectual work that is fully integrated in a public-work project By full scholar's work serves to fuel the social (ie, collective) Integration we mean that the scholar learning of the public-work group This condition requires that the scholar be a full participant in the group rather than just being in a consultative or advisory role We present several case studies of weed scientists practicing public scholarship These scientists found this mode of scholarship to be a highly effective means by which to address their professional priorities Barriers to the practice of public scholarship include the lack of relevant guidelines and norms within academic culture, e g, with regard to quality-assurance standards But public scholarship offers weed scientists a new way of responding to increasingly urgent demands to show that our work effectively produces public value in return for public investment We believe that graduate programs in weed science should begin to offer students opportunities to learn skills that are relevant to public scholarship.

TI Nectarivorous feeding by Shiny Cowbirds: A complex feeding innovation
SO WILSON BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
ID BIRDS
AB Here I report a feeding innovation by Shiny Cowbirds (Molothrus bonariensis) in which the birds feed on the nectar of flax (Phormium tenax) flowers. Flax frequently is cultivated in Mar del Plata City, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, as an ornamental plant, and the Shiny Cowbird is common there. The length of the cowbird's bill is similar to that of the flax flower tube, which permits the cowbird to access the nectar. Further, the panicle stem of the flax is sufficiently rigid for perching, and the short distance between the stem and the flower enables a perched cowbird to reach the flower. At this site, flax nectar probably is utilized in a sustainable manner, as the flowers apparently are not harmed. Future investigations should examine whether or not the observed behavior is restricted to this particular population and if it is not, determine the spatial and temporal extent to which it occurs. Received 12 October 2001, accepted 5 September 2002.

ID EDUCATION
AB This article seeks to take partnerships seriously. Specifically, it is concerned with the nature, opportunities, and challenges facing women's nongovernmental organization (NGOs), which seek to make real contributions to sustainable development. It uses a case study of COFERENE, a successful women's NGO in Costa Rica, to explore the nature of partnerships, the contextual factors that shape them, the successes that can be realized from their wise use, and the potential problems that may arise. There are lessons, both optimistic and cautionary, to be learned from COFERENE'S experiences. This article analyzes these lessons. In synthesis, partnerships are complex and demanding, though there are cases in which women's NGOs have used them effectively to foster sustainable development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Recent debates about governance, poverty,and environmental sustainability have emphasized a "rights-based" approach, in which equitable development is strongly associated with individual and communal rights. This paper reviews this approach and explores its practical application to Thailand's "Community Forestry Bill," which seeks to establish communal rights of access and conservation in forest reserve areas. The paper examines conflicts concerning watershed forests and mangroves in Thailand, and argues that efforts to support rural livelihoods through community rights have been undermined by a state that has frequently supported commercial interests or opposed decentralization to minority groups. The paper documents how civil society organizations may negotiate rights within the wider public spheres in which rules, rights, and "community" are established, and defended.

AB This article presents a simple but valuable framework that helps to generate a clear understanding of the social causes of environmental degradation and factors that affect land user decision-making in soil conservation. It is grounded in structuration theory and resonates with recent ideas encompassed by the "sustainable livelihoods" approach. The framework is illustrated with reference to two case studies in mountainous areas where officials have, for some time, expressed a considerable degree of concern about degradation. The first is from the Uluguru Mountains of central-eastern Tanzania and the second is from the Chiang Dao District of the Northern Highlands of Thailand. The framework helps to reveal the diverse factors contributing to a lack of investment in conservation measures in these two places, in a comprehensive but nondeterministic and culturally-specific way.

AB This paper examines the rationale, practice, and problems of contract farming in vegetable crops in the agriculturally developed Indian Punjab which has faced the problem of sustainability of growth since the early 1980s. It is found that agribusiness firms deal with relatively large producers and their contracts, which are biased against the farmer, perpetuate the existing problems of the farm sector such as high chemical input intensity, and social differentiation. Contracting has however, led to higher farm incomes and more employment for labor. There seems, to be an inherent contradiction in the objectives of the contracting parties and those of the local economy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The lipase-catalyzed selective transformation of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) into dicaprolactone (DCL: 1,8-dioxacyclotetradecane-2,9-dione) and the repolymerization of DCL in supecritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) were carried out for the establishment of a sustainable green polymer chemistry for PCL. PCL with a number-average molecular weight of (M) over bar (n) = 110 000 was selectively transformed into repolymerizable cyclic DCL in 90% yield using immobilized Candida antarctica lipase (lipase CA) in scCO(2) fluid by compression to 18 MPa in the presence of a small amount of water at 40degreesC. The DCL obtained such was readily polymerized by lipase CA in scCO(2) to produce a PCL with an (M) over bar (n) for 33 000 after 6 h.

ID GLOBALIZATION
AB The forthcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development is an unprecedented opportunity to place health higher on the environmental and development agenda. The world's leaders will be grappling with some of the major challenges of our times-how to eradicate poverty and meet the world's development needs In a way that does not destroy the environment. Topping the agenda are water, energy, health, agriculture, and biodiversity. Improvement of access of the world's poor people to clean water, sanitation, and safe sources of household energy would have a huge effect on the main killers of young children-pneumonia and diarrhoea. Similarly, improved environmental management could substantially affect many infectious disease outcomes. At the same time, the growing epidemic of non-communicable diseases could be reversed if people's consumption patterns and lifestyles could be put on a more sustainable and healthy footing. A shared health, environmental, and development agenda could address the large share of the burden of disease that is environmentally related, and vice versa. The health sector Increasingly needs to work in partnership with others rather than work alone. New tools are needed to ensure that intersectoral action becomes embedded in the way that the health sector does business. Improving coordination might be one of the most important ways in which we can help put the planet back on a healthy and sustainable path.

ID FAST PYROLYSIS
AB Biomass, a product of photosynthesis, is a renewable resourve that can be used for sustainable production of hydrogen. We propose an approach that combines production of hydrogen with valuable coproducts and shows promising economics. The concept is based on a two-stage process: fast pyrolysis of biomass to generate bio-oil, followed by catalytic steam reforming of the bio-oil, or a fraction thereof, to produce hydrogen. The preferred option is separation of the bio-oil into a lignin-derived fraction, which could be used for producing phenolic resins or fuel-blending components, and a carbohydrate-derived material, which would be reformed to produce hydrogen. The coproduct strategy can also be applied to residual fractions derived from pulping operations of ethanol production and to effluents from other biomass conversion technologies such as transesterification of vegetable oils or food processing residues. In addition, all of the biomass-derived liquids can be coprocessed with natural gas to produce hydrogen mixed fossil-biomass feedstocks, a strategy similar to cofiring biomass and coal for power generation. This work focuses on the second stage of the process: catalytic steam reforming of various biomass-derived liquids. We have used a commercial nickel-based naphtha reforming catalyst in a fluidized-bed reactor to produce hydrogen from the various biomass-derived liquid. Yields have approached or exceeded 80% of those the theoretically possible for stoichiometric conversion.

AB A simple quantitative approach to enable chemists to compare alternative chemical syntheses on the lab bench with respect to their resource usage and their potential environmental impact is proposed; this may be useful for the systematic design of more sustainable processes. We consider as metrics the mass index S-1 and the environmental factor E to characterize quantitatively the reaction input and output, respectively. The potential environmental impact is estimated by using easily available data of each compound of the feed and of each compound of the waste. The calculations can easily be performed using EATOS-environmental assessment tool for organic syntheses.

AB This paper analyzes an organization that has a well-defined strategy providing a sustainable competitive advantage. This advantage is expressed by at least one dimension of quality on which the product or service exhibits outstanding performance. Using decreasing and increasing exponential demand functions for price and quality, respectively, the optimal quality level is characterized when dollar sales volume (under a cost-based price floor) and profit are maximized. However, as quality inflates, the same quality performance is worth less tomorrow than today. This paper shows that continuous and simultaneous improvement of operational efficiency and quality is a must and is independent from price setting policies. The condition of optimal trade-offs among quality dimensions is found for the case when the company competes on multiple quality dimensions. Finally, the conditions are analyzed when the resources of quality are utilized in other market segments as well. It is found that the corporate level quality (or the utilization level of resources) is lower (higher) than the highest (least) individual business unit (product) quality.

AB In this study an attempt is made to investigate comprehensively the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of Allee population dynamic system. The results show that: (1) because the net production rate of Allee system is a function of the shape parameter d, all Allee systems which possess different B (B = A/K, here K is the carrying capacity, and A the parameter of Allee effect) are adapted themselves to the environments by controlling their production rate. Allee effect does not change the interaction between the system and environment, but it will reduce the MSY; (2) the MSY of Allee system is approximately one-nineteenth of the height of the allometry curve of body size for all A/K < 0.01. However when the net production rate R takes the values from 3 to 15, the MSY of Allee system is also approximately 1/19 of the height of the allometry curve of body size for all A/K less than or equal to 0.001.

AB Employing the theory of minimum stream power and the principle of maximum entropy as well as field data, this paper develops relationships between the river channel pattern and river functions. It is deduced that the channel pattern with a sinuosity of S = 1.4-1.6 and a meander wave length L-m approximate to 12 times the channel width is the optimal channel pattern for environmentally sound training and management of alluvial rivers. Taking into account (i) the optimal channel pattern, (ii) the principle of sustainable development of river systems, and (iii) field investigation on river functions and environment, the paper proposes a river management model, which is characterized by (a) a low flow channel with optimal channel pattern, (b) ecotype river banks, (c) riparian forests, (d) embankment dams located at an optimum distance away from river banks, and (e) accessibility to watersides. A river system possessing these characteristics produces maximum societal, economic, and environmental benefits. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

   tree rejuvenation
ID NUTRIENT; VEGETATION; GROWTH
AB The creation and restoration of natural woodland serving diverse socio-economic as well as nature conservation purposes has become a major objective of sustainable forestry throughout Europe. There is a main focus on the conversion of anthropogenous coniferous forests, which are widely spread in the Central European lowlands and mountain ranges, into natural broad-leaved forests. For ecological as well as economic reasons, the integration of natural regeneration processes into conversion management is considered an important task. Taking the woodland of the Menzer Heide (NE Germany), a typical Pleistocene landscape in the northern Central European lowlands as an example, a vegetation analysis of the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantations dominating in this area is presented. As the main results, (1) two communities are differentiated within the present-day pine plantations on the oligotrophic and acidic sandy soils. Indicated by different species compositions, the Dicranum-community and the Oxalis-community occur, the latter growing on sites with higher nutrient availability. (2) The comparison of an historical with the present vegetation analysis reveals an increase of nutrient availability in recent decades, most probably strongly related to the natural soil regeneration of the formerly exploited forest sites. (3) From the results of the vegetation analysis, including records of species and individual numbers of naturally rejuvenated trees, future stand development scenarios can be derived. Thus, the Oxalis-community may directly develop into oak-beech and beech stands as natural forests. In the long term, the Dicranum-community will pass a regeneration stage with pine and oak, probably further developing towards natural oak-beech and beech forests. In conclusion, decisions regarding extensive or intensive management, aiming at the conversion of coniferous plantations into natural broad-leaved forests, can be made following observation of the natural regeneration processes in the present-day stands. By utilising the natural regeneration processes and by applying only a few controlling silvicultural measures, a low-energy and cost-effective conversion of the forests can be accomplished.

AB Palm leaves are an important source of roof thatch for rural communities in many parts of the tropics. Often leaves are harvested from wild populations, and as a non-timber forest product may promote local commitment to forest conservation. Nevertheless, reports suggest that at least some wild populations are declining due to over-harvesting. In Amazonian Ecuador the understory palm Geonoma macrostachys Mart. is often the preferred species for thatching. Here we explore the limits to sustainable harvesting of this species combining ethnobotanical data on the use of this species by the Huaorani indigenous group with ecological data and transition matrix modeling. We find that due to severe light limitation there seems to be little scope for sustainable harvesting of this species from old-growth forest. Instead high rates of sustainable harvesting could probably be achieved in semi-open anthropogenic habitats, e.g. agroforestry systems or young secondary forests. We also find that harvesting scheme has a strong impact on sustainable harvesting rates; if only adults (leaf length 100-223 cm) are harvested, while subadults (leaf length 35-99 cm) are left unharvested, two to three times as much leaf material can be harvested per area (at a fixed density) as when subadults are also harvested.

AB The creation of a World Lake Vision is essential to achieving the sustainable management of the world's lakes. We discuss the value of lakes, how those values have historically led to changes in watershed land-use and population, and how changes have resulted in stresses that impair lake value. Current approaches to lake management at both the local and international level are examined and their shortcomings highlighted. We illustrate how a World Lake Vision, along with the individual lake visions it promotes, can redress the shortcomings of current lake management approaches. Details of the World Lake Vision and the process of its creation are put forth. We end with a critique of the World Water Vision presented at the second World Water Forum in March 2000 from the perspective of lakes and conclude that, in its current form, the World Water Vision provides an inadequate guide for sustainable lake management.

AB The La Plata River Basin is one of the largest international river basins in the world, with an area of about 3 million km(2). It spreads across five countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay), and its water resources are essential for their economic development. Together with reservoir development, extensive deforestation, intensive agriculture practices and large urban developments took place in the Parana, Paraguay and Uruguay basins, affecting environmental conditions and raising important issues concerning water resources use and conservation. Therefore, the need to promote participatory and cooperative efforts among water resources stakeholders, as well as the systematic exchange of information and experiences on common regional problems among organizations and experts from throughout the basin who are devoted to water resources use and management, was reported by researchers and managers gathered at the First and Second International Workshops on Regional Approaches for Reservoir Development and Management in the La Plata River Basin (held in 1991 and 1994). As a concrete response to this need, the efforts of a number of organizations from various countries within the basin, with the support of international and national governmental organizations, resulted in the foundation of La Plata River Basin Environmental Research and Management Network (RIGA) in March 2001. This was within the framework of the Third International Workshop, which was precisely one of the short-term activities included in the RIGA Action Plan. During the preparatory processes for the RIGA Network, the presence of Japanese cooperation supporting the La Plata River Basin Workshops through a non-governmental international organization (ILEC) played an important role in stimulating such an organization-based joint approach in the basin. This outcome, although not originally planned, constituted a welcomed byproduct of its main specific interest in the region, which was the establishment of international sustainable management guidelines for lake and reservoir management.

AB International conventions to reduce carbon dioxide levels focus on ecosystems and do not specifically recognize the need to conserve species. However, species are the building blocks of ecosystems, they are more widely understood among the public, and they provide means of capturing market values from ecosystems. Achieving successful conservation globally will require ensuring that the systems under which species and ecosystems are conserved axe more inclusive than statutory protected areas. Equal emphasis needs to be placed on including effective regimes that also encompass private and communal ownership through incentive-based approaches. Nevertheless, if globalized industries such as nature-based tourism or consumptive use are to provide meaningful incentives locally, a key requirement is to reduce leakage of revenue that is earned as a result of conserving species, such that local development concerns are addressed. However, current biodiversity conventions that address these needs are largely aspirational, while globalized industries such as tourism mainly promote their green credentials only through voluntary codes of conduct. Greatly improved linkages are needed between international conservation concerns and ensuring effective solutions to sustainability, which inevitably rest at national and sub-national levels, through systems of rights, tenure, benefits and incentives.

AB The global carbon cycle is significantly influenced by changes in the use and management of forests and agriculture. Humans have the potential through changes in land use and management to alter the magnitude of forest-carbon stocks and the direction of forest-carbon fluxes. However, controversy over the use of biological means to absorb or reduce emissions of CO2 (often referred to as carbon 'sinks') has arisen in the context of the Kyoto Protocol. The controversy is based primarily on two arguments: sinks may allow developed nations to delay or avoid actions to reduce fossil fuel emissions, and the technical and operational difficulties are too threatening to the successful implementation of land use and forestry projects for providing carbon offsets. Here we discuss the importance of including carbon sinks in efforts to address global warming and the consequent additional social, environmental and economic benefits to host countries. Activities in tropical forest lands provide the lowest cost methods both of reducing emissions and reducing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. We conclude that the various objections raised as to the inclusion of carbon sinks to ameliorate climate change can be addressed by existing techniques and technology. Carbon sinks provide a practical available method of achieving meaningful reductions in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide while at the same time contribute to national sustainable development goals.

AB This paper describes the convergence of environmental and financial markets, reviews the evolution of market-based environmental programmes as an example of the seven-stage evolutionary process witnessed in a variety of markets and summarizes the emergence of greenhouse-gas-mitigation markets and their potential role in advancing land stewardship, biodiversity and other environmental services.
   Emissions trading has been developed to meet the demand to reduce pollution while avoiding economic disruption. Consistent with the seven-stage pattern of market evolution, the US programme to reduce the damage from acid rain established a standardized environmental commodity, developed 'evidence of ownership' necessary for financial instruments and provided the infrastructure to efficiently transfer title. The success of the system in reducing pollution at low cost has provided a model for other market-based environmental protection initiatives.
   The demand for cost-effective action to reduce the threat of climate change has initiated the same evolutionary process for markets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Many of the land- and forest-management practices that can capture and store atmospheric CO2 can also provide other environmental benefits, such as biodiversity preservation and enhanced water quality. The presence of a carbon-trading market will introduce a clear financial value for capture and mitigation of CO2 emissions, thus introducing a new source of funding for land stewardship and forest rehabilitation. The market is now emerging through a variety of 'bottom-up' developments being undertaken through governmental, multilateral, private-sector and non-governmental-organization initiatives.
   The extension of markets to other emerging environmental issues is now underway, and the linkages between environmental sustainability and capital markets are being more deeply understood. The early evidence indicates that environmental sustainability can be compatible with maximization of shareholder value.

AB The many opportunities for mitigating atmospheric carbon emissions in developing countries include reforesting degraded lands, implementing sustainable agricultural practices on existing lands and slowing tropical deforestation. This analysis shows that over the next 10 years, 48 major tropical and subtropical developing countries have the potential to reduce the atmospheric carbon burden by about 2.3 billion tonnes of carbon. Given a central price of $10 per tonne of carbon and a discount rate of 3%, this mitigation would generate a net present value of about $16.8 billion collectively for these countries. Achieving these potentials would require a significant global effort, covering more than 50 million hectares of land, to implement carbon-friendly practices in agriculture, forest and previously forested lands. These estimates of host-country income potentials do not consider that outside financial investment may or may not be available. Our calculations take no account of the additional benefits of carbon sequestration in forest soils undergoing reforestation, increased use of biomass and reduced use of fossil-fuel inputs and reduced agricultural emissions. In all events, realizing these incomes would necessitate substantially greater policy support and investment in sustainable land uses than is currently the case.

AB In line with its mission of alleviating poverty through support for environmentally and socially sustainable economic development, The World Bank (along with some other multilateral development banks) is working to help developing countries capture a share of the emerging global market in greenhouse-gas-emissions reductions (,carbon trading'). Under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Joint Implementation instrument and the Clean Development Mechanism now provide an opening for substantial international resource transfers and potential for supporting sustainable development through the transfer of cleaner technologies or sustainable forestry and agro-forestry practices. For example, carbon sequestration represents a non-extractive non-consumptive sustainable use of living natural resources that can be incorporated within a multiple-use 'integrated ecosystem management' approach. The World Bank initiated the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) in April 2000, to help spur the development of a global carbon market and to 'learn by doing' how to use carbon-purchase transactions across a range of energy-sector technologies (and some forestry applications) to achieve environmentally credible and cost-effective emissions reductions that benefit developing countries and economies in transition. Building on the success of the PCF ($145 million raised from public and private-sector investors), The World Bank expects to launch two new funds in 2002: the Biocarbon Fund and the Community Development Carbon Fund. These funds will target synergies between carbon markets and objectives such as biodiversity conservation, combating desertification and small-scale community-driven development. Experience from the PCF shows that developing countries can have a comparative advantage in supplying this global market, as emissions reductions can be achieved in developing countries in the range of $345 per ton of CO2 equivalent, compared with a marginal abatement cost of $10-$15 per ton of CO2 equivalent in most countries within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, realizing this economic potential over the next decade, and targeting the market to the rural poor, will require substantial assistance with project development and government legal and institutional capacity building. Specific needs include raising awareness of the potential of carbon markets at all levels (particularly in energy and land-use sectors), clarifying property rights, particularly in the case of communally held land and resources, ensuring the existence of an attractive investment climate, eliminating policies that create perverse incentives and constraints, and mitigating logistical, political and 'reputational' risks that could deter private-sector investors. It will also be necessary to find ways to reconcile the short-term needs of the rural poor and the typically long-term revenue stream associated with carbon sequestration.

AB This paper contains an analysis of the technical options in agriculture for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and increasing sinks, arising from three distinct mechanisms:
   (i) increasing carbon sinks in soil organic matter and above-ground biomass;
   (ii) avoiding carbon emissions from farms by reducing direct and indirect energy use; and
   (iii) increasing renewable-energy production from biomass that either substitutes for consumption of fossil fuels or replaces inefficient burning of fuelwood or crop residues, and so avoids carbon emissions, together with use of biogas digesters and improved cookstoves.
   We then review best-practice sustainable agriculture and renewable-resource-management projects and initiatives in China and India, and analyse the annual net sinks being created by these projects, and the potential market value of the carbon sequestered. We conclude with a summary of the policy and institutional conditions and reforms required for adoption of best sustainability practice in the agricultural sector to achieve the desired reductions in emissions and increases in sinks.
   A review of 40 sustainable agriculture and renewable-resource-management projects in China and India under the three mechanisms estimated a carbon mitigation potential of 64.8 MtC yr(-1) from 5.5 Mha. The potential income for carbon mitigation is $324 million at $5 per tonne of carbon. The potential exists to increase this by orders of magnitude, and so contribute significantly to greenhouse-gas abatement. Most agricultural mitigation options also provide several ancillary benefits. However, there are many technical, financial, policy, legal and institutional barriers to overcome.

AB Since deforestation is one of the sources of carbon dioxide increase in the atmosphere, any measures that prevent or reduce the amount of forest removal are beneficial to the environment and to conservation of biodiversity. In recent years, there has been considerable research on the value of standing forests and many researchers have promoted the management of tropical forests as the best type of land use. On the other hand, the enormous diversity is a serious obstacle to management and use of tropical rainforest. A single hectare of forest can have up to 306 species of trees of 10 cm diameter or more. Here we present a brief review of some of the research and programmes that have tried to promote the use and conservation of tropical forest without clear felling. The sustainable use of the standing forest has usually been promoted as a means of species conservation; however, it is also a way to maintain the carbon fixed in the ecosystem. Here we review some of the pros and cons of extraction of non-timber forest products.

AB Concern over the ever more rapid and widespread losses of biodiversity has instigated various remedial actions: whether in situ conservation, such as the establishment of protected areas, or ex situ, such as the conservation of germplasm in gene banks. In the past, such activities were funded and managed by the public sector; however, in recent years, public support has declined and this has spawned a growing interest in conservation opportunities that might arise from 'free-market' approaches to sustainable land use and management. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is the key framework for articulating policies and actions on biodiversity; however, progress in developing suitable economic and market incentives for biodiversity conservation and its sustainable use has been slow, with activities such as bioprospecting and ecotourism making some, albeit limited, headway. Given the United Nations Framework for Climate Change or United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC's) high profile within the public and private sectors, there is some potential for using it to help advance CBD objectives and provide the much-needed economic incentives for conservation, through some of the market-based mechanisms presented under the Kyoto Protocol. Significant potential lies in the fact that many 'natural' forests and certain other ecosystems are both major stores of carbon and areas of valuable biodiversity. Thus, any attempt at conserving these areas has the potential to yield both carbon and biodiversity benefits. So far, however, the conservation of natural forests is not included in the Kyoto Protocol's definition of sinks. Instead the creation of sinks-through the establishment of fast-growing monocultures-may well lead to biodiversity losses, especially if partly degraded lands axe cleared for this purpose. If real progress is to be made, our understanding of the relationship between land use and biodiversity benefits needs to be improved, and more appropriate proxies for biodiversity need to be developed. At the same time, we need to have a clear understanding of the precise nature of the potential synergies and be more able to identify possible jointaction opportunities that exist between the UNFCCC, the CBD and the Convention on Combating Desertification and other international trade and economic agreements.

DE environmental law; UN Climate Convention; UNFCCC; Kyoto Protocol; carbon
   sinks; emissions trading
AB The controversy over the issues of carbon sinks and emissions trading nearly aborted the Kyoto Protocol. The lengthy and intense debate over the roles that each are to play under the Protocol and the consequent political compromises has resulted in a complex set of provisions and an arcane nomenclature. The distinction drawn between the use of carbon sinks in developed countries under Joint Implementation and their use in developing countries under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a particular source of intricacy. It is at least arguable that key elements of the compromises reached at COP-6 and COP-7 in this regard are inconsistent with the terms of the Protocol and are ultra vires the Convention on Climate Change. This is a source of both uncertainty and potential legal challenge.
   Not only do the recent decisions create needless complexity, they also clearly discriminate against developing nations. Among the recent political compromises is the creation of a third type of non-bankable but tradeable unit with respect to forest management, which is only available to Annex I countries. The result is an anomalous one in which a variety of otherwise equivalent carbon credits can be generated under three different regimes including one, the CDM, that is subject to an elaborate regulatory overlay that discriminates against carbon sequestration by developing countries. For example, complying developed countries can essentially self-certify sequestration projects. In contrast, projects in developing countries must obtain prior approval from a subsidiary body, the CDM Executive Board, mandated to require detailed information and impose substantive and procedural hurdles not required or imposed by its companion body, the Article 6 Supervisory Committee on Joint Implementation Projects. The parallel and related debate over the third 'flexibility' mechanism, emissions trading, compounded the complexity of an already asymmetric and bifurcated system.
   The new requirements devoted to 'environmental integrity' not only have raised the costs of compliance of developing country projects but also virtually ignore the fundamental principle of sustainable economic growth and development embodied in the Convention and related international agreements. The regulations for carbon sinks now being formulated at Conferences of the Parties will have a significant impact on their use worldwide. Of key importance, in addition to their successful integration of carbon sinks and emissions trading into other international treaties, is the development of practically achievable and objective standards and an efficient and transparent approval process consistent with the terms of the Convention and the Protocol. Most important of all is a rebalancing that restores the primacy of addressing climate change in the context of sustainable economic growth and development.

It also describes the steps being taken to define and launch pilot carbon markets in North America and Europe and reviews the key issues related to incorporating carbon sequestration into an emissions-trading market.
   There is an emerging consensus to employ market mechanisms to help address the threat of human-induced climate changes. Carbon-trading markets are now in development around the world. A UK market is set to launch in 2002, and the European Commission has called for a 2005 launch of an European Union (EU)-wide market, and a voluntary carbon market is now in formation in North America.
   These markets represent an initial step in resolving a fundamental problem in defining and implementing appropriate policy actions to address climate change. Policymakers currently suffer from two major information gaps: the economic value of potential damages arising from climate changes are highly uncertain, and there is a lack of reliable information on the cost of mitigating GHGs. These twin gaps significantly reduce the quality of the climate policy debate.
   The Chicago Climate Exchange, for which the authors serve as lead designers, is intended to provide an organized carbon-trading market involving energy, industry and carbon sequestration in forests and farms. Trading among these diverse sectors will provide price discovery that will help clarify the cost of combating climate change when a wide range of mitigation options is employed. By closing the information gap on mitigation costs, society and policymakers will be far better prepared to identify and implement optimal policies for managing the risks associated with climate change.
   Establishment of practical experience in providing tradeable credits for carbon-absorbing land-use practices, especially reforestation and conservation management of agricultural soils, will also help demonstrate the viability of a new tool for financing activities that improve water quality, support biodiversity and constitute important elements of long-term sustainability in land-use management.

AB It is suggested that the major factor in avoiding the development of anthelmintic resistance is the percentage of worms that do not encounter the anthelmintics (worms in refugia). This in turn is determined by the numbers of larvae on pasture, the percentage of animals treated and whether any stages in the host can avoid the action of anthelmintic. To maintain anthelmintic efficacy the percentage of worms in refugia must be sufficiently large. In cattle, this should involve treating only first-year animals and using a different pasture each year for calves. For sheep, only animals that have to be treated should be dosed with anthelmintic and clean grazing strategies that involve the use of anthelmintics should be avoided. For horses, reliance should be placed on the removal of faeces from pasture and only treating when the animals' condition requires it. Without a change in anthelmintic use there is the likelihood of increasing numbers of cases for which no anthelmintic is effective and animal welfare may be compromised.

AB From the late 1980s, government policies and actions have influenced the remarkable rise in Ireland's economic fortunes. Will Irish business be able to maintain this outstanding performance in the face of a world economic slowdown, and problems brought on by success itself? These questions of sustainability are examined, alongside the implications for management of public policy and of foreign-owned and indigenous Irish enterprises.
   The model of the 'flexible developmental state'(FDS) is applied to Ireland.' New forms of industrial organization-like transnational networks with their fluid global movements of money, information, and resources-are especially appropriate in the FDS. The FDS government plays a key role in integrating local and global business in three ways. One is to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and then build local networks of production and innovation around the subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies (MNCs). FDI, in the context of a global economy, was the catalyst that animated the developmental process in 1990s Ireland. The second FDS thrust is to cultivate indigenous networks of innovation and encourage them to internationalize. The third element of the FDS is the creation of a stable macroeconomic and financial environment that fostered Irish adaptation to, and participation in, the global econorny.(2) The 'flexible' component of the FDS is that the Irish government, working through state agencies, shaped the organizational cultures and capabilities of both indigenous firms and MNC subsidiaries, but without directly dictating their activities.

AB Agroforestry is considered to be a promising alternative to short-fallow shifting cultivation or other monocropping systems. An on-farm experiment was established in 1996 in northern Viet Nam to examine the contribution of the leguminous bush Tephrosia candida (Roxb.) D.C. as a fallow or hedgerow species and as a mulch producer to improve nutrient cycling and prevent nutrient losses by erosion. The systems tested were upland rice monocropping (Mono), natural fallow (NaFa), fallow of Tephrosia (TepFa), hedgerow intercropping with upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) and internal mulching using pruned Tephrosia biomass (TepAl), and upland rice with external mulching using Tephrosia biomass (TepMu). Over two cropping seasons, from April 1996 to April 1998, nutrients recycled and inputs and exports were recorded, as well as changes in C-, N- and P-pools, and in pH in the 0-5 cm topsoil layer.
   The Tephrosia systems (TepFa, TepAl, TepMu) prevented nutrient losses by erosion effectively. Compared to the NaFa system, the TepFa system accumulated 34% more N in the above-ground plant parts and increased topsoil N by 20%, probably due to N-fixation. There was a trend that the less labile P-pools (NaOH-P) were reallocated into the more labile P-pools (Bicarb-P) in the soil of the TepFa system. Burning released significant amounts of the inorganic P-pools in both the NaFa and TepFa systems and this effect seemed to be more pronounced in the TepFa than in the NaFa. Organic input to crop export ratios for N and P were >1 in the TepAl and TepMu treatments. This was due to a sufficient quantity and quality of the Tephrosia mulching material. However, moderately labile NaOH-extractable organic P seemed to be depleted in the topsoil due to high P uptake in the TepMu treatment. Thus, nutrient cycling and nutrient balances were improved under the Tephrosia systems. But for long-term P sustainability, there is a belief that a combined use of mulching and mineral P fertiliser is needed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Assessment of the sustainability of alternatives to conventional uses of agricultural land, viz. organic systems and afforestation should include consideration of any effects on trace gas budgets. Nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes and controlling soil properties were measured in an organic lcy-arable rotation in north-east Scotland on a sandy loam. N2O fluxes were monitored in the ley and arable phases and in organic permanent grass (Lolium perenne) located nearby throughout the 3-year phase duration. Gas fluxes in woodland that had been converted from arable for 1 or 6 years were also measured in both north-east and south-east Scotland on sandy loam to clay loam soils. The climate is maritime and variable with annual rainfall between 800 and 900 mm. Within the organic rotation, differences in N2O fluxes between the ley and arable phases were less marked than in conventional agriculture. Although this was mainly because grassland emissions were low, some losses from the arable component were also relatively high. Seasonal rainfall had a major influence on cumulative emissions of N2O, including the first year after conversion from ley to arable. In the short term, changing land use from arable to woodland increased CH4 oxidation rates and decreased N2O emissions, though both these rates were also influenced by seasonal weather. Afforestation of agricultural land appears to be more beneficial to trace gas exchange than conversion to organic production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Resilience and sustainable development: Building adaptive capacity in a

SO AMBIO

DT Article
ID DYNAMICS; SHIFTS
AB Emerging recognition of two fundamental errors underpinning past polices for natural resource issues heralds awareness of the need for a worldwide fundamental change in thinking and in practice of environmental management. The first error has been an implicit assumption that ecosystem responses to human use are linear predictable and controllable. The second has been an assumption that human and natural systems can be treated independently. However, evidence that has been accumulating in diverse regions all over the world suggests that natural and social systems behave in nonlinear ways, exhibit marked thresholds in their dynamics, and that social-ecological systems act as strongly coupled, complex and evolving integrated systems. This article is a summary of a report prepared on behalf of the Environmental Advisory Council to the Swedish Government, as input to the process of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa in 26 August 4 September 2002. We use the concept of resilience-the capacity to buffer change, learn and develop-as a framework for understanding how to sustain and enhance adaptive capacity in a complex world of rapid transformations. Two useful tools for resilience-building in social-ecological systems are structured scenarios and active adaptive management. These tools require and facilitate a social context with flexible and open institutions and multi-level governance systems that allow for learning and increase adaptive capacity without foreclosing future development options.

TI Human impacts on the tundra-taiga zone dynamics: The case of the Russian
   lesotundra
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB The tundra-taiga zone is considered not only as a natural ecotone, but as a unique fringe zone with socioeconomic peculiarities. This holistic approach enables us to analyze several significant types of human impacts (industrial impacts and those associated with renewable resources development, including traditional reindeer herding and human settlements) and their role in the displacement of the lesotundra zone. In Russia, there is much evidence of deforestation and ecosystem degradation in different regions of the lesotundra zone and the northern taiga which borders the lesotundra zone. One indicator of this is that in the Archangelsk region and the Komi Republic, the observed current southern border of the lesotundra zone lies 40-100 km to the south of the southern boundary of the Protection Belt of Pretundra Forests, established in 1959. Human impacts also displace the northern boundary of the lesotundra zone (the boundary with the tundra zone) to the south. As a result, according to published estimations, the total area of human-made tundra and lesotundra stretching from the Kola Peninsula to Chukotka, is c. 470-500 000 km(2). The increases in man-made tundra lead to negative consequences for the sociocultural sustainability of the lesotundra zone, a decrease in the quality of life (notably for permanent residents and native people and increases in mortality and depopulation. It cannot be predicted with any certainty that climate warming in the tundra-taiga zone will lead to a northward movement of the boreal forest treeline. We need also to consider the human impacts discussed in this article, which may actually lead to a southward movement of the lesotundra zone.

AB The repellency of potted plants against the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto Giles was quantified in experimental huts under semi-field conditions inside a screen-walled greenhouse. Ocimum americanum Linnaeus (Labiatae), Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae), and Lippia uckambensis Spreng (Verbenaceae) repelled at an average of 39.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 29.6-48.4%), 32.4% (95% CI = 19.7-43.1%), and 33.3% (95% CI = 21.5-43.3%) of the mosquitoes, respectively (P < 0.0001 for all treatments). This was determined by logistic regression, allowing for variations associated with different bait hosts, sampling huts, and replicate test nights. In contrast, Ocimum kilimandscharicum Guerke (Labiatae), Ocimum suave Willd. (Labiatae), Corymbia citriodora Hook (Myrtaceae), Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae), Tagetes minuta L. (Asteraceae), and Hyptis suaveolens Poit. (Lamiaceae) did not significantly repel mosquitoes. The combination of O. americanum with either L. camara or L. uckambensis repelled 31.6% (95% CI = 19.7-41.7%) and 45.2% (95% CI = 34.7-54.0%) of the mosquitoes, respectively (P < 0.0001 for both treatments). This study is the first to show that live intact plants can reduce domestic exposure to malaria vector mosquitoes. As such, they may represent a new, sustainable and readily applicable malaria vector control tool for incorporation into integrated vector management programs.

AB Since fuel assemblies represent the connecting link between the fuel cycle and the nuclear power plant, fuel assembly design and manufacture as well as fuel management have substantial influence upon the overall nuclear plant economics. A major factor of development has been the increase of the discharge burnup. The economic effect of burnup increase essentially depends on the burnup level and on the approach to the disposal costs. Burnup extension by increasing U235 enrichment has been supplemented by measures to improve the fuel utilization by enhancement of the neutron economy. Condition precedent for all further development is ensuring the maximum possible degree of reliability of the fuel assemblies. Advanced fuel assemblies and integrated high capacity fuel management codes and methods of Framatome ANP, developed on the basis of broad long term experience, combine innovative features with the objective of achieving best overall economy and sustainability.

AB African wildlife populations and their habitats are dwindling outside of state-protected areas due to escalating human demands on natural resources, while the effective enforcement of conservation legislation is impracticable across most of the continent. A particular conservation crisis is looming in southern Africa, where extensive wildlife areas are rapidly giving way to subsistence agropastoralism. The concept of community-based wildlife management (CBWM) has been embraced by donor agencies as a hopeful solution in areas where adequate wildlife resources persist and agricultural potential is marginal. The conservation value of CBWM depends, however, on communities having specific information to evaluate the sustainable benefits of wildlife in comparison with alternative landuse options. Furthermore, simple but scientifically sound monitoring procedures are required to ensure that the offtake from wildlife populations is kept within sustainable limits. This paper draws together key ecological issues of relevance to CBWM in southern African savannas and identifies topics requiring further attention from ecologists. The aim is to assist conservation and development agencies in providing prompt and appropriate technical support to communities in areas where opportunities for CBWM still exist but could soon be foreclosed.

AB Harnessing solar energy to grow algal biomass on wastewater nutrients could provide a holistic solution to nutrient management problems on dairy farms. The production of algae from a portion of manure nutrients to replace high-protein feed supplements which are often imported (along with considerable nutrients) onto the farm could potentially link consumption and supply of on-farm nutrients. The objective of this research was to assess the ability of benthic freshwater algae to recover nutrients from dairy manure and to evaluate nutrient uptake rates and dry matter/crude protein yields in comparison to a conventional cropping system. Benthic algae growth chambers were operated in semi-batch mode by continuously recycling wastewater and adding manure inputs daily. Using total nitrogen (TN) loading rates of 0.64-1.03 g m(-2) d(-1), the dried algal yields were 5.3-5.5 g m(-2) d(-1). The dried algae contained 1.5-2.1% P and 4.9-7.1% N. At a TN loading rate of 1.03 g m(-2) d(-1), algal biomass contained 7.1% N compared to only 4.9% N at a TN loading rate of 0.64 g m(-2) d(-1). In the best case, algal biomass had a crude protein content of 44%, compared to a typical corn silage protein content of 7%. At a dry matter yield of 5.5 g m(-2) d(-1), this is equivalent to an annual N uptake rate of 1430 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Compared to a conventional corn/rye rotation, such benthic algae production rates would require 26% of the land area requirements for equivalent N uptake rates and 23%, of the land area requirements on a P uptake basis. Combining conventional cropping systems with an algal treatment system could facilitate more efficient crop production and farm nutrient management, allowing dairy operations to be environmentally sustainable on fewer acres.

AB There are strong data supporting the clinical efficacy of ionizing radiation therapy in the treatment of extracranial cavernous angiomas; no unusual complications occur. There is no a priori reason to anticipate a high rate of complications following radiosurgery for brain cavernous angiomas and yet equivalent dose prescriptions (site, size and target volume) to those used for AVM are associated with a considerably higher complication rate. The observed sub-acute reactions sometimes recover with steroid therapy. Previous authors have not sought to define the aetiological basis of this observation. Haemosiderin staining of the fringe of normal brain tissue surrounding the cavernoma is a unique feature of these brain lesions and the potential radiosensitizing properties of this iron based substance, for which there is a considerable experimental and clinical observational basis for radiosensitization, are reviewed. These provide good support for the concept that this characteristic feature of brain cavernomas accounts for the higher post radiation reaction/complication rate. Treatment considerations, stemming from these observations, are suggested.

AB Because of the potentially detrimental effects of seed production on adult survivorship and growth, moderate flower harvesting may have little negative impact on population growth of long-lived perennial plants such as Limonium carolinianum (Walter) Britton. We examined this by collecting data on survivorship, growth, and fecundity of an unharvested population over a period of 5 years and conducted a controlled experiment to examine the effect of harvesting on adult survivorship and growth over a 3-year period. Data were summarized in the form of a stage-structured matrix population model with a stochastic element that incorporated year-to-year variation in transition probabilities. Contrary to our original hypothesis, we found that preventing seed set through removal of flowers did not increase adult survivorship or growth. By determining the harvest level that reduced population growth rate to 1.0, we estimated the maximum sustainable harvest level to be 16%, a value that is approximately half that of reported harvest levels on accessible marshes in the study area. In spite of this, the reported harvest levels are unlikely to drive local populations to extinction in the foreseeable future. Providing the adult population size is >100 and harvest levels are <90%, time to local extinction will exceed 100 years. This is a function of the very high survivorship of adults in this species and the fact that harvesting has no negative impact on adult survivorship or growth. However, because of the long preadult phase in this species (8-9 years) and the fact that fecundity of young adults is low, recovery from overharvesting is extremely slow. Adult population size can be reduced to 25% of its original value in 7 years at high harvest levels, but it will take 34 years on average to recover once harvesting is terminated.

ID HISTORY
AB Lakes, of average size 33 ha, occupy a quarter of the surface area of Richards Island, Northwest Territories. Most of the lakes have a central pool deeper than the thickness of winter ice, and many have prominent, shallow, littoral terraces. The relatively warm lake bottoms cause considerable disturbance to the surrounding continuous permafrost. Water and lake-bottom temperatures, the configuration of permafrost, and active-layer thickness were measured at a tundra lake between 1992 and 1997. The lake is oval, 1.6 km long, 800 m wide, and as deep as 13 m. Sandy terraces, covered by less than 1 m of water, extend over 100 m from the shore. The terraces are underlain by permafrost, which terminates almost vertically at their edge. The annual mean temperature measured at lake bottom in the central pool ranged between 1.5degreesC and 4.8degreesC, depending on depth, and between -0.2degreesC and -5degreesC on the terraces, due to differences in snow cover and proximity to the central pool. In consequence, the temperature of permafrost at 7 m depth in the terraces also varied, from -2degreesC near shore to -5degreesC in mid-terrace. The active layer in the terraces was uniformly 1.4 m deep. Geothermal modelling of talik configuration indicates that there is no permafrost beneath the central pool of the lake. The modelling indicates that, under equilibrium conditions, about one quarter of the lakes on Richards Island have taliks that penetrate permafrost, and at least 10-15% of the island is underlain by talik. Short-term climatic changes predicted for the region imply a small increase in summer lake-water temperature and an extension of the open-water season, accompanied by thicker snow cover in winter. Following such changes, with longer freeze-up and warmer terrace temperatures in winter, permafrost may not be sustainable in the lake terraces.

ID SYNGAS PRODUCTION; HYDROCARBONS
AB There is a growing need for hydrogen in processing heavier and dirtier fossil fuels and a future hydrogen economy is widely suggested as the next generation fuel/energy source once fossil fuels diminish in availability. Sustainable fuels are still regarded as too expensive given the large amounts of natural gas and a projected, ample supply of fossil fuels beyond the next twenty-plus years. Today, the steam reforming of hydrocarbons is the most favorable route to H-2. If CO2 sequestration were ever to become widely practiced, fossil fuels would continue to play an important role in the future hydrogen economy.

DE GBFS; fly ash; blended cement; high strength; properties
AB It is one of important measures for the sustainable development of cement industry to utilize industrial wastes. High-strength composite portland cement with a large amount of granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), fly ash and limestone was prepared by separate grinding method, optimizing gypsum and using activators. The total amounts of blending materials are between 45% and 65% and the strength grades of cements reach 525 or even 625 according to Chinese national standard for composite portland cement. Besides setting time and strength, the hydration heat, drying shrinkage and sulfate resistance were also determined. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In literature as well as in environmental reports of many companies of the chemical industry, phrases like "sustainability" and "sustainable development" are proposed strategies for a better future. Such strategies should be the solution for global environmental problems with regard to economic and social needs of the present and future generations. In order to be successful, these strategies should include integrated pollution control as well as responsibility for both resources and products. Examples for new approaches are cleaner production and green chemistry.

AB This paper focuses on the use of net primary productivity (NPP) as a measure of sustainable management in the Mississippi and Ebro deltas. Temporal changes in NPP were quantified for these two deltas based on the aerial coverage of different habitat types, Human appropriation of net primary productivity (HANPP) Was used as a measure of direct human use of deltaic productivity. In both deltas, NPP has declined since 1900 due to a high level of HANPP in the Ebro and wetland loss in the Mississippi. In the Mississippi, NPP declined from 2500 g.m(-2).yr(-1) in 1900 to 2000 g.m 2-yr(-1) in 1990, with a decline to 1750 g.m(-2)-yr(-1) predicted by 2050. In the Ebro, total system NPP has increased from 700 to 1000 g.m(-2).yr(-1) due to subsidized agricultural production, mostly of rice. High HANPP of 35% reduces remaining NPP to 600 g.m (2).yr(-1). The natural energies and anthropogenic subsidies that maintain natural and human-modified deltaic ecosystems are analyzed, Elimination or reduction of important pulsing cycles has,, led to environmental deterioration and higher economic costs and necessitates high levels of Subsidies,, Incorporating natural energies is the best way to manage deltas sustainably, The use of wetlands for wastewater treatment and river diversions are presented as examples.

AB We explored the long-term effect of various management strategies for a mountain ungulate, the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). living in a mosaic of protected reserves and hunting areas. The chamois occurs in the French Alps at high densities within protected reserve,, but is heavily hunted in the surrounding areas, Extensive demographic studies were used for developing a model of the population in the reserve area, as well as for the hunting area. The chamois in the reserve has value for tourism and conservation. whereas the chamois outside the reserve has mainly hunting value. Optimal management of the overall system consisting of reserve and hunting areas depends on the management objective: either a simple maximization of the value of hunted chamois, or the value of hunted chamois together with the value of the chamois in the reserve. We explored how optimal harvesting strategies are affected by the relative hunting values of the sexes and the relative nonconsumptive values of the chamois inside the reserve. A male-biased, sex-specific harvesting rate was generally found to be optimal. a bias which was larger when the value of the chamois in the reserve was included. Movement rates and sex ratio play critical roles in such systems, and should therefore be studied more than they typically are. We suggest experimental approaches to test the critical parameters of the model.

AB Sustainable use is central to contemporary conservation policy as espoused by many of the major wildlife conservation organizations and is one indicator of a shift in policy away from exclusionary practices restricting access toward more inclusive ones that involve some form of resource use, As with many policies, sustainable use in theory may encounter problems in transition to practice. Problems arise based on the biology of the species or system in question and on the dynamics of the economic, social, political, and cultural system,, that guide or regulate use. As a result of these problems. and of other moral and philosophical objections, opponents of applying the concept of sustainable use to wildlife are many. Based on in-depth interviews conducted with 38 conservation experts in 1995. this paper examines the views of a specific group of conservation experts (those interested in marine turtle biology and/or conservation) on the commercial consumptive use of marine turtles and their eggs. Results reveal a variety of positions on use, all of which were justified on scientific grounds. Key characteristics distinguishing between interviewees were how they dealt with uncertainty and their assumptions about economics and commerce. While denving the role of "other" issues in influencing their own opinions, experts saw opposing views as influenced by emotions. Beyond the immediate world of marine turtle conservation, results presented and conclusions reached may be indicative of the wider challenges posed by commercial use of wildlife, regardless of the species in question.

AB The copper flows and stocks of the European economy are investigated and evaluated over a 1-year period in the early 1990s. The method applied is statistical entropy, which quantifies the distribution pattern of a substance (e.g. copper) caused by a system (e.g. political economy). Contemporary copper management can be defined as a simple chain of four processes: production of refined copper from ore; manufacture and fabrication of products and goods; consumption, utilization and storage (infrastructure) of goods; and separation of copper from waste for recycling and finally, landfilling (waste management). Relevant recycling streams (new and old scrap) within or between production, manufacture, and waste management processes also characterize the system. Throughout the life cycle of copper the statistical entropy varies considerably among the above-mentioned processes and covers about 50% of the possible range between total dissipation and maximal concentration of the total throughput of copper. Nevertheless, present copper management does not show a clear entropy trend across its life cycle. The system as a whole neither dissipates nor concentrates copper significantly with regard to the original ore. Even a more optimized waste management system with higher recycling efficiency could not significantly change this finding since today's copper flows into waste management are small compared to the consumption of copper. The relatively limited impact on the entropy trend of contemporary waste management may increase in the future because the infrastructure, which has been established over the last few decades, will be continuously renewed and replaced. As a result of these larger waste streams, decreasing overall entropy trends will be realizable, provided efficient recycling technologies are applied. This indicates the possibility for long-term feasible (perhaps sustainable) copper management. The entropy approach improves our understanding of industrial metabolism and is a useful decision support and design tool, since complex systems can thereby be quantified by a single metric per substance.

AB We collected two long-term datasets documenting the trade in two endemic wild pig species in North Sulawesi, Indonesia-a 6-year survey of the end market and records of all transactions by a wild pig dealer during three periods over a 10-year period. Analysis of these data show that the number of babirusas (an endangered, endemic, protected species of wild pig) on sale in the end market is strongly influenced by law enforcement activities, although dealer habituation is reducing the effects of these interventions. We demonstrate that dealers drove significantly farther to buy wild pigs, paid more for them and bought fewer in 1997 than 1988. These trends are consistent with resource depletion, but we show that they are also likely to be caused by market changes. We suggest that long-term, spatially explicit studies are important for the assessment of the sustainability of the wildlife trade, as they provide the potential for disentangling the influences of market dynamics from population declines, and thereby assist in interpreting changes in prices and quantities on sale in end markets.

AB The Nama Karoo region of South Africa is characterized by low (similar to 200 mm) and variable annual rainfall, which results in grass and shrub biomass production, which is low and highly variable in space and time. These characteristics of Nama Karoo rangelands challenge the ability of the region's livestock farmers to make a sustainable living. In this paper we model a farming system, which attempts to create an environmental buffer of forage reserves by restricting access of livestock within numerous small camps. This is achieved by using a multi-camp infrastructure, which forces the livestock to remove non-selectively most of the available forage within a camp. Non-selective grazing in small camps allows for long rest periods of each camp, and these rest periods build up forage reserves for the dry years, A computer model of a 7000 ha farm was used to simulate rainfall and above-ground plant biomass accumulation, and to test the economic merits of investing large sums of money in multi-camp infrastructure. The model shows that 60 camps or more allows time for forage reserves to build up, but that more than 150 camps becomes too costly. Our simulations suggest that given 250 mm yr(-1) rainfall and the agriculturally recommended stocking rate, camp numbers of 60-80 provide higher profits than other camp numbers investigated. However, with higher rainfall and more animals, increasing camp numbers up to 150 is economically viable and more ecologically desirable. At low rainfall (< 200 mm yr(-1)) production is too low to warrant investment in multi-camp infrastructure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We develop three quantitative indicators of the physical/biological aspect of sustainability. They are based on depletion of resources, dependence on outside subsidies, and disruption of natural cycles. We apply the indicators to an agricultural county in Kansas, using energy, water, soil, and nitrogen as numeraires. 9/10 of Chase County is dedicated to range beef cattle grazing and 1/10 to row-cropping and confinement animal feeding. Range production is relatively non-depleting, independent, and non-disrupting. Cropping is more depleting, dependent, and disrupting, but comparable with that in other agricultural areas. We discuss how this pattern, mediated by absentee land-holding and low human population density, trades off against economic income. With the exception of energy, all analyses are only in terms of direct flows (e.g. actual amounts crossing the county boundary). For energy, we also estimate the energy consumed elsewhere to produce imported non-energy goods and services. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B,V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE sustainable consumption; consumption; sustainability; lifestyles;

AB Postmodern explanations of consumer behaviour stress social and psychological factors to the neglect of explanations based on structural issues such as the working life conditions which favour a work-and-spend lifestyle, the conditions of urban living or the effects of pervasive marketing. This paper argues that consumers may not be so keen and willing but are rather locked-in by circumstances. Some of these circumstances are deliberately created by other interests, and a policy to limit consumption must look for adequate means over a large and varied field. In the end shorter working hours may be an important key to a more sustainable future. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With 2% of the world's forests and 17% of Canada's forested land, Ontario plays a major role in maintaining Canada's forests and managing them sustainably. Ontario is developing a set of criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management (SFM) to aid in conservation and sustainable management of its temperate and boreal (BO) forests. The criteria and indicators are intended to provide a framework for describing and assessing processes of SFM at a regional scale; and to improve the information available to the public and decision-makers. This paper describes three ecological indicators, evaluated using a carbon (C) budget model, a forest inventory database, and disturbance records to assess long-term sustainability of Ontario's forest ecosystems based on the environmental conditions of the past 70 years. Results suggest that total net primary productivity (NPP) of Ontario's forest ecosystems increased from 1925 to 1975 and then decreased between 1975 and 1990; Ontario's forest ecosystems acted as a C sink between 1920 and 1980, and a C source from 1981 to 1990, mainly due to decreased average forest age and NPP caused by increased ecosystem disturbance (e.g. fire, insect and disease infestations, harvesting) since 1975. Current estimates from this analysis suggest that there is significant potential for Ontario's forests to function as C sinks by reducing ecosystem disturbances and increasing growth and storage of C in the young forests throughout the province.

AB A sustainable forest management system requires that a balance must be reached between ecosystem nutrient losses and gains in the course of a rotation. In order to determine the influence of stand characteristics (species composition, density, site potential productivity), method of forest harvesting (stem-only versus whole-tree) as well as rotation length on nutrient losses induced by biomass harvesting, a geochemical balance (nutrient inputs minus outputs) was computed from published information and forest inventory databases for the southern portion of the boreal forest of Quebec. Losses were compared with potential nutrient gains that varied according to soil types. We provided a tool for assessing the risk of having a negative nutrient budget (outputs > inputs) that forest managers can use with information that is already available to them. This exercise was conducted for five commercial tree species, namely paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), aspen (Populus trenmloides Michx.), balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.), grouped into four site indexes and three stand density classes. Strong differences in nutrient exportation in biomass appeared between stands of different compositions as well as between stands of the same species but of different classes of productivity or density. The most nutrient-demanding tree species were trembling aspen and balsam fir. As expected, whole-tree harvesting caused a greater drain on nutrient reserves than stem-only harvesting, but this effect varied strongly with tree species and was greatest for balsam fir and lowest for jack pine. Harvesting the forest before or after the age of financial maturity, which might be desirable under some circumstances, generally created a lesser nutrient drain but this was at the expense of biomass production. Aspen was an exception to this rule showing a greater nutrient drain for stands harvested prior to the age of financial maturity. Implications for the development of indicators of sustainable forestry and for future research are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The multi-criteria evaluation of new and renewable technologies demonstrates the potential analysis of complex systems. Every energy system under consideration is an entity by itself, defined by the respective number of parameters which are deterministically interrelated according to the physical laws. Sustainability indicators take into account the economic and environmental resources parameters. This paper presents selection of criteria and options for the new and renewable energy technologies assessment based on the analysis and synthesis of parameters under the information deficiency method. In order to present an evaluation of the new energy technologies, a number of options featuring some of the characteristics measured by the selected sustainability indicators are taken into consideration. For each option under consideration, the sustainability indicators are defined in order to verify their rating under the specific constraints and to obtain the generalised index of sustainability rating of all options. The aim of this paper is to define energy indicators used in the assessment of energy systems which meet the sustainability criterion. In this respect, the following indicators are taken into consideration: energy resources, environment capacity, social indicators and economic indicators. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

DT Article
AB The National Assembly for Wales is engaged in the preparation of a national spatial planning framework to provide a context for sustainable development and environmental quality. This paper reports on research undertaken for the Assembly on the preparation of the spatial planning framework and identifies the initial stages in that process. The research itself draws upon a study of policy documents relevant to Wales, a comparative review of strategic spatial planning practices in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe, and the identification of the expectations of stakeholders for the framework. The paper illustrates how the concept of 'spatial planning' is being addressed and defined in the process of preparing the framework. The material provides an interesting insight into the emergent practice of spatial planning in the United Kingdom through a case study of Wales with wider relevance for spatial planning activity in Europe.

SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-GOVERNMENT AND POLICY

ID CONSTRUCTION; VALUATION
AB This paper is grounded in VALSE (VALuation for Sustainable Environment) methodology, which seeks to understand the ways that concerned people express the 'values' of environment. In our research we aim to assess the importance of maintaining these values, and to test the integration of the valuation statements within a real decisionmaking process. The study of the combination of institutional analysis and democratic perspective in land-use conflict in the Canary Islands was used for such assessment and testing. An institutional analysis was carried out in order to account for recent changes in the notion of landownership (through the introduction of environmental and landscape values) and corresponding changes in the institutional framework. A democratic perspective was applied in order to include public expression, debate, and deliberation as valid ways of generating and exchanging knowledge, and as a means of reaching a satisfactory environmental decision. The problem of land use associated with the environmental valuation issue can be adequately understood by studying the social processes responsible for the different land uses. To think in terms of social processes for environmental valuation of the landscape implies concern over a process of collective understanding: the ways values and interests are formed and the way the conflict gives rise to different notions and rules of the game, and to different manners of conceiving and implementing decisionmaking processes and solutions to environmental problems.

AB This paper considers the hydrogeological simulation of groundwater movement in karstic regions using a hydrological modelling system (SHETRAN) which has been adapted for modelling flow in karstic aquifers. Flow and transport through karstic aquifers remains poorly understood, yet quantitative hydrogeological models are essential for developing and implementing groundwater protection policies. The new model has been developed and used within the STALAGMITE (Sustainable Management of Groundwater in Karstic Environments) project, funded by the European Commission. The SHETRAN model is physically based insofar as most of the parameters have some physical meaning. The SHETRAN model represents all of the key processes in the hydrological cycle, including subsurface flow in the saturated and unsaturated zones, surface flow over the ground surface and in channels, rainfall interception by vegetation canopies, evapotranspiration, snow-pack development and snowmelt. The modifications made to SHETRAN to simulate karstic aquifers are (1) the coupling of a pipe network model to a variably saturated, three-dimensional groundwater component (the VSS-NET component), to simulate flow under pressure in saturated conduits; (2) the coupling of surface water features (e.g. sinking streams or "ponors", and spring discharges) to the conduit system; (3) the addition of a preferential "bypass" flow mechanism to represent vertical infiltration through a high-conductivity epikarst zone. Lastly, a forward particle tracking routine has been developed to trace the path of hypothetical particles with matrix and pipe flow to springs or other discharge points. This component allows the definition of groundwater protection zones around a source for areas of the catchment (watershed) which are vulnerable to pollution from non-point sources (agriculture and forestry).

AB A study was conducted to examine the variation in fish farm sediment quality with varying organic carbon input in the form of feed. In order to elucidate the seasonal variation in farm sediment quality, relation between seasonal organic carbon input, temperature and sediment quality was studied. The sediment ignition loss, redox potential and acid volatile sulfide sulfur (AVS-S) content showed a correlation with annual organic carbon input. The seasonal AVS-S content showed a significant correlation with the seasonal organic carbon input as well as temperature. Multiple regression analysis revealed that both of these factors explicated 80% of the seasonal variation in AVS-S content. Although redox conditions of the sediment could also be correlated with both the organic carbon input and temperature, the latter seemed to have a greater control. Thus, the farm sediment quality could be directly related to the annual organic carbon input to the fish farm under similar hydrographic conditions. Acid volatile sulfide sulfur content exhibited a significant correlation with both the annual as well as the seasonal organic carbon input. Therefore, AVS-S content proved to be a fairly simple and better indicator for monitoring the fish farm environment for effective farm management and sustainable aquaculture. Importance of size of pellets as a factor affecting the feed input-sediment quality relation is also demonstrated in the present study.

AB The K, Mg, and P fluxes as well as the growth dynamics of the important timber tree Carapa guianensis Aubl. were compared in a monoculture and in an enrichment plantation on a "terra firme" site near Manaus, central Amazon.
   During the 7 years experimental period, the K, Mg, and P fluxes and the balance of the soil were quantified for monthly intervals. The nutrient input into the soil was calculated from the wet and dry deposition as well as from litter decomposition. The nutrient output out of the soil was calculated from the net nutrient uptake of the vegetation and the nutrient leaching from the soil. The growth dynamics of the planted trees were studied by means of biomass data obtained from dendrometric measurements and total tree harvesting.
   After 7 years of growth, the K, Mg, and P balance of the soil of the enrichment plantation was stabilised, whereas a significant deficit of the K, Mg, and P balance of the soil of the monoculture became obvious, caused by high leaching of K and Mg from the soil and low litter decomposition rates. Due to strong competition during the first 5 years of growth, a reduced biomass production of the planted Carapa trees was found in the enrichment plantation compared to trees grown in the monoculture. After that period tree growth was strongly reduced in the monoculture, whereas after 7 years, growth of Carapa grown in the enrichment plantation was still steady.
   From this study, it was concluded that due to the balanced K, P, and Mg input and output of the soil and more sustainable growth of the planted trees in the enrichment plantation compared to the traditional monoculture, the cultivation of Carapa for timber production is recommended in diverse plantations, such as enrichment plantations on this study site.

AB Pterocarpus angolensis D.C. is one of the most valuable indigenous timber species on the African continent south of the equator. Because of its high value, it is actively sought after in a number of countries, and wild populations are diminishing. However, attempts at artificial germination and growth trials have yielded poor results, thus, emphasis needs to be placed on sustainable management of existing populations. Success of in situ management will be enhanced if based on reliable data and knowledge regarding the growth patterns of this species within specific localities and countries. Such comprehensive data are lacking for several countries, including South Africa. This paper presents empirical data on a number of studies investigating the growth patterns of P. angolensis in the central lowveld savannas of South Africa, including phenology, annual diameter increment, size class structure, size of reproductive maturity, and morphometric relationships. The size class profile indicated that there was adequate recruitment of P. angolensis, but with constricted through growth from the suffrutex stage to the sapling stage. A small proportion of individuals attained reproductive maturity at 8 cm diameter, but most were bigger. All stems were reproductively mature by 26 cm diameter. This is below the minimum size for harvesting which is dictated by the need for a well developed heartwood. Annual growth was strongly related to stem size and rainfall during the growing season. Basal area increment of small stems was approximately four times greater than mature stems, and declined with increasing stem size. Over the 6-year-period and across all stem sizes, mean diameter increment was 4.5 mm per year. This rate is towards the lower end of the range of reported growth rates from other countries, and poses particular challenges for the sustainable management of this species in South African savannas.

AB We investigate the ecological status of the standing crop of high-value tree species in coastal scarp forest of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. We compare resource availability, distribution and use in several forests that are under state and community management. Species suitable for harvesting were identified using a simple linear-programming model based on the frequency and scale of regeneration (grain) of the tree species.
   Twenty high-value tree species were widely used. Nine species were apparently over-exploited and absent from community forests. Tree densities were higher in state forests than community forest. Size-class distribution profiles for all species, except Harpephyllum caffrum and Heywoodia lucens, displayed the characteristic inverse J-shaped distribution that generally indicates stable populations. Tree species varied in their spatial scale of recruitment, but were mostly intermediate- to coarse-grained. Two fine-grained species in state forest (Englerophytum natalense and Millettia grandis) and only one species in community forest (E. natalense) had densities that could potentially sustain current levels of exploitation.
   The prevailing tenurial system (i.e. state or community forest), the tree species and category of stem size (dbh) used, all affected tree harvesting off-take levels. Trees in the 10-20 cm diameter size-class (poles) were most harvested. Harvesting levels of pole-sized stems were more influenced by tree size than species, were significantly greater in community than state forests, and could be explained by the closer proximity of households to community ((x) over bar = 1.5 km) than state forests ((x) over bar = 3.2 km). Given the willingness of communities distant from forests to plant multipurpose indigenous trees, there is the potential for strengthening community forestry, and thus rural development, via forestry interventions such as agroforestry. However, the survival of these forests depends on the establishment of suitable integrated community-based institutions and management practices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the Brazilian tropical savanna (Cerrado), soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important factor for crop productivity of the highly weathered, low-fertility soils, and can be easily depleted by soil management or disturbance, affecting sustainability of land use. In order to assess the impact of the first cycle of fast-growing exotic tree afforestation on SOC contents and quality, one site under Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis and two sites under Eucalyptus camaldulensis were studied. The soil under Pinus is a clayey Oxisol with no significant slope. Eucalyptus forests were planted along a toposequence of a sandy Entisol to a loamy Oxisol, which permitted to compare the afforestation effects on SOC contents and properties in two different soils under the same climatic conditions and submitted to the same management practices. Site preparation consisted of mechanical clearing of native vegetation followed by use of heavy disk plow. Litter and soil up to 60 cm were sampled, and the same soil under native Cerrado-type vegetation was sampled as control for each forest site. Analysis of total organic C, soil particle-size fractionation by physical procedures, cellulosic (CPS) and non-cellulosic (NCPS) carbohydrates, lignin phenolic derivatives and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were run to characterize SOC. The results indicate different patterns of SOC dynamics in each site. Pinus forest accumulated a large amount of litter (37.7 Mg ha(-1)), while litter under Eucalypt was less (7.6 Mg ha(-1)) than under Cerrado control (10.9 Mg ha(-1)) in the loamy Oxisol. On the sandy Entisol there was no significant difference in litter quantities (13.9 and 13.5 Mg ha(-1) for Eucalyptus and Cerrado, respectively). Organic C in the surface layer (0-5 cm) was significantly lower under planted forests than under the controls. The SOC losses in topsoil were found to be more significant in the soils with the lower clay content, varying from 19% in the clayey Oxisol to 48% in the sandy Entisol, and in the coarser particle-size fractions, considered more labile. When the total carbon in the 0-60 cm profile is considered, the C losses were 11 Mg ha(-1) (-9%) under Pinus and 9 Mg ha-1 (-17%) in the sandy Entisol under Eucalyptus, and no net losses occurred in the Oxisol under Eucalyptus. Chemical properties of SOC were affected by afforestation, but not in the sandy Entisol; analyses of carbohydrates and lignin derivatives showed a more advanced decomposition status in the Oxisols, while C-13 NMR spectra of humic substances showed a reduction of O-alkyl, and an increase of paraffinic C in the Oxisols. This absence of chemical alterations in the organic carbon of the sandy Entisol, despite the high C loss in topsoil, may indicate a weak adsorption of compounds issued during decomposition, once the clay content is low. On the toposequence, NMR analyses showed the influence of soil type in humic substances, which contained more paraffinic groups and less aromaticity in the sandy soil. In general, although forest plantations in the tropics are expected to conserve SOC, significant losses occurred in the surface layer, which may be reduced through less intensive practices of soil preparation such as reduced tillage, especially in coarse-textured soils.

AB Creating sustainable, diverse futures involves challenging assumptions that Western civilisation and linear, profit based models of unlimited development are universal. This is deeply threatening to many, but objections to such colonised futures are growing. Challenging these world-views means engaging with the complex and intersecting issues of culture, environment, globalisation, gender and sustainability. This paper tests Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) as a method to excavate the levels that have created the worldview behind one image of a colonised future. Analysis reveals a 'Future.con' which excludes most of humanity and pre-dicts a technological future in which humans may only exist to serve the machines they created. It is also the kind of image that, in a higher education context, fits and maintains pervasive but limited world-views. It could be different. Images and some of the tools of CLA can also be used in education to help envision sustainable, culturally diverse futures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID ECOLOGICAL MODERNIZATION
AB Debates about implementing 'sustainable development', 'sustainability' or even 'sustainable futures and resource use' are now engaging most intergovernmental and national bureaucracies. The notion itself appears to have replaced or become confused with efforts specifically directed at environmental protection, also a vague and contested notion. The origin, academic approaches and use of the idea is documented and discussed with reference to selected bureaucracies engaged in environmental 'governance'. I ask why and with what impact these bureaucracies have adopted the term in the post cold-war era. The methodology used is political interest analysis: why have bureaucracies adopted the notion so eagerly since the later 1980s? I argue that the sustainability debate served to strengthen bureaucracy during an era when its powers were under attack. The debate promised to extend the role of bureaucracy from that of agent of policy implementation to that of significant political actor, required to select experts as well as futures. But to what purpose and in whose interest? In seeking 'sustainability' have governments found more than a new tool for governing? I wish to stimulate theoretical and empirical investigations that replace the ubiquitous 'policy-maker' of much academic research with an 'actor' whose spatial nature, political roles and ambitions, as well as legal and resource limitations, are not ignored.

TI Breaking out of the innovation box
SO HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB In most companies, investments in innovation follow a boom-bust cycle. For a time, the cash flows. Then, as the economy sours or companies rethink their priorities, the taps go dry.
   But when research budgets are slashed, the strong projects are often abandoned along with the weak ones. Promising initiatives are cut off just when they are about to bear fruit. Expensive labs are closed; partnership agreements costing millions in legal fees are thrown away. When disruptive changes in the competitive landscape come, companies are caught flat-footed.
   Sustainable innovation requires a new approach: instead of being largely isolated projects, innovation initiatives need to gain access to the insights and capabilities of other companies. To be protected from the ax of short-term cost reductions and the faddishness born of easy money, the initiatives must become part of the ongoing commerce that takes place among companies.
   But how can businesses traffic in such sensitive information without giving their competitors an advantage?
   The answer, the author contends, lies in a practice that's been common since the Middle Ages: the use of independent intermediaries to facilitate the exchange of sensitive information among companies without revealing he principals' identities or motives and without otherwise compromising their interests. Executive search firms, for example, allow job seekers to remain anonymous during the early stages of a search, and they protect businesses from disclosing their hiring plans to rivals.
   A network of innovation intermediaries would be in a unique position to visualize new opportunities synthesized from insights and technologies provided by several companies-ideas that might never occur to businesses working on their own.

ID FLOW
AB The two-dimensional quasi-steady conduction equation governing conduction controlled rewetting of an infinite tube, with outer surface flooded and the inside surface subjected to a constant heat flux, has been solved by Wiener-Hopf technique. The solution yields the quench front temperature as a function of various model parameters such as Peclet number, Biot number and dimensionless heat flux. Also, the dryout heat flux is obtained by setting the Peclet number equal to zero, which gives the maximum sustainable heat flux to prevent the dryout of the coolant.

AB The public participation on integrated forest management process is a privileged orientation of many governments within their sustainable forest policy. Generally, this participation involves a complex decision making process. A multicriteria approach, where stakeholders agreed on interests arbitration process, is of great potential to integrate the multiple dimensions of integrated forest management. The process allows the involvement of multiple users in a given area to take part in the forest management planning which could be socially acceptable as well socially responsible.

AB This paper describes a five-year Canadian-Indonesian faculty development project that involved a range of activities and resulted in sustainable faculty development: the creation of faculty development centres in two post-secondary institutions. The mentor-mentee literature that framed the experience resulted in a gradual shifting of responsibility from the Canadians to the Indonesians. Analysis of the experience resulted in five key points that might inform faculty development practice whether internationally or locally. The key points are: time to develop expertise, understanding the multiple cultural contexts, modelling a range of different kinds of knowledge, sharing an external object of study, and changing the nature of problem solving and posing.

ID MUNICIPAL REFUSE; CHICKEN MANURE; SOIL; BIODEGRADATION
AB Hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is one of the most important crops in Mexico and other countries. This crop, as many others do, faces the loss of soil fertility, one of the most serious problems in agriculture, especially in arid lands. Regarding the importance of the organic matter in soil, we carried out experiments with the variety Anaheim THR 23(C) in an and soil. Three doses of compost were applied as treatments (25, 50, and 100t(.)ha(-1)). These applications were compared with a control without compost in order to determine the doses for major production. Soil humidity, field capacity, available moisture, total porosity, apparent and real density, and permanent wilting point were evaluated. Results showed that the highest doses improved all these physical characteristics of the soil. While there were no significant differences (P=0.05) between treatments, the best yield was obtained with the treatment of 25t(.)ha(-1). Based on the results, the latter dose is recommended for hot pepper production in and lands. Higher doses could be useful to improve physical soil conditions in the short term.

TI E-business in the entertainment sector: the Egmont case
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT

ID INTERNET
AB The new millennium has seen the rise and the fall of 'dotcom' firms, coupled with hype and disappointment over what the Internet will bring to business. While investors may have taken a dislike to web-based firms, problems of embracing or responding to the Internet challenge remain for managers of established firms. For instance, Gartner (2001, quoted after The Economist 2002) predicts that 70% of firms will have an incoherent e-business strategy within a year. For existing players it may be simple to set up a web-presence, but it is difficult to create a sustainable business model. This is especially true for industries in which many large, established firms face tremendous changes in both product design and business processes; for instance, those that deliver digital, or digitisable, goods. The media sector, and more specifically the entertainment sector, are prime examples. This paper investigates challenges and issues for entertainment firms active in different stages of the entertainment value chain. While they operate in a growing market, the digital character of their products places them at the centre of industrial changes triggered by the Internet and other new media. The paper provides an analysis of the changing business environment for media firms, investigates the specific approach chosen by one major player, Egmont, and concludes by assessing the important factors for media firms doing successful and profitable business in the new era. While the focus of this case is retrospective-considering the market at the time of Egmont's deliberations-the paper has the benefit of hindsight in terms of e-business developments and outcomes.

   United Kingdom
AB In London and Merseyside in the UK, which are served by deep underground railway networks, rising water tables are proving an increasing problem, leading to a serious deterioration of track, traction supply and signalling systems. Also in these transport systems there is an increasing demand for an energy efficient and environmentally sustainable comfort cooling system. This paper outlines a novel cooling system that aims to reduce the water table by using the groundwater for 'free' cooling the railway network. This paper investigates the potential for cooling the underground network and trains in this way. It uses a purposely-developed mathematical model to show that additional cooling to the existing rolling stock may be provided, by cooling the tunnels within which they operate. It has been shown theoretically, that by cooling the air within the tunnels by 9K, the temperature in the typical carriage operating under peak load conditions will reduce by approximately 6K to a much more acceptable level. Finally the paper identifies areas for further work, that are required in order to realise the preferred way of achieving a sustainable cooling scheme. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and IIR.

ID TAX COMPETITION
AB The issue of capital tax competition is viewed to be unproblematic if residence-based capital-taxation exists. However, the sustainability of residence-based capital taxation depends on the exchange of information about foreign financial investments between tax authorities. This paper analyzes the incentives of tax authorities to voluntarily provide information. We show that voluntary information exchange is an equilibrium in a standard small-country model of tax competition, whereas it may not be an equilibrium when the size of the financial sector has a positive impact on the wage structure of an economy.

TI Water for people and USEPA - Creating healthy partnerships with Africa's
   urban poor
SO JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB On the settlement and squatter areas of African cities, the urban poor-particularly children-face untold health risks from raw sewage, unsafe water, and solid waste. Safe drinking water is often nonexistent, and the water of questionable quality that is available may be touted as "safe" by vendors and sold at a price few can afford.
   The needs of the urban poor are mounting as the inevitable migration of people from rural areas to the cities continues. Land tenure is rare; financing and constructing homes, water systems, and other infrastructure are risky ventures. Municipalities are not equipped-financially or technically-to meet the basic water and sanitation needs of this growing population.
   WATER For PEOPLE and the US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of International Activities, have joined forces to make a difference. In October 2000, they launched the Water For Africa partnership to help bring safe, sustainable drinking water to Africa's urban poor.
   Education, capacity-building, and collaborative work with local stakeholder groups are under way in Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. The social cohesion that is sometimes taken for granted in rural development projects is often absent because of the great diversity in religion, culture, and ethnicity, making settlement areas complicated environments in which to operate. To determine the assistance best suited for this complex environment, Water For Africa includes extensive evaluation in every project.

AB Aim. The main aim of the study was to undertake training needs analysis among a multi-professional group for the purpose of improving care for ethnic minority patients and other service users.
   Background. Evidence from the literature identifies that some of the explanations advanced for the failure of health professionals to meet the needs of ethnic minorities include lack of understanding of cultural diversities, racism, racial stereotyping, lack of knowledge, exclusiveness, and ethnocentrism. While these issues have been addressed in different countries, little work has been carried out to examine these from the perspective of health professionals caring for ethnic minorities. This study is therefore an attempt to find out what health professionals know about caring for patients and other service users from minority ethnic groups and their perception of training needs in this area of work.
   Methods. A pre- and post-training design phase structured the qualitative approach. A purposive sample of individuals working across five health service organizations located in a multi-racial city yielded a multi-professional group of participants. Views of 22 participants were obtained by semi-structured interviews at a pretraining phase. Training needs of health professionals drew on Walklin's (1992) six stages used to structure data collection, data analysis and delivery of training. The post-training phase used questionnaires to evaluate immediate learning that based on a 4-week period of reflection and applied to practice. The questionnaires were complemented by a facilitator-lead focus group.
   Results. The majority of the participants confirmed that no attention was given in their initial education to the health care needs of minority ethnic groups. Instead, participants engaged in self-initiated learning to improve their knowledge and understanding. The issue of communication was viewed with dissatisfaction and seen as affecting the sufficiency of caring for these patients. All participants rated meeting the needs of ethnic minorities as very important and believed that they had gained a better understanding of the concepts of ethnicity and race and resources available in local communities as a result of the training. They also reported changes in thinking about ethnic minorities and had started to acquire greater confidence to engage with colleagues about different cultural values and practices and the implications of these for caring. While a quarter of the participants had transferred some learning to practice, the majority were not able to bring about any change. This majority response challenged the sustainability of learning about ethnic minorities when training takes place away from the context in which professionals practise.
   Conclusion. Training embedded in clinical and nonclinical environment where patients and other service users and professionals interact is offered as a major finding.

ID CHINENSE STEPPE; COMMUNITY
AB 1. Cleistogenes is an important perennial grass genus found in the pastoral steppes of eastern Inner Mongolia. Despite its dominance in many grassland types, the value of Cleistogenes as a key genus for sustainable grassland development has only recently been recognized. To understand better how to manage Cleistogenes -dominant grasslands, an experiment was conducted in China, to characterize the growth patterns of two Cleistogenes species (C. polyphylla and C. squarrosa ) in relation to environmental parameters.
   2. Sampling exclosures were established on uniform grasslands at Mangha and Liuhe gachas. Over two growing seasons (1999-2000) vegetation cover, green and dry biomass by species, species height and tiller density of Cleistogenes were measured at about monthly intervals starting in mid-May and ending in mid-October. Cleistogenes polyphylla at Mangha and C. squarrosa at Liuhe accounted for > 50% of green biomass. Neither species made any significant growth before late June, even though soil moisture was available and a large number of tillers were present that had survived the subzero winter intact. In contrast, other species (Prunus sibirica , Potentilla spp. Aneurolepidium chinense ) produced up to 500 kg ha(-1) biomass in early spring.
   3. A relationship between temperature and green weight (wt) tiller(-1) indicated that Cleistogenes required an average air temperature > 20 degreesC to initiate growth, most probably due to its C4 photosynthetic pathway. In this region, temperatures above 20 degreesC also coincide with periods of most reliable rainfall, which may explain the success of Cleistogenes in grassland degraded by overgrazing. In contrast, competing C3 species (e.g. Stipa spp. and Aneurolepidium chinense ) initiate growth earlier in spring when rainfall is highly variable and when small plants are most exposed to severe grazing pressure by livestock emerging from winter in poor condition.
   4. Where Cleistogenes spp. completely dominated the grassland, the length of the growing season was shorter and feed shortages in early spring became more acute than for grasslands dominated by C3 species. Livestock producers can minimize this effect by adopting management tactics such as resting pastures in spring to maintain a balance between C3 and C4 perennial grasses. Further research is needed to establish when grazing and strategic rest have most impact on the stability of Cleistogenes -dominant grasslands.

AB 1. Documentation of habitat use by individual bat species is a key issue when assessing impacts after forests are disturbed, for example by logging.
   2. We used bat detectors to compare bat activity in unlogged forest and regrowth forest 15 years after logging in northern New South Wales, Australia. Sites of contrasting management history were replicated at the scale of small catchments, with detectors positioned on tracks, off tracks and in riparian zones in either unlogged or regrowth forest.
   3. The highest bat activity was recorded on forest tracks, with no significant difference between detectors in regrowth (mean = 183 passes night(-1) ) and unlogged forest (196 passes night(-1) ). Activity in riparian zones was intermediate (regrowth = 55 passes night(-1) ; unlogged = 26 passes night(-1) ), while off-track sites in forest regrowth had the lowest activity levels (5 passes night(-1) ). Species richness was lowest in the off-track samples in regrowth and highest in the on-track samples of regrowth.
   4. An index of clutter for different vegetation layers was recorded at each site. Bat activity decreased significantly with increasing clutter formed by the layer of regrowth eucalypts and/or understorey rain forest. This result strongly suggested that low bat activity off tracks was related to vegetation clutter.
   5. Specific identification of calls revealed that the suite of species associated with tracks included both those predicted by ecomorphology to be clutter-sensitive (Falsistrellus tasmaniensis , Vespadelus darlingtoni , Vespadelus pumilus and Chalinolobus morio ) and clutter-tolerant (Rhinolophus megaphyllus ).
   6. Elevation and temperature were also significant covariates of activity for a number of species.
   7. As part of sustainable management of regrowth forests, we advocate maintaining flyways for bats in the form of tracks and riparian zones, in addition to the widely recognized need for the retention of hollow-bearing trees as roost sites. Research on the effects of silvicultural thinning, which will reduce clutter with possible benefits to some bat species, should also be a priority in forest characterized by secondary regrowth.

AB 1. The risk of pest damage in forest monocultures is a growing concern as the area of plantation forest expands world-wide and sustainable management is becoming a general goal. Numerous studies have demonstrated that pest insects are less abundant in more diverse agroecosystems, but limited experimental evidence exists for a similar relationship in forestry. Because plantation forests are usually mosaics of single-species stands, the aim of this study was to test the effect of forest diversity at a landscape level on pest insect infestations.
   2. Within a stand of maritime pine, trees attacked by the stem borer Dioryctria sylvestrella showed no spatial aggregation and clusters of 66 trees proved to be an optimal sampling unit for determining overall percentage infestation.
   3. The spatial distribution of stem borer infestation levels was examined in three maritime pine stands bordered by mixed-species stands of broad-leaved trees, and overall infestation levels compared between four such maritime pine stands and four other maritime pine stands of the same structure but far from any broad-leaved stands.
   4. The percentage of trees infested was significantly lower in the pine stands bordered by broad-leaved stands than in the pine stands surrounded by other pine stands, and in the former, stem borer infestation showed a significant logistic increase with distance from the stand edge. This could be due to effects of resource concentration or natural enemy attack, both of which are discussed.
   5. These results suggest that the conservation or restoration of non-productive mixed-species stands adjacent to intensively managed plantations is a useful preventive method for pest management in forest monocultures.

AB 1. Overexploitation is a major threat to the persistence of many species. A wide variety of approaches to setting 'sustainable' quotas for exploitation exist but there are major discrepancies between theory and practice, and only limited integration between different branches of exploitation literature. Here, we bring together and compare the efficacy of a range of different approaches to estimating sustainability.
   2. A simulated population of a social mammal was used to provide data for, and compare the recommendations of, 10 widely used estimators for setting levels of sustainable exploitation. Estimators tested included four methods for setting sustainable levels of constant-effort harvesting, two approaches to assessing the sustainability of constant-yield harvesting, and four systems for setting thresholds below which harvesting should cease.
   3. The method used to fit catch per unit effort data to a stock dynamic model had an important influence on the variance of recommendations. Recommendations were also affected by the length of data set available and the frequency of changes in exploitation effort. Observation-error estimators were more consistent and more conservative than equilibrium, effort-averaging and process-error approaches. Harvesting at the point of maximum productivity was found to be unstable in a noisy system, suggesting the need for considerable caution when using any of these estimators.
   4. Constant-yield indices, developed for use in the bush meat trade, overestimated the point at which exploitation was likely to become highly unsustainable. Sociality was an important factor underlying this finding and the assessment of sustainability in constant-yield systems should give consideration to the effects of different social systems.
   5. Overall, threshold-harvesting systems provided the highest mean yields in relation to extinction risk. However, the introduction of error into these systems, particularly in the form of less frequent censuses, greatly increased both variance in yields and risk of extinction.

DE continuous improvement; customer focus; EFQM Model; ethic management;
   excellence; public responsibility; results orientation
AB It may be quite rightly stated that the EFQM Model of the European Foundation for Quality Management is the basic reference model for those organisations whose aim is to achieve excellence. It offers an integral and integrating approach to the most relevant dimensions of the reality of the organisation and permits the establishment of framework that is both objective and rigorous and based on a structured diagnosis.
   The EFQM Excellence Model is based on a humanist approach that situates the client (in all aspects/senses) as the centre and ultimate reason of the activity of the organisation, emphasizing the role of the latter as a responsible member of the community. An ethical approach is therefore adopted as the best way to serve the long-term interest of the organisation and the people that integrate it (as well as their sustainability in time), exceeding expectations and the policy of society in general.
   This article analyses in depth, and from the point of view of ethics (one of the key aspects in the search for excellence), the possible ethical implications in the deployment of the nine basic criteria of the EFM Excellence Model which facilitate the understanding of the most relevant dimensions of the reality of an organisation.

AB Multinational enterprises have continued their increase during the last decades. What these companies do and how they do, determines not only the economic development of countries, but also their social and cultural development. This enormous power implies responsibility and new challenges.
   If we also take into account the role of multinational enterprises in what has been called sustainable development, we see that their importance is still more decisive.
   In order to guide the performances of multinational enterprises that operate in developing countries, several supranational organizations like the ILO, the OECD, the EU and the UN have elaborated some recommendations to unify criteria and to set out some minimum standards to favor an integral development of these countries. In this document we present three of those with the greatest impact and we analyze them from the approach of an ethical sustainable human development.

DT Article
DE community; freedom; knowledge; open source; organizational model;
   resources
AB Today we are facing the rising of new needs for the firms, especially for the small ones; they find themselves acting in a context characterized by the great content of information technology. This paper wants to analyse some aspects tied to the use of some particular kinds of resources, such as knowledge and organizational culture. It's necessary, especially in the new economy, to add another attribute to the four set by Barney as elements able to make the resources sustainable competitive advantage sources in 1991: this attribute is freedom, essentially as freedom of reaching and using resources. This attribute, more than coming along with the four already set, can be considered in many cases as a pre-condition to the other ones in existence.
   The theoretical part will be completed by the reference to a particular organizational model that is based on freedom, that is the open source model; we'll try to show how freedom is not an abstract concept in business.

AB To pursue sustainable technology as a key responsibility for chemical engineers, we have presented an infrastructure for integrating element technologies of life cycle engineering (LCE). By that, we can evaluate. and make a rational decision on LCE in chemical industries. With this point of view, we attempt to integrate a product life cycle model developed earlier together with various data bases, simulators and applications on G2 that is known as a development environment of intelligent systems. We also aim at facilitating a collaborative research accessible from global horizon through the Internet. Finally, through implementation associated with the management of plastic wastes, we have shown that more elaborate concerns on LCE is possible through our idea.

TI Promoting democratic governance and preventing the recurrence of
   conflict: The role of the United Nations development programme in
   post-conflict peace-building
SO JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Promoting democracy and strengthening good governance have become core components of post-conflict peace-building initiatives of the United Nations (UN). An often overlooked dimension of the analysis of UN peace support operations has been the crucial role played by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) at the critical juncture linking peacekeeping to sustainable development. UN peace operations in Central America over the last decade have pioneered the organisation's involvement in the uncharted territory of post-conflict peace building. UNDP's Central American experience was the first step in the organisation's evolution away from providing traditional development assistance, towards playing an active and openly political role in post-conflict democracy building and governance reform. This new role of the UNDP has had dramatic repercussions on its mandate, administrative structures, corporate policies and operational strategies. The current institutional renewal of UNDP has its roots in its endorsement of democratic governance as essential dimensions of its mandate to promote sustainable human development. This article assesses the significance, promises and dilemmas of the governance agenda for UNDP and analyses the scope, nature and institutionalisation of democracy and governance programmes within UNDP, using Central America as a case study. It argues that the future of UNDP democracy assistance will largely depend on how successful it is at resolving the inherent tensions between democracy promotion and national sovereignty, while retaining its multilateral approach to peace and democracy.

AB Increased access, to individual customers and their purchase histories has led to a growth in targeted promotions, including the practice of offering different pricing policies to prospective, as opposed to current, customers. Prior research on targeted promotions has adopted a tenet of the standard economic theory of choice, whereby what a consumer chooses depends exclusively on the prices available to that consumer. In this article, the authors propose that consumer preference for firms is affected not just by prices the consumers themselves are offered but also by prices available to others. This departure from the conventional strong-rationality, approach to targeted promotion results in a decidedly different optimal policy. Through a laboratory experiment, calibration of a stochastic model, and game-theoretic analysis, the authors demonstrate that ignoring behaviorist effects exaggerates the importance of targeting switchers as opposed to loyals. This occurs,, though with intriguing differences, even when only part. of the market is aware of firms' differing promotional policies. The authors show that both the deal percentage and the proportion of aware consumers affect the optimal strategy of the firm. Furthermore, the authors find that offering lower prices to switchers may not be a sustainable practice in them long run, as information spreads and the,proportion of aware consumers grows. The model cautions practitioners against overpromoting and/or promoting to the wrong segment p and suggests avenues for improving the effectiveness of targeted promotional policies.

ID FUTURE; SENSE
AB The practice and scholarship of planning has shifted from physical design to process. Process emphasizes diversity, openness, and consensus but is not fully equipped to offer a shared vision in political arenas dominated by fragmentation and conflict. New urbanism has revived the idea that planning is about physical design, but this concept does not fully embrace a holistic vision of community building. This article explains how sustainable development extends the positive attributes of the first two approaches and offers a multigenerational vision of community building. This vision integrates multiple societal values and enhances local imagination, understanding, and commitment to defining solutions for the common good.

AB Many urban and suburban communities in the Midwest are seeking to establish sustainable, morphologically and hydraulically varied, yet dynamically stable fluvial systems that are capable of supporting healthy, biologically diverse aquatic ecosystems-a process known as stream naturalization. This paper describes an integrated research program that seeks to develop a scientific and technological framework to support two stream naturalization projects near Chicago, Illinois. The research program integrates theory and methods in fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, hydraulic engineering and social theory. Both the conceptual and the practical challenges of that integration are discussed. Scientific and technical support emphasize the development of predictive tools to evaluate the performance of possible naturalization designs at scales most appropriate to community based projects. Social analysis focuses on place based evaluations of how communities formulate an environmental vision and then, through decision making, translate this vision into specific stream naturalization strategies. Integration of scientific and technical with social components occurs in the context of community based decision making as the predictive tools are employed by project scientists to help local communities translate their environmental visions into concrete environmental designs. Social analysis of this decision making process reveals how the interplay between the community's vision of what they want the watershed to become, and the scientific perspective on what the watershed can become to achieve the community's environmental goals, leads to the implementation of specific stream naturalization practices.

SO LAND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID OWNERSHIP; WORLD; SELF
AB John Locke's theory of property, described in his Second Treatise on Civil Government, exerts a strong but often unacknowledged influence on environmental economics, providing justification for many of our discipline's norms and practices. This paper examines how Locke's Enlightenment-era thesis has informed our understanding of the relation of the individual and the state to environmental amenities. While Locke has been used to justify a libertarian view that treats any form of environmental regulation as a "taking," elements of Locke's original argument can be understood to subject individual rights claims to constraints requiring intra- and intergenerational sufficiency and sustainability.

SO MILITARY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID LEISHMANIASIS; DIAGNOSIS
AB The United Nations Mission to Eritrea and Ethiopia deployed to monitor a cease-fire in a mutually agreed upon Temporary Security Zone. Support for the United Nations (UN) troops included a Field Dressing Station supplied by the Dutch Navy, augmented by Canadian personnel. As with most missions of this type, the health of the deployed Canadian and Dutch soldiers is such that there is time to provide some medical support to local civilian institutions. This article describes this interaction in Eritrea through the illustration of the diagnosis and management of a specific illness through the cooperative use of high-technology laboratory equipment coupled with what we believe to be common sense. Although there was no specific United Nations Mission to Eritrea and Ethiopia humanitarian medical assistance mandate, the expanded use of CIMIC# projects was employed to allow this activity. The guiding principle of sustainability once UN facilities leave is also illustrated in the approach taken to provide this assistance.

TI Celebrating mountain women: Moving mountains, moving women
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Mountains are the mainstay of local economies, providing valuable resources for livelihoods. But they are not immune to change because mountain people go out into the outside world, and the world comes into their lives. In this context, mountain women face many challenges, for example, those brought about by out-migration of men and young people from their communities, by external commercial interests that exploit mountain resources, and by changes in their roles and responsibilities.
   In this International Year of Mountains, a major forum, "Celebrating Mountain Women," aims to support women and highlight their needs and achievements so that these are reflected and integrated in public policy and in decision-making agendas. Several factors are required to ensure that women are an integral part of sustainable mountain development: more mountain-specific and local research; assistance with entrepreneurship, information, and raising awareness of their rights; and networking among mountain women and various development partners.

TI Integrated mountain development: A question of gender mainstreaming
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB "Development without women is like a bird trying to take off with only one wing," according to Abeba Habtorm, director of, the Ministry of Education in Asmara, Eritrea. Are mountain women adequately integrated in development cooperation efforts internationally, by region, nationally, and in local communities? Has the vital role of women in sustainable development of mountain communities been sufficiently documented, understood, and especially taken into account in development projects? Mountain women's concerns have been the subject of debate during the last 3 decades, and some efforts have been made to develop more gender-sensitive policies and programs as well as more opportunities for mountain women, especially at the local level. Yet, there is still a great lack of disaggregated data on women's roles and responsibilities, on their access to and control over natural resources, services, and infrastructure, and on their knowledge of and participation in the elaboration of strategies to improve the situation they face as a result of male out-migration, globalization, and hence marginalization. The "bird" can take off only if women and men have equal opportunities to design policies and take part in decision making on more sustainable forms of mountain development at all levels.

   Basin, Ethiopia
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE land cover changes; remote sensing; afforestation; Ethiopia
AB This study evaluated changes in land cover in the Chemoga watershed, headwater to the Blue Nile. Two sets of aerial photographs (1957 and 1982) and a multispectral Spot image (1998) were used as inputs to produce 3 GIS-based land cover maps of the area. The results show that during the last 41 years, forest cover increased at a rate of about 11 ha per annum in the 36,400-ha watershed. Woodlands and shrublands decreased between 1957 and 1982 but increased between 1982 and 1998, approximately to their previous levels. Farmland and settled areas gained from the other cover types (13% increase) in the first period but lost around 586 ha (2% decrease) in the second. Grassland and degraded land decreased, accounting for 4.8% of the total area of the watershed in 1982 and 3.5% in 1998, as against 9.6% in 1957. Riverine trees suffered the greatest destruction, shrinking by 79% over the 4 decades; much of this decline was due to cultivation. Marshlands increased in the first period and decreased in the second. A new pond emerged amid the marshlands between 1982 and 1998. Population growth and the associated demand for land and trees was the major driving force behind the changes. This study shows that the deforestation trend was reduced and even partly reversed in the area because local people planted trees as a source of fuel and income. This trend ought to be encouraged through appropriate interventions-in particular by promoting planting of local species rather than eucalyptus-to increase not only economic but also ecological benefits. Indeed, the current state of land cover and its dynamics have environmental implications at the local scale and beyond. Hence, environmental management for sustainable development requires interregional and international cooperation.

LA English
DT Article
DE dambo; savanna
AB Headwater unincised savanna (Sabana) landscapes in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic, have a vegetation cover dominated by the native tussock grass, Danthonia domingensis. Sites occur on gentle-relief upland surfaces approximately between 2000 and 2400 m, mainly in Jose del Carmen Ramirez National Park (JCR) and Juan B. Perez Rancier National Park (JBPR). Surface and subsurface data from 1 site constrain regolith age overlying granitoid saprolite to <12,570 C-14 years BP We conclude that the savannas studied are dambos that developed in response to environmental change during and after the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Dambos elsewhere are widely regarded as reliable indicators of major Quaternary environmental change, Dambos have unique hydrological, ecological, scenic, and utilitarian attributes; their importance will increase with greater tourism, as will the concerns for their sustainable use. This first publication on dambos in the Caribbean signals the need for more research into their origin, evolution, and state of equilibrium.

SO NEW GENETICS AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB Biotechnologies are expected to have profound impacts across industrial and industrializing economies. One of the critical shaping influences on the development and use of these technologies will be the multiple social contests that have developed over their sustainability. For new technologies to become embedded in social, economic and institutional systems, processes of mutual adjustment must take place in both the technology and its social contexts. These adjustment processes tend to be complex and unpredictable, and their scale and scope reflect the anticipated significance of a new technology. I review the range of debates and contests about the impacts of biotechnology on environmental and social sustainability that will influence its development and diffusion. These contests are viewed as contingent, in that they are often framed by already established concerns and interests. In this sense, debates about biotechnology are primarily 'additive', rather than wholly novel.

AB Micronutrient malnutrition (e. g. Fe, Zn and vitamin A deficiencies) now afflicts over 40% of the world's population and is increasing especially in many developing nations. Green revolution cropping systems may have inadvertently contributed to the growth in micronutrient deficiencies in resource-poor populations. Current interventions to eliminate these deficiencies that rely on supplementation and food fortification programs do not reach all those affected and have not proven to be sustainable. Sustainable solutions can only be developed through agricultural system approaches. One agricultural approach is to enrich major staple food crops (e. g. rice, wheat, maize, beans and cassava) in micronutrients through plant breeding strategies. Available research has demonstrated that micronutrient enrichment traits are available within the genomes of these major staple crops that could allow for substantial increases in Fe, Zn and provitamin A carotenoids without negatively impacting yield. Furthermore, micronutrient-dense seeds can increase crop yields when sowed to micronutrient-poor soils. The enrichment traits appear to be stable across various soil types and climatic environments. Further research is required to determine if increasing levels of micronutrients in staple foods can significantly improve the nutritional status of people suffering from micronutrient deficiencies.

ID FUELS; OIL
AB Biomass energy includes fuelwood, agricultural residues, animal wastes, charcoal and other fuels derived from biological sources. It currently accounts for about 14% of world energy consumption. Biomass is the main source of energy for many developed and developing countries. In Turkey energy wood is available in the form of forest chips, fuelwood. wood waste, wood pellets, and it is also produced to a very limited extent from willow crops in short rotation forestry, The major part of wood harvested in the forest area (approximately 10 million ha) ends up as energy wood directly or indirectly after having been used for other purposes first. An overview of biomass potential and utilization in Turkey is presented. In 1999, the biomass share of the total energy consumption of the country is 10 percent. The level of fuelwood use together with that of other agricultural and animal wastes is compared with the commercial energy use within the country's global energy balance. The possibilities of increasing fuelwood production through afforestation programmes and substitution for commercial fuels are discussed. Biogas utilization in the rural regions is also reviewed, emphasizing its possible contribution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most research evaluation has studied the process of innovation, not its outcomes in the wider society. Measurement of socioeconomic outcomes has focused on economic growth itself, rather than sustainable growth. The distributional consequences of S&T programs have been neglected. The authors of this article seek ways to design and evaluate S&T policies so that they reduce rather than increase inequalities. They present a framework for strengthening the use of research results through public institutions to spread benefits more widely.

ID MINIMIZATION CLUBS; MANAGEMENT; ENGLAND
AB The Waste Strategy 2000 (England and Wales) acknowledged that waste minimisation clubs had a major role to play in introducing sustainable wastes management. However, a key criticism of many 'First Generation' demonstration clubs had been that although realizing significant savings, they had done so with substantial financial support, at times up to million. Consequently, to justify this investment by achieving large savings whole business sectors, and especially smaller companies with less potential to make large savings, had been excluded. This strategy had limited the opportunity to spread the positive message of waste minimisation and resource efficiency to key areas of local communities. Given the contribution of waste minimisation to the deliverance of many aspects of sustainable development, itself a key focus of UK Environmental Legislation, this approach was short sighted. Second Generation clubs, such as the Northamptonshire Resource Efficiency Project which utilised a 'Facilitated Self-Help' approach had improved the cost effectiveness of clubs, but significant investment was still required. Therefore, to remedy the situation, two clubs in Northamptonshire were developed with minimal investment, relying heavily on the formation of key local partnerships. These clubs, described as 'Third Generation' clubs, highlighted that low cost does not mean low quality, achieving savings of over 250,000 pounds for an investment of 13,000 pounds each. This ranks these clubs among the most cost effective run to date and has allowed the model developed to be a major tool for the introduction of sustainable wastes management via staff training and the dissemination of waste minimisation issues into the wider business community.

AB Brucellae infections have been documented world-wide over the years in a great variety of terrestrial wildlife species. Recently, brucellae infections have also been reported in a wide variety of marine mammals. A very important consideration with regard to terrestrial brucellosis in wildlife is to distinguish between a spillover of infection from domestic animals and a sustainable infection in wild species. The probability of brucellosis becoming established and being sustainable in a species depends on a combination of factors including host susceptibility, infectious dose, contact with infected animals, management and environmental factors. In this context, the development of the game farming industry appears to have contributed to the re-emergence of brucellosis. The gold standard in brucellosis diagnosis remains the isolation of brucellae. If brucellosis is suspected in an animal or a wildlife population following positive serological results, attempts to isolate the organism should always be performed. The release of anti-brucellae vaccine strain in wildlife is of concern because this could lead to environmental contamination and infection of other wild species. Therefore, the appropriate dosage of the vaccine in target species as well as the safety of the vaccine in non-target species must be addressed in technical terms in order to assist decision-making regarding the management of wildlife brucellosis.

AB The request for this paper was set to provide a perspective on small ruminant productivity with the emphasis being on production in harmony with the environment and disease control. The topic is relevant and important, since it poses a serious challenge to our Mediterranean region's animal scientists in view of public perception with reference to animal production systems. Whilst there is reason to believe that science and technology could cope with the short and medium term negative environmental effects of animal production systems, the most serious environmental costs from animal agriculture are probably incurred over time scales too long to perceive and respond to effectively. Scientific advances and the present methods of technology for food production, preservation, processing, transport and marketing are forcing rapid change, particularly throughout the less developed and marginal regions of the world. Only time will show whether the present pace of change will, on balance, have an overall positive or negative effect on the future state of affairs. These changes should be managed to prevent devastating effects not only on traditional animal agriculture but also on the environment as a whole allowing for a planned evolutionary process, so that humans and the livestock they care for can adopt the new socio-economic conditions, they both must face. Livestock-related development projects in our region must be integrated in a healthy and dynamic rural context.

AB The effectiveness of efforts that integrate ecosystem conservation and community development is the focus of debate. This disagreement steins from the different values and expectations people place on this integration. While some people put priority on ecosystem viability and use development as a means to enhance conservation, others put priority on community viability and consider conservation a means to that end. The absence of a common theoretical framework for ecosystem and community viability has made the design, monitoring, and evaluation of integrated projects difficult a and has contributed to the current disagreement. In this article we propose a theoretical framework, which is based on the hypothesis that ecosystem conservation aid community, survival are interdependent and should be given equal emphasis if both are to benefit. By outlining specific factors that enhance ecosystem and community viability, the framework can aid the design and evaluation of integrated projects.

AB Edith Penrose's (1959) book, The Theory of the Growth of the Firm, is considered by many, scholars in the strategy field to be the seminal work that provided the intellectual foundations for the modem, resource-based theory of the firm. However, the present paper suggests that Penrose's direct or intended contribution to resource-based thinking has been misinterpreted. Penrose never aimed to provide useful strategy prescriptions for managers to create a sustainable stream of rents; rather, she tried to rigorously describe the processes through which firms grow. In her theory, rents were generally assumed not to occur. If they arose this reflected an inefficient macro-level outcome of an otherwise efficient micro-level growth process. Nevertheless, her ideas have undoubtedly stimulated 'good conversation' within the strategy field in the spirit of Mahoney and Pandian (1992); their emerging use by some scholars as building blocks in models that show how sustainable competitive advantage and rents can be achieved is undeniable, although such use was never intended by Edith Penrose herself Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

TI Towards strategic planning and regional sustainability: Hong Kong in the
   Pearl River Delta Region
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the wider spatial and governmental context for promoting sustainable development policies in Hong Kong. It examines the spatial frameworks and the territory-specific approaches adopted in Hong Kong since the 1970s. Despite the claim of a non-interventionist approach, government intervention for the purposes of promoting economic growth was evident in the development model of Hong Kong under the British rule. Additionally, the notion of strategic planning at the regional level was absent from the spatial framework. This was so even with the growing economic interaction between Hong Kong and the other cities in the Pearl River Delta Region (PRDR) in the 1980s and remained so in the early years of the SAR government. With economic integration between Hong Kong and the PRDR, strategic planning has to take on a different form. The diversity of the socio-economic context and the complexity of political processes in the PRDR offer enormous opportunities to all stakeholders. Hong Kong should be more proactive in bringing the region together with a view to attaining regional sustainability. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

TI Social equity in housing in the Hong Kong special administrative region:
   A social sustainability perspective
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The housing arena in Hong Kong has undergone dramatic transformation due to the change in government in 1997 and the subsequent economic recession engendered by the Asian financial crisis. This paper applies the sustainable development perspective to investigate whether policy changes and government responses to the collapse in the property market have made the distribution and consumption of Hong Kong more equitable. It argues that the government's emphasis on home ownership has intensified horizontal and vertical inequity but that the economic recession has the unintended effect of reducing vertical inequity between the low- and the lower-middle-income groups. Simultaneously, the recession has reduced the housing choices and mobility of the middle-income groups, rendering them the real losers of the housing policies and economic changes after 1997.

TI Environmental policy and planning in Hong Kong: An emerging regional
   agenda
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB For the past 20 years, environmental policy in Hong Kong has been driven by responses to a variety of local problems resulting in an array of environmental ordinances and supporting regulations addressing air water and noise pollution problems, waste management and the use of EIA in the development planning process. Hong Kong's approach to environmental policy has been based on the conventional 'command and control' model of environmental management. It has, however, become increasingly apparent that many of Hong Kong's environmental problems cannot be effectively addressed solely by local initiatives but must involve broader collaborative efforts With authorities in neighbouring Guangdong Province. Furthermore, the Hong Kong SAR's efforts to address sustainability issues, which are still at an early stage, may also be facilitated by a regional rather than purely local perspective as well as by one that explores the utility of the ecological modernization model. This paper discusses the recent evolution of environmental policy in Hong Kong, the emergence of a regional environmental management agenda and the potential of ecological modernization as a basis for the development of a broader strategy to manage the environmental problems of the Pearl River Delta Region.

ID NETWORKS; DESIGN
AB In several industrialised countries, there have occurred initiatives to establish eco-industrial parks. Originally, these were mainly based upon the exchange of resources between heavy industries in industrial complexes. These initiatives are generally referred to with the concepts of industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks. Since then, the concept of eco-industrial parks has been extended to another relevant type of industrial park, the so-called mixed industrial park, which consists of various small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), sometimes complemented by a small number of larger industries. Because of the resulting growing ambiguity in the significance of eco-industrial park initiatives, a typology is desirable for entangling the confusion that is introduced. It is argued that mixed industrial parks are poorly investigated although they have a major environmental and spatial impact, Starting from a general consideration of eco-industrial park initiatives, this paper describes the societal and environmental problems that are related to the mixed industrial parks, proposes solutions and discusses the counteracting factors. While our argument relates strongly to the traditionally industrialised countries, it is also relevant to newly industrialised countries, as they are faced with similar problems, or will encounter them in the near future.

AB A major threat to the sustain ability of tourism is the escalating demand for energy resulting in the depletion of natural resources and an associated threat to the global climate. It is argued that tourism. and particularly the recreational part of the product. may contribute considerably to a country's 'energy bill'. This study analyses tourist attractions and activities in New Zealand with the purpose to understanding the energy use of different categories, sub-categories, and operator types. The results of a survey across a wide range of tourism businesses (N = 107) show that tourist attractions. such as museums (10 MJ/visit), or experience centres (29 MJ/visit) generally consume less energy than tourist activities, such as scenic Flights (344 MJ/flight) or jet boating (255 MJ/ride), on a per capita basis, Various factors influence the total energy cost of a business and the consumption per tourist, particularly when motorised travel is used to overcome Physical barriers, Such factors include visitor numbers. management style, technical equipment, and fuel mix. A detailed examination of the energy use pattern of an operator can often improve the energy efficiency. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A retrospection has been made in "HNS 2001" on the development attained in the field of high nitrogen steels (HNS) and its future development.HNS has been scientifically proved to be the advanced material of the XXI century: they allow up to 400 % increase in strength, acquisition of unique properties, conformity to the ecological and sustainable development requirements, etc. The cardinal problem being the serious lag in their large-scale industrial production and application. The problems are debatable. The author has made a schematic attempt to provoke discussion aimed at the more enhanced development of HNS and the metallurgy under pressure (MP) on the basis of his 30 years of investigation and implementation as well as of the available reference literature.

AB This paper examines the work of the Village Enterprise Fund, an US nongovernmental organization, in East Africa as a case study in "equity" based microfinance in low-income countries. Many small businesses established in high-income countries rely on some form of equity capital to fund the startup phase and much of the growth of the business. The success of startup grants and equity financing in high-income countries suggests that this method might also be applicable in low-income countries. Using the work of the Village Enterprise Fund as an example, the paper argues that startup grants and equity finance are useful and appropriate in addition to the more common loan-based approaches.

AB Substantial attention has been given to the obligations of developed countries to share benefits and transfer technology in exchange for access to biodiversity. There has been comparatively little discussion of measures that developing countries can take to attract and fully benefit from bioprospecting endeavors. Efforts in Costa Rica and South Africa to promote value-added bioprospecting and national programs in Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Cuba to develop biotechnological capabilities are analyzed for insights into the components of successful strategies for sustainable development of biochemical resources. Potential synergies between national programs to promote biotechnology and value-added bioprospecting are also discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Experience with community-based biodiversity conservation programs in the 1980s and 1990s contributed to the conviction among donor agencies and researchers that such programs must be based on the active support of local resource users, appropriate incentives, and institutional support. Yet the continuing struggles of practitioners to implement conservation interventions that are socially and ecologically sustainable point to difficulty in realizing these principles on the ground. Actor-oriented research in rural development and actor network theory emphasize that the capacity of facilitators to engage effectively in negotiation processes and establish strong networks with key actors is critical in mediating intervention outcomes. Drawing on the case of the India Ecodevelopment Project at Rajiv Gandhi (Nagarahole) National Park in Karnataka, India, this paper explores the role of relationships and networks between actors in a conservation and development intervention, finding that practitioners need to focus on negotiation and network building as a central rather than subsidiary part of the intervention process. Associated with this is the need for change in the way donor and implementing agencies conduct themselves, to promote communication and greater flexibility in intervention processes.

AB In this paper, we briefly describe the institutional background of Singapore's successful national skills development model. We devise a tentative framework to evaluate national level skills development efforts, and we use it to assess the Singapore model. We argue that the model has the potential to move constantly toward higher skills equilibria. We question however, the long-term sustainability of the model, and whether it is transferable to other developing countries. We conclude with some principles that other countries might use in organizing their own skills development systems. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper asks what should be demanded from urban open space in the 21st century. It explores the social and spatial implications of new lifestyles, values, attitudes to nature and sustainability, and the models for future city life and the patterns of urban open space that might accommodate these. One vital role that urban parks play is providing space for the expression of diversity, both personal and cultural; this raises issues of democratic provision for and access to public open space. It suggests, inter alia, that the role of the urban street as public space may need to be re-thought. The social and cultural values of open space include attitudes towards nature and the desire for contact with it; contemporary understandings of ecology offer new insights into ways to serve both human needs and the broader ecological framework of urban open space structures. It has been suggested that the urbanity of public open space is threatened by the increase in 'virtual' transactions, obviating the need for real, social interaction, but there is also evidence that use of new communications technology can increase and enhance use of public open space; this may include engagement in the productive aspect of our landscape. A more flexible approach to open space definition and usage is proposed, recognising 'loose-fit' landscapes which allow opportunities for the socially marginalised and the ecologically shifting within a dynamic framework of urban structures and networks.

AB Today's landscape planning and design cannot favour one of the alternatives either to reproduce only historical images of landscapes and treat landscape a patient or to transform land use by following the organisational principles of human natural systems. Landscape planning must focus on the multi-functionality of the landscape using the premise of sustainable land use. Three examples, in Germany, that illustrate possibilities of future landscape transformation are presented. Though landscape planning is an important instrument to regulate the relationship between man and environment in such landscapes, in general practice landscape planning faces a lot of concrete problems. Requirements, methods and potentials of landscape planning that enable it to tackle these problems are proposed. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper reviews some of the current water quality issues relating to the surface waters of Scotland and highlights some of the key issues likely to be significant over the next decade. The sustainable management of water quality requires an appreciation of the temporal and spatial assessment of the resource, together with an identification of reference or natural conditions from which to determine change, and the elucidation of the drivers of change. Only through this integrated approach, can appropriate management strategies be developed and prioritised, bearing in mind that impacts may be decoupled from sources in both time and space. This paper highlights recent trends in water quality (from a hydrochemical perspective) with separation into three broad groups: rivers, lochs and estuaries. For rivers, a general reduction in concentration of determinants that are more indicative of urban point sources (phosphorus, ammonium, suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand etc.) is apparent, while in more agriculturally-dominated areas, an increase in concentration of solutes that are considered more diffuse in origin, (e.g. nitrate) is reported. The increasing contribution to total loads from diffuse pollutants is a priority area for both research and policy. Current scientific challenges are to define the most appropriate spatial context within which regional water quality issues can be monitored and managed. It is likely that future emphasis will be placed on making an initial ecoregion based grouping in conjunction with physically defined catchment, which will be used to quantify site-specific impacts. Such an organisational approach will provide a mechanism that enables a targeted monitoring strategy to be developed. This will allow the establishment of ecologically based targets for water quality, and an improved understanding the biogeochemistry of pollution reversibility and ecosystem recovery. It is also fundamental to the development of tools through which to predict the time scale and magnitude of any recovery, such that environmental benefit can be optimised against realistic socio-economic constraints. The inter-relations between water quality objectives and the development of legislation for water resources management in Europe are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The application of a variety of reservoir yield estimation methods is described against the background of a review of yield in Scotland. The study is timely, both in the context of the possible effects of climate change, the institutional re-organisation of the water industry world-wide-but originating largely from the UK-and the emerging issues of sustainability and the shift from supply to demand side management. To set the paper in context, the study was undertaken just prior to the transfer of responsibility for water supply from regional councils to new water authorities in 1996, and following the quinquennial Scottish Office Environment Department's survey of water resources in 1994. A comparative review of assessment methods was undertaken in order to recommend a flexible and consistent approach for single sources, but with a view to extending this to conjunctive schemes. A case study of Loch Bradan showed that the derivation of the inflow record and definition of the catchment boundary are at least as important as the yield assessment method itself.

AB Hydrology in Scotland has emerged as a diverse and maturing discipline in recent years following its origins in engineering and the environmental sciences. Despite significant progress in understanding the physical, chemical and biological aspects of the hydrological cycle in Scotland, hydrologists face a number of significant challenges. These include: improved basic process understanding and modelling of catchment functioning; increased understanding of climatic variability and change; the collection of more extensive and well-integrated data sets; improved understanding of the role of hydrology in maintaining good ecological status in managed rivers; and a rapidly evolving policy agenda both within Scotland and the EU. So far, the response of the scientific community to these challenges has been encouraging. However, it is concluded that in the future, hydrologists need to be increasingly engaged in interdisciplinary research projects and communicate better with environmental planners and various stakeholder groups if the discipline is going to make its full contribution to sustainable water resource management in Scotland.

TI Input-output models for the analysis of a local/global supply chain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB A supply chain can be analysed as a network of production processes which can be localised within and outside a given geographic area. Each process can be defined as a system that produces output flows in consequence of input flows.
   In this paper, an input-output approach based on production processes is used to develop specific models that investigate flows among production processes either of a whole (global) supply chain or of a part of the supply chain localised within a given area (local). By-product and waste outputs are also considered. The developed models can help improve design and management of supply chains also in terms of sustainable development of a local area. In fact, this use of the input-output analysis entails a deeper understanding of the relationships among the processes and the environment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most people in developed countries will live with a serious, eventually fatal, chronic condition for months or years before dying; yet, the delivery of health care services has only just recently begun adapting to this reality. Quality improvement methods have been effective in helping clinical services to make substantial changes quickly.
   Quality improvement requires stating an aim, measuring success, and testing possible improvements. The testing of changes requires a clinical team to Plan, Do, Study, and Act on new insights (the "PDSA cycle"). Repeated PDSA cycles generate deep understanding of complex systems and make sustainable improvements rapidly.
   This paper discusses a composite case study in a nursing home setting, which builds on experience with multisite collaborative efforts and introduces quality improvement methods in the context of end-of-life care.

TI OR, ethics and decisions: the OATH of PROMETHEUS
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT EURO 2000 Conference
CY 2000
CL BUDAPEST, HUNGARY
DE decision aid; physics; ethics; OR
AB This paper sums up the ideas submitted to the OR community at the opening lecture of the EURO XVII Conference in Budapest on 17th July 2000. This paper aims to promote a movement in favour of Ethics in OR.
   The role of OR is first emphasised. An analogy with Physics is considered. There are strong similarities between OR and Physics but also major differences. While Physics models Natural Real World Phenomena, OR faces Human Systems. However, in Physics "GOD" keeps the decision stick unchanged, i.e. the laws of Physics remain the same, while in OR the responsible actor is the Decision-maker. "GOD" has been replaced by man: it is a Promethean-like situation.
   It is then suggested that all decisions should be well-balanced between the influence of three poles. In the early years of OR a "Rational pole" was first developed. From the 1970s a "Subjective pole" has been considered to include emotionality, real-life experience and the preferences of the Decision-maker. In the future an "Ethical pole" should also be taken into account in order to respect the social and the ecological environment of the affected people, and to promote sustainable development for future generations.
   In order to stimulate an ethical dialogue, and a commitment by the OR community, an OATH of PROMETHEUS, is now proposed. The author hopes that all over the world OR researchers will support this action and take the oath. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To predict the potential effects of future global environmental changes (e.g. climate, land-use, fire disturbance, and forest harvesting) on the sustainability of forest ecosystems, forest resource managers will need forest simulation models. Basic approaches to modelling forest growth and dynamics include the use of empirical, mechanistic, and hybrid forest simulation models. In this paper, a hybrid, monthly time-step model of forest growth and carbon dynamics (TRIPLEX) is described and tested. The TRIPLEX model integrates the forest production model of 3-PG (For. Ecol. Manage. 95 (1997) 209), the forest growth and yield model of TREENYD3 (Ecol. Model. 90 (1996) 187), and the soil-carbon-nitrogen model of CENTURY4.0 (Global Biogeochem. Cycles 7 (1993) 785). The model is intended to be comprehensive without becoming complex, and minimizes the number of input parameters required, while capturing key processes and important interactions between the carbon and nitrogen cycles of forest ecosystems. It is designed as a hybrid of both empirical and mechanistic components that can be used for (1) making forest management decisions (e.g. growth and yield prediction), (2) quantifying forest carbon budgets, and (3) assessing the effects of climate change in both the short and long term. We tested TRIPLEX against age-dependent growth measurements from 12 permanent sample plots (PSP) in jack pine (Pinus banskiana Lamb.) stands in northern Ontario (Canada). Comparisons of simulated stand growth variables (e.g. tree diameter, height, and stem density) with those observed in PSPs indicated a good agreement over 30 years. Predictions of tree total volume and aboveground biomass were within the expected range for these plots. While the model is promising, future modifications are discussed.

To reduce the complexity it is common to model such ecological systems at different scales with differing degrees of detail. Incompatibilities between models at different planning levels may create implementation problems. This research shows that modern optimisation algorithms and fast computing can solve integrative forest resource models at a resolution suitable for operational planning for forest regions where normally at least two levels of planning would be applied. Two packages are evaluated, SPECTRUM, a linear programming (LP) package, and HABPLAN, which uses the Metropolis algorithm to converge on the optimum solution. Preliminary indications are that both packages could handle the problem size, but the HABPLAN package had some additional features which makes it attractive for solving multi-objective problems with spatial components as in modelling sustainable forest management.

DE hollow logs; logging residues
AB To optimize the use of resources of Deramakot Forest Reserve, a model area for sustainable management of tropical forests in Sabah, Malaysia, a study on the utilization of hollow logs and other logging residues was initiated. In a pilot study, how much high quality timber can be extracted from trees regarded as hollow by the felling team of the logging contractor was evaluated. The amount of extractable timber considered as timber of low-quality (upper stem parts, top portions, big branches) was also determined. At the same time whether the chain saw method is a reliable method for the detection of hollow stems was tested.
   Results of the study were as follows:
   Several trees, which the sawyer considered to be hollow on the basis of the chain saw method were not hollow at all. The chain saw method proved to be unreliable for the determination of hollow logs or the extent of the hollow. It is suggested that the chain saw method be substituted by the drilling method, which determines the actual wall thickness of hollow logs. Furthermore, it is suggested that the responsibility for the detection of hollow trees be switched from the sawyers to the tree marking teams.
   The hollow trees analyzed contained large amounts of good timber (68-99% of the log volume up to the first branch).
   In view of modern wood processing techniques (e.g. finger jointing) the quality standards for logs suitable for log sales have to be changed.
   The concept of logging residue utilization has to be promoted. Education of contract forestry workers, field staff of the Forestry Department and of the license holders is required in order to change attitudes regarding log quality. A different remuneration system for sawyers has to be developed and implemented. The sawyer has to be encouraged to extract as much timber as possible within the cutting limits and not be discouraged from doing so as is currently the case.
   Recovery studies are required to determine the amount of sawn timber and other products produced from hollow log parts and from logging residues like upper stem parts, top portions and big branches.
   The technical and economic aspects of hollow log and residue extraction need to be evaluated through case studies.

AB Management decisions concerning impacts of projected changes in environmental and social conditions on multi-use forest products and services, such as productivity, water supply or carbon sequestration, may be facilitated with signal-transfer modeling. This simulation method utilizes a hierarchy of simulators in which the integrated responses (signals) from smaller-scale process models are transferred and incorporated into the algorithms of larger spatial- and temporal-scale models of ecological and economic phenomena. Several innovative procedures germane to multi-issue sustainable forest management have been initiated in our signal-transfer modeling development for forests of the southeastern United States. These developments include response surface interpolation for multi-factor signal-transfer, use of loblolly pine modeling to infer the growth of other southern pines, determination of soil nutrient limitations to productivity, multivariate clustering as a spatial basis for defining land units relevant to forest management, and variance propagation through the modeling hierarchy. Algorithms for larger scale phenomena are shown to constrain the variance introduced from a smaller-scale in a simulation of ambient ozone exposure effects on loblolly pine timber yield. Outputs of forest variables are frequency distributions that may be statistically compared for alternative environmental or management scenarios. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper begins with an analysis of flooding as a natural disaster for which the solutions to the environmental, social and economic problems are essentially those of identifying and overcoming hazards and vulnerability, reducing risk and damaging consequences. Long-term solutions to flooding problems, especially in a changing climate, should be sought in the wider context of developing more sustainable social organization, economics and technology. Then, developments are described of how scientific understanding, supported by practical modelling, is leading to predictions of how human-induced changes to climatic and geological conditions are likely to influence flooding over at least the next 300 years, through their influences on evaporation, precipitation, run-off, wind storm and sea-level rise. Some of the outstanding scientific questions raised by these problems are highlighted, such as the statistical and deterministic prediction of extreme events, the understanding and modelling of mechanisms that operate on varying length- and time-scales, and the complex interactions between biological, ecological and physical problems. Some options for reducing the impact of flooding by new technology include both improved prediction and monitoring with computer models, and remote sensing, flexible and focused warning systems, and permanent and temporary flood-reduction systems.

AB The Treaty of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) states in its Article 55: "...The High Authority shall promote technical and economical research relating to the production and increased use of coal and steel and to occupational safety in these industries... The results of research financed shall be made available to all concerned in the Community...". For the European steel industry Article 55 was the fundament for building-up a steel research programme covering the topics from raw materials to steel application and originated a European network of researchers from steel industry, research institutes and universities. Regarding the past 50 years iron and steelmaking has run through dramatic changes in technology and environmental impact. The ECSC steel research has contributed to nearly all important technology developments. The financial contribution of ECSC support represented about 8% of the money spent on research by the European iron and steel industry. The main objective of the ECSC steel Research and Technology Development (RTD) programme was to sustain and develop the Community steel industry's competitiveness. This report describes some projects carried through and results obtained in ECSC research works in the field of iron and steelmaking.

AB Sustainability requires living within the regenerative capacity of the biosphere. In an attempt to measure the extent to which humanity satisfies this requirement, we use existing data to translate human demand on the environment into the area required for the production of food and other goods, together with the absorption of wastes. Our accounts indicate that human demand may well have exceeded the biosphere's regenerative capacity since the 1980s. According to this preliminary and exploratory assessment, humanity's load corresponded to 70% of the capacity of the global biosphere in 1961, and grew to 120% in 1999.

AB Fishery management plans ignore the potential for evolutionary change in harvestable biomass. We subjected populations of an exploited fish (Menidia menidia) to large, small, or random size-selective harvest of adults over four generations. Harvested biomass evolved rapidly in directions counter to the size-dependent force of fishing mortality. Large-harvested populations initially produced the highest catch but quickly evolved a lower yield than controls. Small-harvested populations did the reverse. These shifts were caused by selection of genotypes with slower or faster rates of growth. Management tools that preserve natural genetic variation are necessary for long-term sustainable yield.

AB Environmental catalysis has continuously grown in importance over the last 2 decades not only in terms of the worldwide catalyst market, but also as a driver of advances in the whole area of catalysis. The development of innovative "environmental" catalysts is also the crucial factor towards the objective of developing a new sustainable industrial chemistry. In the last decade, considerable expansion of the traditional area of environmental catalysis (mainly NOx removal from stationary and mobile sources, and VOC conversion) has also occurred. New areas include: (i) catalytic technologies for liquid or solid waste reduction or purification; (ii) use of catalysts in energy-efficient catalytic technologies and processes; (iii) reduction of the environmental impact in the use or disposal of catalysts; (iv) new eco-compatible refinery, chemical or non-chemical catalytic processes; (v) catalysis for greenhouse gas control; (vi) use of catalysts for user-friendly technologies and reduction of indoor pollution; (vii) catalytic processes for sustainable chemistry; (viii) reduction of the environmental impact of transport. Therefore, a significant change has occurred in the last decade in the areas of interest regarding environmental catalysts and in the modality of approaching the research. This review, based on but not limited to the workshop "Environmental Catalysis: A Step Forward" (Maiori, Italy, May 2001), introduces the proceedings of this workshop reported in this issue of Catalysis Today and has the objective of providing an overview to the topic and setting the basis for a step forward in environmental catalysis research.

AB The present paper describes the results of studies directed to novel catalytic processes design for the environmentally friendly production of cellulose. The new delignification catalyst which is produced by chemical interaction of elemental sulfur with hydrazine in superbase medium was used for the improvement of efficiency and ecological purity of the conventional pulping process. This catalyst reduces the concentration of polysulfides in pulping liquor and the yield of side sulfur-containing compounds (by 1.5 times). The processes of wood delignification with sulfur-free reagents based on catalytic pulping with acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide and on the delignification of steam-activated wood with NaOH or Na2CO3 solutions have prospects for the environmentally benign production of cellulose. The new catalytic process of vanillin production by oxidation of lignosulfonates with molecular oxygen was described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A major issue that has long dogged federal human services demonstration programs is the perception that when federal dollars end, the programs end-regardless of any proven successes. Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports (ACCESS) was a 5-year federal demonstration project to foster partnerships between service providers for homeless people with serious mental illness and co-occurring substance abuse disorders; and to identify effective, replicable systems integration strategies. After federal funding ended, research teams visited the ACCESS sites to determine which project elements remained and which strategies were used by the sites to continue ACCESS. This article describes ACCESS services and systems integration activities retained by the sites, new funding streams, and strategies used to obtain continued funding.

AB Increasing dependence on off-farm inputs including, fertilizers, pesticides and energy for food and fiber production in the United States and elsewhere is of questionable sustainability resulting in environmental degradation and human health risks. The organic (no synthetic fertilizer or pesticide use), and low-input (reduced amount of synthetic fertilizer and pesticide use), farming systems are considered to be an alternative to conventional fanning systems, to enhance agricultural sustainability and environmental quality. Soil N availability and leaching potential, crop yields and weeds are important factors related to agricultural sustainability and environmental quality, yet information on long-term fanning system effects on these factors, especially in the organic and low-input fanning systems is limited. Four fanning systems: organic, low-input, conventional (synthetic fertilizer and pesticides applied at recommended rates) 4-year rotation (conv-4) and a conventional 2-year rotation (conv-2) were evaluated for soil mineral N, potentially mineralizable N (PMN), crop yields and weed biomass in irrigated processing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) from 1994 to 1998 in California's Sacramento Valley. Soil mineral N levels during the cropping season varied by crop, farming system, and the amount and source of N fertilization. The organic and low-input systems showed 112 and 36% greater PMN pools than the conventional systems, respectively. However, N mineralization rates of the conventional systems were 100% greater than in the organic and 28% greater than in the low-input system. Average tomato fruit yield for the 5-year period (1994-1998) was 71.0 Mg ha(-1) and average corn grain yield was 11.6 Mg ha(-1) and both were not significantly different among farming systems. The organic system had a greater aboveground weed biomass at harvest compared to other systems. The lower potential risk of N leaching from lower N mineralization rates in the organic and low-input fanning systems appear to improve agricultural sustainability and environmental quality while maintaining similar crop yields.

ID SYSTEMS; MODEL
AB Cropping, when possible, tends to become more important than animal production because, in general, it can feed more people per area unit in terms of calories and protein. In such systems, the role of wasteland grazing as a source of energy for agriculture through animals for traction and dung is often taken over by the use of resources from fossil reserves. This changing role of animals in the sustainability of agriculture is addressed in this paper to discuss options and constraints for animal production in newly developing fanning systems. Based on a brief literature review, this paper discusses how and in which way ruminant livestock has played or can continue to play a role in (newly developing forms of) sustainable agriculture. The role of livestock in different modes of agriculture ranging from expanded agriculture (EXPAGR), and high external inputs agriculture (HEIA) to low external inputs agriculture (LEIA), and new conservation agriculture (NCA) are elaborated. It is argued that even when fossil reserves based external inputs such as oil and fertilisers become more widely used, they should still be used with care to save money and finite resources as well as to avoid problems of waste disposal. However, in conditions with limited access to resources, it continues to be difficult to obtain inputs from fossil reserves. Under these conditions, the major options to increase system sustainability by reducing pollution problems and dependency on external resources are (a) to adjust ways and objectives of production systems to the access to resources, and (b) to achieve increased use and recycling of resources within the system itself. Definitions for sustainability are given and translated into four criteria, i.e. food production and degree of self-sufficiency in the short term based on energy, protein, clothing, shelter, etc.; food production and degree of self-sufficiency in the long term expressed in the form of soil organic matter (SOM) content; reduced dependence of external inputs (=nitrogen use); and aspects of resilience, stability and equity in crop-livestock systems. The results of scenario studies concerning use of grass and legume leys for livestock production illustrate options and trade-offs for different crop-livestock combinations in terms of these criteria for sustainability.

AB Development of environmentally and economically sound agricultural production systems is an important aim in agricultural policy and has a high priority in agricultural research worldwide. The present work uses results from the first complete crop rotation period (1990-1997) of the Apelsvoll cropping system experiment in south-eastern Norway to discuss the effect of cropping systems and their management practices on environment, soil fertility, crop yields and the farm economy, and how this knowledge may be used to develop a more sustainable agriculture. The experiment includes conventional arable (CON-A), integrated arable (INT-A), ecological arable (ECO-A), conventional forage (CON-F), integrated forage (INT-F) and ecological forage (ECO-F) cropping systems which were established on model farms of 0.2 ha. On the basis of nutrient runoff, soil erosion and pesticide contamination, the following ranking from the most to the least favourable was made for environmental effects: INT-F > ECO-F > ECO-A > INT-A > CON-F > CON-A. Environmental effects such as N and P runoff losses were very much linked to the proportion of ley in the system. Thus, major improvements to reduce the effects of agriculture on nutrient runoff, cannot be achieved without changing the cropping systems in the direction of more mixed fanning with reduced cropping intensity. The nutrient balance calculations showed that there were considerable deficits in the ecological systems, a fact which must be taken into consideration in the development of sustainable ecological cropping systems. The yield reduction experienced with integrated and ecological cropping, relative to conventional cropping, was smaller for forage crops and potatoes than for cereals. This suggests that it is easier to maintain the yield level by reduced cropping intensity in mixed farming systems with livestock than in arable fanning systems without livestock. Because of the premium prices and government subsidies to ecological fanning, the economic results were equally good in the ecological systems as in the conventional ones. Economically, integrated farming was less favourable than the other systems. It is concluded that, overall, integrated and ecological forage systems results in the least environmental harm, and based upon the present government subsidies, the forage systems also seem the most profitable, along with the ecological arable system.

AB This paper sets a framework for intervention in the relationship between biodiversity and tourism against the background of the Convention on Biological Diversity. It is argued that intervention cannot and should not only be based on considerations of measurable impacts of tourism on biodiversity alone. This action should also be weighed against arguments of legitimacy, feasibility, and effectiveness of its various types. Currently, feasibility seems to be the main principle on which interventions are based. As most instruments are non-compulsory, they are effective only to a limited extent. For reasons of legitimacy, the position of small-scale entrepreneurs should receive more attention in international and national policy debates.

AB Metal nanocontacts of Cu, Ag, Ni, Pd, and Pb were fabricated via the electrochemical etching or deposition method at a gap of sustainable thin Au wires in solution. Relatively stable behaviors of the conductance quantization exhibiting a unit value were apparent at the contacts of Cu, Ag, Ni, and Pd at room temperature. Conductance quantization behavior of the Pb contact was rather unstable in comparison with other metals. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.

AB This paper presents a method to evaluate the effects of different fisheries development intensities on aquatic vegetation by using a geographic information system (GIS) in Honghu Lake, one of the largest shallow lakes in the middle to lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Data for aquatic plants surveyed at 34 sampling stations in July 1992 were employed for this application. The aquatic plants were divided into two categories: aquatic plants favoured (APF) or not favoured (APNF) by fish, respectively. The aquatic plant utilization, which represents different fisheries development intensity, in a sampling stand was defined according to its biomass and species composition (APF or APNF dominated). Four different utilization levels were distinguished: low, high, long-time restoration after over-utilization and short-time restoration after over-utilization. For each utilization level, four sample stands were chosen to obtain the biomass-water depth relation, which was then applied to obtain the distribution of biomass over the entire lake. Under low and high utilization levels, the simulated average biomass was 7420 and 5260 g m(-2) respectively, with APF contributing most to the standing crop. The restored biomass after over-utilization depends on restoration time. The simulated average biomass of short-time restoration was 5530 g m(-2) with APF 500 g m(-2). The calculated average biomass of long-time restoration would reach 12360 g m(-2) with APF 720 g m(-2). Limiting the scale of fish-pen-culture and improving the way of utilizing aquatic plants favourable to herbivorous fish is vital for sustainable development of the lake.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB 1. Fresh water and the ecosystem functions of catchments are essential to all life, and provide benefits upon which society depends. Yet there is widespread evidence of increasing degradation of river quality in many parts of the world.
   2. Rivers are complex living systems, and must be managed on a systemic basis. Historic parochial approaches to management can exacerbate wider-scale problems by degrading ecosystem functions.
   3. Reversal of long-term ecosystem degradation. not merely reducing the rate of ongoing damage to ecosystem functioning, is vital for achieving sustainability. In an already ecologically impoverished world, restoring ecosystem functions and the capacity of catchments to support human needs may be the only form of investment in a sustainable longer-term future.
   4, A 'building block' approach can enable local issues to be addressed by technologies that protect or restore ecosystem functions at the catchment scale. They may also represent a cost-effective means for targeting investment.
   5. Shifts in thinking and action are required if a move from a reactive to a systemic approach to the water environment is to be achieved. These shifts include acknowledgement of the central importance of ecosystem functions. protecting these functions through management action, valuing them appropriately. and taking longer-term and wider-scale perspectives in management decisions. A focus on restoration of function at the catchment scale, achieved through greater inclusion of all sectors of society in decision-making. is an essential element of this approach.

DE integrated river basin management; strategic planning; flood management
AB 1. There is now an irresistible momentum for a truly integrated and strategic approach to river basin management. As a consequence, the framework within which individual organizations can carry out their roles and responsibilities in a co-ordinated and sustainable way can be determined.
   2. Extreme events such as floods and droughts have severe social and economic consequences, 'Traditional' engineered responses, which take little account of fluvial processes and ecosystem functioning. often exacerbate these problems and can have severe adverse consequences on the environment.
   3. Bringing together a range of scientific, technical and engineering disciplines to address catchment management has many advantages. Identifying and implementing innovative solutions that benefit local communities and the environment is the only sustainable way forward for river management.
   4. Public understanding of risk assessment and management is vital to the success of an integrated approach. So too is a strategic dimension to inform the town and country planning system and major investment decisions by major utilities and public bodies responsible for water supply. pollution control and flood management.
   5. There are major challenges ahead for public utilities, agencies and professional bodies in terms of attracting, retaining and blending together skilled scientific, engineering and technical specialists. These skills need to be complemented by the ability to convey sophisticated information in readily understood language. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB 1. Sustainable river management is the proclaimed aim of many agencies and institutions, but it remains challenging to bring this worthy ideal from the level of political rhetoric to that of practical river management.
   2. Amongst the many drivers that already pressure the river manager. from internal institutional goals, through political aspirations to systemic change within the biophysical process systemic one common element emerges, that of prevailing uncertainty.
   3. Once it has been accepted that conventional science and engineering approaches to uncertainty (risk) minimization may be sub-optimal in a truly holistic (biophysical, socio-economic, political) system, the challenge emerges of developing a more appropriate framework without destroying over-burdened managers and management systems in the process.
   4. It is argued that the necessary components are often already in place or under consideration. A linked model is proposed comprising practical measures of sustainability, robust approaches to uncertainty (if necessary, involving attitude change), responsive (adaptive) management frameworks, and an important underpinning of fuzzy decision support.

AB 1. Under definitions of 'strong' sustainability, ecosystem protection and the valuation of natural goods and services figure prominently. These priorities also lie at the heart of the EC Water Framework Directive (WFD).
   2. This paper explores the ability of fluvial geomorphology to describe, monitor and predict river channel conditions and behaviour at the basin and smaller scales. It also examines how geomorphology can help to create management 'tools' and work in interdisciplinary frameworks with freshwater ecology to assess instream physical habitat.
   3. Systematic views of river basins and predictive techniques based on system drivers have been popular in fluvial geomorphology for 50 years. System states are seen as resulting from the balance between all relevant processes, However. channel dimensions and forms at a site are much harder to predict and their dynamic adjustment can occur rapidly, exhibiting 'threshold' behaviour.
   4. Direct human impacts have been a focus of research but long-term monitoring of channel states and adjustments has been neglected: River Habitat Survey offers major opportunities in this respect, even though it was not designed specifically for geomorphological interpretation.
   5. In the UK. local or 'reach'-scale channel adjustment is widespread. justifying a major empirical survey effort in support of management decisions. Channels are supply-limited in sediment terms, polycyclic in profile. confined within glacial and periglacial sediments and extensively manipulated by engineering modifications. Whilst system properties are vital to the choice of management options over long timescales. conditions on a hierarchy of smaller scales can confound the systematic attempts of geomorphologists to classify and predict channel states.
   6. Freshwater ecologists have long appreciated the need for a scaled approach to river systems. This paper argues for extensions to shared data collection and analysis programmes before immutable policy becomes established around unfinished management tools. Adaptive management creates a more realistic medium for the use of uncertain geomorphological and ecological predictions. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB 1. Riverside Explorer is an interactive educational CD-ROM specially developed by the Environment Agency to enable schools in England and Wales to use River Habitat Survey (RHS) data. It has five modules, an illustrated glossary and teaching aids, including example case studies.
   2. A simplified form of the RHS database containing information and photographs from 4500 river sites in England and Wales was used to provide an attractive classroom resource, relevant to the national teaching curriculum for 9-14 year olds. This enables teachers and pupils to explore rivers in their locality and further afield, and in so doing help them understand how river processes, features and wildlife are linked.
   3. Copies of the CD-ROM were distributed free of charge to all primary and secondary schools in England and Wales, Questionnaire returns and other responses show that where it has been used Riverside Explorer has proved popular.
   4. In classroom teaching the CD-ROM is mostly used in a structured way for learning about the key features of a river basin, and to chart downstream changes along the course of a river. It is also used to investigate the habitat requirements of river wildlife, and to help pupils learn how to observe features in their local river and make comparisons with those elsewhere.
   5. The database and the example case-studies are currently under-used by teachers. This may in part be because teachers are not yet confident enough to develop new learning activities using the CD-ROM, but more generally because of time constraints imposed by heavy teaching workloads.
   6. To encourage greater use of the analytical and diagnostic elements of Riverside Explorer, teachers need more guidance to help their pupils discover ways in which rivers can be managed more sustainably and how this fits into the new National Curriculum for schools.

AB 1 Sustainable river management demands a strategic approach that renders even routine decisions highly complex if they are to be consistent, transparent and accountable. Under these circumstances, there is an increasing need for decision-support systems, although carefully structured guidelines and statements of best practice will continue to play a major supporting role.
   2. This support is likely to be particularly important in wide-ranging contexts, from routine decisions in determining land drainage consents, to complex decisions involving significant uncertainty. Sustainable Upland River Corridor Management Evaluation System (SURCoMES) has been developed as a prototype system to demonstrate the potential scope and problems for providing decision support in complex and uncertain scenarios.
   3. In its present form it focuses on the selection of management responses to problems of river bank erosion. It caters for uncertainty by providing guidance as to whether a particular decision is more or less sustainable than alternative options. It does not determine whether actions are absolutely sustainable or not.
   4. Because of the judgemental nature of the questions, underlying criteria and standards have been built into the system. These evaluations, are, in part, subjective, even when based on existing best practice and experience, so a Delphi technique approach has been used to capture professional opinion from the research sector and the Environment Agency which is responsible for river management in England and Wales.
   5. Decision support will undoubtedly have an important future in sustainable environmental management. The SURCoMES approach indicates potential applications. but the system requires further development and validation before it is implemented more widely. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Recent research has provided important principles to follow in successfully revegetating disturbed lands in arid climates. Sustainable revegetation needs to be accomplished within the confines of the existing ecosystem of the area. Revegetation planning, revegetation implementation. and evaluation and monitoring should be considered for each revegetation project. Planning includes conducting a site assessment, establishing goals and standards, determining site preparation requirements, selecting species, selecting revegetation techniques selecting conservation and water management treatments, determining timing, and evaluating costs. Revegetation implementation begins with the selection of an on-site manager who will monitor adherence to the revegetation plan, conduct prejob meetings, and ensure revegetation is implemented as planned. Project evaluation arid long-term management includes conducting on-site inspections, evaluating success, and implementing modification where neccssary. Successful revegetation projects completed within the Great Basin and Mojave Desert ecoregions are presented. Seeding and transplanting prove to be successful in Great Basin ecoregion. Irrigation was used with highly predictable success in transition zone between Great Basin and, Mojave Desert ecoregions. Seed pretreatment, irrigation, arid various mulches show Promise for successful revegetation in the drier Mojave Desert ecoregion.

AB Nganabbarru, or water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), is frequently hunted by Aboriginal men, and buffalo meat is an important food source for many Arnhem Land Aboriginal communities. The experience of buffalo hunting trips with Aboriginal men who reside at Korlohbidahdah outstation in central Arnhem Land is used as a point of departure to consider the relationships between Aboriginal people and megaherbivores in the past and the present, and to explore the complexity of feral animal management in cross-cultural settings. This enquiry raised the question of the cultural conception of feral animals and demonstrates that there is no simple answer to the question: what is a buffalo? Buffaloes have been the focus of a colonial economic industry and are iconic of the Territorian way of life. However, they spread economically significant livestock diseases and cause widespread environmental damage. In the 1980s feral buffalo populations were the target of the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC) control program. The failure to continue control programs following the cessation of BTEC program and inadequate consultation with Aboriginal landowners has meant that today's land managers are once again faced with conflicting views about controlling feral buffalo populations on Aboriginal land and within National Parks like Kakadu. It is concluded that there are genuine, previously overlooked opportunities for cross-cultural collaboration in managing feral buffaloes. Cross-disciplinary research involving ecologists, anthropologists, linguists, economists and environmental historians is required to help develop sustainable and culturally appropriate feral animal control programs.

AB In this paper we will introduce the application of our newly patented double hierarchical Fuzzy-Genetic system (British patent 99-10539.7) to produce an intelligent autonomous outdoor agricultural mobile robot capable of learning and calibrating its controller online in a short time interval and implementing a life long learning strategy. The online and life long learning strategy allow the outdoor robots to increase their experience and adapt their controllers in the face of the changing and dynamic unstructured outdoor agricultural environments. Such characteristics permit prolonged periods of operation within dynamic agricultural environments, which is an essential feature for the realization of a platform vehicle for use in sustainable agriculture and organic farming.

TI Nitrogen use efficiency in German agriculture since 1950: Facts and
   evaluation
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
ID ARABLE SOILS; CULTIVATION
AB The present agricultural production system in Germany is characterized by a high degree of commercial N-fertilizer and imported fodder use. Because the N use efficiency is low, a large part of the applied N is emitted in a reactive form into the environment. The possible damage caused in the environment so far has been investigated only partly. The objective of the present study therefore was to quantifiy this environmental damage. To this end, the yearly N surplus in German agriculture since 1951 was estimated with the use of statistical data on national agriculture. With the use of literature data, we showed how, and to which extent, surplus N is emitted into the environment. We also evaluated monetarily the environmental damage. To judge the magnitude of the environmental damage, the monetary damage was compared with the economical output of agriculture. Our calculations aim at directing ways to develop a sustainable agricultural production system, to which Germany has committed itself by signing the Agenda 21.
   For the period under study (1951 to 2000), we calculated from the difference between the N input by commercial fertilizers and imported fodder, and the N output by animal and crop products the annual N surplus. This surplus increased from about 10 kg/ha in the 1950s to 120 kg/ha in the 1980s, and amounted to 70-80 kg/ha in the 1990s. In case additional N inputs are considered, such as N fixation by legume crops, N deposition from the atmosphere, or N input by compost and sludge, and if the lay-off cropland area is subtracted from the total agricultural land area, the calculated N surplus per hectare of cropland is considerably larger. For 1995, for example, in this case a N surplus of nearly 150 kg/ha is calculated, which is emitted largely into the environment (ground and surface waters, atmosphere). The annual external costs caused by these emissions are estimated at 2.5 to 10.0 billion DM (approximate to 1.25 to 5.0 EU$). Furthermore we point out, that particularly animal products are consumed to such an extent that it harms the population's health. Stimulating and subsidizing organic farming may help to reduce the excessive use of nitrogen in today's agriculture. It appears, that in view of the present state of science and technology, the NO3 and agricultural N surplus problem in Germany can be solved enduringly only with a significant reduction in animal production.

TI Models for improving cataract surgical rates in southern China
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background/aims: Unoperated cataract is the main challenge to blindness reduction in China. This demonstration project in Guangdong Province was designed to test various strategies to improve the cataract surgical rate.
   Methods: Two strategies (reduction of the cataract surgical fee and training of country doctors in the detection of cataract blindness) were implemented in each of two counties. Both interventions were introduced in a third county.
   Results: The cataract surgery rate (CSR) per million was 366 in the county where training took place, 588 where the fee was lowered, and 1140 where both interventions took place. The improvement in CSR was highly significant (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: In southern China, CSR can be increased with community based measures. Sustainability for such measures will be the major future challenge.

AB Activities related to refurbishment of the building stock as a percentage of all building work have been constantly growing in most central European countries over the last 20 years. The main argument in this paper is the need to improve knowledge about composition of the existing building stock, the dynamics of its transformation and to relate this to the different actors in property professions. A review is presented of traditional and new sectoral research approaches to partial or national building stocks to provide a context for assessing an integrated approach to the German building stock with methodological propositions for improving the synergy between different sectoral approaches. Detailed consideration is given to life cycle analysis, building product modelling, historical building research and new simulation techniques. Sustainability indicators and the integration of building stock, infrastructure and land use are discussed.

AB This article considers the issue of economic development as a component of coastal management initiatives in developed countries, focusing on the Forth Estuary Forum as a case study. The evolution of coastal management into integrated coastal management is briefly considered, as is the context of the Scottish coastal management system and a brief discussion of the variations between the different legal systems within the UK. The current hurdles to economic development and the views of developers and economic agencies being considered in the coastal management process itself are highlighted, illustrating the process of integration and the current voluntary regime in the UK, particularly in the Forth Estuary Forum. The article concludes that economic development issues must be taken seriously if coastal management is to be integrated and inclusive.

ID ENERGY ANALYSIS; AGRICULTURE
AB Horse traction in the context of Sweden 1927 and tractor traction in the context of Sweden 1996 were compared in terms of their resource requirements. Flows of energy, material and service from the environment and the economy were identified for the two traction-producing systems, The environmental work and human activity involved in generating necessary inputs for the systems were evaluated on a common basis, using emergy analysis. The main difference between the systems was found in their energy signature. Sixty percent of the horse inputs were renewable, compared with only 9% renewable inputs for the tractor. Ecological technology was replaced by mechanical technology. This represented a shift from a technology that was maintained and driven by mainly locally-generated qualities and driven on local flow-limited renewable sources to a technology controlled and supported by non-local processes and driven on non-renewable sources. A decrease in available fuels and minerals might cause a change in the choice of technology and ecological technology might then be reintroduced into our society as a whole and not only into the agricultural sector. Evaluating management strategies that consider direct and indirect requirements for natural resources from the economic system and 'free' natural resources from the environment currently requires a method able to integrate both. Emergy analysis provides that ability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A number of recent developments in the application of the theory are considered and the origin of the differences between adaptive thermal comfort and the 'rational' indices is explored. The application of the adaptive approach to thermal comfort standards is considered and recommendations made as to the best comfort temperature, the range of comfortable environments and the maximum rate of change of indoor temperature. The application of criteria of sustainability to thermal standards for buildings is also considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Method to regenerate ammonia for the capture of carbon dioxide
SO ENERGY & FUELS

DT Article
ID CO2; ABSORPTION; RECOVERY
AB Compared to the conventional MEA process for the capture of carbon dioxide from flue gas, the ammonia scrubbing technique provides advantages of lower material costs and less corrosion to absorber, as well as the potential for saving energy, which will eventually make the process less expensive. However, in addition to the highly volatile nature of ammonia, the lack of a method to separate ammonia from CO2 after thermal decomposition of ammonium bicarbonate also hinders the ammonia scrubbing technique from being applied in practice. This paper investigates a method to regenerate ammonia so as to allow for the ammonia scrubbing technique to be practical in the capture of CO2. In the new method, a weakly basic ion-exchange resin containing amine functional groups is used to regenerate ammonia through absorbing carbonic acid at ambient temperatures from ammonium bicarbonate, the main product formed after the absorption Of CO2 by ammonia. The resin can then be regenerated when it is heated by water at temperatures equal to or greater than 50 degreesC. A 50% energy saving can be expected of the new method when compared to the energy requirement of the MEA process. Also, through several runs of a resin absorption--desorption experiment, the sustainability of the resin for the regeneration of ammonia from ammonium bicarbonate was evidently demonstrated. The regeneration capability of the resin can be maintained consistently at 87% of the original regeneration capability of the resin. The issue of the volatility of ammonia is also addressed.

AB This paper attempts to estimate the maintenance cost of water pollution abatement measures to the Indian industry using the methodology of distance function in the theory of production. The distance function is estimated using both programming and stochastic frontier models for a sample of water polluting industries in India. The firm-specific shadow prices for pollutants, measures of efficiency, and scale economies are estimated. Estimates show that on average the cost to the Indian industry for reducing one ton of BOD and COD are respectively, Rs 0.246 and 0.077 million. Large differences in the estimates of firm-specific shadow prices of pollutants reflect the use of inefficient water pollution abatement technologies. The relationships between firm-specific shadow prices or marginal costs of abatement of BOD and COD and the index of compliance (ratio of effluent load to sale value) and the pollution load reductions obtained confirm the earlier empirical results of studies on water pollution abatement in Indian industries. The earlier studies have found increasing marginal costs with respect to reductions in pollution concentrations and decreasing marginal cost with respect to the pollution loads reduced by the firms.

AB The author argues that organic-coffee certification enacted under the rubric of transnational certification norms alters the logic and practice of economic management and governance in an Oaxacan (Mexican) peasant producers' union. As the title indicates, these changes are productive of social and economic tensions. An economic and ethnographic analysis of 'certification labor' demonstrates (a) that the work of certification is distributed within producer organizations such that village and regional leaders become burdened by significant new responsibilities, and (b) that practical changes-including a new producer logic ('market-price interdependence') and village certification-service providers ('peasant inspectors' and 'community technical officers')-have a significant qualitative impact upon household and village economic governance. In addition, certification (c) affects the operation of statewide producer unions, altering the ways in which these interact both with their member organizations and with certifiers: unions must intervene to aid (regional) member organizations in their efforts to certify, yet also find that certification norms, such as conflict-of-interest provisions, constrain the union's ability to promote producer interests. Thus a qualification to an organic and ethical-products literature that conflates quality certification with the protection of smallholder cultural and economic independence is provided. The author concludes that a rethinking of certification norms, together with efforts to assist producer certification, should be a priority for supporters of sustainable agriculture.

AB Over the last two decades shifting human resources, socioeconomic potentials, and innovations in information technology and communication have all but overthrown the formal order of the planning and management of urban systems. The authors trace the causes to misplaced priorities in urban governance and related issues, via the interface of infrastructure systems and land use. They survey some major theoretical and applied decision-support systems collaborative planning systems, and collaborative decision-support systems which have been advanced to date, indicating their strengths and weaknesses with regard to their ability to anchor public participation and professional collaboration in key planning and management issues. They highlight the fact that, although relevant multivariate, disaggregated, and incoherent small-scale researches do yield high dividends, their lack of cohesive interrelationship is related to the fragmentation of urban systems-despite various attempts at bringing about sustainable development. They suggest that decisionmaking can be effective when all aspects involved are visually related and collectively executed. They conclude by emphasizing that a comprehensive approach needs to be adopted for the planning and management of urban centers in order to enhance systems performance, human interaction, and contained developments.

AB California and other regions in the United States are becoming more populated and ethnically diverse, and thus, ecological impacts on the wildland-urban interface are a significant policy concern. In a socioeconomic assessment focused on the geographic regions surrounding four national forests in southern California, population projections are being formulated to assist in the update of forest plans. In southern California, the projected trend of explosive population growth combined with increased ethnic and racial diversity indicates four challenges for environmental management. First, patterns of recreation use on wildlands are likely to change, and management of these areas will have to address new needs. Second, as land-management agencies face changing constituencies, new methods of soliciting public involvement from ethnic and racial groups will be necessary. Third, growth in the region is likely to encroach upon wildland areas, affecting water, air, open space, and endangered species. Fourth, in order to address all these concerns in a climate of declining budgets, resource management agencies need to strengthen collaborative relationships with other agencies in the region. How environmental managers approach these changes has widespread implications for the ecological sustainability of forests in southern California.

AB A support tool system comprising risk and priority analyses was illustrated in a geographical information system environment and also tested with data from two forest protection areas for comparison of the system output. The system is recommended as a management monitoring tool for areas where village forest protection at a local level is taking place. The geographical area in the eastern part of India is subject to scarcity of forest resources and is representative in the context of widespread occurrence of local forest protection. Data used were topography, hectares protected, population census, distance to forest and other villages, degree of forest regeneration, presence of plantations, age of protection, surrounding forest resources, and population mix. Methods used were digitizing information for the systems' different layers, analyses of satellite information, field work, gathering of local information, and the application of five risk/priority analyses: erosion, ecological and institutional sustainability, conflict, and degree of dependency.
   Questions asked were how the different analyses should be interpreted and how the system could be kept updated. The results show that the system needs resource-demanding and field assistance to be kept dynamic. The system is also dependent on the interpretations of the analyses. The limits or levels of assistance for forest management depend on the resources available. The system illustrates how a tool can be utilized for decisions regarding input of resources. It can further be very useful in defining and comparing different areas in order to detect areas in need of assistance and the type of help needed.

AB Research suggests that political will to deliver improvements in the quality of surface water in the UK and across the EU, alongside measures to place tighter controls on the quality of biosolids applied to agricultural land, will augment the levels of energy used in sewage and sludge treatment. This coincides with increasing concerns over the use of fossil fuel derived energy sources and their potential to enhance the Earth's greenhouse effect and promote global climate change, creating a serious paradox for those responsible for managing the aquatic environment. However, previous research also suggests that novel technologies and practices could potentially mitigate the problem in hand. This paper describes the development of a model for estimating future energy use and CO2 emissions in the wastewater treatment sector, and outlines the results of different projections using incumbent and novel practices. Indications are that using incumbent approaches could augment CO2 emissions by 15-30% in the medium- to long-term, while loss of the agricultural sludge route and deployment of an incineration strategy could mean increases are of the order of 50-70%. Alternatively, the construction of a greater number of sludge treatment facilities, with greater biogas recovery, could reduce this burden to around -8 to +7% over the same period, while the realisation of the full potential an anaerobic pre-treatment process could lead to reductions of up to 16%. Nevertheless, some of the options will come at a higher cost then incumbents, and the potential for making the business case for these investments is explored.

DE temporarily-open estuary; phytoplankton; microphytobenthos; South Africa
AB Of South Africa's 250 estuaries, 182 (73% of the total) are classified as temporarily-open. There is, however, little information currently available on their physico-chemical-biological properties and processes. This study addresses some aspects of the primary biomass available in these systems, in order to provide basic information for their sustainable management. Six surveys were undertaken in the Mpenjati Estuary, on the Kwazulu-Natal south coast, during 1998/99. Results show that microphytobenthic chl a attains concentrations of up to 616 mg chl a m(-2), i.e. among the highest ever recorded for any South African estuary. Phytoplankton biomass in the estuary, on the other hand, varied from 0.14 to 15.4 mg chl a m(-3). These concentrations are lower than those recorded in the permanently open estuaries of southern Africa. Chl a concentrations in the sediment were one to three orders of magnitude higher than in the water-column, with an average ratio of water-column to sediment chl a of 0.054+/-0.11 SD. These results are analysed in the context of the alternation of closed and open phases of the estuary, and in relation to some key physico-chemical factors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS; TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS; SIGNATURE WHISTLES; CALLS
AB Oceanic dolphins (Odontoceti: Delphinidae) produce tonal whistles, the structure and function of which have been fairly well characterized. Less is known about the evolutionary origins of delphinid whistles, including basic information about vocal structure in sister taxa such as the Platanistidae river dolphins. Here we characterize vocalizations of the Amazon River dolphin (Inia geoffrensis ), for which whistles have been reported but not well documented. We studied Inia at the Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve in central Brazilian Amazonia. During 480 5-min blocks (over 5 weeks) we monitored and recorded vocalizations, noted group size and activity, and tallied frequencies of breathing and pre-diving surfaces. Overall, Inia vocal output correlated positively with pre-diving surfaces, suggesting that vocalizations are associated with feeding. Acoustic analyses revealed Inia vocalizations to be structurally distinct from typical delphinid whistles, including those of the delphinid Sotalia fluviatilis recorded at our field site. These data support the hypothesis that whistles are a recently derived vocalization unique to the Delphinidae.

TI Old-age security in the Baltics: Legacy, early reforms and recent trends
SO EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB LIKE OTHER FORMERLY SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, the three Baltic states have witnessed sweeping changes in their economies and societies since the late 1980s. Economic transformation affected the existing set of social security institutions in a number of ways. At the onset of market-oriented reforms, price liberalisation and the curtailment of subsidies on basic goods and services required a shift from indirect to direct transfers. At a later stage the restructuring of state-owned enterprises had an effect on both the revenue and the expenditure side of social security schemes. These systems, inherited from the socialist past, were in dire need of reform, to secure their financial sustainability, to meet the demographic challenges ahead and to adapt some of the previous design features to the new economic order. Sooner rather than later, post-socialist social policy thus had to shift from ad hoc emergency measures to institutional rebuilding, especially in the area of old-age security.
   The reform of pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension schemes is a challenging and frequently painful task that affects substantial entitlements, and involves difficult trade-offs in terms of goals and values (see Nelson, 2001). This study focuses on the reform experiences of the Baltics, a region witnessing substantial pension scheme changes in the past decade. In terms of their legacy, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania exhibit many similarities (see Mannik Leppik, 2002; Zilite, 2001). From the 1940s until August 1991, when long-standing efforts to obtain independence were finally successful, their societies and economics were integrated into the Soviet Union. In all Soviet republics the state pension system adopted in 1956 established uniform eligibility conditions for drawing a retirement pension. The minimum working record was 25 years for men and 20 years for women. Moreover, age 60 and 55 had to be reached by men and women respectively in order to receive an old-age pension. The pension formula considered only earnings levels reached during the pre-retirement years, as well as length and continuity of service. While overall pension differentials were small, due to the compressed wage structure, certain hazardous or privileged occupations-e.g. the police, teachers, miners and workers employed in heavy industry-could retire earlier and/or receive higher benefits, marking an important departure from universalism.(1) The scheme was financed from the state budget, via a non-earmarked social tax paid by all enterprises and organisations on gross payroll. Soviet pension benefits have often been described as relatively generous, but it should be noted that the pension was mostly the sole source of retirement income, as formal asset holding was uncommon in the Soviet Union (see Castel & Fox, 2001).
   The three Baltic states thus started from an identical old-age security system and faced similar transition-related challenges. While subsequent pension policy choices in the Baltics differed considerably, it is interesting to note that the most recent reform trends seem to point to a convergence of reform approaches. This article will start with a presentation of the three Baltic country cases, highlighting early reforms and recent trends in the area of old-age security. In a concluding section the post-socialist pension reform experiences of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania will be discussed comparatively.

TI Remapping labour rights: The case of transitional Lithuania
SO EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB THROUGHOUT THE MID-1990s Lithuania has competed with its neighbours for foreign direct investment (FDI). In this context Lithuanian governments of differing political persuasion have sought to attract foreign investors partly on account of the country's willing, educated and compliant workforce.(1) As part of this agenda, the myth of a stable prospering Lithuania with few social and economic problems has been actively promulgated by the country's press and its political elites. The January 2001 edition of EuroBusiness, for instance, contained a special Baltic states supplement with the title 'New Breeds of Tiger'. Among the specific virtues of Baltic Lithuania, EuroBusiness noted 'aggressive economic liberalisation, privatisations, wily courtship of foreign capital and the painful reorientation of trade away from volatile Russia'. All of these factors were said to 'have underpinned a truly remarkable flourishing of prospects, generating year upon year of high yet sustainable growth(2). The report went on to record that, according to the Wall Street Journal, Lithuania, and its next door neighbour Latvia, preceded only by Estonia, outranked Denmark, Finland and Germany in the 'league table of economic freedom'.(3) This ranking was not accidental, as one of the first actions of the newly elected government was to scrap a capital gains tax of 15% in December 2000.(4)
   Lithuania's attempt to portray itself to outsiders as a 'neo-liberal paradise', itself, is not untypical for the region. Since independence, and even more so since the advent of the Russian crisis, many Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries have faced increasingly incompatible policy objectives. On the one hand, policy actors are driven by an overwhelming desire to attract FDI at virtually any price, including the circumscription of the rights of organised labour. On the other hand, for a number of countries preparation for European accession imposes clear limitations on their policy options. Lastly, constraints on the political manoeuvring space of CEE governments arise from the possibility or actuality of social unrest or political instability.
   Using the example of changes to Lithuania's labour legislation since 1992, this article aims to map out the developing political economy that has evolved in the context of these conflicting goals. Specifically, our analysis focuses on the question as to whether the desire to attract FDI has led to a potential marginalisation of labour as an organised and political force, or whether such a development has been halted by compliance with requirements related to future European Union accession. In addition, we explore the concrete responses of the trade union sector to attempts to deregulate the Lithuanian labour market.
   In pursuing this agenda, our article does not attempt to gauge the level of social deprivation that characterises life in Lithuania today, nor do we seek to explore the literally schizophrenic split between social reality and the aspirations of the official and unofficial promoters of inward investment.(5) Suffice it to say that the Russian crisis, together with a host of domestic problems, has left Lithuania with pressing social problems that belie the propaganda of the regional business magazines. For Lithuanians these problems are nonetheless all too obvious. In its review for the year 2000 Lithuanian state television included a brief newsreel of a distraught middle-aged man being wrestled to the ground by three police officers before being bundled into the back of a police Lada. The man, who had doused himself in petrol and was about to set himself on fire in front of the presidential palace, was shouting 'let me die-I have nothing left to lose'. This incident was a solitary act of desperation by one of several dozens of workers who had been on hunger strike in protest against the non-payment of wages by defaulting employers at bankrupt enterprises.(6) The enterprise from which this worker had come, Litoda, was located in a town in the west of the country and formerly produced synthetic leather. In the new Lithuania, in which Mafia men and their legions of adolescent imitators strut in regulation black leather, the demand for its synthetic imitation had slumped, while export of this product had proved almost impossible. Although some hunger strikes lasted for six weeks and saw their participants removed to hospital with probable permanent physical damage, the local English-language press failed even to mention them. The local Lithuanian news, meanwhile, reported the savage beating by thugs of a strike leader who headed a protest demonstration marking the anniversary of one year of non-payment of wages owed to workers in a large Kaunas factory. In case the point was missed, the thugs did not bother to steal his wallet.
   Our analysis is based on two pillars. We commence with an examination of the framework of labour and employment legislation. This is followed by a review of current liberalisation measures and their public reception. We then attempt to identify what we would call, for lack of a better term, the determining interests which have framed, and are framing, the neo-liberal transformation of Lithuania. We come to the tentative conclusion that, although the Lithuanian state has been remapped so as to accommodate the interests of capital, potentially to the detriment of labour, there remains a possibility for a reassertion of organised labour and a concomitant reorientation of Lithuanian politics towards a left-centre consensus.

ID ANTI-IGE ANTIBODY; SERUM IGE; ASSOCIATION; CHILDREN
AB The ability of omalizumab, an anti-immnoglobulin-E agent, to maintain long-term disease control in patients with moderate-to-severe allergic asthma was investigated in a 24-week double-blind extension to a 28-week core trial.
   During the extension, 483 of the initial 546 patients were maintained on randomised treatment and the lowest sustainable dose of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) as established during the steroid-reduction phase of the core trial. The use of concomitant asthma medication was permitted and investigators were allowed to adjust the BDP dose or switch patients from BDP to other asthma medications if deemed necessary.
   More omalizumab-treated patients (33.5%) than placebo-treated patients (13.5%) were able to complete the extension period without requiring inhaled corticosteroid treatment. The mean BDP equivalent dose throughout the extension was lower in the omalizumab group (25 mug(.)day(-1)) than in the placebo group (43 mug(.)day(-1)). Disease control was sustained in 76% of omalizumab patients compared with 59.4% of placebo patients free from an asthma exacerbation during the extension period. Compared with placebo, fewer patients in the omalizumab group used other concomitant asthma medication during the extension. Treatment with omalizumab was well tolerated and the incidence of adverse events was similar between groups.
   In conclusion, these results suggest that omalizumab is a promising new agent for the long-term control of allergic asthma.

AB This paper deals with territory and economic development, highlighting the active role of territory in the development process. The main aim of the paper is to draw policy lessons from theoretical analysis and international comparison. After a short analysis of the debate about the literature on local development (industrial districts, endogenous development, regional innovation systems), the paper deals with the concept of 'local productive system', determined by a strict interaction between economy, society and territory. Local productive systems, through productive linkages and interaction among local actors, produce external economies (to local firms) and collective efficiency. Success stories of local development are based on the production of specific knowledge and resources, on collective learning. The creation of dynamic competitive advantages is, then, the crucial factor for a sustainable local development. It is possible to argue that a 'high road to development', based on quality products and innovation, is the pathway for local and regional development in Europe. Finally, policy lessons for depressed regions are drawn.

AB The population of American plaice in the waters off Labrador and on the northeast Newfoundland shelf declined substantially during the mid to late 1980s. early 1990s at a time when reported catches were very low. An earlier study examined the overlap in distribution between American plaice and cod in research vessel survey data and concluded that unreported bycatch in the cod fishery could explain the decline of the Div. 2J portion of the Subarea2+Div.3K stock of American plaice. We evaluate the method proposed in that study and use reported and observer estimates of catch to investigate potential catch levels relative to survey estimates of population biomass. This method does not appear to be a good predictor of American plaice bycatch in the cod fishery as most of the regressions were not significant and it requires extrapolation well beyond the range of the data used to build the regressions. Furthermore. there was little overlap between the extent of the commercial cod fishing grounds and the distribution of American plaice in the autumn surveys. For this stock, catch to survey biomass ratios were low regardless of the source of information used to estimate catch and suggest an exploitation rate that should be well below sustainable levels. These analyses support the conclusion that fishing was not the cause of the decline in this population of American plaice. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) has been a useful concept in fishery population dynamics, but populations harvested by annual removal of the MSY become commercially extinct in a variable environment. In this study, a target point is obtained that maximizes yield while minimizing the impact of fishing on population biomass and that reduces the risk. Fishing mortality was expressed as pF(MSY), where p was a proportion, and the rate of population increase. biomass, and yield were found in terms of the proportion p. A p-value of 0.75 maximized yield, while maintaining biomass as high as possible for protection of the harvested population. At the target point of 0.75F(MSY), a small decrease in yield below the MSY resulted in a substantial increase in stock biomass. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Miombo (Zambezian savanna) woodlands in protected and public (communal) lands of eastern Tanzania were examined to compare standing and harvested wood stocks and investigate different human disturbance gradients between the two utilization/management regimes. The standing volume in the forest reserve was 47 +/- 3.38 (S.E.) m(3) ha(-1) and the total removal volume (calculated from stumps) was 7.1 +/- 1.18 m(3) ha(-1). In the public lands. the standing volume was only 16.7 +/- 2.26 m(3) ha(-1) and the total removal volume was 19.62 +/- 2.58 m(3) ha(-1). Harvesting intensity decreased with increasing distance from village settlements and reserve boundaries but the pattern had no significant overall impact on standing stocks of wood. The Dar-es-Salaam-Morogoro highway, which bisects the study area is the major axis of disturbance. Multivariate analysis indicated that the linear combinations of physiographic variables significantly influence the pattern of tree harvesting. commercial harvesting for charcoal overrides patterns from other harvesting purposes because of economic incentive and the wide range of species and size classes harvested. The estimated annual wood removal for all uses of 6.38 +/- 2.39 m(3) ha(-1) in public lands exceeds the reported mean annual increment (MAI) in the study area of 4.35 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1). Thus present patterns of harvesting are changing the structure and composition of the vegetation. especially in the communal areas and are not sustainable. This will increase pressure for harvesting in reserves. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents long-range forest management analyses with the objective of mapping consequences for the timber production potential when forest management treatments are changed in an environmentally oriented direction. Sample plots from the National Forest Inventory, covering the entire productive forest area in Norway, were aggregated into 10000 treatment units. Management strategies maximising the net present value of the forest-land, with certain environmentally oriented constraints, were analysed. The following environmentally oriented constraints were considered: (i) areas of current old forest set aside, either proportionally or cost-efficiently, for permanent preservation, (ii) minimum target levels for area covered by old forest through time, (iii) retention of trees at final felling, and (iv) restricted management for border zone areas. With a real rate of discount of 2.5%, and all the constraints imposed simultaneously, the annual harvest potential was reduced by 30% for the first 10-year period, while the net present value was reduced by 21.5%. The results further demonstrated significant efficiency gains of letting the preservation of old forest be allocated cost-efficiently, compared with a strategy of setting aside an equal portion oil all eligible areas.

SO FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS

DE community; management; indigenous; sustainability; conflict
AB There is growing recognition in tropical countries that safeguarding forests requires the active involvement of local communities, but knowledge of how best to do this is limited. Orissa's extensive experience of community forest management (CFM) provides some valuable lessons and insights regarding: GO how and why communities manage their forests; and (b) the sustainability of CFM initiatives. The paper discusses the following aspects of CFM in Orissa: (a) the conditions that give rise to the initiation of CFM; (b) the size and nature of the benefits and how they are distributed among the various sub-groups of a community; Q the factors affecting its sustainability, including conflicts and their management; and (d) communities' support needs. The principal research activity was a survey, primarily socio-economic, of 43 forest-dependent communities. CFM was examined in the context of people's livelihood systems as a whole, since these can affect the size and nature of any benefits they derive from forest protection and also their main reasons for deciding to protect. The authors conclude that CFM has made an important contribution to the regeneration and sustainable management of Orissa's forests and argue that the formal balance of control of forests be shifted further towards communities. They highlight the plurality of institutional and management arrangements that communities have developed and caution against forest departments imposing a standardised, blueprint approach, as has tended to happen in government Joint Forest Management (JFM) programmes. Several weaknesses are identified in India's JFM programmes and reforms are recommended. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MANAGING TROPICAL FORESTS; PROSPECTS; AMAZONIA; IMPACTS
AB Following recent changes in the Bolivian Forest Law, there has been considerable debate about the financial viability of natural forest management in Northern Bolivia. We compare the returns to timber extraction for a number of forest management regimes, finding that the cost for private parties of meeting the recently imposed sustainable forest management requirements is significant. While still profitable (i.e. earning positive rates of return), Sustainable forest management is clearly less profitable than traditional logging practices. Indeed, the net present value per hectare is depressed to such low levels that forests are unlikely to earn competitive rates of return, so that future conversion or misuse of forestlands may be feared. Finally, implications of the new forest law for the distribution of the resource rent between firm and government are discussed. Our results indicate that historic patterns of incomplete rent capture by the government have effectively been reversed, and that many firms will not be able to earn 'normal profits' under the new regime.

AB The development of a coherent system of criteria and indicators (C&I) requires collaboration and communication among scientists, government, the public, certifying organizations, and the forest industry. It also demands the integration of knowledge from many fields of study, which is foreign to the disciplinary nature of most forestry research. There needs to be greater effort to link groups of indicators and to favour those that are assimilative in nature. Modelling tools adapted to a multi-disciplinary approach and collaborative development will help to integrate knowledge from various fields and institutions. Specific challenges for implementation of C&I have been identified, including: leadership and vision in the evolution towards sustainable forest management (SFM); linking of grass-roots and higher level CI initiatives; streamlining and co-ordinating different certification initiatives and agencies; technology transfer; and collaboration among disciplines.

AB The world's forests have all the characteristics of "wicked problems" that are complex, tricky and thorny. Decades of sweeping changes that have taken place worldwide at various levels have resulted in the emergence of "metaforestry" which transcends the field of conventional forestry in response to the need to deal with ulterior and more fundamental problems concerning the forest. Being an overarching objective of metaforestry, sustainable forest management calls for a new line of thinking to promote collaboration in international forums concerning global forest policy.

AB The Canadian Forest Sector is at a crossroads. Compared with its best global competitors, the sector's returns have been low. Its propensity to operate at the commodity end of the spectrum, coupled with an intense focus on cost cutting, has raised serious questions as to the long-term viability of research and technology as part of an innovation process. Stated provocatively, the question is "Does this sector need research? Why? For what?" And yet the evidence is clear. For sustainable growth and healthy balance sheets, more attention is needed on initiatives to add value, to move up the value chain, and to benefit from a more strategic focus on proprietary technological advantage. Too much reliance on suppliers, alone, for technology cannot yield sustainable leadership through innovation. Appropriate partnerships with technology providers ranging from universities, research institutes and suppliers, coupled with an in-house focus on innovative new products can lead to marketplace competitiveness. To balance needed industry investments, appropriate participation from governments at all levels can ensure that public policy-driven technology change can achieve societal goals in concert with achieving and maintaining industry competitiveness. Research institutes are key partners here with their focus on translating science into technology applied at the mill level. An environment that will attract highly qualified personnel into a sector often seen as less exciting than others more visibly tied to the information age will only occur when industry is seen to be highly supportive of innovation as a competitive force. The challenges are great but the potential returns are far higher if industry and government join forces to foster a truly innovative forest sector.

AB A current pattern of seasonal migration, particularly among smallholders, is marked by movement between the Amazon River floodplain and upland bluffs near the city of Santarem, Brazil. Nearly fifty years of jute cultivation "subsidized" residents of the floodplain, enabling them to remain there year-round. Without this subsidy, annual flooding and the concomitant seasonal dearth of cash-economy activities make permanent occupancy difficult. The present-day seasonal migration and complementary use of both upland and floodplain environments has broad implications for theories about past patterns of settlement and for the region's future sustainable development.

AB This article examines the way that 'sustainability' is used as a rallying point for different ideological positions and interests. Sustainability is important for its discursive effect, as well as a Principle for better environmental management. Since the Rio Summit ill 1992 the international community, has become more global, culturally and economically, but the effects of globalisation, including the environmental effects, are not necessarily shared. One area ill which this is clearly, evident is ill the measures that are taken collectively to protect 'nature'. The article examines the way in which interests in nature are evaluated, and made, legitimate, especially interests in the 'Commons'. The approach of the 'realist' tradition ill international relations is that states seek, to protect and enhance their own interests, but the interest ill 'environmental regimes' since the 1970s also implies a 'softer', more consensus-building approach to international collaboration. For some commentators it raises the question of whether the international community should welcome 'soft law, and voluntary compliance, or seek More radical solutions based on a concept Of 'global sovereignty'. Whenever the merits of these different positions one thing is clear: the material consequences of contemporary policy discourses Carry 'real', not 'imagined' effects for sustainable practices in the future.

AB This article argues that there is substantial optimism to be found in the way that the challenges of rural resource management in Africa are currently, understood and responded to that was not evident at the time of the Rio conference, It is suggested that the source of The optimism? lies in the multi-disciplinary, research of the last decade. This has changed quite fundamental, the ways in which society-environment relationships ill Africa are understood, will significant development of common policies. The first section of the article reviews aspects of research that has challenged the Africa ill environmental crisis scenarios, which has exposed the adaptive capabilities of African farmers and herders ill natural resource management and is promoting an understanding of environmental change based on non-equilibrium dynamics. In short, these changes ill thinking have opened zip policy, opportunities based oil communities as agents for conservation rather than inevitable despoilers of natural resources. Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) ill Africa encompasses a variety of experiences on the ground and the activities of diverse agencies ill relation to a range of resources. The article details a number of directions within The same areas of social and ecological science reviewed earlier that are shaping improvements ill CBNRM. Communities (and ecologies) are now understood as internally, differentiate and dynamic; research is identifying also The external social, physical and institutional environments that influence tide operation of local institutions; and there is greater attention currently to the informal institutions operating at the local level. Through these directions it is demonstrated that the challenge for sustainable rural resource management in Africa cannot lie solely with local communities.

AB Throughout the world, agriculture is under pressure to develop as a more sustainable economic activity, This article first summarises the causes of the unsustainability of modern farming, then describes three emerging approaches to the development of a more sustainable agriculture: namely, the production of environmental goods, integrated farming To-date, none of the three approaches has been widely, implemented and the final Section reviews The potential of different Institutional Structures adopted around the world to promote and implement sustainable agriculture. A continuum of structures is identified, ranging from voluntarism, through local knowledge communities, to state regulation, It is concluded that a sustainable agriculture requires a new, social contract between food producers, food retailers,food consumers and the state, set within an holistic rather than of local development.

AB This article compares and contrasts the environmental problems faced by low- middle- and high income cities and what this implies for each in meeting the environmental goals of sustainable development. It reviews the evidence in regard to how air, water and waste problems differ according to cities' average incomes, This shows that household and neighbourhood level problems such as indoor air pollution and inadequate Provision for household water supplies, sanitation and waste removal are most severe in low-income cities, and that their burdens fall primarily on the urban poor. Affluent cities contribute much more to global stresses such as carbon emissions and aggregate waste generation, whose burdens fall far more widely and are more likely to affect future generations. The article also discusses other important influences on the severity, of cities' environmental burdens - in particular intra-urban inequality, and the quality of governance. The article ends with a discussion of whether the environmental interests of the currently, deprived are complementary to or in conflict with those of future generations, and the potential role of an in reconciling these interests.

AB This article uses the ten year anniversary, of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development marked by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in August 2002 to explore ways in which women have, or have not, become more involved in environmental decision making and this involvement (for example equitable education, health care and economic status) are being met, it opens by, explaining why women have been identified as a coherent group which should be the focus of attention, on, by focusing on their relatively, poor (compared to men) economic and social status and their disproportionately high involvement in tasks which are unpaid or otherwise undervalued. Women's involvement in Agenda 21 and the resulting document which specifically, refers to the need to improve womens health, education, economic position and involvement in decision making is reviewed before considering how far progress has been made in these areas. The article concludes that, while some improvements appear to have been made, these are by no means uniform across space and time and that persistent inequalities continue to exist, and indeed have emerged in some of the new concerns identified by the UN.

DT Article
AB For many poor and marginalised groups living in the developing world, the notion of sustainable development as a realisable working concept remains ajar off dream. This is because zip till now the developed countries have not shown the political will to implement long-lasting and sustainable poverty alleviation measures to raise living standards for the worlds poorest societies. The use of the concept also seems inappropriate with respect to communities and systems faced with the devastating effect of frequent or prolonged climate hazards. Evidence from this article shows that such communities, whether existing in the flood plains of England and Wales (flood hazard) or along the hurricane coast of eastern India (storm hazard), struggle to maintain their lifestyles and standards of living. An important issue here concerns the availability of physical, economic and institutional resources employed to combat the effects of the climate hazard and to reduce the vulnerability of high-risk communities and groups exposed to them. This article shows that when these resources are lacking, the adaptive capacities of local communities to cope with the effects of severe climate impacts declines. The result is that community development levels either suffer a long-term fall, especially if the climate event is frequent or prolonged enough, or are maintained at a level much lower than they would otherwise be in the absence of the external climate stimuli. If the principles of sustainable development are to be realised for such hazard-prone communities, then the inclusion of climate risks in the design and implementation of development programmes is a necessary first step.

LA English
DT Article
AB Earlier this year, as part of preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) Rio +10, the House of Commons' Environmental Audit Committee (FAC) invited comments relating to what had been achieved within The UK. This article derives from a contribution we made to the Council for Environmental Education's (CEE) submission to the EAC. it reviews educational activities in response to Agenda 21, Chapter 36, initiated by central government, local authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and others, Exemplars relating to policy, programmes and strategy are illustrated, alongside a commentary on their effectiveness and strategic value, across a range of sectors. We suggest that there is now a priority need for integrated and integrative leadership, both within and across sectors, which synthesises existing knowledge and best practice, and makes them available to ongoing initiatives, Geography's role in this, as a subject discipline and via geographical education at school level, is explored.

TI The water budget myth revisited: Why hydrogeologists model
SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB Within the ground water community, the idea persists that if one can estimate the recharge to a ground water system, one then can determine the size of a sustainable development. Theis addressed this idea in 1940 and showed it to be wrong-yet the myth continues. The size of a sustainable ground water development usually depends on how much of the discharge from the system can be "captured" by the development. Capture is independent of the recharge, it depends on the dynamic response of the aquifer system to the development. Ground water models were created to study the response dynamics of ground water systems; it is one of the principal reasons hydrogeologists model.

DE general problem solving tool; learning organization; wicked problems
AB "Wicked" ill-defined problems such as violent crime, illegal drugs and terrorism may contain technical, economic, and political elements operating together as systems. Practical resolution requires "simple solutions" that are technically feasible, economically sustainable and politically implementable. Here we show an approach to achieve simple solutions to these problems. The approach was derived and tested in two experiments: first to develop verification measures for the Chemical Weapons Convention and subsequently to develop response concepts for biological terrorism. The approach's validity derives from its close relationship to the scientific method in objectively testing results, and its power is achieved by focusing a team of people directly on the problem of interest in the setting of a learning organization. The approach appears to provide access at will of the full human potential to resolve wicked problems and, thereby, yields a general problem solving tool of substantial power.

AB Commercial citrus (Citrus sp.) groves in Florida use an average of 150 lb/acre (168 kg.ha(-1)) of elemental nitrogen (N) per year. There are about 853,000 acres (345,000 ha) of commercial citrus requiring about 63,975 tons (62,652 t) of N. At an average analysis of 12% N, about 533,125 tons (483,811 t) of blended nitrogenous fertilizers are applied to citrus annually. To meet this annual N demand from compost, it would be necessary to produce 3,198,750 tons (2,901,906 t) of 2% N compost. The market for high-quality compost products in Florida is far greater than the current or projected production capacity of the state. As long as the cost benefits of compost are clear to citrus growers, demand will always exceed supply. Not all composts are equal in their nutrient availability. The best composts for use as fertilizers are derived from sewage sludge or biosolids, municipal solid waste and sludge, food waste, and/or animal manure combined with a bulking agent such as sawdust or wood chips. Composts made from wood waste as their only feedstock contain large amounts of lignin and cellulose to break down within a reasonable period to directly offset chemical fertilizers. Ultimately, they will mineralize in the soil and provide all of the benefits described earlier, but their rates of availability are in years rather than months, like the other composts.

AB Sales of organic products reached $8 billion in the U.S. in 2000, continuing the nearly decade-long trend of 20% annual growth. In Iowa alone, organic production for all crops was 5265 ha (13,000 acres) in 1995 but 60,750 ha (150,000 acres) in 1999. Despite the growth in organic agriculture, our knowledge of organic farming systems remains limited. We have adopted a systems theory approach in our current research program at Iowa State University (ISU) to help address this gap in understanding. Systems theory holds that biological systems, such as agroecosystems, consist of integrated units of people, plants, animals, soil, insects and microorganisms, and each subsystem provides feedback to the other. In order to obtain input on research questions and experimental design, the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture and ISU held six focus groups across Iowa in 1998 before long-term site establishment. Producers and agricultural professionals at the focus groups supported the need for long-term agroccological research (LTAR) sites in four distinct agroecological zones in Iowa. The goal of each LTAR is to examine the short- and long-term physical, biological, and socioeconomic effects of organic and conventional farming systems. By establishing long-term experiments, we are testing the hypothesis that longer crop rotations, typical of organic farms, provide yield stability, improve plant protection, and enhance soil health and economic benefits compared to conventional systems with shorter rotations and greater off-farm inputs. Examples of research results from two LTAR experiments in Iowa include similar pepper (Capsicum annuum) and soybean (Glycine max) yields in the conventional and organic systems. Organic systems used mechanical weed control and locally produced compost in place of synthetic fertilizers. Feedback from the local farm associations that are responsible for farm stewardship and farm finances is inherent in the LTAR process.

AB Systems approaches to research can be used to study characteristics of agricultural systems that cannot be addressed using conventional factorial experiments. The goal of a factorial experiment is to break down a complex system in order to isolate and study specific components and identify cause-effect relationships. In contrast, systems experiments aim to understand how a complex system functions as a whole and thus requires that intact systems be studied. Two approaches have been successfully applied to agricultural systems research: 1) field station experiments where simulated cropping systems are established in replicated plots and 2) studies of intact agroecosystems using commercial farms as study sites. These two approaches have complementary strengths and limitations and have made significant contributions to our understanding of ecological processes in agricultural systems. The development of sustainable agroecosystems will be best accomplished using an integrated research approach combining systems experiments with appropriately designed factorial experiments.

AB The Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS) is dedicated to farming systems that are environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable. Established in 1994 at the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDACS) Cherry Farm near Goldsboro, N.C.; CEFS operations extend over a land area of about 800 ha (2000 acres) [400 ha (1000 acres) cleared]. This unique center is a partnership among North Carolina State University (NCSU), North Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University (NCATSU), NCDACS, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), other state and federal agencies, farmers and citizens. Long-term approaches that integrate the broad range of factors involved in agricultural systems are the focus of the Farming Systems Research Unit. The goal is to provide the empirical framework to address landscape-scale issues that impact long-run sustainability of North Carolina's agriculture. To this end, data collection and analyses include soil parameters (biological, chemical, physical), pests and predators (weeds, insects and disease), crop factors (growth, yield, and quality), economic factors, and energy issues. Five systems are being compared: a successional ecosystem, a plantation forestry-woodlot, an integrated crop-animal production system, an organic production system, and a cash-grain [best management practice (BMP)] cropping system. An interdisciplinary team of scientists from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at NCSU and NCATSU, along with individuals from the NCDACS, NGO representatives, and farmers are collaborating in this endeavor. Experimental design and protocol are discussed, in addition to challenges and opportunities in designing and implementing long-term farming systems trials.

AB Over the past few decades Australia, like a number of other countries, has experienced a significant polarisation of household incomes as a result of social, demographic and economic changes. At the same time there has been a significant decline in home purchase rates amongst younger households. The paper uses micro data from the 1986 and 1996 censuses to explore some of the spatial and socio-economic implications of this change in housing tenure. It raises the question whether these changes are both related and interrelated. It suggests that tenure might be yet another factor that contributes to a process of social and spatial polarisation.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
ID PULP INDUSTRY; MILL SLUDGE; DENSITY
AB Long term performance of 'vermireactors' in which paper waste was converted to vermicasts by the anecic earthworm Lampito mauritii Kinberg has been assessed. The study focussed on four aspects: (a) recovery of vermicasts in digesters fed with paper blended with cowdung in 4:1, 5:1, and 6:1 ratios (by weight), (b) reproduction/mortality of earthworms in the reactors, (c) growth of earthworms in terms of increase in zoomass, and (d) the effect of digester volume on the three aforementioned factors. These studies are a sequel to the work reported earlier(2) where four of epigeic and anecic earthworms were screened for their efficiency and sustainability in processing waste paper. The studies had indicated L. mauritii and Eudrilus eugeniae Kinberg to be the most efficient producers of vermicasts, with L. mauritii a shade above E. eugeniae. As L. mauritii is an indigenous species whereas E. eugeniae is an exotic in the Indian context, it seems that the former may adapt better ecologically, hence is more resilient than the latter.

ID SCHOLARLY COMMUNICATION
AB The introduction of the World Wide Web presented changes in the world of academic publishing. Publishers are looking for alternatives to the traditional text-based, paper-based manuscript. Since the mid 1990's, the number of academic electronic journals increased from less than a 100 to several thousands. However, the extent of the penetration of academic electronic journals and the final form they will assume is unclear. This article introduces four scenarios. The scenarios describe four possible forms of academic journals and are based on the economic viability of electronic journals and their acceptance.
   The scenarios include status quo, replacement, co-existence, and ubiquitous outcomes for academic journals. It is shown that if the ubiquitous scenario occurs, a number of issues must be resolved which are independent of individual journals. These universal issues include the reliability of the infrastructure, long-term sustainability, and backwards integration. Unintended consequences are also examined.

TI The quest for good government and development in Africa: is NEPAD the
   answer?
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB The New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) states that democracy and good governance are preconditions for development. Given the fact that Black Africa is currently suffering widespread economic crisis and political disorder, how probable is it that electoral politics as it has been instituted over the last decade will lead to good government-which all, inside and outside Africa, now claim is the basis for sustainable economic growth?
   On the face of it, the argument is simple: democracy should reduce the scope for conflict and make good government more likely. In turn, good government should bring about the political stability, the institutional consolidation and the operation of the rule of law that are universally seen as the necessary framework for investment. Greater investment should facilitate economic growth. Growth provides the foundations for development.
   This article investigates the extent to which the political changes that have occurred in the last decade have made the possibility of good government and development more likely in Africa. It offers an analysis of why it is that the nature of politics in Africa today makes good government difficult and reconsiders the changes that have taken place in the exercise of power over the recent past.

ID SECURITY
AB UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has identified water and sanitation as a principle area of focus for the forthcoming World Summit oil Sustainable Development (WSSD). It is fitting that this meeting is being held ill Johannesburg, as water resources management issues are of primary, importance to the southern African region. There is a new water architecture being developed in the region, one that hopes to correct abiding structural inequalities of access between and among states, communities and peoples. Part of this new water architecture includes all enhanced role for the private sector and 'the market' in the provision and management of this crucial resource. This is a role that many feel will exacerbate rather than alleviate historically derived problems of underdevelopment. It is a role, therefore, that may undermine many of the positive developments that have taken place in the region over time. If regional leaders are interested in sustainable and equitable water resources management, they must be prepared openly to debate this issue with all interested parties not only at the WSSD, but also ill the region and beyond.

AB Pesticide use in highland Ecuador is concentrated in the high-risk, commercial production of potatoes. Small farm families experience considerable exposure and adverse health consequences. The authors describe a three-pronged strategy to reduce health impacts: 1) a community-based process of education and provision of personal protective equipment to reduce exposure; 2) farmer field schools to increase agro-ecosystem understanding and to reduce pesticide use; and 3) policy interventions to restructure incentives and to reduce availability of highly toxic insecticides. They discuss the challenges faced by each and the ongoing need for integrated interventions both to reduce adverse pesticide health impacts in the developing world and to promote sustainability of agricultural production in highland ecosystems.

TI Competition load and stress in sports: a preliminary study in biathlon
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE

DT Article

ID ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE; RECOVERY
AB International sports calendars are being increasingly filled with competitive events and fatiguing travel, at the risk of overloading the athletes involved. The Medical Committee of the International Biathlon Union, in order to check for any significant changes, analysed seven recent competitive seasons, calculating the number of races and total and daily numbers of racing kilometers for each season. A theoretical model for stress was subsequently developed, based on identification and quantification of favourable and unfavourable factors, with establishment of average and maximal stress scores for each season. A questionnaire was distributed to athletes to collect data about daily stress levels, and the correspondence between the theoretical model and the athletes' responses was determined. This analysis demonstrates that the biathlon has become more demanding for those athletes in the racing circuit, with significant increases in number of races, total and daily numbers of kilometers raced, and average stress scores for athletes of both sexes. The self-reported daily stress levels for some athletes show an interesting correspondence with the theoretical stress model. If such correspondence is confirmed, this model might constitute an instrument with which international sports federations, considering the concentration of races, related travel and recovery times, could plan sustainable competitive calendars.

AB Therapeutic angiogenesis may be a realistic approach in treating ischemic heart disease. VEGF is a major angiogenic factor involved in physiological as well as pathological angiogenesis. The ability of VEGF to promote angiogenesis in animal and clinical studies has been studied extensively. However, it is becoming clear that VEGF alone may not be sufficient to effectively complete the angiogenesis process. The use of more than one growth factor may be more pertinent in creating a sustainable angiogenic effect with clinically significant outcome. The challenge is to find complementary partners in angiogenesis to better affect the outcome of the process. To this end, we have been studying the effects of other angiogenic factors such as angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in a chronic ischemic porcine model. Single intramyocardial introduction of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of Ang-1 into the left ventricle free wall has been found to enhance angiogenesis by augmenting the formation of new capillaries that manifested in improved total blood flow in the myocardium. A combined therapeutic angiogenesis study involving VEGF and Ang-1 is currently underway. Due to their unique complementary properties, it is expected that the combination will not merely enhance angiogenesis but will also lead to healthy and mature vascular network in the ischemic myocardium.

TI Coastal cultural heritage: A management tool
SO JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
LA English
DT Article
AB Two parallel processes have marked coastal realities in many parts of the world. The former process consisted in the design and the dissemination of integrated coastal management programmes and actions consistent with the prescriptions from Agenda 21, and from the relevant guidelines by inter-governmental and local organisations. The latter one consisted in the increasing importance that coastal. cultural heritage has acquired either in the social perception of coastal reality, and in the prospects of driving coastal systems towards sustainable development. Hence, the need of framing the coastal cultural heritage into coastal management programmes, strategies and actions tailored to the principle of integration, which is the key word of the Agenda 21 approach, has come to the for,e and gained importance. To meet this need, the Guidelines for management of coastal cultural heritage, dealing with conceptual and methodological frameworks, and designing operational approaches were worked out for the use by decision-makers, managers and planners on the local scale. The Guidelines, which by now are available in the Italian language, have multimedia features and interactive properties, and are available in a CD-ROM format. They were devised in the framework of the Progetto Finalizzato Beni Culturali (Special Project for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage) convened by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (the Italian National Research Council). This paper aims at introducing their relevant background stimuli, their features, and their cardinal use criteria.

   conservation practice
AB Loess Plateau, an and and semi-arid region in Northwest China, is well-known for its most serious soil erosion in terms of sediment yield each year. Soil erosion, which is intensified by agricultural activities, is the major factor influencing sustainable agriculture development in this region. It reduces productivity by removing nutrients and especially reducing water availability that is essential for crop production in the area. It also brings about off-site costs by demanding more efforts for maintenance of banks and dams along Yellow River through raising the riverbed with sediment. Climate is capricious and extreme weather conditions occur frequently, which impairs normal agricultural production with erosion and also decrease of water availability. Extensive way of farming still dominates on the Loess Plateau, which cannot produce satisfying economic results and needs to be improved or altered. Conventional agricultural production pattern needs to be reconsidered for husbandry has not been granted its due position. Agriculture is the backbone of economy. Poor agricultural production impedes economic development and vice versa, backward economy also influences the advancement of agriculture. Besides a large population, education status of farmers is another threshold that requires being resolved for a sustainable agriculture.
   Although conventional agriculture has been practiced there for more than 5000 years, now it cannot meet the demand for food and fiber by the increasing population and some of its farming practices are contributing to environmental degradation directly or indirectly and can sustain no longer. Agriculture on Loess Plateau needs to find its own way of sustainability. To work toward a sustainable agriculture, chances and challenges both indwell on Loess Plateau.

AB Study objective: To examine the role of specialist outreach in supporting primary health care and overcoming the barriers to health care faced by the indigenous population in remote areas of Australia, and to examine issues affecting its sustainability.
   Design: A process evaluation of a specialist outreach service, using health service utilisation data and interviews with health professionals and patients.
   Setting: The Top End of Australia's Northern Territory, where Darwin is the capital city and the major base for hospital and specialist services. In the rural and remote areas outside Darwin there are many small, predominantly indigenous communities, which are greatly disadvantaged by a severe burden of disease and limited access to medical care.
   Participants: Seventeen remote health practitioners, five specialists undertaking outreach, five regional health administrators, and three patients from remote communities.
   Main results: The barriers faced by many remote indigenous people in accessing specialist and hospital care are substantial. Outreach delivery of specialist services has overcome some of the barriers relating to distance, communication, and cultural inappropriateness of services and has enabled an over fourfold increase in the number of consultations with people from remote communities. Key issues affecting sustainability include: an adequate specialist base; an unmet demand from primary care; integration with, accountability to and capacity building for a multidisciplinary framework centred in primary care; good communication; visits that are regular and predictable; funding and coordination, that recognises responsibilities to both hospitals and the primary care sector; and regular evaluation.
   Conclusions: In a setting where there is a disadvantaged population with inadequate access to medical care, specialist outreach from a regional centre can provide a more equitable means of service delivery than hospital based services alone. A sustainable outreach service that is organised appropriately, responsive to local community needs, and has an adequate regional specialist base can effectively integrate with and support primary health care processes. Poorly planned and conducted outreach, however, can draw resources away and detract from primary health care.

AB A biochemical approach was employed to examine the oxidative utilization of carbohydrate and lipid in red muscle of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during sustained swimming at 30 and 60 % of their critical swimming speed (U-crit; for 2, 15 and 240 min) and during non-sustainable swimming at 90 % U-crit (for 2, 15 and 45 min). Measurements included pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, creatine phosphate, ATP, glycogen, glycolytic intermediates, acetyl-CoA, acetyl-, total-, free-, short-chain fatty acyl- and long-chain fatty acylcarnitine, intramuscular triacylglycerol and malonyl-CoA concentrations, and whole body oxygen consumption ((M) over dot O-2). During the first 2 min at 30 and 60 % U-crit, oxidation of endogenous glycogen by PDH activation increased 4- and 8-fold, respectively, yielding 1.5- to 2.5-fold increases in acetyl-CoA and 2- to 6-fold increases in acetyl-carnitine concentrations. Within 15 min, PDH activity returned to control values (153.9 +/- 30.1 nmol g(-1) wet tissue min(-1)); after 240 min there were small 1.7- to 2.6-fold increases in long-chain fatty acyl-carnitine and approx. 50% decreases in malonyl-CoA concentrations, indicating an overall enhancement of lipid oxidation. Sustainable swimming at 30 and 60 % U-crit was further characterized by 1.5- and 2.2-fold increases in (M) over dot O-2, respectively. Non-sustainable swimming at 90 % U-crit was characterized by a sustained tenfold (approx.) elevation of red muscle PDH activity (approx. 1600 nmol g(-1) wet tissue min(-1)). Significant 67% decreases in white muscle creatine phosphate and 73% decreases in glycogen levels, without matching increases in lactate levels, point to significant recruitment of white muscle during high-speed swimming for power production, and the potential export of white muscle lactate to red muscle for oxidation. Overall, sustainable exercise at 30 and 60 % U-crit is supported by approximately equal contributions of carbohydrate (approx. 45 %) and lipid (approx. 35 %) oxidation, whereas non-sustainable swimming is supported primarily by carbohydrate oxidation with only moderate contributions from lipid oxidation.

AB Most of the projected global population increases will take place in third world countries that already suffer from water, food, and health problems. Increasingly, the various water uses (municipal, industrial, and agricultural) must be coordinated with, and integrated into, the overall water management of the region. Sustainability, public health, environmental protection, and economics are key factors. More storage of water behind dams and especially in aquifers via artificial recharge is necessary to save water in times of water surplus for use in times of water shortage. Municipal wastewater can be an important water resource but its use must be carefully planned and regulated to prevent adverse health effects and, in the case of irrigation, undue contamination of groundwater. While almost all liquid fresh water of the planet occurs underground as groundwater, its long-term suitability as a source of water is threatened by nonpoint source pollution from agriculture and other sources and by aquifer depletion due to groundwater withdrawals in excess of groundwater recharge. In irrigated areas, groundwater levels may have to be controlled with drainage or pumped well systems to prevent waterlogging and salinization of soil. Salty drainage waters must then be handled in an ecologically responsible way. Water short countries can save water by importing most of their food and electric power from other countries with more water, so that in essence they also get the water that was necessary to produce these commodities and, hence, is virtually embedded in the commodities. This "virtual" water tends to be a lot cheaper for the receiving country than developing its own water resources. Local water can then be used for purposes with higher social, ecological, or economic returns or saved for the future. Climate changes in response to global warming caused by carbon dioxide emission are difficult to predict in space and time. Resulting uncertainties require flexible and integrated water management to handle water surpluses, water shortages, and weather extremes. Long-term storage behind dams and in aquifers may be required. Rising sea levels will present problems in coastal areas.

AB A modelling procedure of hourly time discretisation is developed in order to study the effects of episodic rainfall events to the dynamics of coastal marine environments. This methodology was applied on the gulf of Gera, Island of Lesvos, Greece, a semi-enclosed and shallow ecosystem surrounded by an intensively cultivated watershed. The simulation of biological and chemical processes in the water column was focused on the interactions of inorganic nutrients, primary producers and organic matter. The hydrodynamic behaviour of the area was estimated by the combination of the Princeton Ocean Model and a multiple-box mass balance approach in order to describe the tidal hydraulic regime. The estimation of nutrient fluxes due to non-point sources was based on a modification of the unit-mass response functions. The results have shown that nutrient loading from agricultural runoff could be considerable after episodic rainfall events, resulting in an increase of the nutrient stock from 40% to 60%. The responses of the primary producers are regulated from weather conditions of the following period and the residence time of excessive nutrient loads within the gulf that ranges from a time span of less than 10 days to 1 month period. The good fit between simulated and experimental data supports the view that this integrated modelling approach should be considered as a realistic reproduction of the dynamics of coastal marine ecosystems and be used for testing various scenarios concerning their sustainability.

AB After reviewing lessons learned about rapid social change when establishing oil and gas fields around underdeveloped communities, Chevron and its joint venture participants in Papua New Guinea (PNG) established a new model to implement initiatives that promote improved partnerships and networking among development agencies. The model also ensures that sustainable results are achieved beyond the life of oil and gas production in the area. This new model serves as a vehicle for implementing current initiatives while building capacity to promote sustainable social development in the long term.

AB We are exploiting materials and concepts from food science to create functionalized, environmentally friendly derivatives of the biopolymer chitosan, a byproduct of seafood processing. Functional groups are grafted onto chitosan using tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for food browning. The functionalizing groups studied include low-molecular-weight phenols derived from natural sources and high-molecular-weight proteins. The approach of using low-molecular-weight phenols to functionalize chitosan is illustrated with arbutin, a natural phenol found in pears. Results demonstrate that tyrosinase initiates reactions that lead to the conversion of arbutin-chitosan solutions into gels. These gels can be rapidly broken by treatment with the chitosan-hydrolyzing enzyme chitosanase, demonstrating that the chitosan derivatives remain biodegradable. We briefly review other studies in which low-molecular-weight natural phenols are enzymatically grafted onto chitosan to confer functional properties. The creation of co-polymers is illustrated by results in which tyrosinase is used to couple gelatin onto chitosan. Gelatin is a proteinaceous byproduct of meat production. The tyrosinase-generated gelatin-chitosan conjugates have been observed to offer interesting rheological and thermal properties. These results demonstrate the potential for using renewable resources and enzymatic processing to create environmentally friendly polymers with useful functional properties.

AB Rangeland ecological condition was monitored over a 48 year period on 41 sites on Bureau of Land Management rangelands scattered across 6 counties in southwestern New Mexico. All sites were grazed by livestock during the study period. Sampling occurred in 1952, 1962, 1982, 1992, 1997, 1998, and 1999. A modified Parker 3 step method in conjunction with Dyksterhuis quantitative climax procedures were used to determine rangeland ecological condition. At the end of the 48 year study period (1952-1999), the average rangeland ecological condition score across study sites was the same (P > 0.05) as the beginning of the study (39% versus 41% remaining climax vegetation. respectively). Major changes (P > 0.05) in rangeland condition occurred within the study period due to annual fluctuations in precipitation. Ecological condition scores increased in the 1980s and early 1990s due to above average precipitation. However, drought in the early to mid 1950's and again in the mid to late 1990's caused rangeland condition scores to decline. At the end of the study (1997-1999), 38% of the sites were in late seral ecological condition, compared to an average of 25% in the 1952 to 1982 period. The amount of rangeland in late seral ecological condition increased while the amount of rangeland in mid seral and early seral condition decreased in the 1990s compared to the 1952-1962 period. The average percent cover of black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda Torr.) and tobosa (Hilaria mutica Buckley), the primary forage grasses in the Chihuahuan Desert, were the same (P > 0.05) in 1952 and 1999. Over the 48 year study period, the average cover of shrubs including honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) showed no change (P > 0.05). However major increases in honey mesquite basal cover occurred on 1 site and creosotebush (Larria tridentata [Pursh] Nutt.) increased on another. Grazing intensity was evaluated during the last 3 years of study (1997, 1998, 1999). Overall grazing use of forage across sites and years averaged 34% or conservative. Our research shows controlled livestock grazing is sustainable on Chihuahuan Desert rangelands receiving from 26-35 cm annual precipitation.

The TVEs and rural non-agricultural sector were widely regarded as the most dynamic sector in the Chinese economy during the reform era. However, such a successful story and optimistic view had changed tone since 1997, seemingly from the robust boom to a deep recession. Evidently, China's present TVEs development must be confronted by deep-seated problems that created the fundamental sustainability dilemma. To better understand China's unusual process of TVEs development. this paper focuses on the sustainability dilemma from the functional and spatial perspectives. It analyses the internal conflicts between TVEs development and agricultural production and explains why the present mode of China's TVEs development cannot be sustained. Within the rural economy, agricultural production and the TVEs themselves have created severe conflicts that have led to a fundamental sustainability dilemma: further encouragement of TVEs or maintaining a stable agricultural Output. especially of food supply. The underlying causes for the sustainability dilemma are diagnosed, primarily based on a consideration of functional and spatial division. The paper argues that the conflict is inevitable due to the dysfunctional nature created by TVEs in the rural sector. That is, farmers simultaneously perform two different functions: agriculture and industry, both of which Should be functionally and spatially separated. According to Lewis's Two-sector Structural-change Model, this paper attempts to seek a possible solution that aims at an overall functional clarification between the urban and rural sectors.

AB To restore fertility and productivity of saline soil through bioremediation, a farm-scale trial was undertaken by exploring the effect of three factors, viz, soil conditioner (SC, recycled agrowaste), halophiles culture, and a plant growth regulator (PGR), modified industrial byproduct. A three factor factorial design was used with each factor at two levels - the lower level indicated no treatment, while the upper level indicated treatment, and there were eight experiments in all, which were replicated thrice. One out of the eight treatment combinations was without SC, PGR, or halophiles inputs served as control. The plantation and growth of Casuarina equisetifolia, in the treated soils as per the design, was monitored through various relevant parameters that included soil characteristics, level of (micro) nutrients, and exchangeable cations, and growth-related parameters. The analysis of data thus generated through appropriate ANOVA indicated an overwhelming role of SC in the bioremediation of soil salinity and growth parameters of the C equisetifolia plantation, followed by that of halophiles and then the PGR as envisaged. The role of PGR was however important in first establishing the plantation in the saline soil, when halophiles get enough time to establish favourable pattern and concentration of microbes in soil by up to more than a million times of the initial microflora level of 5.9x10(3)/g soil. Data collected up to six months clearly indicated bioremediation of the otherwise saline soil, and effectiveness of the given treatments was evident. It is proposed that such bio-measures may go a long way in converting large tracts of saline soils into fertile ones with healthy soil-microflora in an eco-friendly manner which is cost-effective as well.

AB Recent years have shown a dramatic decline in telecommunications profits. At least three main reasons for this can be identified:
   1 the lack of proper business planning in the IP services sector resulting in high investments which were not met by sufficient revenues;
   2 over-extension in banking loans to cover for wild investments in UMTS licences, resulting in interest commitments that put a too heavy burden on, normal revenue generation; and
   3 the incredible price erosion for trunk capacities, resulting in a serious almost non-recoverable gap between investments per megabit and revenues, per megabit.
   Only recently we have seen major and seemingly successful companies (Global Crossing, Carrier 1, GTS, KPN-Qwestdagger) hit the rocky shores. It is clear that the telecommunications world operates in a non-sustainable business model which cannot last much longer. This paper analyses the problem causes and gives directions for solutions for a return to a potential healthy telecommunications business environment.

ID FAILURE PATTERNS; METHODOLOGY; REHABILITATION
AB A comprehensive review of pipe replacement analyses is presented, from which an economically sustainable threshold break rate for replacement of pipelines in deteriorating water distribution systems is derived that yields some of the previously available replacement criteria under weaker restrictions. Relations of equivalence are established between the threshold break rate and both the rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF) and the hazard rate functions. These statistical functions are used to predict break rates for a system. Optimal replacement times are obtained by equating the threshold break rate and the assessed (predicted) break rate from the ROCOF and the hazard rate functions. Design charts to determine the optimal threshold break rate as a function of pipe diameter and discount rate are also given, as well as numerical examples illustrating the developed theory.

AB Elimination of large predators and reduced hunter harvest have led to concerns that all increasing elk (Cervus elaphus) population may be adversely affecting vegetation oil the low-elevation elk winter range of Rockey Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA. Beaver (Castor canadensis) and their impoundments also have declined dramatically (94%) in the same area over the past 50 years coincident with a 20% decline in willow (Salix spp.) cover. From 1994 to 1998. we studied vegetation production responses of willow communities to elk herbivory and water availability. We estimated willow production by measuring current annual growth of shrubs in 9.3-m(2) circular plots, and we, measured herbaceous production by clipping vegetation within 0.25-m(2) circular plots. Elk herbivory suppressed willow heights, leader lengths, annual production, and herbaceous productivity of willow communities. Water impoundment had a positive effect oil herbaceous plant production, but little effect oil shrubs, possibly because water tables were naturally high on the study sites even without beaver dams. Nevertheless, the, winter range environment previously included more riparian willow habitat because of more stream area (47-69%) due to larger beaver Populations. Elk herbivory appears to be the dominant force determining vegetation productivity in willow sites, but the effects may be exacerbated by lowered water tables. Fewer elk or protection front browsing, and water enhancement for <10 years along with management to encourage elk movement away from willow communities, could possibly work as strategies to reestablish sustainable willow communities.

ID MARKET
AB The residential property market accounts for a substantial proportion of UK economic activity. Professional valuers estimate property values based on current bid prices (open market values). However, there is no reliable forecasting service for residential values with current bid prices being taken as the best indicator of future price movement. This approach has failed to predict the periodic market crises or to produce estimates of long-term sustainable value (a recent European Directive could be leading mortgage lenders towards the use of sustainable valuations in preference to the open market value). In this paper, we present artificial neural networks, trained using national housing transaction time series data, which forecasts future trends within the housing market.

SO LAND USE POLICY
LA English

DE forest management; forest history; sustainable forestry;
   developmentalism
AB This paper proposes and tests a hypothesis that there is a general model of forest management through time that applies to varying extents in several countries. It does so by analyzing at a synoptic level, evidence from the histories of United States, Canadian and Australian forest histories and to a lesser extent global forest management histories. The hypothesized stages are (i) traditional hunter-gatherer society, (ii) exploitive colonization, settlement and commercialization, (iii) wood resource protection, (iv) multiple use management, and finally, (v) sustainable forest management or ecosystem management.
   The developmentalist model of change presented here reveals a striking similarity in the stages or eras that these countries experienced in the struggle to manage public forest estates. Changing community values and economic circumstances produced similar stages in several countries. The details of policies and legislation may differ, the terminology may be different, even some stages may be missing, but the trajectory of change remains similar. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The objective of this paper is to examine the land-use dynamics between cattle production and forestry: when forest production takes place in a sustainable manner and cattle production is without the benefit of artificial production incentives. Data from the Lowlands of Bolivia are used in the empirical analysis and although the results directly reflect that situation, they are pertinent to much of Latin America and the continuing land-use conflict between forestry and cattle production. The results suggest that contrary to conventional wisdom, higher stumpage values do not always lead to a decrease in the land converted to pasture. In circumstances where per hectare stumpage values are very low, increases in stumpage values will provide the capital required to convert land to pasture and thus exacerbate land conversion. This will occur until a certain threshold value, after which further increases in stumpage values will decrease land conversion to pasture, as would be expected.

SO MAN IN INDIA

AB Humanities collective knowledge of bio-diversity and its use and management rests in cultural diversity; conversely, conserving bio-diversity often helps strengthen cultural integrity and values. The study of these inter-relationships need to be studied mainly for the simple reason that culture is not only the ethical imperative for development, it is a condition of its sustainability, for there exists a symbiotic relationship between biological diversity and cultural diversity, between habitats and cultures, between ecosystems and cultural identity, and that this relationship constitutes a determining factor in ensuring sustainable human development. Religious beliefs and rituals are very much intimately related to the management of the ecosystems. The present paper delves into the socio-cultural norms governing the activities of the villagers during the Yatra and tries to emphasize the importance of these socio-religious practices or ethics towards conservation. However coming. in contact with the external forces diluted many of these sound practices often resulting in irreversible damage to not only the environment surrounding them but also most importantly, the social fabric, which binds these. people together; The paper thus tries to evolve sound social practices towards better management of the eco-system.

AB In this paper, we analyze the variance of accounting profitability among a broad cross-section of firms in the American economy from 1981 to 1994. The purpose of the analysis is to identify the importance of year, industry, corporate-parent, and business-specific effects on accounting profitability among operating businesses across sectors. The findings indicate that industry and corporate-parent effects are important and related to one another. As expected, business-specific effects, which arise from competitive positioning and other factors, have a large influence on performance. The analysis reconciles the results of previous studies by exploring differences in method and data. We also identify the broad contributions and limitations of the research, and suggest avenues for further study. New approaches are necessary to generate significant insights about the relationships between industry, corporate-parent, and business influences on firm profitability.

DT Article
DE Pagophilus groenlandicus; harp seal population assessment; unreported
   mortalities; struck and loss estimates; commercial seal hunt
AB One of the major sources of unreported mortality during the commercial harp seat (Pagophilus groenlandicus) hunt in the Northwest Atlantic is the number of animals that are killed but not recovered or reported, commonly referred to as struck and lost. With the significant expansion of the hunt in Canada and in Greenland during the mid-1990s, there is a concern that the number of seals lost may have reached a level that is not sustainable relative to current harvest levels. To address this problem a study examining struck and loss rates was initiated in 1998 and 1999. Loss rates for young seals taken on the ice varied from 0% to 1.9% and from 0% to 10.0% when taken in the water, Seals greater than one year of age had loss rates of 0%-4.9% when taken on the ice and 13.8%-50.0% when taken in the water. These estimates are lower than those recently reported for Northwest Atlantic harp seals.

TI Technologies and their influence on future UK marine resource
   development and management
SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE marine technologies; sustainable development; conflict resolution;
   decision-making
AB This paper attempts to predict changes and trends in future UK marine resource development and management. It does this by asserting that our presumptions about marine resources and the way in which they should be used are changing. Some emerging presumptions may not only preclude the use of existing technologies in some cases (e.g. dumping at sea), but may also act as drivers to the development of new technologies, such as offshore wave and wind power generation devices. A variety of maritime industries exploiting both living and non-living resources are examined individually. Attention is paid to marine conservation and the technologies that are important to providing generally for the protection of the marine environment. The authors conclude that major drivers will be ones for cleaner seas, for the development of renewable marine energy sources, and for the innovative management of the consequences of sea-level rise. With regard to the exploitation of living resources the finite limits to fisheries are stressed, and the present importance of industrial fishmeal supplies for salmon farming are highlighted. One of the greatest potential technological advances is predicted to be in marine habitat mapping. Given the changes in presumptions about our use of the seas, one over-riding conclusion is that the sustainable development of marine resources, and the conservation of priority habitats and species (for both the local seas and global oceans), must involve sustainable mechanisms for conflict resolution and decision-making.

   equity; intra-societal equity; life-cycle analysis; sustainable tourism
AB Cruise tourism continues to be a major international growth area. In terms of achieving sustainable tourism it is, therefore, a subsector within which socio-economic, cultural and environmental considerations need to be continually analysed, addressed and monitored. The environmental impacts of cruise tourism are categorised in this paper and potential strategies that can be employed by both cruise line operators and cruise tourism destinations are explored. Secondary evidence of action by both parties suggests that the industry is taking a number of belated positive steps. However, decision-makers in cruise tourism destinations, particularly those outside North America, need to work closely with operators to facilitate both integrated waste management and intergenerational and intra-societal equity rather than merely accept the prospect of short-term economic gain.

SO MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES
LA French
DT Article
AB Valorisation of Municipal Solid Waste Incineration Residues - excluding ashes - is a positive advance in sustainable development: saving natural resources, decrease in wastes volume stored, reduction of energy consumption.
   If good conditions of incineration can be ensured and post-combustion treatments are realised, solid residues are in the form of granular materials usable in construction and civil engineering. Uses in road structures are classical; application for the precasting of paving is quite new and interesting due to the quantity of recycled materials.
   Mechanical and physical performances of municipal solid waste incineration residues let us to replace a part of the granular skeleton and to obtain similar behaviour as with reference granular composition: splitting resistance, water absorption and resistance to abrasion are optimised. Leaching behaviour is also verified in order to avoid detrimental effect on the environment; it is shown that post-combustion treatments and compacting energy combined with vibration are essential for a good quality product fabrication.

AB During the last two decades, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in groundwater in Japan have increased steadily due to the development of intensive agriculture. In some areas, they have reached or even exceeded the unacceptable level for drinking water, 10 mg l(-1). In 2000, the Environment Agency showed that 5.6% (173 of 3,374) tested wells and 4.7% (64 of 1,362) wells used for drinking water exceeded the standard level in 1999. The highest value of NO3-N in the wells was 100 mg l(-1). Many researches have shown that NO3-N pollution of groundwater was widely observed in Japan, except the paddy field regions. Farming practices in Kagamigahara city of Gifu prefecture have been typical ones for reducing NO3-N pollution in groundwater. In the east district of the city, NO3-N concentration was low in 1966, but reached 27.5 mg l(-1) in June, 1974. The farmers in this district began to reduce the nitrogen fertilizers in carrot cultivation, going from 256 kg N ha(-1) in 1970 to 153 kg N ha(-1) in 1991. The use of controlled release fertilizer increased fertilizer-nitrogen efficiency compared with common compound fertilizer and NO3-N concentration in the groundwater began to decrease steadily. It was discussed that in order to decrease the NO3-N pollution of groundwater, it is necessary to refocus not only agricultural technology but also agricultural policy, toward sustainable agriculture and rural development.

AB Theories on the motivation underlying firm boundaries have recently sparked renewed debate. What best explains whether a firm relies on market control or hierarchical control to secure required resources? How do the characteristics of the resources come into play? In this study, we consider a comprehensive path model of the governance mode decision for sourcing technological know-how. By integrating different perspectives on firm boundaries, including transaction cost economics. a resource-based view, and an options perspective. we link characteristics of the technology (i.e., uniqueness, barriers to imitation, commercial uncertainty, technological dynamism) to the perceived threat of opportunism, the potential for sustainable advantage, and the pursuit of a licensing agreement vis-a-vis the outright acquisition of the firm that possesses the desired know-how. We use structural equation modeling to analyze 127 sourcing arrangements. Our results show that technological dynamism and barriers to imitation indirectly influence the governance mode decision by increasing the perceived threat of opportunism. Commercial uncertainty directly influences the governance mode and decreases the likelihood of an acquisition vis-a-vis a licensing agreement. Although uniqueness and barriers to imitation are also positively associated with the perceived potential for sustainable advantage, the potential for sustainable advantage had no direct effect on governance mode. Implications and suggestions for further research are offered.

AB The capitalist model of developpment creates two simultaneous types of damages : social ones and ecological. The more and more liberal policies carried on by capitalists tend to reinforce the exploitation of the working force in the whole world and to achieve the privatisation of all ressources, knowledges and of all the not market sectors of Human activities. The global warming is already programed by the market and this can only leads us to a new type of dead end. In these conditions, the concept of a Sustainable developpment which is supported by the major polluters of our planet is a non sense if we do not ask about the goals we have to give to the developpment and to the Human progress which needs to be separated from the law of profit.

AB This review presents the point of view that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) do not play a vital role in the nutrition and growth of plants in many production-orientated agricultural systems. Highly available soil P often limits AM colonisation and causes the C-costs to the host to outweigh any benefits from colonisation. Even when P availability is low and AM colonisation levels are high, as may occur in organic and biodynamic agricultural systems, AMF may not always contribute to plant growth for reasons not yet understood. AM fungal activity may also be greatly limited by soil fumigation, non-responsive plant varieties, or rotations based primarily on non-mycorrhizal crops or crops of low AM dependency. Thus, profitability may sometimes be enhanced by management practices, such as tillage and P-fertilisation, which limit AM colonisation. Manipulation of agricultural systems to favour AMF must occur only if there is clear evidence that AMF make a positive contribution to yield or are vital for maintenance of ecosystem health and sustainability. A crucial role for AMF in soil structural stability or in enhancing micronutrient concentrations in produce may be sufficient evidence and may eventually compel consideration of AMF responsiveness when breeding new crop varieties.

AB Inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi has potential benefits in not only sustainable crop production but also environmental conservation. However, the difficulty of inoculum production due to the obligate biotrophic nature of AM fungi has been the biggest obstacle to putting inoculation into practice. Nevertheless, several companies have sought to produce inoculum of AM fungi. Firstly in this review, the present status of inoculum production and its use in Japan is described. Secondly, although the effectiveness of inoculation is primarily limited by environmental and biological factors, some possible ways to improve inoculation performance are discussed. Approaches include use of chemicals to increase spore germination and colonization and soil application of charcoal to provide a microhabitat for AM fungi to colonize and survive.

TI Energy and CO2 life-cycle analyses of wind turbines - review and

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
DE wind turbine; energy intensity; CO2 intensity; life-cycle assessment
ID POWER; GENERATION; EMISSION
AB Despite the fact that the structure and technology of most modem wind turbines differs little over a wide range of power ratings, results from existing life-cycle assessments of their energy and CO2 intensity show considerable variations. While the range of energy intensities reflects economics of scale, their scatter is due to discrepancies in the energy contents of materials and the analyses' methodology and scope. Furthermore, energy intensities depend crucially on the country of manufacture, turbine recycling or overhaul after the service life, and the choice of tower material. In addition, CO2 intensities vary with national fuel mixes. Measures of life-cycle energy or CO2 emissions can be employed in policy and planning, especially for comparative risk and sustainability assessments, and source switching and capacity growth scenarios. If these measures are to assist decision-making, uncertainties in life-cycle assessments should be minimised by compliance to a standardised methodology, and by use of input-output-based hybrid techniques.

AB The UK Sustainable Development Strategy requires that society makes prudent use of resources so as to protect the environment and at the same time maintain high and stable levels of economic growth and employment. Waste minimisation projects/clubs have been a central feature of the UK programme to encourage the adoption of more sustainable practice by industry. More recently, it has been recognised that there is a requirement to link such industrial projects with those that encourage the general public to adopt more sustainable practice. A large and dynamic partnership of local and regional players has delivered a programme of some 17 waste minimisation/resource efficiency projects in Northamptonshire, a County in the East Midlands of England, since 1997. The projects have delivered impressive financial savings and training to over 300 companies, mostly SMEs. The Corby Waste Not (CWN) was a project, based within Corby Borough, Northamptonshire, which has the highest degree of deprivation in the County. It was a holistic waste minimisation project in that it initiated and integrated activities across the whole spectrum of the community. CWN was funded by some pound 148 380 of external funds and was managed by an extensive partnership that included all key local and regional organisations. Project outcomes were impressive by UK standards, the industrial/commercial developments alone resulted in savings greater than pound 250 000 for an expenditure of F, 35 000, making it one of the most cost-effective in the UK. Using theories of planed behaviour, the CWN management team introduced a number of other activities that have resulted in clear evidence of a marked improvement in relation to waste issues by the community.

AB In an area adjacent to trials conducted by Braz et al. (2001) another area was fenced to evaluate the degradation of piles feces liberated by the cattle and the influence of nutrients liberated to the forage on the nutrients production and concentrations. Fifty piles feces were collected immediately after excretion by the animal and maintained in the field for periods of 7, 14, 28, 56 and 112 days of incubation. It was observed a continuous and high variation in the potassium contents through feces, that ranged from .25 to .05% after 112 days, in this period, the pile nutrient liberation corresponded to 90% initial amount. ADF contents, in the first week, decreased 50% from the beginning, representing a later tendency for increase in the ADF fecal concentration, as previously observed. As for the concentrations of N and P, it was observed that liberation was restricted and correlated with the degradation of dry matter, probably as a function of low biological activity in the feces and of consequent liberation of these nutrients in the particulate form. Concerning the influence of liberated nutrients through the feces to the forage on the nutrient production and concentration, there was a high variation in K concentration and production only in the central region of evaluation after 112 days of incubation, i.e., in a radium of 25 cm from the pile center, there was no difference in the nutrients production and concentrations in the other evaluated regions.

AB Most of the Earth's living resources are found in specific geographical locations such as the global coastal environment and the catchment basins of large river systems. Furthermore, a large proportion of the world's population lives in close proximity to these regions and is frequently dependent upon it for either part or much of its food supply and industrial raw materials. The consequence of this situation is that much of the waste, both industrial and domestic, and various other types of habitat destruction generated by the human population, occurs in those areas that are of greatest biological and economic significance. The overall problem is, how to develop effective procedures for environmental/ecological impact and risk assessment? One of the major difficulties in impact and risk assessment is to link harmful effects of chemical pollutants in individual sedentary animals (i.e., invertebrates) with the ecological consequences. Consequently, this obstacle has resulted in a,knowledge-gap,, for those seeking to develop effective policies for sustainable use of resources and environmental protection. However, diagnostic <clinical-type>> ecotoxicological tests or <<biomarkers>> for effects of contaminants are now increasingly available; and there is a concerted international research effort to improve and extend their predictive capability. These ecotoxicological tools can provide information on the health-status of populations based on relatively small samples of individuals. Also, biomarkers can now be used to begin to link processes of molecular and cellular damage through to the higher levels (i.e., prognostic capability), where they can result in reduced performance and reproductive success. In conclusion, an integrated environmental management (IEM) strategy must be truly cross-disciplinary if an effective capability for risk assessment and prediction is to be developed in relation to resource sustainability. Areas of collaboration need to include, among others remote/satellite surveillance, risk assessment, interpretation of complex information and predictive modelling, There also needs to be increased focus on precautionary anticipation of novel environmental hazards.

AB There are a number of pathologies that are associated with the development of renal failure. Once renal function has deteriorated beyond a point where life is not sustainable without dialysis, new sets of pathologic processes develop. These are, in part, related to the continuation of poor renal function and to the process of dialysis itself. This article addresses the processes that are believed to be due to dialysis, among which are disorders of bone, deposition of metals and amyloid within a number of tissues, and local problems such as inflammation and tumors related to the dialysis site.

AB The mobile food service practice is one of multiple survival strategies adopted by poor urban households in Cameroon to maintain and expand the base of subsistence incomes, especially in the current surge of economic crisis. Though a fast-growing informal sector enterprise, it is still at an artisanal stage in urban Cameroon, creating an urgent need for a supportive policy environment that could have measurable positive impacts on improving the productivity, welfare and income levels of the micro-entrepreneurs. This study looks at the mobile food service practice in Kumba, Cameroon, in terms of its basic characteristics, the locational factors influencing its socio-spatial distribution, the critical success factors (CSFs) determining customer choices, and its impacts on the local environmental resources and quality of urban life. The mobile food service practice creates employment, generates income, and acts as a food energy-support instrument to the urban poor and local economic activities operating in Kumba. The vendors, who are mostly women, can make incomes that are 405 per cent of the national minimum wage and, thus, contribute financially towards the education, health and survival of their families. The paper provides some recommendations on ways to improve the efficiency of this sector so as to achieve sustainable economic and social development and to enhance empowerment thereof.

AB People in Portugal have never been so healthy. Nevertheless, there are great differences in health status between social groups and regions. In 1994, Portugal was the country with the second worst level of inequality in terms of income distribution and with the highest level of poverty in the European Union (EU). Poverty in Portugal affects mainly the elderly and women (especially in single parent families). Beyond these groups, there are the children, the ethnic minorities and the homeless. Substance abusers, the unemployed, and ex-prisoners are also strongly affected by situations of social exclusion and poverty. Although poverty has been an important issue on the political agenda in Portugal, it shows a worrying tendency to resist traditional Social Security interventions. In the late 1990s, however, welfare coverage rates appear to have risen. To what extent can poverty cause a worsening of health status? Is there any sustainable positive association between welfare and improved health status? How, to whom and when should actions to improve the health status of the disadvantaged be addressed, without subverting the health status of the rest of the population. It is also necessary to reveal the consequences of poor health to individuals, families and communities in terms of income, social empowerment and the ability to fulfil other needs. Finally, reflection on the role and effectiveness of traditional social security models is necessary, in order to improve the impact and adequacy of its interventions. The goal of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge about disadvantage, the current health situation of the most vulnerable groups in Portuguese society-those affected by poverty, deprivation and social exclusion-and to detect the constraints on access to health and health care.

TI Participatory evaluation of reproductive health care quality in

SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE

DT Article

   Tanzania
AB Participatory approaches are becoming increasingly important in the field of health, and many organizations, governments and donors have recognized the need to increase stakeholder involvement to ensure sustainable and real change. However, commitment to participation is often lacking and participatory processes, if applied, tend to be short-term and discrete, especially in institutional settings. Rarely, for example, arc stakeholders involved in long-term monitoring and evaluation activities, due the time-consuming nature of participation, and to perceptions on the part of donors and other decision-makers that participation lacks the rigor and objectivity of external evaluation. This paper describes the strategies used by an international reproductive health organization to collaborate with local stakeholders in a long-term participatory approach to quality improvement, focusing on defining quality of care, identifying problems in health facilities, setting goals and seeking solutions to those problems, tracking changes in quality over time, and feeding this monitoring and evaluation information back into the quality improvement process. The paper also illustrates how greater participation was achieved over time as local stakeholders moved away from traditional models and relationships and started working together to meet their quality improvement goals. The paper argues that participatory techniques are essential if the real needs of clients are to be met through sustained change and continuous quality improvement at the site level.

AB Nutrient cycling in a short rotation forest system can be manipulated to give sustainable biomass production and land use. Internal factors, such as species, litter source and initial chemical composition, could play some special role when managing litter in plantation forests to provide biomass sustainably for use as a fuel. These factors were examined for their effects on eucalypt leaf litter decomposition and nutrient release using leaf litter of three species (Eucalyptus botryoides, E. globulus, and E. ovata) from two sources (trees without irrigation and trees irrigated with meatworks effluent) under a short rotation forest regime in New Zealand. The species had significant effects on the litter decomposition and nutrient release while litter source mainly influenced nutrient release. The litter dry weight loss for the three species after the 12-month period were E. globulus (84%) > E. botryoides (55%) > E. ovata (41%). Similar trends were found for the release of six nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Mn). Litter from trees without irrigation released these nutrients slower than did litter from trees irrigated with meatworks effluent. For nitrogen, this was 28.9% and 49.2%, respectively, of the original total amount released after 12 months, and for phosphorus 10.4% and 42.4%. Potassium was consistent in being released most rapidly (from 67 to 93% of the total after 12 months) from all litter types. Phosphorus, magnesium, and nitrogen accumulated more than their initial amount in some litter types. The initial contents of acid detergent fibre (cellulose and lignin) and magnesium of leaf litter, and their ratios with other nutrients (e.g. lignin/N and cellulose/Mg) were key factors influencing litter decomposition and nutrient release. The effects of these internal factors should be considered when managing litter in plantation forests to give sustainable biomass production. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Soil degradation due to tillage has been reported Africa-wide. Other main causes of soil degradation are overgrazing, extensive cultivation of marginal lands, widespread clearing of vegetation for agriculture, deforestation, exploitation of unsuitable agricultural technologies, mis-management of arable lands, and frequent drought. Hence, declining soil fertility and increasing population pressure on lands are fragile bases on which to build expectations for improved crop production. This paper recognizes conservation tillage systems as one means for preventing food shortages and natural resources degradation throughout the continent. Conservation tillage has the potential for increasing soil organic matter content and enhancing soil aggregation. Conservation tillage systems can create an aggregated, fertile surface layer that is important from a soil erosion reduction perspective and thus for a sustainable agriculture in Africa. Some indigenous tillage systems in Africa can be adapted to meet objectives of conservation tillage systems. Further, recent technological developments in tillage and seeding machinery will certainly enhance the rate of farmer's acceptance and adoption of conservation tillage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Under semiarid Mediterranean climatic conditions, soils typically have low organic matter content and weak structure resulting in low infiltration rates. Aggregate stability is a quality indicator directly related to soil organic matter, which can be redistributed within soil by tillage. Long-term effects (1983-1996) of tillage systems on water stability of pre-wetted and air dried aggregates, soil organic carbon (SOC) stratification and crop production were studied in a Vertic Luvisol with a loam texture. Tillage treatments included conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT) and zero tillage (ZT) under winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and vetch (Vicia sativa L.) rotation (W-V), and under continuous monoculture of winter wheat or winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (CM). Aggregate stability of soil at a depth of 0-5 cm was much greater when 1-2 mm aggregates were vacuum wetted prior to sieving (83%) than when slaked (6%). However, slaking resulted in tillage effects that were consistent with changes in SOC. Aggregate stability of slaked aggregates was greater under ZT than under CT or NIT in both crop rotations (i.e., 11% vs. 3%, respectively).
   SOC under ZT tended to accumulate in the surface soil layer (0-5 and 5-10 cm) at the expense of deeper ones. At depths of 10-20 and 20-30 cm no differences in SOC were encountered among tillage systems, but CT exhibited the highest concentration at 30-40 cm depth. Nevertheless, when comparisons were made on mass basis (Mg ha(-1)), significant differences in stocked SOC were observed at depths of 0-10 and 0-20 cm, where ZT had the highest SOC content in both rotations. The stock of SOC to a depth of 40 cm, averaged across crop rotations, was greater under ZT (43 Mg ha(-1)) than under CT (41 Mg ha(-1)) and MT (40 Mg ha-1) although these figures were not significantly different. Likewise, no significant differences were encountered in the stock of SOC to a depth of 40 cm among crop rotations (i.e., 42 Mg ha(-1) for W-V vs. 40 Mg ha(-1) for CM). Crop production with wheat-vetch and continuous cereal showed no differences among tillage systems. Yields were strongly limited by the environmental conditions, particularly the amount of rainfall received in the crop growth season and its distribution. Similar yield and improved soil properties under ZT suggests that it is a more sustainable system for the semiarid Mediterranean region of Spain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The quantification of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in ecosystems is important for (a) understanding changes in ecosystem structure and function with changes in land use, (b) determining the sustainability of ecosystems, and (c) balancing the global C budget as it relates to global climate change. A meso-scale study was conducted to determine regional effects of climate change on C and N cycling within disturbed ecosystems. Objectives of the research were to quantify (a) sediment yield, (b) current C storage in vegetation and soils, and (c) soil C efflux from both abandoned and rehabilitated coal surface-mined lands in Ohio. A dynamic model was developed to simulate sediment yield, grassland production, and C and N cycling on surface-mined lands. Evaluation of plant production and soil erosion submodels with data sets from surface-mined lands in the mid-western U.S. resulted in r(2) values of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. Depending on the initial values of soil organic carbon (SOC), model simulations estimated that unvegetated surface-mined lands in Ohio yield approximately 441,325 Mg yr(-1) of sediment and emit between 2,000-20,000 Mg yr(-1) of C to the atmosphere from decomposition of SOC. While rehabilitated lands had a higher C efflux rate than barren lands, a positive C sequestration rate of 18.4 Mg km(-2) yr (-1) was estimated as a result of organic matter additions. This sequestion rate increased considerably under projected climate change scenarios, while it decreased when simulated rehabilitated grasslands were harvested for hay. Changes in land use and cover can cause surface-mined lands to be either a net sink or source for C. Successful rehabilitation of mined lands can decrease erosion and promote soil C sequestration, while at the same time providing additional lands for the management of natural resources.

ID PROFILE; IMPACT
AB Before the financial crisis of mid-1997, estimates of consumption poverty in Indonesia were based on rather modest poverty line thresholds when seen in relation to estimates of capability poverty. The reasons behind this discrepancy are identified and alternative estimates of consumption poverty for the pre-crisis period proposed, During the crisis, the behavior of consumption poverty can be described as transient in nature and is relevant in understanding the notion of vulnerability, that is, the risk that individuals and households can experience temporary episodes of poverty. Vulnerability could have worsened, however. in the absence of government intervention, entailing macroeconomic stabilization measures and social protection initiatives. Based on this experience, a fiscally sustainable social safety net, that is able to reinforce household coping mechanisms and social capital, is recommended as part of the country's medium-term strategy to combat poverty.

AB The transition to sustainable agriculture in tropical small-scale farming has been discussed intensively since Boserup published her theory on the role of population pressure as a leading factor. Bosernp's work challenged the Malthusian approach to rural transformation. Recent evidence supports the Boserup theory as applied to Machakos District, Kenya. This paper aims to establish how much of terracing is directly explained by population density increases as opposed to other district and village-level variables by using a retrospective multivariate analysis in Machakos and Kitui Districts. Kenya. The findings suggest that variables such as the distance to major urban markets and the windfall profits from the coffee boom in the late 1970s are at least as important in explaining the investment in the quality of land in Machakos and Kitui Districts.

DT Article
AB Tourism is a less observed subject in theological ethics. In traditional theological ethics tourism is only understood as escape from everyday's life or as an expression of people finding to themselves away from their daily routine. Both of those ways of looking at the theme of tourism don't allow to look at the subject in a responsible way regarding all the consequences of today's tourism since it plays an important role in the economy with enormous rates of growth. Those facts challenge theological ethics together with the people in tourist countries are taken into account. The article tries to take up such a position. Quality seals for tourist places, taxes on petrol for aeroplanes and plans for regions are means to include tourism in a sustainable development. Looking at tourism in such a way can save jobs in tourist countries and contributes to a gain for the tourists at the same time. By that the article doesn't follow the arguments of social ethics that either judges the motivation of tourists or suggests holidays at home as an alternative to current tourism.

AB Reduced impact logging (RIL) systems are currently being promoted in Brazil and other tropical countries in response to domestic and international concern over the ecological and economic sustainability of harvesting natural tropical forests. RIL systems are necessary, but not sufficient, for sustainable forest management because they reduce damage to the forest ecosystem during the initial forest entry. If conditions were identified where RIL costs were clearly less than conventional logging (CL) costs, then a strong incentive for RIL adoption would exist.
   In this paper, a comparison of costs and revenues was made for typical RIL and CL operations in the eastern Amazon. An economic engineering approach was used to estimate standardized productivity and cost parameters. Detailed data on productivity, harvest volume, wasted wood and damage to the residual stand were collected from operational scale harvest blocks. Productivity and cost data were also collected using surveys of forest products firms.
   The major conclusion of the study was that RIL was less costly, and more profitable, than CL under the conditions observed at the eastern Amazon study site. Full cost accounting methods were introduced to capture the direct and indirect costs associated with wasted wood. The impact of wasted wood on effective stumpage price provided the largest gain to RIL. Large gains attributable to RIL technology were also observed in skidding and log deck productivity. In addition, investment in RIL yielded an "environmental dividend" in terms of reduced damage to trees in the residual stand and reduction of the amount of ground area disturbed by heavy machinery. Developing institutions that can monetize the value of the environmental dividend remains a major challenge in the promotion of sustainable forest management in the tropics.

ID PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES; COUNTRIES; ISSUES
AB There is a lack of effective, safe, and affordable pharmaceuticals to control Infectious diseases that cause high mortality and morbidity among poor people in the developing world. We analysed outcomes of pharmaceutical research and development over the past 25 years, and reviewed current public and private Initiatives aimed at correcting the Imbalance in research and development that leaves diseases that occur predominantly In the developing world largely unaddressed. We compiled data by searches of Medline and databases of the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, and reviewed current public and private Initiatives through an analysis of recently published studies. We found that, of 1393 new chemical entities marketed between 1975 and 1999, only 16 were for tropical diseases and tuberculosis. There Is a 13-fold greater chance of a drug being brought to market for central-nervous-system disorders or cancer than for a neglected disease. The pharmaceutical Industry argues that research and development is too costly and risky to invest in low-return neglected diseases, and public and private initiatives have tried to overcome this market limitation through incentive packages and public-private partnerships. The lack of drug research and development for "non-profitable" infectious diseases will require new strategies. No sustainable solution will result for diseases that predominantly affect poor people in the South without the establishment of an International pharmaceutical policy for all neglected diseases. Private-sector research obligations should be explored, and a public-sector not-for-profit research and development capacity promoted.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE

ID PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; HEALTH; PARTICIPATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; EXERCISE
AB PURPOSE: For physical activity to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, it must be sustained throughout life. We sought to determine the relation between the ability of young adults in different sports and their continued physical activity in midlife, and subsequent cardiovascular disease.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Baseline self-reported ability in tennis, golf, football, baseball, and basketball was assessed in a cohort study involving 1019 male medical students (median age, 22 years). Physical activity and sports participation were assessed 22 years later. The incidence of cardiovascular disease was assessed during a median follow-up of 40 years, using annual questionnaires, medical records, and death certificates.
   RESULTS: Subjects with high ability in tennis as young adults had the highest participation in the sport in midlife (median age, 48 years). In the midlife questionnaire administered in 1978, 33% reported playing tennis within the past week and 51% within the past year. Tennis was the only sport in which a higher ability during medical school was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. After adjustment for father's occupation, parental incidence of cardiovascular disease, serum cholesterol level, cigarette smoking, body mass index, and hypertension during follow-up, the relative hazard of developing cardiovascular disease was 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35 to 0.89) in the high-ability group and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.96) in the low-ability group, compared with the no-ability group.
   CONCLUSION: Our results support the association between sustained activity in aerobic sports and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Sustainability of activity should be considered when developing physical education programs for Young adults. (C) 2002 by Excerpta Medica, Inc.

AB Among US writers on environmental aesthetics, it has become de rigueur to leverage Aldo Leopold's legacy against the proliferation of "popular" landscape tastes, which are typically seen to have their origins in 17th-19th century European traditions of landscape painting and aesthetics. These writers regard victims of popular or "scenic" landscape tastes (exemplified by Olmsted's Central Park) as intellectually shallow, motivated by momentary "sensory pleasures", and passively and anthropocentrically drawn to "naturalistic" environments rather than actively and biocentrically engaged with natural environments. This implicit refusal to grant sensory information and affective processing the power to catalyze and inform serious reflection is not new; neither is the attribution of popular landscape aesthetics to the elite society of a limited culture and historical period surprising, given the current preponderance of post-modernist sensibilities. However, in the often highly-charged atmosphere of local environmental planning and management arenas, both positions are needlessly polemical. More importantly, there is good evidence to suggest that both positions are founded on misconceptions about how the human mind works. In this paper, we will review work that establishes the intellectual bona fides of visual imagery, the important contributions that emotions make to cognition, and the likelihood that explanations of environmental aesthetics rooted in European enlightenment-era landscape painting are inadequate. This review suggests that frequent calls for new normative environmental aesthetics based on a cognitive understanding of ecological sustainability are likely premature. As social scientists, we suggest that attempts to impose prescribed environmental aesthetics (albeit ecologically pure environmental aesthetics) are inappropriate and may well be self-defeating. Instead, we suggest that a thorough understanding of visual and non-visual environmental aesthetics is needed, including examinations of the possibility that affect elicited by scenic encounters with prefer-red landscapes can lead people to form emotional attachments to the land and thereby develop a greater appreciation for sustainability goals.

AB The increasing awareness of the need to create green and sustainable production processes in all fields of chemistry has stimulated materials scientists to search for innovative catalysts supports. These new catalytic supports should allow the heterogenization of most catalytic processes, increasing the efficiency and selectivity of the synthesis and reducing waste and by products. Following the development of several micellar templated structures. such as M41S(1). FSM-16.(2.3) HMS.(4.5) MSU-x.(6) and SBA-x.(7.8) it is a crucial next step to create Support materials. consistirig of a composite matrix with combined micro- and mesoporosities and a sufficient stability to withstand most industrial treatments. We describe in this paper the very first development of a hexagonal material with large pore diameters and thick walls (4 nm). containing internal microporous silica nanocapsules. These plugged hexagonal templated silicas (PHTS) have two types of micropores (originating from the walls and the nanocapsules respectively) and a tunable amount of both open and encapsulated mesopores. The micropore volumes have a high value (up to 0.3 cm(3)/g) and the total pore volume exceeds 1 cm(3)/g. The obtained materials are much more stable than the conventional micellar templated structures known so far, and can easily withstand severe hydrothermal treatments and mechanical pressures.

AB Achieving sustainable competitive advantage and increasing the economic value of a firm in the 21st century's global economy will be a complex, challenging, and knowledge-based task. It can be thought of as revolving around the interplay of three basic forces: (a) a dynamic environment, filled with opportunities and threats, (b) an innovative and agile organizational system, and (c) strategic leadership whose role is to mediate between these two forces, to optimize existing processes and systems and, at the same time, to discover new opportunities and to capitalize on them. The purpose of this paper is to evidence the technology dimension of strategic leadership and to analyze new perspectives for production economics. We describe first the rules of the game in a dynamic and hypercompetitive environment. By examining the differences between leadership and management, it is possible, first to identify and understand the different roles of production economists and second to analyze the two most critical tasks of production economists: (a) as a manager, to optimize existing processes and systems, and (b) as a leader, to invent the future and to inspire people to work enthusiastically for achieving challenging goals. The message of the paper is that a comprehensive conceptual framework for integrating technology into strategic leadership increases the probability that a firm can achieve superior long-term performance.

AB Learning actors' leverage for change along the journey to sustainability requires quantifying the component forces of environmental impact and integrating them. Population, income, consumers' behavior, and producers' efficiency jointly force impact. Here, we renovate the "IPAT Identity" to identify actors with the forces. Forcing impact I are P for population, A for income as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, C for intensity of use as a good per GDP, and T for efficiency ratios as impact per good. In the "ImPACT Identity," parents modify P, workers modify A, consumers modify C, and producers modify T. Because annual percentage changes in component forces add to a change in national impact actors' leverage is reflected transparently in consistent units of annual percentage changes that can be compared from force to force. Examples from energy and food, farming and manufacturing, and steel and water show that declining C, called dematerialization, can temper the sustainability challenge of growth (P x A), and that innovation or efficient technology that lowers T can counter rising consumption (P x A x Q. Income elasticity can accommodate connections between income and other forces. From rates of change of forces, the identity can forecast impacts. Alternatively, by identifying the necessary change in forces to cause a projected impact, ImPACT can assay the likelihood and practicability of environmental targets and timetables. An annual 2-3% progress in consumption and technology over many decades and sectors provides a benchmark for sustainability.

ID SYSTEMS
AB In the construction of mathematical models from experimental data, it is possible to determine equations that model relations using several methodologies [Un nuevo algoritmo para la modelizacion de sistemas altamente estructurados (2000); Env. Model. Software 15 (2000) 461; Guide to Statistics 1,2 (1999); Regression models (1999); Ecosystems and Sustainable Development II (1999)]. These methodologies build equations that are in line with the experimental data and they analyse a dimension of adjustment and a dimension of error or distance between the experimental data and the data that is produced by the model. There are studies of sensitivity of the sample of data, as found by Bolado and Alonso [Proceedings SAMO 2001]. The authors consider that it is useful to obtain new parameters that relate the sensitivity of the equations to the variations that are produced by the experimental data. This will allow the selection of the model according to new criteria.
   On the one hand, the authors present a theoretical study of sensitivity of the models according to different points of view. On the other hand, they discuss a computing algorithm that allows the analysis of sensitivity (and stability) of the mathematical equations, which are built from any methodology.

TI Basic needs in the Northern Province and South Africa's globalization
   agenda
SO AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The requirement for the improvement of poor people's basic needs and overall quality of life is inseparable from concerns with sustainability and state capacity for executing social welfare responsibilities. South Africa has, paradoxically, redefined state role away from social provision, as it replaced the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) with the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy in 1996. Whereas the RDP accorded the state a pivotal role in meeting basic needs, GEAR pursued outward-looking development. In accordance with the logic of GEAR, the Northern Province Government formulated its Growth and Development Strategy (GDS), essentially an offspring of that macro-policy.
   Using the Northern Province as case study, this paper illustrates that GEAR and GDS have engendered outward-looking development that is also open to the dictates of external forces. It is argued that South Africa and that province are as such inserted into the global system in a way that they cannot shape or domesticate globalization for resolution of their germane development difficulties. We point out that that form of globalization has not led to the improvement of the poor people's access to basic needs. In conclusion, we urge for the establishment of a strong developmental state that would engender auto-centeredness.

AB Widespread deforestation and increasingly intensive use of land to sustain a growing population has increased soil erosion, lowered soil fertility, and reduced agricultural productivity in the hills of Nepal. This has raised concern over sustainability of the hill farming system. There is growing evidence that agroforestry can be a potential solution to above problems. However, the development of agroforestry as a viable alternative for farmers in diverse ecological and socioeconomic conditions has become a very challenging issue. The objective of this paper was to identify factors influencing the adoption of agroforestry by subsistence farmers in the hills, with reference to an agroforestry project initiated by Nepal Agroforestry Foundation (NAF). Necessary information for this study came from a survey of 223 households (82 project and 141 non-project) from Kumpur, Nalang, and Salang villages in Dhading district in 1998. The results showed that male membership in local NGOs, female education level, livestock population, and farmer's positive perception towards agroforestry have significantly positive effects, while the number of children below 5 years of age, number of males aged 10-59 years, male education, female's Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) membership, and respondents' age had significantly negative effects on adoption of agroforestry among project households. Among non-project households, those with more livestock and male membership to local NGOs were found more likely to adopt, while the households headed by males were less likely to adopt agroforestry.

AB Consultants, farm advisors, resource conservationists, and other land managers may benefit from decision tools that help identify the most sustainable management practices. Indices of soil quality (SQIs) can provide this service. Various methods were tested for choosing a minimum data set (MDS), transforming the indicators, and calculating indices using data from alternative vegetable production systems being evaluated near Davis, California. The MDS components were chosen using expert opinion (EO) or principal components analysis (PCA) as a data reduction technique. Multiple regressions of the MDS indicators (as independent variables) against indicators representing management goals (as iterative dependent variables) showed no significant differences between the EO and PCA selection techniques in their abilities to explain variability within each sustainable management goal. Linear and non-linear scoring techniques were also compared for MDS indicators. The non-linear scoring method was determined to be more representative of system function than the linear method. Finally, indicator scores were combined using either an additive index, a weighted additive index, or a decision support system. For almost all indexing combinations, the organic system received significantly higher SQI values than the low input or conventional treatments. The efficacy of the indices was tested by comparisons with individual indicators, variables representative of management goals, and another multivariate technique for decision making that used all available data rather than a subset (MDS). Comparison with the comprehensive multivariate technique showed results similar to all of the indexing combinations except the additive and weighted indices using the linearly scored, EO-selected MDS. This suggests that a small number of carefully chosen soil quality indicators, when used in a simple, non-linearly scored index, can adequately provide information needed for selection of best management practices.

ID AGROFORESTRY; NIGERIA
AB In Ghana, shade for cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is becoming a critical issue because of extensive deforestation. Unlike in some other cacao-growing countries, cacao is not grown under the shade of coconut (Cocos nucifera) in Ghana. An experiment to compare the merits of four cacao-coconut intercropping systems with the traditional cultivation of cacao under Gliricidia sepium shade was undertaken at the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana. Cacao seedling girth was not affected when intercropped with coconut but was significantly (P = 0.01) reduced when intercropped with G. sepium. High density cacao facilitated better early canopy formation. Yield of cacao spaced at 2.5 m triangular (1739 plants ha(-1)) with coconut at 9.8 m triangular (105 plants ha(-1)) was significantly higher (P = 0.05) than from the other treatments during 1993/94 to 1995/96. There were no major disease problems associated with intercropping cacao with coconuts. Widely spaced coconuts intercropped with cacao spaced at 3 m x 3 m showed better flowering and gave higher coconut yields, but cacao spaced at 2.5 m triangular under coconuts spaced at 9.8 m triangular was more profitable than the other treatments. Moisture stress was the greatest in cacao system with G. sepium shade and this could be responsible for the low yield of cacao in that treatment. It is suggested that properly arranged high density cacao under widely spaced coconuts can be a profitable intercrop system for adoption by cacao farmers in Ghana.

AB This article discusses a collaboratively organizational capacity-building model for agencies engaged in HIV/AIDS prevention. The cooperative training approach (CTA) utilized by the Training and Technical Assistance Program trained participants to incorporate learned skills into their daily work practices, and to become trainers to help disseminate their newly acquired skills, first to others in their own organization and later to other organizations, The CTA was Successfully implemented among 285 community-based organizations (CBOs) serving predominantly Hispanics in the U.S.-Mexico border region. The program evaluation demonstrated that it has significantly upgraded the program implementation capability and the organizational infrastructure of the participating organizations resulting in improved delivery of services to their clients. Furthermore, it fostered networking and collaboration for the development of sustainable training and technical assistance networks of agency staff skilled in organizational capacity building. It is suggested that funding agencies examine the feasibility of using this approach to increase the organizational capacity of CBOs involved in HIV/AIDS prevention.

TI An entitlement approach to the challenges of mangrove management in El
   Salvador
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper summarizes those factors that have contributed to the degradation of the mangroves in El Salvador, and examines the implications of proposed changes in property rights to the mangroves for poor coastal communities. Current patterns of extraction and conversion in the mangrove ecosystem in El Salvador can be viewed through an entitlement lens that confers property rights upon some actors, for certain uses, and denies them to others. Unfortunately, the present system of laws and regulations that governs resource use in the mangroves is contradictory and confusing. A number of laws currently are active that give entirely different directives about the use and transformation of the ecosystem. The rational and sustainable management of the mangroves cannot be secured without a redefinition of entitlement rights. This redefinition of entitlements, however, should take into account the needs of those whose livelihoods are intimately connected to the health of the ecosystem.

TI Industrial transformation and shrimp aquaculture in Thailand and

ID MANGROVE FORESTRY FARMS; SOUTHERN VIETNAM; MIXED SHRIMP; IMPACTS
AB Shrimp aquaculture in Vietnam is in the process of being transformed into a major industry around the intensification of the production system. The experiences of other countries in the region, especially in Thailand where high input production systems dominate, suggests that now is a critical time for intervention to redirect industry into pathways that are more sustainable ecologically, socially, and economically. In Thailand, years of experience with intensified systems and a complex industrial organization has not led to sustainable solutions. The challenge here is for society to regain control and then to redirect the transformation along more efficient and benign pathways. Our analyses suggest that current pathways in both countries are unlikely to lead to a sustainable industry. A complete transformation of the way shrimp are grown, fed, processed, distributed, and regulated is needed.

TI Small-scale fisheries, population dynamics, and resource use in Africa:
   The case of Moree, Ghana
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
AB We consider population dynamics and sustainable use and development of fishery resources in Moree, a small-scale fishing and coastal community of 20 000 people in the Central Region of Ghana near Cape Coast. Moree suggests that relationships between population dynamics and fishery resources are more complex than the concept of Malthusian overfishing implies. Reasons include changing biophysical characteristics of the upwelling system along the coast of West Africa; qualitative as well as quantitative changes in fishing activity throughout the year; the market nature of fishing activity and nonlocal demands for fish; regular fishery migration; and institutions regulating fishery resource access at home and at migration destinations. Population and resource relationships in Moree may be the effects of fishery resource and economic changes on migration rather than population pressure on fishery resources. Fisheries management policies must take into account processes that lie beyond the influence of local fishermen.

AB We argue that all aspects of demographic change, including migration, impact on the social resilience of individuals and communities, as well as on the sustainability of the underlying resource base. Social resilience is the ability to cope with and adapt to environmental and social change mediated through appropriate institutions. We investigate one aspect of the relationship between demographic change, social resilience, and sustainable development in contemporary coastal Vietnam: the effects of migration and remittances on resource-dependent communities in population source areas. We find, using longitudinal data on livelihood sources, that emigration and remittances have offsetting effects on resilience within an evolving social and political context. Emigration is occurring concurrently with, not driving, the expansion of unsustainable coastal aquaculture. Increasing economic inequality also undermines social resilience. At the same time diversification and increasing income levels are beneficial for resilience.

AB Sustainable beekeeping depends upon more than good luck. Under prevailing conditions, American apiculture as we know it will survive only if beekeepers respond effectively to the threats arrayed against it. Appropriate responses to certain of these threats call for beekeepers to work smarter, not just harder, to overcome some of the challenges to beekeeping. With significant improvements in key areas, apiculture in the USA and elsewhere might yet thrive.

AB The conversion of natural grassland to cropland had resulted in severe deterioration in soil resource and rapid expansion of land desertification in the semi-arid agro-pastoral zone of north China. To assess the effects of land-use change and subsequent soil and crop management practices on soil degradation in semi-arid Horqin Sandy Land, north China, soils were sampled from adjacent natural grassland (NG) and cultivated land (converted from NG in 1986), including hawthorn (Crataegus sanguinea L.) orchard (HO), monocultured cropland (MC) and alley-cropping land (interpolating with plum trees and crops) (AC). Land use change and subsequent tillage practices resulted in significant decreases in silt content, water-holding capacity, dry macro-aggregate, organic C, total N, basal soil respiration, and phosphatase activities. However, contents of total and available P were improved by application of phosphorus fertilizers in cultivated systems. Compared with NG soil, the extent of soil degradation in the cultivated system was ranked in the order: the conventional tilled cropland (MC) > the tilled alley-cropping system (AC) > the HO pattern with minimized disturbance. From perspective of soil resource and environment conservation, a viable option for protecting soil resources and achieving sustainable land use should be to stop conversion of grassland to cropland and to translate the conventional tillage into conservation tillage.

AB The paper sets out a fresh approach to healthy workplaces, laying foundations to meet the demands of the new millennium. Professionals such as occupational hygienists deal with issues at the heart of the economy and society, which are beginning to attract the attention of politicians. Old disciplinary barriers must be crossed and communication improved so that healthy work is accepted as a mainstream concern, integral to sustainable development. This presents challenges both to professionals and to those with responsibilities for policy. As a first step, we need to develop an understanding of how conclusions from research can inform responsible decision making. We will not be able to design and build perfectly safe environments, but real progress can be made in the field of 'workplace health defence', using available human, technical and financial resources. A vital ingredient is partnership in the workplace, involving social partners and professionals working in collaboration.

TI Cities and the geographies of "actually existing neoliberalism"
SO ANTIPODE
LA English
DT Article
ID GLOBALIZATION; GOVERNANCE; CAPITALISM; STATE
AB This essay elaborates a critical geographical perspective on neoliberalism that emphasizes (a) the path-dependent character of neoliberal reform projects and (b) the strategic role of cities in the contemporary remaking of political-economic space. We begin by presenting the methodological foundations for an approach to the geographies of what we term "actually existing neoliberalism." In contrast to neoliberal ideology, in which market forces are assumed to operate according to immutable laws no matter where they are "unleashed," we emphasize the contextual embeddedness of neoliberal restructuring projects insofar as they have been produced within national, regional, and local contexts defined by the legacies of inherited institutional frameworks, policy regimes, regulatory practices, and political struggles. An adequate understanding of actually existing neoliberalism must therefore explore the path-dependent, contextually specific interactions between inherited regulatory landscapes and emergent neoliberal, market-oriented restructuring projects at a broad range of geographical scales. These considerations lead to a conceptualization of contemporary neoliberalization processes as catalysts and expressions of an ongoing creative destruction of political-economic space at multiple geographical scales. While the neoliberal restructuring projects of the last two decades have not established a coherent basis for sustainable capitalist growth, it can be argued that they have nonetheless profoundly reworked the institutional infrastructures upon which Fordist-Keynesian capitalism was grounded. The concept of creative destruction is presented as a useful means for describing the geographically uneven, socially regressive, and politically volatile trajectories of institutional/spatial change that have been crystallizing under these conditions. The essay concludes by discussing the role of urban spaces within the contradictory and chronically unstable geographies of actually existing neoliberalism. Throughout the advanced capitalist world, we suggest, cities have become strategically crucial geographical arenas in which a variety of neoliberal initiatives-along with closely intertwined strategies of crisis displacement and crisis management-have been articulated.

AB Microbial consortia capable of degrading 3-chlorophenol (3-CP) were enriched in continuous up-flow column reactors under circum-denitrifying conditions. 3-CP degradation capability was developed and sustained when 3-CP was supplied at 16-21 muM, although suppression of the 3-CP degradation capability was observed when 3-CP was supplied at 42 muM. When 3-CP was stably degraded, the ratio of nitrate consumption to 3-CP degradation approached the theoretical stoichiometric value, which was calculated by assuming a 3-CP de gradation-dependent nitrate reduction. Batch-incubation experiments demonstrated that the microbial consortium that was enriched in the column reactors required either nitrate or oxygen for degrading 3-CP, while 3-CP was not degraded under sulfate-degrading conditions. Although many attempts were made to sustain the microbial 3-CP degradation capability under denitrifying conditions, mostly in batch cultures, none of them have been successful so far. Therefore, the results obtained in this study may be the first to demonstrate sustainable 3-CP degradation capability under circumdenitrifying conditions.

AB Effluent waters from shrimp aquaculture, which can contain elevated levels of phosphorus, ammonia, nitrate, and organics, must be managed properly if shrimp aquaculture is to achieve sustainability. Constructed wetlands are ecologically beneficial, low cost treatment alternatives proven capable of reducing suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals from wastewater of many sources. The goal of this study was to determine how well a constructed wetland performed as a filter in a full-scale shrimp aquaculture operation. A 7.7 ha (19 ac) mesohaline (3-8 ppt) constructed wetland treating 13,600 m(3) per day (3.6 MGD) of effluent from 8.1 ha (20 ac) of intensively farmed shrimp ponds at the Loma Alta Shrimp Aquaculture Facility (LASAF), located along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in semi-arid South Texas, was found to reduce concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS) and inorganic suspended solids (ISS) by 31, 65 and 76%, respectively, during recirculation, and maintained consistently low levels of mean BOD (< 9 mg l(-1)), total ammonia (< 1.8 mg N l(-1)) and nitrate (< 0.42 mg N l(-1)). Determination of parameter values for the k-C* wetland design model for ISS or TP showed that mean target levels could be achieved, given expected influent concentrations, when the ratio of pond surface to wetland surface was 12. Constructed wetlands can perform satisfactorily as recirculation filters in large-scale shrimp aquaculture operations, reducing the impact of effluent on local water bodies, conserving large quantities of water and providing valuable ecological habitat.

AB Two 8-week feeding trials were conducted with juvenile Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone) to compare the growth and performance of animals fed a series of experimental and commercial pelleted shrimp and fish feeds and dietary feeding regimes within an indoor running-water culture system and an outdoor zero-water-exchange culture system. The best overall shrimp growth performance was observed for animals fed the experimental shrimp diet and all-day feeding regime under outdoor zero-water-exchange culture conditions. Final body weight and average weekly growth rate under these conditions were 2.8 and 3.4 times greater, respectively, than animals of similar size fed with the same diet under indoor running-water culture conditions. Although direct comparison between indoor and outdoor culture systems is difficult because of the lower indoor water temperatures, and consequently lower mean daily feed intake of animals, it is believed that the higher growth and feed performance of animals reared under outdoor `green-water' culture conditions was primarily due to their ability to obtain additional nutrients from food organisms endogenously produced within the zero-water-exchange culture system. The most promising features of zero-water-exchange culture systems are that they offer increased biosecurity, reduced feed costs and water use for the farmer, and by doing so provide a potential avenue of moving the shrimp culture industry along a path of greater sustainability and environmental compatibility.

AB The emergence of environmental governance for sustainable development as a field of inquiry has stimulated a plethora of research into new formations for governing the environment. Partnerships hold an exalted status in these formations, but there has been surprisingly little evaluative work of their activities. This paper extends that embryonic analysis through empirical consideration of a partnership established to foster the development of sustainable communities, specifically by stimulating greater public participation in positive environmental activities. Theoretical insights about patterns of power, perceived authority and legitimacy in the partnership are developed through a consideration of 'actor-spaces' and the 'sociology of translation' that emerge from actor-network theory.

AB Environmental policies and responses are strongly influenced by a government's knowledge and understanding of environmental problems, its assessment of their severity, the expert opinions available to it on the size of the response needed, its understanding of the driving forces leading to environmental deterioration and the influence of prevailing theories and paradigms. Environmental policy cannot furthermore exist in a policy vacuum. Environmental goals may or may not be strongly weighted compared to other societal goals especially economic goals. All these influences have major bearing on the approach taken by governments to environmental policy.

AB The dwarf shrub heather Calluna vulgaris is an important component of the UK landscape, with value for amenity, nature conservation and animal production. A model, called "HeathMod", is described, which investigates the impact of grazing on upland heather. It combines an empirical model of production with a simple process-based model of grazing impacts. Validation from short-term studies in the literature indicated that the model predicts grazing impacts well, although more studies of grazing impacts are required to confirm the model's accuracy. Analysis of the model allowed derivation of a simple general formula for predicting sustainable levels of grazing, given knowledge of local site productivity. Predicted levels of sustainable grazing were lower than previous estimates, mainly because the model predicts the long-term impacts of sustained grazing. Application of the model is most appropriate in areas where heather is in mixed-age stands, because there is inadequate information available to model interactions between grazing and degeneration in even-aged stands of heather.

TI Land-use and the conservation of Sharpe's Longclaw Macronyx sharpei in
   central Kenya
SO BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
ID LANDSCAPE
AB The highland grasslands of central Kenya hold a suite of restricted-range bird species, including several of global conservation concern. These grasslands occur almost entirely on private land with no formal protection, and have received little conservation attention. This paper describes land-use change on the Kinangop Plateau, Kenya, and considers the implications for grassland bird species, especially Sharpe's Longclaw Macronyx sharpei. The Kinangop Plateau is an area of montane grassland east of the Rift Valley, used primarily for dairy farming since human settlement in 1964. However, dairy farming (which retains grassland as pasture) has given way to other forms of land-use, especially cultivation of crops. In March 1996, a questionnaire was administered to 50 landowners to investigate community attitudes towards birds and their conservation, the extent of present land-use changes and likely future land-use patterns, The mean acreage of landholding was decreasing, and more grassland was rapidly being converted into cultivated land, with 3.2% being ploughed up during the six months from November 1995 to May 1996. Farmers expressed a preference for crop farming (66%) over livestock farming (26%) or other land uses. Thirty-two per cent expressed a positive attitude, and 60% were indifferent, towards birds. Most (76%) were not aware of biodiversity values or conservation. Though 64% were aware of declining bird populations around them, 82% of this group did not realize that their activities might be contributing to this decline. Sixty-eight per cent of landowners planned to convert all or part of their grassland holdings. Although landowners' interests seemed generally incompatible with grassland conservation, a substantial proportion (44%) were prepared to consider opportunities to enhance the area's conservation value. An informal follow-up survey in March 1999 concluded that prospects for the dairy industry and for grassland habitats on Kinangop were not as bleak as the initial survey suggested, but confirmed the delicate conservation status of Sharpe's Longclaw and its habitat. We suggest a variety of actions that might help to secure the future of Sharpe's Longclaw while promoting sustainable agricultural development on Kinangop, and propose several topics where further research is needed. Species such as Sharpe's Longclaw will only survive if we can develop ways of managing their habitats in a manner that is consistent, rather than in conflict, with the needs of the agricultural community.

TI Tapping in time: A longitudinal study at the ages of three to five years
SO BULLETIN OF THE COUNCIL FOR RESEARCH IN MUSIC EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID RHYTHM
AB This work shows the result of the tapping in time performances of nine children across three consecutive years: 1999, 2000 and 2001 at the ages of three, four and five years old, and belonging to two urban middle class kindergartens. Tapping with music implies synchrony. This kind of performance involves different tasks: tactus tracking of the musical fragment, flexibility and fluency in the tapping motion and the distribution of onsets in time. The current question is about the characteristics of synchrony at these ages, the stability or change within each age and the identification of tendencies in two of the isolated variables: correspondence and sustainability. A test has been developed that consists of tapping the tactus in a musical fragment in which the metrical and phenomenological accents match. our test shows that correspondence and sustainability improves with age: some performances are random during the period and, in a few cases, some children do not improve during the period.

TI Leveraging Internet technologies in B2B relationships
SO CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Why is it that two firms can use the Internet in the same way (e.g., to reach new customers) and achieve very different outcomes? How can firms better allocate and subsequently leverage the investments they make in Internet technologies? This article shows that e-commerce technologies cannot be successfully leveraged without considering the organizational relationships in which the technologies are being embedded. By properly matching the B2B context with Internet technologies, firms can be in a better position not only to achieve significant economic outcomes, but also to attain sustainable competitive advantages, improve coordination and collaboration processes, and decrease channel resistance.

TI Client co-production in knowledge-intensive business services
SO CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID HUMAN-RESOURCES; TRUST; COMMITMENT
AB A common characteristic of knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) firms is that clients routinely play a critical role in co-producing the service solution along with the service provider. This can have a profound effect on both the quality of the service delivered as well as the client's ultimate satisfaction with the knowledge-based service solution. Based on research conducted with an IT consulting firm and work done with other knowledge-intensive business service providers, this article describes clients' key role responsibilities that are essential for effective client co-production in KIBS partnerships. It then presents strategies that service providers can use to manage clients so they perform their roles effectively. By strategically managing client co-production, service providers can improve operational efficiency, develop more optimal solutions, and generate a sustainable competitive advantage.

TI AN ASSESSMENT OF LAND USE CHANGES IN FUQING COUNTY OF CHINA USING REMOTE
   SENSING TECHNOLOGY
SO CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE land use change; remote sensing; GIS; driving force
AB Fuqing County of southeast China has witnessed significant land use changes during the last decade. Remote sensing technology using multitemporal Landsat TM images was used to characterize land use types and to monitor land use changes in the county. Two TM scenes from 1991 and 1996 were used to cover the county and a five-year time period. Digital image processing was carried out for the remotely sensed data to produce classified images. The images were further processed using GIS software to generate GIS databases so that the data could be further spatially analyzed taking the advantages of the software. Land use change areas were determined by using the change detection technique. The comparison of the two classified TM images using the above technologies reveals that during the five study years, a large area of arable lands in the county has been lost and deforestation has taken place largely because of the dramatic increase in built-up land and orchard. The conclusive statistical information is useful to understand the processes, causes and impacts of the land use changes in the county. The major driving force to the land use changes in the county appeared to be the rapid economic development. The decision makers of the county have to pay more attention to the land use changes for the county's sustainable development.

DT Article
DE urban challenges and problems; urban governance; urban policies
AB China's urban reforms have brought social progress and development, but a comprehensive national system of social welfare (for example, unemployment insurance, pensions, medical care and public housing) for new migrants from rural areas is lacking. One of the most remarkable changes in Chinese cities in the last decade was a change in social "equality", with the rise of new poverty both in individual communities and some social groups in urban society. However, there is little social assistance and public infrastructure for the migrants. Governments or communities or individual should pay attention to the control of new urban poverty and new slums. This paper consider that it is necessary to launch a successful policy, which include mainly: 1) accommodating urban growth through low-cost investment projects; 2) urban economy depends heavily on successful macroeconomic policy; 3) to broaden the three channels linking adjustment to the incidence of urban poverty; 4) to restructure urban economic based on the high or new technology; 5) to coordinate relationship between urban economic growth and environment management for sustainable development of Beijing's metropolitan fringe.

   system dynamics
AB Miyun Reservoir was designated as the water source of Beijing City in 1982. Since that time, socio-economic development in Miyun Area has been slowing due to the restriction of severe environmental standards. More and more attention from the public and government has been paid to the regional sustainable development. And an effective planning for the local society management system is urgently desired. In this study, a regional sustainable development system dynamics model, named MiyunSD, is developed for supporting this planning task. MiyunSD consists of dynamic simulation models that explicitly consider information feedback that governs interactions in the system. Such models are capable of simulating the system's behavior and predicting its developing situation of the future. For the study case, interactions among a number of system components within a time frame of fifteen years are examined dynamically. Three planning alternatives are carefully considered. The base run is based on an assumption that the existing pattern of human activities will prevail in the entire planning horizon, and the other alternatives are based on previous and present planning studies. The different alternatives will get different system's environmental and socio-economic results. Through analyzing these dynamic results, local authorities may find an optimal way to realize the objectives that the regional environment will be well protected and at the same time the economy will be rapidly developed.

AB The yield of the Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax caeruleus from Bahia Magdalena, B.C.S., was analyzed using a stock-recruitment model. The model was stochastic, and it used the hypotheses of process error (H-1) in the model, and observation error (H-2) in the data. The results showed a positive bias in the management quantities and the parameters of the model. Confronting both hypotheses with a Monte Carlo simulation resulted in evidences of the effect of the observation error in the measurement of the adult stock of the sardine population. Statistical analysis supported in the Bayes theorem showed that the probabilities estimated from a maximum likelihood model for hypothesis H, are informative enough as prior probability. In this way, the maximun sustainable yield (MSY) of the fishery was 14,400 t with u(MSY) = 0.35. The decision table showed that parameters of the model have a probability > 0.80 for alpha (density-independent parameter) between 0.040 and 0.058, while beta (density-dependent parameter) varies between 1.6 and 2.2 with a probability > 0.85. The joint distribution of both parameters allowed a yield 10,100 t < MSY < 20,200 t per fishing season.

AB The reform program implemented in Argentina a decade ago became emblematic of how neo-liberal policies could bring about miraculous economic recovery. Thus, the recent collapse of Argentina's economy has called into question the sustainability of the neo-liberal development model adopted by most Latin American countries during the 1990s. By examining Argentina's municipal and housing policies during the past decade, this paper brings some insights into the failings of Argentina's reform program. The analysis indicates that, as a result of a narrow focus on economic growth and macroeconomic performance, Argentina's reform program failed to address the challenges faced within individual sectors. The paper also indicates that poverty alleviation and other social objectives were relegated to less importance than economic objectives, and were not purposely sought in the context of sector policies. The downfall of Argentina's economy is particularly grim in view of mounting unemployment, increased income disparities, and other social costs resulting from the reform program, and should reminds us of the risks of forgoing social objectives for the sake of macroeconomic performance.

AB Successful conservation of nontimber products and their rainforest habitats requires the identification of optimal harvest regimes, the accurate estimation of maximum harvest limits, and the implementation of those limits by local harvesters. We used a combination of participatory research techniques and demographic modeling to determine maximum sustainable harvest rates of the bromeliad Aechmea magdalenae in the buffer zone of the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve in Mexico. We examined the effects of three types of variation on maximum harvest rates: variation between forest types, between harvest regimes, and over time. We also tested the accuracy of estimating maximum harvest limits using matrix-model projections of unharvested populations. Maximum harvest rates of ramets from secondary forest populations were much higher than from primary-forest populations. Likewise, variation in local harvest regimes had a large effect on maximum harvest rates. Populations concurrently harvested for leaves and ramets had higher maximum sustainable levels of ramet harvest than those harvested for ramets only. Simulations using harvested and unharvested populations yielded significantly different estimates of maximum sustainable harvest limits, indicating that methods for calculating maximum harvest limits that assume linear responses to harvest may lead to erroneous conclusions. Active participation in the research process enabled local harvesters to accept as valid the harvest limits determined in this study, to switch to using a more sustainable harvest regime, and to pass a local law prohibiting the destruction of their remaining primary forest because of its potential as A. magdalenae habitat.

   ENVIRONMENT; DYNAMICS; SCIENCE; GROWTH
AB This paper shows that it is difficult, if not impossible, to formulate policies that guarantee that tourism can be maintained for a long time without severely impacting on the environment. The analysis is purely theoretical and is based on very simple and general assumptions about the interactions between the three main components of the system: the tourists, the environment, and the capital. These assumptions are encapsulated in a so-called minimal model, used to predict the economic and environmental impact of any given policy. This paper is of value for three reasons. First, it introduces the approach of minimal descriptive models in the context of tourism, which has traditionally been dominated by the use of black-box econometric models. Second, the specific results are quite interesting. We show, in fact, that tourism sustainability can be achieved, provided agents are prudent about reinvesting their profits and are willing to protect the environment, but that sustainability is very often at risk, because unforeseen shocks can easily trigger a switch from a profitable and compatible behavior to an unprofitable or incompatible one. These results are in line with conventional wisdom and observations, but the interesting fact is that here they are theoretically derived from a few very simple and abstract premises. Third, although not directly related to the problem of tourism but rather to the general topic of sustainability, this is one of the first times that the notion of sustainability, which is more and more pervasive in the field of resource management, is interpreted strictly in terms of the structural properties of the attractors of a dynamic system. This creates an important and promising bridge between sustainability and bifurcation theory, one of the most important areas of systems analysis.

AB Brazil will benefit if it gains control of its vast Amazonian timber resources. Without immediate planning, the fate of much of the Amazon will be decided by predatory and largely unregulated timber interests. Logging in the Amazon is a transient process of natural resource mining. Older logging frontiers are being exhausted of timber resources and will face severe wood shortages within 5 yr. The Brazilian government can avoid the continued repetition of this process in frontier areas by establishing a network of National Forests (Florestas Nacionais or Flonas) to stabilize the timber industry and simultaneously protect large tracts of forest. Flonas currently comprise less than 2% of the Brazilian Amazon (83,000 km(2)). If all these forests were used for sustainable logging, they would provide less than 10% of the demand for Amazonian timber. To sustainably supply the present and near-future demand for timber, approximately 700,000 km(2) of the Amazon forest needs to be brought into well-managed production. Brazil's National Forest Program, launched in 2000, is designed to create at least 400,000 km(2) of new Flonas. Objective decision-making tools are needed to site these new national forests. We present here a method for optimally locating the needed Flonas that incorporates information on existing protected areas, current vegetation cover, areas of human occupation, and timber stocks. The method combines these data in a spatial database that makes it possible to model the economic potential of the region's various forests as a function of their accessibility and timber values while constraining model solutions for existing areas of protection or human occupation. Our results indicate that 1.15 x 10(6) km(2) of forests (23% of the Brazilian Amazon) could be established as Flonas in a manner that will promote sustainable forest management; these Flonas would also serve as buffer zones for fully protected areas such as parks and reserves.

TI Resilience management in social-ecological systems: a working hypothesis

ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; DYNAMICS; COMPLEXITY; SCENARIOS
AB Approaches to natural resource management are often based on a presumed ability to predict probabilistic responses to management and external drivers such as climate. They also tend to assume that the manager is outside the system being managed. However, where the objectives include long-term sustainability, linked social-ecological systems (SESs) behave as complex adaptive systems, with the managers as integral components of the system. Moreover, uncertainties are large and it may be difficult to reduce them as fast as the system changes. Sustainability involves maintaining the functionality of a system when it is perturbed, or maintaining the elements needed to renew or reorganize if a large perturbation radically alters structure and function. The ability to do this is termed "resilience." This paper presents an evolving approach to analyzing resilience in SESs, as a basis for managing resilience. We propose a framework with four steps, involving close involvement of SES stakeholders. It begins with a stakeholder-led development of a conceptual model of the system, including its historical profile (how it got to be what it is) and preliminary assessments of the drivers of the supply of key ecosystem goods and services. Step 2 deals with identifying the range of unpredictable and uncontrollable drivers, stakeholder visions for the future, and contrasting possible future policies, weaving these three factors into a limited set of future scenarios. Step 3 uses the outputs from steps 1 and 2 to explore the SES for resilience in an iterative way. It generally includes the development of simple models of the system's dynamics for exploring attributes that affect resilience. Step 4 is a stakeholder evaluation of the process and outcomes in terms of policy and management implications. This approach to resilience analysis is illustrated using two stylized examples.

AB Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria is characterised with compact land mass and traditional farming practices with rudimentary farm tools and implements. Bush fallowing, constitutes the main farm management technique. Expansion of production can only be achieved through agricultural intensification rather than through expansion of land holdings. But chemical inputs for intensification are scarce and costly and therefore unaffordable by the millions of small farmers. This study has found that with improved varieties of cassava cuttings and maize seeds provided by various agricultural agencies in the state, the application of organic manure together with farmers' education, crop yield can significantly improve. The paper, therefore, calls for an integrated farming system so that farmers can use the animal manure for their crops for increased yields.

AB Apex predators in pelagic ecosystems may play key roles in determining food web structure and ecosystem dynamics. Commercial fisheries can thereby have large effects on pelagic ecosystems by selectively harvesting apex predators. We assessed the potential ecological consequences of fishing due to alternative harvest practices currently employed in the capture of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). Specifically, we estimated the demand on the prey resources consumed by yellowfin tuna and how this demand is altered by three methods of pure seining and by long-lining. These fishing techniques are contrasted by stark differences in age selectivity; longline and purse seine sets on yellowfin associated with dolphins ("dolphin sets") capture old fish, whereas purse seine sets on free-swimming tuna schools or floating objects ("dolphin-safe sets") capture young yellowfin. Yellowfin tuna predation rates were estimated froth a bioenergetics model coupled with a population model based on natural mortality estimates and age-specific vulnerabilities for each gear type. Maximum equilibrium fishery catch (measured in megagrams per year; 1 Mg = 1 metric ton) was lowest fur dolphin-safe sets and highest for dolphin sets and longline fishing. Moreover, the present combined fishery yield could not be sustained by either of the dolphin-safe sets, but could be sustained with either dolphin sets or long-lining. The predation rate of the yellowfin population was highly sensitive to the magnitude and type of fishing mortality: yellow fin predation rate declined by similar to119 Mg per megagram of floating object set catch, 72 Mg per megagram of school fish set catch. In contrast, predation declined by only 34 Mg and 17 Mg per megagram of dolphin set and longline catch, respectively. When considering all fishing techniques simultaneously in proportion to the present fishery, we estimated that total yellowfin predation is presently only one-third the magnitude expected froth an unfished population. This reduction in predation was unevenly distributed among prey items; the prey of large yellowfin experienced 80% less predation, whereas the prey of small yellowfin experienced only 50% less predation, compared to an unfished population. We conclude that fisheries can have large effects on trophic linkages in pelagic food webs even when fishing rates are sustainable, and that these ecological effects vary considerably for different types of fishing gear and fishing practices.

AB The purpose of this special issue is to elucidate concepts of value and methods of valuation that will assist in guiding human decisions vis-a-vis ecosystems. The concept of ecosystem service value can be a useful guide when distinguishing and measuring where trade-offs between society and the rest of nature are possible and where they can be made to enhance human welfare in a sustainable manner. While win-win opportunities for human activities within the environment may exist, they also appear to be increasingly scarce in a 'full' global ecological-economic system. This makes valuation all the more essential for guiding future human activity. This paper provides some history, background, and context for many of the issues addressed by the remaining papers in this special issue. Its purpose is to place both economic and ecological meanings of value, and their respective valuation methods, in a comparative context, highlighting strengths, weakness and addressing questions that arise from their integration.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB A 'value of ecosystem services' (VES) may be calculated by multiplying a set of ecosystem services by a set of corresponding shadow prices. This paper examines the role of the VES concept in measuring trends in human wellbeing. Under conventional arguments from applied welfare economics, standard measures of market consumption may be extended to include the value of direct environmental services, which affect welfare in ways that are not mediated by the consumption of purchased goods. The VES concept does not capture values such as ecological sustainability and distributional fairness that are not reducible to individual welfare. And its operationalization is constrained by the well-known limitations of nonmarket valuation methods. Nonetheless, attempts to calculate the value of environmental services can provide insights into the tradeoffs between market activity and environmental quality that are implicit in the process of economic growth. Such efforts can promote informed debate concerning the achievement of sustainable development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We estimated global marketed and non-marketed economic value front two classified satellite images with global coverage at 1 km(2) resolution. GDP (a measure of marketed economic output) is correlated with the amount of light energy (LE) emitted by that nation as measured by nighttime satellite images. LE emitted is more spatially explicit than whole country GDP, may (for some nations or regions) be a more accurate indicator of economic activity than GDP itself, can be directly observed, and can be easily updated on an annual basis. As far as we know, this is the first global map of estimated economic activity produced at this high spatial resolution (1 km(2)). Ecosystem services product (ESP) is an important type of non-marketed value. ESP at 1 km(2) resolution was estimated using the IGBP land-cover dataset and unit ecosystem service values estimated by Costanza et al. [Valuing Ecosystem Services with Efficiency, Fairness and Sustainability as Goals. Nature's Services, Island Press, Washington DC, pp. 49-70]. The sum of these two (GDP + ESP) = SEP is a measure of the subtotal ecological-economic product (marketed plus a significant portion of the non-marketed). The ratio: (ESP/SEP) x 100 = (%ESP is a measure of proportion of the SEP from ecosystem services. Both SEP and %ESP were calculated and mapped for each 1 km(2) pixel on the earth's surface, and aggregated by country. Results show the detailed spatial patterns of GDP, ESP, and SEP (also available at: http://www.du.edu/ similar to psutton/esiindexisee/EcolEconESI.htm). Globally, while GDP is concentrated in the northern industrialized countries, ESP is concentrated in tropical regions and in wetlands and other coastal systems. (X)ESP ranges from 1% for Belgium and Luxembourg to 3% for the Netherlands, 18% for India, 22% for the United States, 49% for Costa Rica, 57% for Chile, 73% for Brazil, and 92% for Russia. While GDP per capita has the usual northern industrialized countries at the top of the list, SEP per capita shows a quite different picture, with a mixture of countries with either high GDP/capita, high ESP/capita, or a combination near the top of the list. Finally, we compare our results with two other indices: (1) The 2001 Environmental Sustainabilily Index (ESI) derived as an initiative of the Global Leaders of Tomorrow Environment Task Force, World Economic Foruin, and (2) Ecological Footprints of Nations: How much Nature do they use? How much Nature do they have? developed by Mathis Wackernagel and others. While both of these indices purport to measure sustainability, the ESI is actually mainly a measure of economic activity (and is correlated with GDP), while the Eco-Footprint index is a measure of environmental impact. The related eco-deficit (national ecological capacity minus national footprint) correlates well with %ESP. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bibliographical study of articles published in scientific journals over the last 10 years, and of books published over the last 20 years, reveals a clear increase in the number of publications dealing with ecological engineering, particularly on aquatic ecosystems, which today are becoming a major topic. The concept of ecological restoration must be clearly defined scientifically and include adequate pre- and post-restoration monitoring of various performance indicators, to allow for restoration, evaluation and increase its success. A restoration experiment was carried out in a former channel of the Rhone River according to a scientifically based decision framework. Long-term monitoring of aquatic vegetation (17 years of data) on two former channels (reference and restored ecosystem) clearly demonstrated human impacts on aquatic ecosystems. A channel exhibiting rapid terrestrialization and eutrophication processes after completion of a hydroelectric scheme construction was restored. In keeping with the hypothesis, the increase in groundwater supply led the restored ecosystem to return to a less advanced and self-sustainable successional stage, whereas vegetation monitoring in the reference channel did not show significant changes over this 17-year of period, supporting long-term studies to determine the effects of restoration on the biota.

AB The European eel panmicitic population has been declining at least since the 1980s throughout its distribution area. The stocks are now ten times lower than they were initially. The causes of this decline are reviewed in this paper: marine causes such as Gulf Stream shifts are thought to reduce survival of leptocephali larvae during their transoceanic migration, but inland causes are also suspected, i.e. overfishing of all continental stages, obstructions to upstream and downstream migrations, habitat loss, water quality, parasite and xenobiotic contamination, which together contribute to reducing quality and quantity of spawner escapement from European inland waters to sea. Restoration programs have been conducted in several inland hydrosystems in Europe. If local fisheries have been sustained mainly by stocking elvers and glass eels, no significant restoration of the population has been observed suggesting that restoration plans are inefficient, despite significant efforts and relevant technologies (fish passage). The causes for the failure of restoration projects are listed and discussed, and it is shown that the minimum scale to work at is the catchment area. But international cooperation is required to coordinate programs, to determine common objectives and policies. Concepts for Sustainable restoration and management are provided and discussed together with the general interest of eel population as a biointegrator of the quality and integrity of inland hydrosystems.

AB Complex environmental and ecological problems require collaborative, interdisciplinary efforts. A common approach to integratirig disciplinary perspectives on these problems is to develop simulation models in which the linkages between system components are explicitly represented. There is, however, little guidance in the literature on how such models should be developed through collaborative teamwork. in this paper, we offer a set of heuristics (rules of thumb) that address a range of challenges associated with this enterprise, including the selection of team members, negotiating a consensus View Of the research problem, prototyping and refining models, the role of sensitivity analysis, and the importance of team communication. These heuristics arose front a comparison of our experiences with several interdisciplinary modeling projects. We use one such experience-a project in which natural scientists, social scientists, and local residents came together to investigative the sustainability of small indigenous communities in the Arctic illustrate the heuristics.

TI Overview of renewable energy sources in the Republic of the Sudan
SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sudan is an agricultural country with fertile land, plenty of water resources, livestock, forestry resources and agricultural residues. An overview of the energy situation in Sudan is introduced with reference to the end uses and regional distribution. Energy sources are divided into two main types: conventional energy (biomass, petroleum products and electricity) and non-conventional energy (solar, wind, hydro, etc.). Sudan possesses a relatively high abundance of solar radiation, moderate wind speeds, hydro and biomass energy resources. Application of new and renewable sources of energy available in Sudan is now a major issue in strategic planning for alternatives to fossil fuels to provide part of local energy demand. Sudan is an important case study in the context of renewable energy. It has a long history of meeting its energy needs through renewables. Sudan's renewables portfolio is broad and diverse, due in part to the country's wide range of climates and landscapes. Like many of the African leaders in renewable energy utilisation, Sudan has a well-defined commitment to continue research, development and implementation of new technologies. Sustainable low-carbon energy scenarios for the new century emphasise the untapped potential of renewable resources. Rural areas of Sudan can benefit from this transition. The increased availability of reliable and efficient energy services stimulates new development alternatives. Renewable environmentally friendly energy must be encouraged, promoted, implemented and demonstrated, for use in the Republic of the Sudan. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Increased thermodynamic efficiency coupled with reduced impact on the environment are fundamental aims in the generation and rational use of energy if a contribution is to be made towards sustainable development on both a local and worldwide scale. Technological developments over recent years in the field of thermal electricity generation, together with research and technologies emerging from environmentally friendly systems, are allowing increases in the efficiency of energy generating processes accompanied by a reduction in polluting gases released into the atmosphere. This work develops the methodology for defining and designing a cogeneration plant based on a combined cycle and using a computer program to provide time simulation. By way of example, the results obtained from the thermal power station of a chemical complex are given. As a novel feature, the work includes the application of a system to capture carbon dioxide, a gas that makes a significant contribution to the so-called 'greenhouse effect', the main cause of global warning. The work carried out allows highly accurate forecasting of future working of the cogeneration system in the proposed application, and analysis of the performance of the plant as a function of its capacity to capture carbon dioxide. The work also considers the feasibility of long-term confinement of the captured carbon dioxide in the deep ocean, and analyses its impact on plant efficiency. Finally, an economical analysis of the proposed plant is included in order to evaluate the impact of the potential carbon dioxide capture and storage system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The need for construction projects to be sustainable is becoming more widely recognised, partly because of diminishing world energy resources, and partly because recent world developments (for example, global warming and increasing oil prices) have made those involved in construction more aware of a new approach to building. We often hear now of buildings with a high environmental rating, of sustainable development, and of improved comfort. The stated objective is to construct comfortable buildings, which use little energy and produce little pollution. This desire on the part of construction project leaders has led to some problems amongst architects. engineers and university researchers who tend to work in isolation from each other. However. the only way to achieve an overall improvement in building design is by close collaboration between the various participants, from when the first sketch of the future building is made. Of course, this task appears difficult because these participants have different approaches, training and 'tools of the trade'. This article aims to show that efficient cooperation between the professionals involved is possible. We will see that by producing an instructive working document, understandable by all and based on expert rules, it is possible to produce buildings which are adapted to the climate. and to spread the scientific knowledge to the more practical professions. We will illustrate our ideas by describing the methodology we used for a building project in the tropics. Finally. we will present a summary for the period 1997-2001 and will show the impact that such collaborations have had on the design of buildings in tropical climates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Synthesis or creation of a new, process system may be one of the most attractive work for engineers. At present we are requested to propose new, systems to develop a sustainable society and to keep the globe clean. For creation of ideas, some jump mechanism in brain is required, since there is no explicit algorithm for it,
   The contents of this paper are based on my experiences. First. the basic mechanism of human brain is discussed. Then three phases of process system synthesis are discussed in analogs to the architectural design of our own house. New thermodynamic approaches are developed for these three phases of design.

DE exergy for higher efficiency and lower cost; optimal design;
   second-law-based decomposition; enhanced optimization
AB The design of an energy-intensive system for lower cost and higher efficiency is one of the essential approaches to sustainable development. A principle is presented whereby exergy is elevated from a tool that reveals opportunities of higher efficiency to a tool that reveals opportunities of both lower cost and higher efficiency.
   The principle states that minimizing the individual costs of the energy conversion devices of a system with respect to their efficiency decision variables leads to a minimized cost of the system and an optimal overall system efficiency. The cost of a device is the sum of its fixed charges and its running expenses. The cost of exergy destruction of a device is its major running expense.
   The premises on which the principle is established are explained. Second-law analysis and design models of energy conversion devices play a central role in establishing these premises. Three useful design model manipulations seeking equations for the costing and for the performance of energy conversion devices are presented. Applications to the optimal design of systems and extensions to their optimal operation are given elsewhere. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper concerns a new method of sewage sludge treatment that contributes more than traditional methods to the sustainable technology by achieving a higher rational efficiency of sludge processing. This is obtained by preserving the chemical exergy present in the sludge and transforming it into a chemical one-methanol. The proposed method combines a sludge gasification process and a modified methanol plant. The sludge gasification produces a synthetic gas mainly containing CO and H-2 which gas is next used as a reactant to make methanol.
   The plant, with a capacity of 50000 tons (dry) solids per year. is simulated by a computer model using the flow-sheeting program Aspen Plus (Aspen Technology). The exergy analysis is performed for various operating conditions and the optimal values of these conditions are found. The irreversibilities of different plant segments: thermal dryer, gasifier, gas cleaning, compressors, methanol reactor, distillation column and purge gas combustion are evaluated. It is shown that the rational efficiency of the overall process is much higher than that of traditional plants of thermal sludge treatment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper extensively concentrates on energy and environmental impacts only. Energy utilisation and its major environmental impacts are discussed froth the standpoint of sustainable development, including anticipated patterns of future energy use and subsequent environmental issues in Turkey. Several aspects relating to energy utilisation, renewable energy, energy efficiency, environment and sustainable development are examined froth both current and future perspectives. Turkey is an energy-importing country; more than half of the energy requirement has been supplied by imports. Domestic oil and lignite reserves are limited and lignites are characterised by high ash, sulphur and moisture content. Due to increasing energy consumption, air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern for the future of the country. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions for sustainable energy development and environmental pollution preventation in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Turkey is an energy importing country; more than half of the energy requirement has been supplied by imports. Domestic oil and lignite reserves are limited, and lignites are characterized by high ash, sulfur and moisture content. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources. Because of this and the fact that it has limited fossil fuel resources, a gradual shift from fossil fuels to renewables seems to be serious and the sole alternative for Turkey. This article presents a review of the present energy situation and sustainability, technical and economical potential of renewable energy sources, and future policies for the energy, sector in Turkey. Throughout this paper several problems relating to energy sources and sustainable development are discussed from both current and future perspectives.

AB The authors consider the role of institutional networks in integrated and inclusive coastal-zone management in Trinidad and Tobago. Drawing on theories of social institutions, a framework for understanding the institutional prerequisites for participatory management is developed. In this framework, distinction is made between institutions at the community, formal-organisational, and national regulatory levels and the means by which institutions adapt to and learn about new issues in terms of networks of dependence and exchange are characterised. The immediate networks between actors (their spaces of dependence) are augmented by wider networks between institutions at various scales (their spaces of exchange). This framework is applied to a case study of resource management in Trinidad and Tobago. Semistructured interviews with key government urban and economic planners, fisheries regulators, and other agents in Trinidad and Tobago, and a participatory workshop for resource managers, are used to identify the perceived opportunities and constraints relating to integrated and inclusive resource management within the social institutions. The findings are analysed through an exploration of the spaces of dependence and exchange that exist in the various social networks at the different institutional scales. The prescriptive relevance of this approach is in the demonstration of the nature of change required in social institutions at all scales to facilitate integrated and inclusive resource management.

ID CALIFORNIA
AB The production, certification, and marketing of organic agriculture developed slowly in the West as a nongovernmental, community-based response to concerns over food safety and the environmental impacts of chemical agriculture. The current emergence of organic agriculture in less-developed nations is following a very different trajectory owing to the presence of an established global market for organic products and the developmental goals of interventionist states. In this paper I examine the emergence of state-sponsored organic marketing and certification programs in the Peoples' Republic of China as an extreme case of developmental state intervention in organic agriculture. I find that the predominance of state and market instead of community and ecology in the Chinese organic 'movement' has profound implications for the ability of organics to promote environmentally sustainable agriculture in less-developed nations. Direct state intervention may overcome some of the public-goods and collective-action problems often associated with organic agriculture. However, conflicts of interest between the state as regulator and as producer erode the consumer trust upon which organic markets rely. The use of political authority to organize organic production allows state entrepreneurs to capture market premiums, reducing farmer innovation and long-term incentive, and exacerbating free-rider problems. The case of organic agriculture in China demonstrates the need for caution when applying universalistic economic theories about environmental problems to diverse political economies. This has important implications for international environmental regimes as well as the globalization of eco-consumerism or eco-labeling strategies.

AB The concerns of environmental ethics on other continents fail in Antarctica, which is without sustainable development, or ecosystems for a "land ethic," or even familiar terrestrial fauna and flora. An Antarctic regime, developing politically, has been developing an ethics, underrunning the politics, remarkably exemplified in the Madrid Protocol, protecting "the intrinsic value of Antarctica." Without inhabitants, claims of sovereignty are problematic. Antarctica is a continent for scientists and, more recently, tourists. Both focus on wild nature. Life is driven to extremes; these extremes can intensify an ethic. Antarctica as common heritage transforms into wilderness, sanctuary, wonderland. An appropriate ethics for the seventh continent differs radically from that for the other six.

AB Community-based conservation and development has become the prevailing programmatic paradigm of conservation organizations and development donors over the last 20 years, spawning a myriad of integrated conservation and development projects (ICDP) around the world. Appealing for its ambitious aspiration to harmonize sustainable economic development at the local level with the conservation of legally established protected areas (e.g., parks and reserves), the ICDP approach recently has drawn criticism from conservation biologists for failing to ensure adequate protection of biodiversity. Development planners and economists have also raised questions about the financial sustainability of ICDPs in practice and the replicability of the model from highly local contexts to larger regional scales, This paper briefly reviews the central elements of the concept of integrated conservation and development and the emerging debate over its effectiveness, A description of the Community Initiative Program (CIP), a pilot program of the Rondonia Natural Resources Management project (PLANAFLORO) in the western Brazilian Amazon state of Rondonia, follows. The CIP is a significant experiment because it boldly attempted to apply the principles of ICDP to the regional scale involving numerous different communities in one program simultaneously. Based on the author's mid-term review of the CIP in 1999, the development and conservation impacts of the program are considered. While the CIP has not significantly curbed the degradation of protected areas in Rondonia as intended, the evidence suggests lower rates of deforestation in municipios (i.e. counties) with the highest concentrations of CIP projects, Although the economic development impacts are mixed, approximately 50% of the projects delivered tangible benefits to local communities. Lessons learned from the CIP are presented in the final section. Among the lessons learned from the CIP, detailed in the final section, are several that will be familiar to other ICDP evaluators: the importance of thematic coherence in initial project design, the need for explicit attention on environmental conservation objectives, deficient institutional capacity of implementing organizations, inadequate attention to women's concerns and roles in community projects, and lack of technical criteria for measuring project sustainability.

TI A green industrial revolution? - Sustainable technological innovation in
   a global age
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
AB In declaring that the twenty-first century could be defined by a new 'green industrial revolution', Factor Four and Natural Capitalism suggests that an increasingly pronounced 'technological turn' is occurring in the environmental debate. Yet, how credible is this project as a whole? While hampered by managerialist and technologically reductionist premises, this paper nevertheless suggests this 'ecomodernist' project deserves careful scrutiny. However, the extent to which the political narrative which frames Factor Four and Natural Capitalism is internally consistent is examined. Whether the emerging spatial and temporal geography of a neo-liberal global political economy is compatible with this project is considered. Finally, the wisdom (and desirability) of leaving it up to business interests to dominate and define sustainable technological innovation is evaluated.

TI Response scenarios for the deltaic plain of the Rhone in the face of an
   acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise with special attention to
   Salicornia-type environments

AB One of the most critical problems facing many deltaic wetlands is a high rate of relative sea-level rise due to a combination of eustatic sea-level rise and local subsidence. Within the Rhone delta, the main source of mineral input to soil formation is from die river, due to the low tidal range and the presence of a continuous sea wall. We carried out field and modeling studies to assess the present environmental status and future conditions of the more stressed sites, i.e., Salicornia-type marshes with a shallow, hypersaline groundwater. The impacts of management practices are considered by comparing impounded areas with riverine areas connected to the Rhone River. Analysis of vegetation transects showed differences between mean soil elevation of Arthrocnemum fruticosum (+31.2 cm), Arthrocnemum glaucum (+26.5 cm), bare soil (+16.2 cm), and permanently flooded soil (-12.4 cm). Aboveground and belowground production showed that root:shoot ratio for A. fruticosum and A. glaucum was 2.9 and 1.1, respectively, indicating more stressful environmental conditions for A. glaucum with a higher soil salinity and lack of soil drainage. The annual leaf litter production rate of the two species is 30 times higher than annual stem litter production, but with a higher long-term decomposition rate associated with leaves. We developed a wetland elevation model designed to predict the effect of increasing rates of sea-level rise on wetland elevation and Salicornia production. The model takes into account feedback mechanisms between soil elevation and river mineral input, and primary production. In marshes still connected to the river, mineral input decreased quickly when elevation was over 21 cm. Under current sea-level rise conditions, the annual amount of riverine mineral input needed to maintain the elevation of the study marshes is between 3,000 and 5,000 g m(-2) yr(-1). Simulations showed that under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change best estimate sea-level rise scenario, a mineral input of 6,040 g m(-2) yr(-1) is needed to maintain marsh elevation. The medium term response capacity of the Rhone deltaic plain with rising sea level depends mainly on the possibility of supplying sediment from the river to the delta, even though the Rhone Delta front is wave dominated. Within coastal impounded marshes, isolated from the river, the sediment supply is very low (10 to 50 g m(-2) yr(-1)), and an increase of sea-level rise would increase the flooding duration and dramatically reduce vegetation biomass. New wetland management options involving river input are discussed for a long-term sustainability of low coastal Mediterranean wetlands.

AB This paper explores the long-standing interest in the introduction of fodder legumes as an essential component of mixed farming systems in Africa. The central argument is that because of certain biological characteristics and their association with historic changes in European agricultural, fodder legumes have become endowed with a mantle of absolute goodness. However, while the screening of fodder legumes has been an important theme in agricultural research for over 70 yr, the actual level of use by farmers and livestock keepers in Africa is still insignificant. This analysis leads to a call for a more realistic approach to legume research and promotion. Particular attention is placed on the idea that the bio-physical and socio-economic factors that have previously been seen as constraints to legume adoption should now be viewed as system properties and incorporated into the design specification of technology. Without such an approach the 'logic of fodder legumes' will continue to limit the contribution that agricultural research can make in Africa. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The goal of this paper is to show how ail ecosystem-based approach can contribute simultaneously to a Multipurpose use of forest resources in mountain areas, and to the maintenance of the quality of the forests and forested landscapes producing the resources. An ecosystem-based approach in managing forest resources in mountain areas is considered as essential. Its principles, methods and instruments are introduced and illustrated with examples. The accent is put on the importance of the landscape (ecocomplex) level, the integration of ecological, economic and social considerations, and the use of multicriteria decision aid techniques.

AB Methods to monitor the sustainability of forest management oil local to regional scales are currently being developed in Europe, based on pan-European criteria. However, current approaches to indicator development have several shortcomings. First, they fail to integrate the links among indicators. Second, they do not address the factors giving rise to specific indicator values explicitly. Third, they select indicators with an emphasis on data availability or case of measurement rather than oil informational content. To overcome these problems, we propose using a modelling approach to indicator development. What modelling and indicator development have in common is that they both try to capture the essence of real, complex systems. In this paper. we present an initial attempt to develop indicators for the sustainable management of mountain forests, using a modelling approach. Key issues that make the Sustainable management of mountain forests a challenge, Such as the poor ability of many stands to fulfil current human needs, are identified. A conceptual model depicting the most relevant system elements and links is described. In contrast to the Pan-European criteria and concept areas of sustainable forest management, which are result-oriented, the elements in the conceptual model are process-oriented. The approach could lead to a better understanding of the factors influencing the decision-making at the management unit level and to the identification of a set of meaningful indicators. To evaluate its full potential, however, a simulation model should be developed based oil the conceptual model, and be applied to case studies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Local-authority and collective forms of ownership still tend to dominate in the Alpine regions. This article concentrates on collective ownership or common property in the Alps and poses the question as to its importance with respect to the sustainable use of natural resources in the mountain regions. The concept of common property or collective ownership is explained in the first part of the article, and the advantages and disadvantages of this ideal type of regulatory system, at least as presented in the literature, are explored briefly. Based on empirical examples in Switzerland, the second part of this article will demonstrate how common property regimes have changed, despite the basically unchanging nature of property rights. This article and, in particular, the selected case studies, question the results of studies carried out by Netting, who examined the management of Alpine meadows and Pastures, and forests in the Valais village of Torbel. Netting demonstrated that a differentiated collective property order for forests, meadows and Alpine pastures is no historical anachronism and can produce entirely valid results. The third part of the article is therefore concerned with recent trends and emerging management forms for forests, water Courses, and Alpine meadows and pastures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper describes the control and data acquisition system (CADAS) for the in-vessel vision system (IVVS) for ITER, which imposes special design requirements due to its reactor characteristics. CADAS provides remote real-time control of the motors (by TCP-IP), fast data acquisition (20 bytes/pixel at 100 kpixels/s), error management and sustainable network data transfer rates (by TCP-IP). It is composed of a supervisory workstation connected by a 100 Mbit/s Ethernet channel to a remote VME crate, housing a board based on a PowerPC604R CPU running LynxOS, and two on-site developed intelligent modules. The architecture of these VME modules as well as the operation software and the application protocol are described. The test results are presented as well as an image obtained during the test procedures performed at the ENEA-Frascati Laboratory. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Towards sustainable households: a methodology for developing sustainable
   technological and social innovations
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB A high factor environmental efficiency improvement, towards a Factor 20 by 2050 AD needed due to the assumed doubling of the world population combined with a fivefold increase of wealth per capita and a halving of the total global environmental burden - cannot be achieved through good housekeeping and technological innovation alone; any technological solutions will have to be combined with social innovations, in lifestyles and cultures. This paper describes the conclusions of the SusHouse (Strategies towards the Sustainable Household) Project that has been exploring possible socially and technologically innovative strategies for sustainable households. The Project has covered three household 'functions': Clothing Care, Shelter (Heating, Cooling and Lighting) and Food (Shopping, Cooking and Eating). These have been studied in five European countries (Germany, Hungary. Italy, The Netherlands and the UK). The methodology of the Project has involved stakeholder workshops, the construction of Design-Orienting Scenarios, environmental, economic and consumer assessment of the Scenarios and strategy formulation. The paper describes: (1) the methodology for devising design-orienting scenarios, with examples from the three functions; (2) the results of environmental, economic and consumer acceptability assessments of these scenarios; and (3) comments on how the methodology can be developed and applied.

TI The ethics of enough
SO FUTURES
LA English
DT Article
AB Enough is more than subsistence but is related to the ecological limits of the earth, our demands on them, and the other resources we need to live sustainable and meaningful lives. Ethics has a cultural and temporal context. In the West there has been the tussle between rational and moral ethics. The former prevailed as the benefits of science and technology emerged. Rational ethics is utilitarian, anthropocentric, and unsustainable. Moral ethics is struggling to replace its former "other worldly" and religious cloak with, at least, an ecocentric and spiritual cloak. The ethics of enough is explored in terms of needs and wants, right and wrong desires, means and ends, and, finally, moral virtue and happiness. Moral virtue alone, though, is unlikely to lead to happiness. Good fortune is also required, but cannot be acquired on one's own. It has to be bestowed, by society or a just government, which in turn has to be created by the participation and actions of its members or citizens. Both enough and the ethics are to be found in good fortune. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Assessing the cost and willingness to pay for voluntary HIV counselling
   and testing in Kenya
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
DE health care; health economics; HIV; Africa; prevention; education
AB Objective: Voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) should be an important component in a country's HIV/AIDS prevention and care strategy. However, the high cost of VCT raises concerns about the affordability of VCT in low-income countries. This study was designed to assess the costs of VCT and to identify potential ways of introducing VCT more affordably.
   Methodology: An economic evaluation was performed of VCT services in two rural health centres in Thika District and an urban health centre in Nairobi, Kenya. A contingent valuation study was also performed among VCT clients. Estimates were developed regarding the national cost of offering VCT services in Kenya.
   Results: VCT added US$6800 per year to the average cost of providing services at each of these three health centres. The evaluation revealed that the incremental cost, from the government's perspective, of adding VCT is approximately $16 per client. The estimated incremental cost per client is significantly less than a previous cost estimate in Kenya which estimated a cost per client of $26. The difference in cost estimates is in part attributable to the emphasis of this project on integrating VCT services into existing health centres, rather than creating stand-alone sites. The cost of VCT services might be further reduced to as little as $8 per client if a government health worker could perform the counselling. A contingent valuation study indicated that most VCT clients would be willing to pay at least $2 for the service. However, if the full cost of the service were charged to the client, less than 5% of clients indicated they were willing and able to pay for the service.
   Conclusions: Integrating services into existing health centres can significantly reduce the cost of VCT. Additional cost reductions may be feasible if health centre staff are hired to perform the counselling. Furthermore, it appears that some level of cost recovery from VCT clients is feasible and can contribute to sustainability, although it is very unlikely that the full cost of the service could be recovered from the clients. The national provision of VCT in all Kenyan health centres is likely to be an affordable option, although additional operational research is required to determine the most appropriate way of scaling up VCT services throughout the country.

AB Objective: to describe 10 Years of experiences of the Swedish National Bicycle Safety Programme which started during 1990 as part of an initiative taken by the World Health Organization (WHO). In relation to WHO's efforts with regard to accident and injury prevention, a global programme to increase helmet-wearing by two-wheel riders was launched. The idea was to introduce a simple 'vaccine' for everyone that was achievable at a low cost. The Swedish initiative was taken up by the Karolinska Institute and the National Institute of Public Health. Method: at an operational level, all available methods and data sources were utilized in the programme: surveillance of injuries, provision of information and advice, training and supervision, environment and product improvements, and legislation. Results: considerable progress has been made in reducing bicycle-related injuries in Sweden over the last two decades. Cycling injuries among the elderly must be a matter of particular concern. Conclusions: our 10 years of experiences from a bicycle helmet promotion programme lead to the conclusion that there is a case for mandatory helmet wearing, as one of the most important strategies on the national level. But regional and community-based efforts will still need to be more comprehensive. Besides this, efforts must be made to intensify the activities of parties already involved in prevention programmes. New target groups must be approached, such as immigrants, vulnerable social groups, and teenagers. Sustainability of the Swedish Bicycle Helmet Initiative Group, including continued participation of group members and organizations, is the key-in the long term-to protecting Swedish bicyclists against head injuries.

AB Hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) cover crops were grown in a rotation with sweet corn (Zea mays var. rugosa Bonaf.) and muskmelon (Cucumis melo L. Reticulatus group) to evaluate the legume's ability to remove excess P from soils when poultry litter was used as a fertilizer. Fertilizer treatments were: 1) litter to meet each crop's recommended preplant N requirements (1x); 2) litter at twice the recommended rate (2x); and 3) urea at the 1x rate as the control. Following the vegetable crops, hairy vetch was planted on half of each replication, while the other half was fallowed. The vetch was removed from the field in a simulated haying operation in the spring. Soil samples were taken at 0-15 cm and 1530 cm depths at the onset of the study and after each crop to monitor plant nutrient concentrations. The vetch sometimes raised soil test N concentrations at the 0-15 cm depth. Soil test P concentrations at the 0-15 cm sampling depth in the vetch system were consistently lower numerically, but not statistically, relative to comparable plots in the fallow system. Soil test P at the 0-15 cm depth was usually increased by litter at the 2x rate relative to the urea control, regardless of cropping system. Yields of both vegetable crops were similar among all cover crop and fertilizer treatments.

AB Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.)Walp.] cover crops were grown in a rotation with broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenck.), spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), and turnip greens [Brassica rapa L. var. (DC.) Metzg. utilis] to evaluate the legume's ability to remove excess P from soils when poultry litter was used as a fertilizer. Fertilizer treatments were: 1) litter to meet each crop's recommended preplant N requirements (1x); 2) litter at twice the recommended rate (2x); and 3) urea at the 1x rate as the control. Following the vegetable crops, cowpeas were planted on half of each replication, while the other half was fallowed. The cowpeas were harvested at the green-shell seed stage and then underwent a simulated haying operation to remove remaining shoot material from the field. Soil samples were taken at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depths at the onset of the study and after each crop to monitor plant nutrient concentrations. The cowpeas lowered soil test N concentrations at both soil sampling depths, but had no consistent effect on soil test P concentrations. Soil test P at the 0-15 cm depth was not increased by litter at the 1x rate but was increased by litter at the 2x rate relative to the urea control, regardless of cropping system. Poultry litter was effective as a fertilizer for all three vegetable crops, but the 1x rate appeared inadequate for maximum production of broccoli and turnip greens.

AB This chapter gives an overview of attempts in the Netherlands to restore coastal ecosystems and habitats, and explains how scientific and non-scientific information has been used to meet the goals. Indications for successes and failures of management measures taken so far, as well as dilemmas to cope with, are given. Up to now only small scale restoration projects have been executed, while large scale projects generally are not further then the thinking or planning phase. A special type of 'restoration projects' are the large civil engineering works, particularly in the south-west of the Netherlands. Although these works were not planned and executed as restoration projects, but designed for safety against flooding from the sea, they have led to significant changes in the boundary conditions of the systems concerned. For restoration projects yet to be executed one can learn very much from these developments, particularly regarding the sensitivity of coastal systems for changes in boundary conditions and about the (im)possibilities to 'steer' ecological developments. Physical, chemical and biological processes form the basis of restoration measures of coastal habitats, and this means that a thorough knowledge of these processes is essential. Coastal ecosystems are the result of complex interactions of large-scale and small-scale processes, implying a holistic approach in scientific investigations. Consequently, restoration of these systems primarily has to be realised by influencing the basic processes. This is the only way to preserve or regain in a sustainable way ecological values, such as species composition. Focusing only at one particular species (e. g. breeding terns) or a specific habitat (e.g. a salt marsh) may easily ignore the underlying processes. In general, coastal restoration should focus on the redirection of processes towards a desired status by stimulating certain process parameters. Monitoring of the results and, if necessary, gradual readjustment of the governing factors, is an essential part of this approach.

DE over-abstraction; arid conditions; Afghanistan; groundwater management;

AB A 'first pass' groundwater management policy has been developed for use by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Afghanistan, designed to prevent derogation of existing traditional water sources, aquifer over-abstraction and chemical deterioration of soil and groundwater quality. Key elements include (1) continuing promotion of groundwater as a drinking water source, (2) a presumption against use of motorised pumps to abstract groundwater for irrigation unless other options (surface water, qanats) are not available, (3) the use of groundwater for irrigation as a temporary alternative to surface water (i.e. a strategy for drought survival) rather than as a long-term development policy, (4) limiting groundwater abstraction to a long-term average of 11 s(-1) km(-2), (5) siting irrigation wells at least 500 in from other groundwater sources and (6) analysing irrigation groundwater for electrical conductivity, sodium absorption ratio, boron and residual sodium carbonate alkalinity. Analyses of these parameters indicate that groundwater from some areas is of dubious suitability for irrigation. In some villages and towns, groundwater contains elevated nitrate and faecal bacteria concentrations, probably derived from latrines, sewage or animal wastes.

AB Over the past thirty years catches of skates have increased in the western Atlantic as a result of targeted fisheries and as by-catch. Presently, sustainable harvest levels for skates in the western Atlantic are unknown. Available life history information was used to model three western Atlantic skate species, little skate Leucoraja erinacea, winter skate Leucoraja ocellata, and barndooor skate Dipturus laevis, to determine their population growth rate and susceptibility to population decline under exploitation. Population characteristics were estimated using age-based matrix analyses for little and winter skate and a stage-based matrix approach for barndoor skate. The intrinsic rate of population increase (r) for little, winter and barndoor skates were 0.21, 0.13 and 0.20, respectively. Fishing mortality resulting in equilibrium conditions, where the intrinsic rate of increase is zero, were 0.35 for little skate, 0.16 for winter skate and 0.20 for barndoor skate. Elasticity analyses indicated that juvenile survival contributed most to Population growth in little skate and winter skate, and adult survival contributed the most in barndoor skate. Thus. conservation measures should focus on juvenile and adult stages of these species. fit the absence of fishing mortality, elasticity of fecundity was low for all species, however: at high exploitation levels the contribution of fecundity to Population growth rate increased. Stochastic analyses were performed by varying first year mortality (egg stage to the completion of one year of life), and model parameters for each species to generate estimates of the distributions of biological reference points. Our Study supports the finding that long-lived. slower growing, late maturing species are highly Vulnerable to exploitation. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

TI Use and conservation of medicinal plants and animals in Pernambuco State
   (northeast Brasil): A case study
SO INTERCIENCIA
LA Portuguese
DT Article
ID FOLK MEDICINE; MEXICO; BRAZIL; MARKET
AB A survey of the use and knowledge of medicinal plants and animals was carried out at a fair in Caruaru, a dry, area in the northeast of Pernambuco state, Brazil. We aimed to verify the relative importance of plants and animals, the categories of diseases or physiological systems to which they have been indicated as well as to record the intracultural variation of knowledge on these resources. From this onwards, it was intended to infer the impact of plant and animal extrativism on the conservation and sustainable use. The most important species of plants as to the relative importance were Sideroxylon obtusifolium (Roem. e Schult.) TD. Penn.; Hymenaea sp.; Myracrodruon urundeuva (Engl.) Fr. All.; Stryphnodendron sp. Among the animals, we can highlight Melipona scutellaris; Crotalus sp.; Carcharhinus leucas; Caiman cf. latirostris; Epicrates ceuchria xerophilus and Phrynops sp, The informants were in agreement with the utilization of plant species to disruptions on the sensorial (audition), nervous, respiratory and genital urinary systems as well as sexual inability. Amongst the animals. informants referred them to disruptions on the digestive and respiratory systems, and osteomuscular and connective tissue diseases. There was no considerable variation in the knowledge of the informants, suggesting that the cultural system in the fair is founded upon the sharing of knowledge. Under a conservationists' viewpoint, the most important vegetal species are those more vulnerable due to the means of use and extraction of products from them. Amongst the animals used for medicinal purposes, there are species found in the list of animals threatened with extinction.

ID DENTAL-HEALTH; CARIES; PREVALENCE; TRENDS
AB A study in West Java has indicated that involvement of primary health care personnel and schoolteachers in oral health education (OHE) at primary schools is a feasible approach that is sustainable. Aim: The present study aims to assess the effects of that school-based OHE programme on pupils who had completed the programme one and a half years ago. Methods: Eight experimental and six control primary schools in the same area participated in the study. Out of each school 10 children, aged 8-12-years old, were randomly selected. Results: ANOVA with age and gender as co-variables showed statistically significantly lower (21%) habitual plaque scores among children from experimental schools as compared to those from control schools. Tooth brushing effectiveness had significantly improved among experimental children and they took longer for tooth brushing when supervised. The dmft/dmfs values were comparable but the DMFT/DMFS values of children from experimental schools tended to be lower (not statistically significant) than of those from control schools. Differences in oral health knowledge were apparent but self-reported habits pertaining to oral health were comparable between children from experimental and control schools. Conclusion: This school-based OHE programme had a moderate positive effect on oral health knowledge and on habitual plaque levels and on the effectiveness of tooth brushing. The effects on caries levels and on self-reported behaviour were inconclusive.

TI Assessing the benefits of ethical trade schemes for forest dependent
   people: comparative experience from Peru and Ecuador
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
DE impact assessment; ethical trade; fair trade; forestry; livelihoods
AB In this paper we consider the social impact of ethical trade schemes, particularly the kinds of benefits ethical trade provides for smallholder farmers and their livelihoods and for sustainable forestry. We focus oil two cases, which are linked to the fair trade movement: brazil nuts collected from forests in Peru and cocoa grown under agroforestry conditions in Ecuador. The impact assessment approach used in these studies is explained and the findings outlined. The evidence that benefits accrue to smallholders and collectors of forest products is mixed. In Ecuador, we found that the benefits accruing to small producers of the cocoa scheme included cash payments, more transparent weighing and grading systems, better returns on crops due to the vertical integration of the ethical trading chain, and capacity building benefits (e.g. organisational development, cultivation techniques and marketing). In Peru. brazil nut collectors participating in the ethical trade scheme did not perceive major differences between the ethical scheme and the conventional trading chain. However, there are also positive aspects of the brazil nut ethical scheme, such Lis the use of electronic weighing scales which increases transparency and advocacy efforts relating to improving the quality of the brazil nuts exported and thus helping to maintain access to international markets. Most of the brazil nuts and cocoa are now sold on conventional markets, although the fair trade markets helped both schemes to become established on international markets. Non-monetary benefits, obtained through capacity building, are often underrated but are important to producers, particularly in the ethical cocoa scheme.

AB Toxicity of an acaricide, bifenazate, and an aphicide, pymetrozine, to the phytoseiid mites, Galendromus occidentalis Nesbitt, Neoseiulus fallacis Garman and Amblyseius andersoni (Chant), and the coccinellid spider mite predators, Stethorus punctum picipes Casey and Harmonia axyridis Pallas, was examined in laboratory bioassays. The impact of applications of these pesticides on phytoseiids and a guild of spider mite/aphid predators in commercial hop yards in Washington was also evaluated. In bioassays, bifenazate at the full field rate was moderately toxic to the phytoseiids and coccinellids (37-81% mortality) but less toxic at half and quarter rates (0-44% and 0-11%, respectively). Pymetrozine was non-toxic to all predators at all rates. Phytoseiid (G. occidentalis/N. fallacis) populations and a guild of non-phytoseiid spider mite/aphid predators in hop yards appeared unaffected by single applications of half or three-quarter rates of bifenazate and the full rate of pymetrozine. Bifenazate and pymetrozine show great potential as selective pesticides that can be used in a sustainable hop arthropod management program based on recruitment and conservation of endemic natural enemies.

AB In many African countries where both Government resources and donor aid for the control of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis are declining, there is an increasing need to identify areas where intervention is most likely to be technically, economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. Activities then can be focused so that the maximum benefits are obtained from limited resources. We describe a decision-support framework based on a geographical information system to identify areas of high priority for the control of tsetse and trypanosomiasis in the common fly belt of eastern Zambia. Digital coverages were generated for six environmental variables: ( 1) cattle density, ( 2) human density, ( 3) land designation, ( 4) relative arable potential, ( 5) crop-use intensity and ( 6) proximity to existing control operations. The distribution of tsetse in the area was predicted using a multivariate (maximum likelihood) analysis of areas of known presence and absence and a series of environmental data. Experienced Zambian veterinarians and biologists working in the region established criteria weights for the input variables and the data were integrated in a geographical information system (GIS), using weighted linear combinations to prioritize areas for trypanosomiasis control. The results of this exercise and estimates of the errors involved are discussed.

AB We investigate the interplay between firms' decisions in product development, either joint or independent, and their ensuing repeated pricing, either collusive or Bertrand-Nash. A joint venture develops a single product, whereas independent ventures develop their respective products which can be differentiated. We prove that joint product development and the resulting lack of horizontal product differentiation may destabilise collusion, whilst firms' R&D decisions have no bearings on collusive sustainability if differentiation is vertical. We also discover the non-monotone dependence of firms' venture decisions at the development stage upon their time preferences, as well as upon consumers' willingness to pay.

AB By 1997 about 90 million heat pumps have been installed worldwide, only less than 5% are located in Europe, historically the cradle of this "thermodynamic heating and cooling process". The majority of the approximately 4 million installed heat pumps are imported reversible air-to-air systems in southern Europe and only 30% represent the typical European-made heating only electric driven compression systems for space and water heating in buildings in central and northern Europe. The first and second oil crises has been the main cause for a first European heat pump "boom" at the end of the seventies. Consequently the following drop in energy prices negatively influenced the market in some countries. The new renaissance in Europe in the middle of the nineties was initiated by the understanding of sustainable development for a more efficient energy use and the related protection of the environment.

ID ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; WATER-QUALITY; PROGRAM;

AB Criterion 7 - legal, institutional and economic framework for rangeland conservation and sustainable management - contains 19 of the 67 indicators incorporating the Montreal Process. These indicators are aggregated into five sub-criteria; those dealing with the legal, institutional, and economic frameworks for supporting the sustainable management of rangelands, and sub-criteria concerning the capacity to monitor and conduct and apply research. Capacity for sustainability can be tied to property rights (Indicator 48), land-use policy (Indicators 49, 50), and use of best management practices (Indicator 51). Public participation in planning is an effective measure of sustainable management, but with public interaction in planning, science is no longer seen as being value-free (Indicators 52, 53, 54). Concerns exist that the numbers of trained rangeland managers and scientists, along with those in related disciplines, are inadequate to meet existing and future needs (Indicator 55). Enforcement capabilities, an institutional measure, rely upon the legal framework to be effective (Indicator 57). Access to capital can be important to graziers if they are to retain flexibility to manage sustainably (Indicator 58). Monitoring and reporting programmes are difficult and expensive, yet they remain critical for assessing sustainable management (Indicators 60, 61, 62). Education, research and outreach are equally meaningful as indicators of sustainability for forests and rangelands (Indicators 63, 64).

AB Biological monitoring is surveillance undertaken to ensure that previously established quality control conditions are being met. Surveillance is a systematic and orderly gathering of data, preferably using standard methods and procedures so that comparison between bioregions globally is facilitated. Biological monitoring should be closely linked and integrated with chemical/physical monitoring, otherwise the cause of biological deviation from the norm may not be reliably associated with chemical/physical deviations from the norm. Since biota may differ dramatically from one ecoregion to another, a universal biological monitoring system should use species with a cosmopolitan distribution so that multi-regional comparisons can be made, large-scale stress patterns will emerge, and biotic impoverishment of an indigenous biota can be confirmed using the biotic impoverishment of organisms with a cosmopolitan or, at least, a very wide distribution. When intimately associated with chemical/physical monitoring, the causes can be more readily identified. Finally, organisms with a cosmopolitan distribution tend to be relatively small and have better recolonization rates following disturbance than organisms with more limited distribution and can be assessed in large numbers because of their small size. These attributes enhance statistical validity and the assessment of structural and functional changes. Functional changes are particularly important in the determination of ecosystem services, which, in turn, are becoming increasingly linked with sustainable use of the planet. This method is in no way intended to denigrate biological monitoring of larger organisms or ones with more limited distributions, but rather to show how the linkage between the two will provide more persuasive evidence of change, should it occur. Additionally, because of short life cycles and the larger numbers that can be monitored, smaller organisms provide early warning systems that might prevent harm to the larger organisms with more restricted distribution. There is no robust evidence on what level of biodiversity is essential for sustainable use of the planet. Furthermore, not all the species on the planet have been given taxonomic names; for the many that have been named, their life cycles and habitat requirements are poorly understood. Worse yet, there are too few adequately qualified professionals to carry out these tasks even if human society deemed them important. As a consequence, the monitoring effort should initially concentrate at the systems level (landscapes, ecoregions, habitat) with the hope that a healthy ecosystem will retain most of its component species. Monitoring at the species level should accompany systems level monitoring to see if the assumption is correct. I seek acquaintance with nature - to know her moods and manners. Primitive nature is the most interesting to me. I take infinite pains to know all the phenomena of spring, for instance, thinking that I have here the entire poem, and then, to my chagrin, I learn that it is but an imperfect copy that I possess and have read, that my ancestors have torn out many of the first leaves and grandest passages, and mutilated it in many places. I should not like to think that some demigod had come before me and picked out some of the best of the stars. I wish to know an entire heaven and an entire Earth.

AB An inventory of medicinal plants used by the juang and Munda tribes of the Keonjhar district of eastern India resulted in identification of 215 plants, belonging to 150 genera and 82 families. The preparation, utilisation and the juang name for the plants are documented. This reveals a wealth of traditional knowledge of herbal care in one primitive and another widely distributed tribe of eastern India. Three new records of plants having therapeutic value are identified and 29 plants having a new use were found. The dependence of tribes on forests was most evident in the study region, as species of mushrooms, wild berries, tubers, and flowers constituted the tribe's diet. Cooking oil demand of households was entirely met from the forest oilseeds, while the flora of the region provided medicine for most, if not all, common ailments. Understanding of ethnobiology of the region in the changing dynamics of a people-forest relationship in the region is important for planning sustainable forest management.

AB In higher education, the term sustainability is often used to describe a positive movement to becoming more socially and environmentally responsible. The road to sustainability is not even. To pursue the path in a meaningful way, there are various elements that need to be considered and a number of matters to be taken care of, from proper planning, to appropriate methods for monitoring progress and measuring success. While maintaining the status quo is usually quite simple for universities, becoming more socially and environmentally responsible is not easy, given the current framework and mandate of the modern university. In this paper, we explore the challenges and barriers universities face when navigating the path to sustainability, and offer example cases from European and Canadian perspectives. It is our hope that this approach will be useful for readers in order to better understand and identify the challenges and issues universities currently encounter in pursuing sustainability.

AB The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of water, land and biotic resources in the inland river basins is important in the arid zone. Analysis of the exploitation potential of water resources and the environmental changes through water development can help people in the sustainable development and management of water resources within the basin. Water resources development has affected the scale of oasis establishment in the middle reaches and the existence of lower-reach oases in the Hei River basin. Exploitation and utilization of water resources at the present stage should bring about a harmonic relation between economic development and the ecological environment in the whole basin. The whole area should be considered as an entirety to adopt feasible engineering and administrative measures such as strengthening the protection of water resources in upper streams, macro-control of water consumption and implementing water-saving measures in middle and lower reaches, quantitatively managing and allotting water resources in accordance with regional conditions and adherence to comprehensive rehabilitation. Thus, economic, environmental and social benefits of water resources can be enhanced.

TI Infrastructure development: a public-private partnership in India
SO INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Infrastructure policy is of the utmost significance for economic improvement, and should be given full attention, especially in developing countries. One of the main problems is the lack of funds required to put infrastructure programmes into practice. This problem should be solved by providing high quality infrastructure, which results in large investments. In the case of India, different investment models (voluntary, coalition, and partnership) have been put into practice to deal with funding problems. The Sustainable Cities Programme (SCP) supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is an example of one of the best models of public-private partnership in infrastructure development. Applied in the city of Chennai in India, it required the involvement of both the public and private sectors, as well as community organisations, in order to achieve successful results. Circumstances in India appear favourable for the government to carry out a determined policy of infrastructure investment.

   estimates
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTOREGRESSION; CYCLES; SPAIN
AB Using alternative time-series methods, this paper investigates the patterns of transnational terrorist incidents that involve one or more deaths. Initially, an updated analysis of these fatal events for 1970-1999 is presented rising a standard linear model with prespecified interventions that represent significant policy and political impacts. Next, a (regime-switching) threshold autoregressive (TAR) model is applied to this fatality time series. TAR estimates indicate that increases above the mean are not sustainable during high-activity eras, but are sustainable during low-activity eras. The TAR model provides a better fit than previously tried methods for the fatality time series. By applying a Fourier approximation to the nonlinear estimates, we get improved results. The findings in this study and those in our earlier studies are then applied to suggest sonic policy implications in light of the tragic attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.

TI Full cost or "sustainability cost" pricing in irrigated agriculture.
   Charging for water can be effective, but is it sufficient?
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
LA English
DT Article
DE water management; irrigation; water value; full cost; pricing; quota
AB In France, the water management issue is no longer a matter of developing stakeholder participation or transferring state competence to user associations. But, as for other countries with a significant irrigated agriculture, two socio-economic questions need to be answered: (i) How to ensure the sustainability of investments by raising the price of water without discouraging economic development? (ii) How to share water between users when resources are scarce?
   Answering these questions brings up the two basic principles of good water management for sustainable development: as it consumes more than 70% of the available water of low flow periods, irrigated agriculture must respect the other uses by limiting its demand to the allocated volume; as it involves large and long-term public investments, irrigated agriculture must at least bear the "sustainability cost" of the irrigation schemes including the upstream water resources. Such a general answer is of course largely case-specific and should be adjusted to each institutional framework. In France today, the Societes d'Amenagement Regional (SARs) are currently applying these principles. This paper will address both socio-economic questions stated above, with a specific discussion on the case of a water-stressed basin in the south west of France where a specific step-pricing and quota system has been set up in order to regulate the demand. It is argued that "full cost pricing of water services", as recommended in the World Water Vision (The Hague 2000), is not practical in the short term and, if pursued, could lead to very undesirable results. As a conclusion, two recommendations are proposed with a view to developing best practices in charging for water. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE

DE Aral Sea; river basin planning; water resources management
ID SEA
AB The Aral Sea environmental crisis has been created by poor water management in the river basins of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya. Nearly all the flow is abstracted for ailing irrigation schemes in the upper and middle basins, for massive river basin transfer schemes, or is lost to evaporation and seepage from reservoirs and canals. The only solution to the crisis in the lower deltas is to allow more water to flow to them. The paper argues that the only practical approach for achieving this in the short to medium term is better water management in the upper and middle river basins, and that a more rational basis for allocating water to meet the needs of all users is urgently required. The paper describes a real-time water resources management model for the Syr Darya river that has been designed for sustainable planning and management of the water resources to meet the needs of all riparian users. The power and limitations of such models in relation to effective management of the water resources of the Aral Basin are discussed. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS
LA English
DT Article
ID AUSTRALIAN BEEF-CATTLE; GROWTH TRAITS
AB A 300 cow Brahman herd kept on improved pasture was subjected to a selection and management programme based on a limited breeding season. Artificial insemination using mainly progeny tested bulls was used in part of the herd and the rest were bred in single sire herds. Of the 200 sires used during the 30 year period, 82% were homebred and selected principally for high estimated breeding value of 18-month weight. Variance components of birth (BW), weaning (205 W) and 18-month (548 W) weights of 6130 calves born 1968 through to 1997 were estimated by the Restricted Maximum Likelihood method (REML) using uni- and bivariate animal models. For each weight the animal's direct and maternal genetic and the dam's permanent environmental effects were considered random and those of sex, year and month of birth and age of cow were considered fixed, but the models differed as far as the number of significant interactions included. Adjusted least squares means for BW, 205 W and 548 W were 28, 158 and 292 kg. Phenotypic and direct and maternal genetic trends from univariate analysis were for BW: 0.156, 0.061 and -0.001 kg; for 205 W: 0.471, 0.126 and 0.044 kg; for 548 W: 1.973, 0.486 and 0.251 kg per year. Direct and maternal heritabilities from univariate analyses were for BW, 205 W and 548 W, 0.33 and 0.08; 0.07 and 0.14; 0.13 and 0.08, respectively. Genetic direct-maternal correlations for the three weights were -0.37, -0.13 and 0.49 and permanent environmental variance of the dam as proportion of phenotypic variance (c(2) ) had values of 0.03, 0.16 and 0.01, respectively. Direct and maternal genetic correlations were for BW: 205 W, 0.64 and 0.74; for BW: 548 W, 0.35 and 0.74; and for 205 W: 548 W, 0.64 and 0.96. Future genetic work in the herd should put more emphasis on the improvement of cow efficiency for sustainable beef production on native and improved pasture.

AB Pregnant gilts (n = 126) were assigned randomly to 12 0.4-ha old world-spar bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum) pastures in an outdoor swine (Sus scrofa) production system to examine effects of stocking rates (17.5 or 35 gilts/ha; 7 or 14 gilts per pasture) and dietary N on percentage of ground cover, soil nitrate (NO3-) concentration, and reproductive performance. Treatments were arranged factorially with two stocking rates and two diets equivalent in dietary lysine but different in CP (control = 14.7% CP vs experimental = 12.6% CP) with three pastures per treatment. The experiment was repeated during a second parity with the same animals on the same treatments. Each triangular gestation pasture was subdivided into three regions: 1) near the point or radial center; 2) the middle region that contained a hut and a wallow area; and 3) the outer section where gilts were fed each day. Soil samples (15 cm deep) were taken at the beginning and end of the 306-d study, and soil nitrate-N concentrations were determined. Percentage of ground cover was visually estimated initially and every 30 d thereafter through d 306. Before farrowing, gilts were moved to identical pastures for farrowing and were fed a common 16% CP sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)-based lactation diet beginning at the time of movement to the farrowing pasture. Pregnant gilts were weighed at the time of assignment to treatments in the gestation pastures, when they were moved to farrowing pastures, and at weaning. Production data included total number of pigs born per sow, number of pigs born alive or dead, average birth weight, number of pigs weaned, average weaning weight, and mortality. No differences (P > 0.05) were observed between treatments in soil NO3- concentrations. Percentage of ground cover was decreased (P < 0.01) by the higher stocking rate when grazing was initiated in March/April but recovered rapidly after removal of pigs. More (P < 0.01) pigs were weaned per sow (8.4 vs 7.1 +/- 0.34) from higher gestation-stocking rate groups. Pig mortality in farrowing was greater (P < 0.05) for lower gestation-stocking rates (25.7% vs. 18.1 +/- 1.9%). A stocking rate of 35 sows/ha might have increased production potential but was associated with a rapid loss of ground cover during spring.

AB 1. Intercropping, the practice of growing two or more crops in close association, is attracting increasing interest in developed countries, primarily due to claims that it can provide increased yields in an environmentally sustainable manner.
   2. The land equivalent ratio (LER) is frequently used to attest the claim that intercropping produces a greater total biological productivity per unit area of land than monocropping. However, similar to other indices, the value of the LER is dependent on the relative densities of the two crops and fails to provide an indication of the optimal crop density combination required to produce maximum biological productivity. We used an alternative methodology to predict the optimum density for planting two crops in a mixed stand.
   3. Maize and beans were grown both in monoculture and in intercropped stands at a range of densities. Monocrop stands of both maize and bean displayed an asymptotic yield-density relationship. When a second crop was introduced into the stand there was no effect on the yield of maize, but there was a large reduction in the yield of bean.
   4. The LER did not demonstrate an unequivocal advantage to intercropping. Less than a third of the LER values, over the range of densities considered, were greater than one, although none was significantly different to unity. The highest values were obtained from those plots sown with a high density of maize.
   5. An alternative method of analysing the biological productivity of an intercrop System is proposed. This approach requires a combination of (i) an additive experimental design, (ii) the use of a regression model to measure the competitive effect of two species, and (iii) the presentation of the net competitive effect on individual and total yields using a response surface. The reciprocal model was used to dissociate and quantify intra- and interspecific competition, estimate a competitive equivalence coefficient and predict the individual yields of the full complement of density combinations included in the maize and bean experiment.
   6. The model explained up to 90% of the variation in the observed yields of maize and bean in an intercrop. An inspection of the response surface for the LER indicated that the minimum density combination required to produce the maximum yield advantage within the density range considered comprised maize being planted at a density of 11 plants m(-2) and bean being planted at a density of 39 plants m(-2). Although this combination would provide the maximum biological productivity, it is considered unlikely to provide the maximum gross economic margin.
   7. The above methodology may provide a useful tool for managing competition, either between two or more crops in an intercrop, or within a crop-weed interaction.

AB Background Aggressive behaviour has been identified as a significant problem amongst people with intellectual disabilities living in institutional settings. Anger is a key activator of aggressive behaviour, as well as being an important element of clinical distress related to adverse life experiences. There is some evidence for the value of cognitive-behavioural treatments for anger problems with people having intellectual disabilities. No controlled studies of anger treatment involving intellectually disabled offenders living in secure settings have been conducted to date. A pilot study of an elaborated anger treatment protocol for this client population was undertaken, comparing the specialised anger treatment with routine care.
   Methods Detained men with intellectual disabilities and histories of offending were allocated to specially modified cognitive-behavioural anger treatment (n = 9) or to routine care waiting-list control (n = 10) conditions. Eighteen sessions of individual treatment were delivered over a period of 12 weeks. Treatment outcome was evaluated by participants' self-report of anger intensity to an inventory of provocations and by staff-ratings of the anger attributes of participants' ward behaviour.
   Results Participants' reported anger intensity was significantly lower following the anger treatment, compared to the routine care wait-list condition. There were largely no treatment condition effects in staff-rated anger. Limited evidence for the effectiveness of anger treatment was provided by the staff ratings of participant behaviour post-treatment.
   Conclusions Detained offenders with intellectual disabilities can benefit from intensive individual cognitive-behavioural anger treatment. Further research is required to examine the mechanisms for change and their sustainability.

DE community education; biological diversity; biological resources;
   sustainable utilisation
AB This paper looks at the outcomes of a community education programme on biological diversity conservation for sustainable development, held in March 1998 in the Shiselweni Region of Swaziland. It highlights some of the community's observations and concerns in the Shiselweni Region, among which was recognition that a large extent of biological resources are being lost in the region.
   The conservation of biological diversity is an important parameter in maintaining sustainable development. A major problem is that community level activities that have a negative effect on biodiversity are often undertaken without due regard to the possible effects. It was observed that self-regulation by communities could be achieved through an education process. Biological diversity conservation is dependent on the level of information and awareness among the communities in any country and Swaziland is no exception.

AB Even mild iodine deficiency during early childhood and pregnancy has the potential to impair neurological development. Often considered a problem of developing nations, a number of industrialized countries are at risk of deficiency. Despite past success with intentional and unintentional iodine fortification, recurrence of deficiency is an ever-present risk. Tasmania, an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia, has a history of endemic iodine deficiency, which was successfully eliminated by iodine prophylaxis initiated in 1950. In this report we describe a formal assessment of iodine nutrition in the Tasmanian population, 50 yr after initiation of the prophylaxis program. The requirements and obstacles to achieving sustainable iodine prophylaxis in an otherwise affluent community are considered. A cross-sectional study was undertaken during the yr 2000. Urinary iodine excretion (UIE) and thyroid ultrasonography were assessed in a representative statewide sample of school-age children. Children (n = 225) aged 4 to 17 yr from throughout Tasmania were studied. The sample comprised 99 girls and 126 boys. The median UIE was 84 mug/liter (87 mug/liter for males and 81 mug/liter for females), with UIE 50 mug/liter or less in 20%. Based on age-specific World Health Organization/International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders normative data for thyroid volume, the prevalence of elevated thyroid volume was 5.3% for boys and 3.5% for girls. However, after correcting the World Health Organization/International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders reference data, the prevalence increased to 24.6% for boys and 20.7% for girls. No significant difference in the thyroid volumes was found between males and females in this study. These data confirm the recurrence of mild iodine deficiency in Tasmania. The failure of sustained iodine prophylaxis highlights the universal importance of persistent surveillance, use of sustainable measures, public awareness, and a specific legislative framework for managing ongoing iodine prophylaxis. Our findings also emphasize the importance of accurate reference data for assessment thyroid volume.

AB Migration is a common and essential livelihood strategy in the risk-prone environment of Sahelian West Africa. But migration is not a passive reaction to economic and environmental forces. Patterns of movement are determined by context-specific and complex dynamics, mediated by social networks, gender relations and household structures. IDS-based research on sustainable livelihoods illustrated this in two locations in Mali: in a village in the Sahelian dryland with different and gendered migration patterns of various ethnic groups; and exceptional patterns in the Sudano-Sahelian cotton region with extensive and long-lasting engagement in small cocoa and coffee plantations in C (o) over cap te d'Ivoire.

AB Evidence from two communities suggests diverging paths of economic development; one which integrates culture into economic activities, and a second path which does not. If endogeneity cannot be assumed, does the relevance of culture for economic activities influence its stability and sustainability? Despite the predominance of culture in the former community, the social norms, ethnic cues and symbols are neither more likely to thrive or survive. Against expectations, the latter group appears more successful in preserving culture through a strategy of separating social identity from economic activities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This essay considers the underpinnings of the large U.S. current account deficit. It then tackles the question of whether the U.S. current account deficit is sustainable. A current account deficit is "sustainable" at a point in time if neither it, nor the associated foreign capital inflows, nor the negative net international investment position are large enough to induce significant changes in economic variables, such as consumption or investment or interest rates or exchange rates. Even if the current account deficit is sustainable by this definition today, its trajectory could still be creating future risks for the U.S. and global economy.

LA English
DT Article
DE small scale mining; environmental impact; management; environmental
   policy
ID GOLD; ECOSYSTEMS
AB This paper considers technical measures and policy initiatives needed to improve environmental management in the Portovelo-Zaruma mining district of southern Ecuador. In this area, gold is mined by a large number of small-scale and artisanal operators, and discharges of cyanide and metal-laden tailings have had a severe impact on the shared Ecuadorian-Peruvian Puyango river system. It is shown to be technically possible to confine mining waste and tailings at a reasonable cost. However, the complex topography of the mining district forces tailings management to be communal, where all operators are connected to one central tailings impoundment. This, in turn, implies two things: (i) that a large number of operators must agree to pool resources to bring such a facility into reality, and (ii) that miners must move away from rudimentary operations that survive on a day-to-day basis, towards bigger, mechanised and longer-term sustainable operations that are based on proven ore reserves. It is deemed unlikely that existing environmental regulations and the provision of technical solutions will be sufficient to resolve the environmental problems. Important impediments relate to the limited financial resources available to each individual miner and the problems of pooling these resources, and to the fact that the main impacts of pollution are suffered downstream of the mining district and, hence, do not affect the miners themselves. Three policy measures are therefore suggested. First, the enforcement of existing regulations must be improved, and this may be achieved by the strengthening of the central authority charged with supervision and control of mining activities. Second, local government involvement and local public participation in environmental management needs to be promoted. Third, a clear policy should be defined which promotes the reorganisation of small operations into larger units that are strong enough to sustain rational exploration and environmental obligations. The case study suggests that mining policy in lesser-developed countries should develop to enable small-scale and artisanal miners to form entities that are of a sufficiently large scale to allow adequate and cost-effective environmental protection.

AB An industry-wide survey of the forest products industry was conducted to measure the development of environmental management systems (EMS) designed to implement sustainable forest management on industrial forestlands. The results indicated that larger capacity, publicly owned operations (i.e., paper or engineered forest products firms) that participated in a forest certification standard exhibited well-developed EMSs. Smaller capacity, privately owned operations, such as sawmills, had poorly or undeveloped EMSs. The study provides a valuable baseline by which to measure future EMS development in the forest products industry.

TI Logging restrictions in China - A turning point for forest
   sustainability
SO JOURNAL OF FORESTRY

AB During the past 50 years, China has experienced excessive exploitation of natural forests and countrywide development of forest plantations. Although forest coverage increased from 5.2 percent in 1950 to 16.5 percent in 1998, the natural forest has sharply declined in quantity and quality. China's logging restriction, the core of the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP), protects millions of hectares of forests from further clearing. This 13-year-old program helps China adjust the age structure of national forests and provides a new chance for restoring forest sustainability.

   Countryside biogeography; Fragmentation; Morphospecies; Neotropics
AB The future of biodiversity depends to a great extent on the conservation value of human-dominated and semi-natural habitats. In a mixed agricultural landscape in southern Costa Rica, we compared the richness and composition of terrestrial arthropod communities occurring in three habitat types along a gradient of increasing disturbance: in a large (227 ha) forest fragment, small (3.8-5.3 ha) forest fragments, and sun coffee (1 - 3 ha) plantations. Pitfall trap sampling revealed decreasing morphospecies richness with increasing disturbance. Moreover, the number of species unique to a habitat type was lower in the smaller forest fragments and the coffee sites. We found significant changes in community composition associated with habitat at the levels of order (all arthropods), family (beetles), and morphospecies (carabids, scarabs, and ants). We identified no significant correlation of richness among the taxonomic orders, meaning these taxa are unable to serve as biodiversity indicators (for each other or for all arthropods) in the study region. Arthropod diversity presently found in countryside habitats is certainly lower, and perhaps less sustainable, than that of the extensive forested habitats fragmented > 40 years ago. It nonetheless remains substantial, suggesting a conservation opportunity in human-dominated landscapes of the tropics.

AB The papers presented in this volume represent only a small part of the results obtained within the scope of the first integrated programme concerning the Mediterranean Sea. The latter is considered as a downscaled model of the ocean system, and a regional sea for the targeted projects supported by the European Commission. Whatever the domain is, the variability of the system appeared as a major feature. Consequently, this theme has been selected, among the main initial objectives, as the central subject of this volume. Spatial and temporal variabilities are considered, at different scales and at different (water, particles, sediment, trophic) levels of the marine ecosystem. In the hereafter contributions, one will find the long-term (millenar, secular and interannual), seasonal and short-term variability, the mesoscale and large-scale processes and models, including coupled ecosystem models. These results have to be considered as a significant contribution to a better understanding of the ocean as well as a base for a sustainable management of the marine systems. In effect, knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms and their variability are essential to create an efficient management of the environment. As far as the forcing functions are considered, two main factors control the variability of the Mediterranean marine system: the climate-meteorology and, directly or indirectly, the anthropogenic activity, through the use of surface waters, soils, and air. These factors have an impact on the quality (biogeochemistry) of the environment and on the dynamics, thus influencing the biological level of the system. As a result, the spatial distribution of the main wind trajectories, of runoff and rivers or straits, have a paramount influence on the observed characteristics of the various sub-basins and their gradients (north-south and west-east) over the entire basin.

AB Phosphorus (P) forms were sequentially extracted from peat derived soils (Eutric Histosols and Gleysols) at eight sites in Saxony-Anhalt (Germany) to disclose general differences in P pools between mineral and organic soils and to investigate effects of peat humification and oxidation in conjunction with land use and soil management on the P status of soils. Overall 29 samples providing a wide variety of basic chemical properties were subjected to the Hedley fractionation. The Histosol topsoils contained more total P (P-t) (1345+/-666 mg kg(-1)) than the Gleysol topsoils (648+/-237 mg kg(-1)). The predominant extractable fractions were H2SO4-P (36-63% of P-t) in calcareous and NaOH-P-o (0-46% of P-t) in non-calcareous Histosols. These soils had large pools of residual P (13-93% of P-t). Larger contents and proportions of P-o and of labile P fractions generally distinguished organic from mineral soils. Regression analyses indicated that poorly crystalline pedogenic oxides and organic matter were binding partners for extractable and non-extractable P. Intensive management that promotes peat humification and oxidation results in disproportional enrichments of labile P fractions (resin-P, NaHCO3-P-i, and NaHCO3-P-o). These changes in P chemistry must be considered for a sustainable management of landscapes with Histosols and associated peat derived soils.

SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICINE

DT Article
DE urban health; health systems; evaluation; Tanzania
AB Background In the 1990s, as a response to rapid urbanization, there were a number of large, urban health initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa. Most tended to be comprehensive as opposed to selective in scope: they aimed at strengthening the health system as a whole, and placed emphasis on delivering improved services at the primary level, with increased community participation. A multi-dimensional approach is required to assess the achievements of such initiatives.
   Methods In 2000 an external evaluation of the Swiss-funded Dar es Salaam Urban Health Project, Tanzania, used 50 key informant interviews, 90 health facility exit interviews, 90 community resident interviews and document analysis to assess achievements over a 10 year period. The study considered achievements in terms of capacity building, improving quality of care, community involvement, inter-sectoral action and sustainability.
   Results Although the project achieved improvements in capacity building and in structural and technical quality of care, there were difficulties in generating inter-sectoral action and the concept of participation was limited. However, citylevel 'ownership' of the activities was high, and, with the advent of sector-wide allocation of funds (SWAPs) in the health sector in Tanzania, the prospects for sustainability of the achievements made in the project appear to be good.
   Conclusion Both the multi-dimensional method of the evaluation and the findings can inform future urban health initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa and in other resourceconstrained environments. The decentralization that occurred in Dar es Salaam and the general approach of the project provided a platform to test out various elements that are common to health sector reform across developing countries.

AB Crop biotechnology is being used in two major ways to enhance human nutrition: to improve global food security by making more food available, especially locally grown and familiar foods in the developing world, and by enhancing the nutritional composition of foods that would interest both the developed and developing worlds, Since the first commercialized products of biotechnology are major commodity crops grown primarily in the US, Canada and Argentina (soybeans, corn, canola and cotton), there is concern about whether and when crop biotechnology will help the developing world, There are, however, several on-going projects in Africa, SE Asia and Latin America where crop biotechnology is being used to enhance locally grown crops, The expectation is that genetically improved crops, e.g., those able to resist local pests, will allow even small-scale farmers to grow more crops using fewer inputs and in an environmentally sustainable manner. Furthermore, there are numerous on-going projects to enhance the nutritional or health value of foods via transgene technology. A few of these projects are described in this article.

AB Finding realistic housing solutions that are able to respond to the realities of poverty in the developing or newly industrialising, world are frequently distinct from those suited to the developed world due to levels of poverty and differing welfare regimes, This requires a different understanding of the concept of housing and shelter for developing and developed countries. Population increase and emerging habitation patterns in parts of Latin America have required that policy-makers review traditional 'top down' approaches to the way the homeless poor are treated and how self-help or 'bottom up' schemes are increasingly seen as a sustainable way forward in providing affordable housing options to both governments and communities.
   Over the last decades, mass in-migration to cities has put pressure on governments to provide public housing - but two major problems arose: firstly, governments found it difficult to finance the increasing demand for public housing, and secondly, the nature of employment and the informal economy in the developing world meant that this new housing was often too costly for the urban poor, in some cases increasing homelessness still further.
   Recent policy developments tend to favour supporting what the poor are and have been able to achieve for themselves, with appropriate government support. Upgrading shack settlements is now recognised as a community driven and cost-effective response that can, if appropriately supported, offer an initial and sustainable solution to urban housing need by tapping into additional non-governmental sources of funding In the absence of a major public sector housing stock to meet demand, governments are also recognising that self-help housing schemes for families able to access funding and resources offer a further innovative approach to meeting housing need.
   The nature of housing and shelter in the developing world requires a unique response so that it remains attainable and affordable to the poor, Neo-liberal policies, increasingly adopted in Latin America, are not able to provide suitable, sustainable and affordable housing delivery and alternatives need to be explored. This paper traces some developments in Latin American housing policy and explores some of the challenges that are faced in responding to the unique housing needs of the urban poor.

AB Loss of environmental services provided by forests is a non-linear process in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Intermediate-intensity land-use types in the form of complex agroforests have maintained global environmental benefits under a sustainable and profitable land use regime. Conversion to tree crop monocultures, however, poses a challenge to the environmental stakeholders and an opportunity from to stakeholders in the private economy. We quantified environmental indicators, as well as profitability and sustainability of a range of existing and possible production systems. Criteria and indicators were used at plot to landscape scales, taking into account local, national and global perspectives. Agronomic sustainability and profitability were assessed at plot level as they are of primarily local concern, while environmental services of forests, such as plant species and functional type richness, carbon stocks, greenhouse gas emissions, and trans-boundary haze, which are of national and global concern, were assessed at landscape level. Quantitative trade-offs and complementarities were analysed between global environmental benefits and local profitability. The current trend towards simplification of the complex agro-ecosystems and inherent loss of environmental services of forests is driven by profitability. The sequence in which environmental services of forests are lost is: standing carbon stocks, biodiversity, an low or negative greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Increasingly environmentally proactive firms are interested in finding ways to encourage employees to take environmental actions that will improve the environmental performance of company operations, products and services. Results of an employee survey show that both environmental policies and supportive supervisory behaviors can increase the probability that employees will try environmental initiatives. We describe environmental policies and supervisory behaviors that exist in firms that are committed to sustainable development and employee environmental initiatives. From the survey results, we draw some lessons for managers and organizations that would like to support employee participation in sustainable development activities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

ID HEALTH-SERVICES
AB Integration of leprosy control into the general health services is regarded as an important condition for increasing the accessibility and sustainability of leprosy services. However. it is often difficult to embark on such an integration process. In Jigawa State in Northern Nigeria, the leprosy elimination campaign was used as the initiator and catalyst for the integration process. In this article. this challenging process is described and analysed. Available information is used to identify the constraints that emerged and to assess the consequences of integration for important aspects of leprosy control. Such as case detection and case-holding and the accessibility and quality of the provided services. Some lessons from this experience are drawn that can be helpful for integration in other States or countries.

SO LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID MODERNIZATION
AB The contemporary emphasis on collaboration, partnership and participation that characterises ecological modernisation provides an interpretation of sustainable development in which economic growth and environmental protection are mutually compatible goals. At the same time the political modernisation of local government has undermined local democratic structures and replaced them with new forms of local and regional governance which are more centralised, less representative and less democratic. A key element of modernisation has been the emphasis on forms of strategic planning at local and regional levels, which have tended to privilege economic over environmental and other policy goals. In the process, sustainable development, despite its elevation as a fundamental policy objective, has tended to become marginalised. This analysis advocates a form of strategic planning that integrates policy sectors and spatial scales. Its realisation suggests the need for a reinvigoration of democratic processes and a commitment to greater equity,. Such a transformation is necessary if sustainable forms of development are to be realised.

AB Inflammation is a process culminated by cellular components and soluble mediators act in concert to evolve a sustainable process to impart distress in vascularized tissue. Among the contributors, extracellular nucleotides are prominent in PMN granule release (degranulation); chemotaxis, enhanced expression of adhesion molecule on the surface of PMN. However, co-stimulatory effectors such as chemokines are required for the extracellular nucleotide-induced maximal effect in inflammation. Enzymes, which degrade the extracellular nucleotide(s), could potentially attenuate or minimize the extracellular nucleotide(s) induced effect by degradation.

AB In finding a sustainable way forward for radioactive waste management it is necessary to consider whether to take action now to avoid future costs or to delay action in order to keep options open. Solutions must recognise that uncertainty increases over time and that human perception is limited to at most two generations. Formulation of policy must take account of different time frames and seek a consensus based on guiding principles. The policy process must be open, accessible and,fair and ways of achieving this are considered. In terms of time, policy-making for radioactive waste should be conceived as a continuing process in which proposals are monitored and reviewed linking present and future together.

AB Background: We present our results from the "B" trial (the 2nd U.S. FDA-approved clinical trial) with the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) or Lap-Band(R) System, regarding weight loss, complications, and effect on co-morbidities with up to 3-year follow-up.
   Methods: Between March 1999 and June 2001, 63 morbidly obese patients underwent LAGB following accepted ASBS/SAGES guidelines and protocol requirements. All bands were placed via the classic high peri-gastric dissection above the lesser sac, corresponding to the equator of the calibration-tube balloon. Frequent follow-up by a multidisciplinary program was maintained.
   Results: All procedures were performed laparoscopically with no conversion to laparotomy. Operative time decreased from a mean of 197 minutes for the first 10 patients to 120 minutes for the last group. Average hospital stay was 1.4 days. Perioperative complications included 1 intraoperative gastric perforation, which was closed and did not prevent band placement, and 5 port problems. Gastric slippage occurred in 9 patients (14.2%), 3 of whom were revised to a gastric bypass and 6 who had the band removed. Three additional bands were removed due to infection (1), band erosion (1) and a cluster of gastric symptoms (1). Percent excess weight loss averaged 27.2 at 6 months (range 1-68), 38.3 at 1 year (range 10-77), 46.6 at 2 years (range 1689), and 53.6 at 3 years (range 21-94). Before surgery, 46 of 63 patients (73%) suffered from a serious comorbidity. Following LAGB, all categories showed marked improvement.
   Conclusions: In this study up to 3 years, LAGB provided a safe and sustainable weight loss. Significant resolution of serious co-morbidities was common. A U.S. bariatric practice achieved results comparable to those in the international literature. The primary requisites to achieve optimal results include careful patient selection, the refined surgical technique, and a comprehensive long-term patient management program.

AB The object of this article is to explore whether ecological utopias are capable of providing a useful contribution to our quest for an ecologically responsible future and a sustainable society and, if so, in what specific ways. The author develops a model of ecological utopias as a distant point of orientation, or as a "navigational compass." In this model, ecotopias may influence the course of concrete decision making in the direction of a future sustain able society. After an analysis of the current social debate in western Europe on sustainable development, it is argued that ecological utopias can help us to "monitor" environmental problems and that they provide "inspiration" for a cleaner society. Ecotopias also allow us to imagine a "virtual reality" of a possible ecologically stable society and are a justifiable means of visionary imagery of a better future.

AB Education is essential for improving agriculture, both in productivity and environmental performance. Effective education must reach not just farmers, but also the public and policy makers so that the challenge of agricultural sustainability may be widely appreciated. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette has implemented a sweeping programme of educational improvements to transform a production demonstration farm into an agricultural learning landscape. Key features include instructional signs at overlooks; a discovery trail with activity stations and research bulletin boards; an 'environmentally responsive' home with energy-saving innovations; and a wildlife corridor, nature trail and outdoor classroom. The farm has attracted visitors of all ages and interests to learn about agriculture, stewardship and sustainability, whereby food is produced and economic benefit derived, but with no net degradation of earth resources.

AB This analysis presents the development of the Holstein dairy system in Brazil, evaluating system sustainability during a time of crisis, based on changes in system productivity, stability, resilience and equity. Sustainability indicators are used to describe these changes. Records of Holstein cows registered in the National Dairy Cattle Archive from 1980 to 1992 were analysed to include a crisis period around 1990. The Holstein dairy farming system showed high stability and resilience in terms of milk production, although a high sensitivity to disturbances was evident.

TI Potential of soy-cassava flour processing to sustain increasing cassava
   production in Nigeria

AB Cassava production is increasing in Nigeria and needs to be sustained. One way of achieving this is to process cassava into high-grade products with positive and high-value elasticity of demand. Soy-cassava flour, a blend of cassava and soy bean flours, was produced and tested for consumer acceptability and economic viability. The results showed that the soy-cassava flour, with 16% protein, compared favourably with gari and cassava flour as food material for the preparation of fufu (the popular local cassava food product). Its production was profitable, with a pre-tax profit of close to N5,000 (equivalent to US$62.5 at a rate of US$1 = N80) per tonne. There are clear prospects for large-scale production and marketing of soy-cassava flour in Nigeria. This would establish a large market for cassava roots, since it takes over 2.5 tonnes of cassava root to produce one tonne of soy-cassava flour. Widespread production of this cassava-based, high-grade product can therefore contribute significantly towards sustaining the increasing trend in cassava production in Nigeria.

AB In Northern Europe and Canada, the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer), seriously affects the marine phase of salmon production. Although the problem is long-standing, the development of sustainable methods of pest management has been unable to keep pace with the intensification of production, leading to large-scale reliance on very few chemotherapeutants. This runs the risk of selecting for genetically determined resistance in target organisms. There are many examples of similar evolutionary adaptations in arthropod pests of arable crops, livestock and human health. Several hundred pest species are now documented as being resistant to one or more chemical classes of insecticides and acaricides. Many of these compounds are identical or closely related to ones currently employed against salmon lice. It is, therefore, opportune to consider what lessons have been learnt from contending with resistance in terrestrial organisms, the implications for sustainable use of chemotherapeutants in aquaculture, and the potential for developing effective resistance management strategies. An EU-funded project named SEARCH (QLK2-CT-2000-00809) has been initiated to explore in more detail the diagnosis, incidence, dynamics and management of resistance to chemotherapeutants in L salmonis.

AB The resource management strategies of smallholder farmers in mixed crop-animal farming systems in a hillyland community in Batangas province In the Philippines were studied to document the farmers' socioeconomic, agroecological, psychosocial and sociocultural attributes and determine the different factors associated with the institutional arrangements on land, labor and technology management.
   Farmer-respondents continued to make use of their Indigenous practices related to mixed crop-animal fanning. There was extensive land use and intensive management of resources among farmers with different endowments and production resources. They followed different patterns of land and labor management and a uniform pattern of technology management. The patterns of Institutional arrangement on land management included cultivating one's own land, renting another's land, and cultivating another's land on a rent-free basis. The first pattern predominated. The predominant labor management type Involved the whole family doing the farm work. Technology was utilized mainly in the Individual households.
   Household size, tenure status and attitude toward social and technological Interventions were associated with the Institutional arrangement on land management. Size and type of cultivated land were associated with the Institutional arrangement on labor management. Significant associations were also noted between size of cultivated land and source of labor and the institutional arrangement on technology management.

AB Background. Optimal behavioral interventions for sustainable weight loss are uncertain. We therefore conducted a study among overweight/obese women comparing conventional dietary counseling of individuals (counseling-based intervention) to a novel, group-based skill-building intervention.
   Methods. Eighty subjects were randomly assigned to either the counseling-based or to the skill-building intervention. Outcomes included weight loss, dietitian hours per group and per unit weight loss, and dollars spent per group and per unit weight lost.
   Results. Weight loss at 6 months (follow-up rate 61.3%) in the counseling-based group was 8.8 lb (P=0.0001), and in the skill-building group was 3.8 lb (P=0.01). A total of 160 dietitian hours were required for the counseling-based group, and 131 for the skill-building group. The counseling-based group cost an average of $21 per pound lost, while the skill-building cost an average of $48 per pound lost (P=0.16).
   Conclusions. At 6 months, individualized office-based counseling produced more weight loss than a skill-building approach and cost less than half as much per pound of weight loss. Longer-term follow-up is required to determine if, as hypothesized, the skill-building intervention produces more sustainable weight loss.

TI DB32 and the design of good urban streets
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER
LA English
DT Article
DE roads & highways; traffic engineering; urban regeneration
AB Good streets play a vital role in making cities work well: they provide networks for circulation, spaces for human interaction, conduits for services and (less tangibly) they define urban character. However, street design has become dominated by the requirements of the motor car and statutory services, enforced by legislation and standards. The other functions, equally important, have been pushed aside, leading to a decline in street quality and the urban environment. The problems caused by the unimaginative following of DB32 were addressed by the DETR in 1998 in its publication Places, Streets and Movement which showed how streets could be designed for the full range of functions, in particular promoting walking and cycling. This approach to street design reflects the Government's wider sustainability agenda, but it is often incompatible with the car-dominated standards of DB32. Most streets still give priority to the motor car, mainly because it is easier and safer, both for developers and local authorities, simply to follow the Standards than to take an imaginative approach to streets. DB32 needs to be revised to end the contradictions and to bring it into line with the more recent guidance, allowing local distinctiveness and good design, and recognising the full range of a street's functions.

AB Manufacturing firms are exploring different ways to remain profitable in today's globally competitive market. Human resources have been acknowledged as an important factor in developing sustainable competitive advantage. With an increased emphasis on developing human resources, many firms are empowering their employees by implementing Quality Circles and Employee Involvement Teams. There is a need to identify factors that are critical to implementing employee empowerment programmes and how to overcome resistance. This case study reports the experience of a US subsidiary of a Japanese firm with the employee empowerment programme and the subsequent steps it took to address the above mentioned issues.

AB It has become fashionable to conceptualize recent shifts in agrarian priorities as a 'postproductivist' transition from a previously 'productivist' agriculture. This notion became more popular throughout the 1990s as a way to capture in one convenient package the complex changes experienced by both the agricultural sector specifically and within rural areas more generally. However, the widespread and uncritical use of such an all-encompassing term is rather surprising given debates elsewhere in human geography on the rejection of dualistic thinking. Yet, in agricultural and rural studies, the active creation and reinforcement of a productivist/post-productivist dualism has emerged as a means of explaining the uneven development of rural areas. This paper develops a critique of post-productivism to demonstrate its invalidity, presenting empirical evidence to refute five supposed characteristics relating to quality food, pluriactivity, sustainability, production dispersion and regulation. It is argued that future progress in agricultural research will only be made if post-productivism is abandoned. Effort should be refocused upon understanding deeper processes underpinning agricultural change using existing theoretical perspectives developed in human geography but which lack application in the agricultural context. Ecological modernization is provided as a brief exemplar of how such progress may be achieved.

AB Objective: To assess the 1999-2000 food security situation and the food relief programmes in Ethiopia, and evaluate the need for a national food and nutrition policy.
   Design: A systematic search of data sources from the Ethiopian Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC), the Ethiopian Central Statistical Authority, the World Food Programme (WFP) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the bibliographic database Medline and direct contacts with associations, institutions and people concerned with food security in Ethiopia.
   Setting: Consultations to WFP Ethiopia.
   Results: Food availability was severely restricted due to recurrent disasters such as drought, flood, war and a lack of diversity of food items. Food accessibility was limited due to a weak subsistence-agriculture-based economy, depletion of assets, absence of income diversity and a lack of alternative coping mechanisms. Food intake adequacy was rarely achieved due to food shortages, improper diet and poor sanitary conditions. There was a lack of early warning data to monitor food security indicators. Food aid programmes did not meet the requirements for food quantities and composition, and faced major obstacles in logistics and targeting of the vulnerable population.
   Conclusions: Improvements in food security and the eradication of famine will require investment in sustainable projects. There is an immediate need for better planning and targeting of food aid and a national food security monitoring system. A national food and nutrition policy is recommended, focusing both on relief efforts and on underlying factors contributing to the famine.

ID MANAGEMENT; MODEL
AB Solid waste recycling and recovery approach can be a sustainable and effective waste management system in many growing cities of the least developed countries. In the course of achieving proper solid waste management, a lot of efforts in these countries have, however, been focused more on collection and disposal and ignored waste recycling which can result into income generation, employment creation and reduction of the waste quantities that will finally require disposal in the existing municipal landfills or disposal sites. This paper reports the findings of a study on solid waste recycling in a selected semi-planned settlement in Dar es Salaam City, Tanzania. The objective of the study was to describe the existing solid waste management in the study area with a view to identifying the waste generation rates, types of the wastes and determine the amount of waste from the settlement that can be recycled for the purpose of income generation and reduction of the total amount of waste to be disposed of. Findings from this study revealed that waste generation rate in the study area was 0.36 kg per person per day, and that out of the 14 600 kg of recyclable waste generated per year, 8030 kg or 55% can be recycled and generate a per capita income of Tsh 834 000 for waste recyclists which is more than twice the official minimum annual wage (Tsh 360 000) in Tanzania at the time of the study. The study also revealed that effective waste recycling in the study area would result in the reduction of the total waste that need to be transported for final disposal by 11%.

SO REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH

DT Article
ID ECONOMICS; RESOURCE
AB This paper demonstrates a methodology for constructing asset accounts for a commercial fishery in which the stock, harvest, and effort level are out of sustainable equilibrium. The paper adopts the framework used by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis in its preliminary 1993 Integrated Economic and Environmental Accounts and follows methodologies recommended by the National Research Council committee constituted to review those efforts. The accounts were constructed for the period 1985 to 1995 for the Atlantic sea scallop fishery, a significant commercial fishery, using information obtained with the cooperation of the National Marine Fisheries Service from existing databases constructed for management purposes. No significant additional data collection was required for the purpose of this study. Differences between the net rent and user cost values of the stocks over this period indicate the inefficient exploitation of immature scallop populations.

AB The Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS)/Organizacion para Estudios Tropicales (OET) has evolved in many ways since its founding in 1963 as a non-profit consortium offering graduate courses and facilitating research in tropical ecology in Costa Rica. By 2002, its international membership included about 65 institutions, including four from Costa Rica. It had developed three Costa Rican field stations (La Selva, Las Cruces, and Palo Verde) with excellent facilities for teaching and research, and it was constructing a new Costa Rican office at the University of Costa Rica. Combinations of internal and external pressures influenced OTS to develop in new directions in the 1980s and 1990s. It became more diversified and more concerned with applied science in its traditional areas of graduate education and research facilitation. The Organization also evolved into new niches: more applied biology, professional education, environmental education and policy, conservation efforts, and an expanded geographic distribution to other Latin American countries. OTS was composed of changing combinations of people (Boards, members, staff) with evolving and competing priorities for limited financial resources. External environmental changes also shaped OTS's evolution. New problems of increased tropical deforestation, the emergence of the biodiversity "crisis" and conservation biology, global climate change, and calls for sustainable development affected OTS constituents and funding priorities of governments and foundations. Both internal and external pressures have in some cases demanded for OTS to improve its relationship with: Costa Rican biologists and their institutions, the Costa Rican government, and Costa Ricans living around the three OTS field stations.

ID PRECIPITATION
AB The process industry slowly moves towards a sustainable technology in which raw materials and side products are recovered and roused and the energy consumption is reduced as much as possible. In a further stage this may result in closed systems in which the emission of polluting substances to air and water are reduced to a minimum level. In order to face these challenges, new separation technologies are required with a high separation performance at low energy consumption. Membrane technology is a relatively new separation process, which fulfils these criteria. It can he applied in process integrated systems and in this way waste problems are drastically reduced while valuable products are recovered.

AB Flowers of Limonium carolinianum are harvested for use in dried flower arrangements and various crafts. The increasing commercialization of this harvest has led to concerns regarding its sustainability. We quantified the extent of the harvest on four marshes on the Bay of Fundy coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. Over a four-year period from 1996 to 1999, flower stalk removal averaged 32% on easily accessible portions of these marshes (i.e., within 100 m of a road) compared to 5% on inaccessible portions (greater than 500 m from a road). In 5 x 5 m plots where flowers were experimentally removed, no seedlings emerged the following year, whereas seedlings always emerged in unpicked control plots. This rapid and dramatic impact of localized harvesting on seedling emergence is due to the limited dispersal and short life span of L. carolinianum seeds. Sampling in concentric circles around isolated adults revealed that 50% of seedlings emerged within 34 cm of the parent and 90% emerged within 61 cm. Tethered seed experiments revealed that seeds that did not germinate in the first spring after production did not survive to the next spring. Our results suggest that unregulated harvesting has the potential to dramatically impact recruitment into local populations. To reduce the likelihood of local extinction we recommend that harvesters do not reduce flower stalk densities below 1 per m(2).

AB I have assembled traditional ways to think about human needs and power along with empirical data to support a mental model of human values. The hierarchy of needs from the world of psychology and the hierarchy of power from the world of diplomacy provide a structure for the model. The empirical data collected from several nations over the last three decades support the structure. Furthermore, an examination of specific trends in this data for specific values indicates that it is not impossible to achieve a sustainable world driven by sustainable values. A world that will be defined by its successful movement toward the "triple bottom line," a term articulated by John Elkington, is a world in which economic prosperity, environmental protection, and social equity are aligned. To say that the model allows one to address terrorism is based on the assumption that the lack of social equity or the perception of that lack determines the likelihood of terrorism.

AB By developing a ``European System of Social Indicators'' the scientific community as well as policy makers are being provided with a theoretically well-grounded as well as methodologically sound tool of social measurement to be used to continuously monitor and analyse the development of welfare as well as general trends of social change in European societies. The article focuses on the development of a conceptual framework, to be used to guide and justify the selection of measurement dimensions and indicators. Based on an extensive review of theoretical concepts of welfare and an exploration of political goals of societal development at the European level, six major categories of goal dimensions, referring to the concepts of quality of life, social cohesion and sustainability have been identified as the backbones of the conceptual framework. In addition, the article presents the main features of the architecture of the European System of Social Indicators and lays out its main structural elements and characteristics.

AB Active promotion of evidence-based decision-making at all levels of the health field is a necessary step in the direction of improving the health of the population. Recent studies have shown that the burden of disease in developing countries is high particularly the burden of infectious, communicable and non-communicable diseases and health problems of mothers and children. There is presently, a mismatch between this increased disease and health burden and the technical and human capacity of developing countries to use existing knowledge and to generate new knowledge to combat these diseases and health problems. It is therefore necessary to assist developing countries to build indigenous research capability so they can undertake studies in their own national settings the results of which will lead to the development of appropriate control strategies in their countries. Building indigenous research capacity will enable developing country scientists to translate results of studies carried out elsewhere into their individual national settings. Eventually results of such studies will increase the global knowledge base about the particular health problems and contribute to finding appropriate solutions to them. The research will, finally, increase knowledge-based decision-making by their health leadership of the country. This paper has set out to describe some experiences in capacity strengthening over the last few decades and to propose from these, mechanisms for building these capacities in a sustainable manner.
   This paper has described the steps in capability strengthening with special emphasis on identification of trainees, their training and deployment on return. The paper has described mechanisms of research sustainability including creation of suitable career structures, remuneration of researchers and the importance of building up suitable infrastructure for research to meet increasing demands and competence. The place of partnerships South-South, South-North and networking has been stressed. Finally, the paper calls for greater involvement by policy makers in developing countries in the entire capacity building process. They should set highly focussed research priorities, identify competence not already existing and proceed to fill these gaps along the lines described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Fallow management plays a key role in supplying nutrients to the growing crop, suppressing weeds, reducing pests and diseases, and improving the sustainability of cropping systems in the humid forest zone of West and Central Africa. We evaluated soil nutrient concentration, soil acidity and soil organic matter status under natural Chromolaena fallow, fallow without Chromolaena (where Chromolaena was removed by hand), and planted Pueraria fallow in three different sites with different soil physico-chemical properties in southern Cameroon. Human population pressure is high and fallow length is short in the northern site, while an intermediate position and the contrary were observed in the central and southern sites, respectively.
   The highest nutrient concentrations (Ca2+ and Mg2+), and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) were found in the sandy clayey soils in the northern site. The lowest Al saturation and soil acidity were noticed in the sandy soils in the central site, while in the clayey soils in the southern site the lowest nutrient concentration, ECEC, and the highest soil acidity and Al saturation were found. Pueraria decreased soil acidity and increased nutrient concentration relative to Chromolaena in the northern site. The beneficial effects of Pueraria on soil acidity and nutrient concentration became less pronounced in the central site and were absent in the southern site. In the northern and central sites, the highest maize yield was observed under Pueraria, showing the responsiveness of maize to N.
   In the soils of the southern site with the smaller weight (< 1.50 mg per g of soil) of particulate organic matter (POM) (53-4000 mum) and greater chemical constraints (high soil acidity and Al saturation), higher in N content in medium (250-2000 mum) and fine (53-250 mum) POM was found under Pueraria compared to natural fallow. N content in medium POM under Pueraria was greater by 47% compared to the natural fallow. The N content in fine POM under Pueraria was greater by 59% relative to the natural fallow. In the southern site, chemical constraints induced very low maize yields under all fallow types. It appears that POM quality, i.e. N content, was more important for maize than POM quantity, i.e. weight, while groundnut and cassava were more sensitive to POM quantity.
   Pueraria have a beneficial ecological and environmental sustainability in the soil with low acidity, while Chromolaena seems to be more sustainable than Pueraria in the acidic soils. However, crop yields found in this study were low. Maize yield was lower than 2000 kg ha(-1), groundnut grain dry matter yield was lower than 600 kg ha(-1) and cassava was lower than 400 tuber dry matter kg ha(-1). Therefore, to attain, highest productivity levels it is necessary to combine fallow management (primarily planted such as Pueraria which can increase N content even where there are chemical constraints or soil degradation) with the use of fertilisers (organic and mineral).

SO SYSTEM DYNAMICS REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMICS
AB Many natural resource-based commodity systems exhibit a trio of undesirable behaviors-price instability resource unsustainability, and inequity among people along the commodity chain. In this article we share findings from a modeling project that focuses primarily on the second problem, unsustainability, in the forest products economy and forest ecosystem of the Northeastern United States. Tire model shows the structural potential for lumber industry capacity to overshoot the timber resource of the regional forest. Many of the policies commonly advocated in response to resource shortage, such as boosting mill efficiencies and eliminating log exports, appear unlikely to solve the problem. We identify several policies with the potential to help sustain both the industry and resource base. We also share insights on how to design a modeling and intervention process when addressing policy problems for which no single organization has direct responsibility, Finally, we consider ways to navigate through three prevalent defensive routines - denial, resignation, and despair-that are often barriers to constructive discussion on how to address potential limits to growth.

SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT

DE environmental certification; ecolabels; accreditation; tourism;
   hospitality
AB Attempts to promoting sustainable tourism and ecotourism as quality products suffer from the lack of methods to ensure these are not just a green wash. The current proliferation of awards, labels and endorsements has confused consumers to the extent of preferring to ignore these green messages. Several initiatives have emerged to address the proliferation of small, little known, limited value ecolabels in tourism and hospitality, and to ensure that the larger ones meet internationally accepted criteria. This paper will review progress made by a wide range of public, private and non-profit agencies in developing environmental standards and method to measure them, which will be set against the internationally agreed process for compliance assessment. From the above experiences, the author will outline the prospects to environmental certification in tourism and hospitality, which are the development of an international accreditation system, following agreed standards, and linked to national, regional or sector-specific certification programmes.
