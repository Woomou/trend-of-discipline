   VISITOR MANAGEMENT
AB Nature-based tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic regions has grown substantially in recent years. However, relatively few studies have examined tourism in the Sub-Antarctic region. This article discusses the growth and nature of tourist visitation in the Sub-Antarctic and the development of management regimes for conserving the region's fragile nature and cultural heritage. Special reference is given to the Australian and New Zealand management strategies and the potential conflict between the objectives of government authorities and large and small operators in developing visitor guidelines. The article concludes by noting the significance of the development of Sub-Antarctic visitor management strategies for the concept of sustainable tourism.

TI THE COMMODIFICATION OF MOUNTAINEERING

DE MOUNTAINEERING; ECOTOURISM; ALPINE ECOTOURISM; SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
ID TOURISM
AB This article argues that mountaineers, with their long-term relationships with specific regions and peoples, complex motivations structuring their presence and activities, and lengthy history as a distinct cultural community, represent what ecotourism is striving for. They are a group of socially aware, self-reflective travelers who are proactive in the growth and restructuring of the mountain experience. Mountaineering literature is used to describe the changes in the sport and in the mountains, and to illustrate some of the ways in which cultural values, social meaning, and physical reality change when the human/nature relationship is commodified. Assessing consequences of a commodified alpine experience raises further questions as to the efficacy of ecotourism development models, and achievability of 'sustainable' tourism.

TI MODIFIED LOGIT-FUNCTION DEMAND MODEL FOR PREDICTING NATIONAL CRUDE-OIL
   AND NATURAL-GAS CONSUMPTIONS
SO APPLIED ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents a novel approach to demand forecasting for both crude oil and natural gas:  it can be applied with confidence for any country that is politically and economically stable.  However, because of these uncertainties and social factors, it is often difficult to formulate a wise policy concerning long-term energy requirements. None the less, there is a need for each country to formulate a sustainable energy strategy.  Thus it is desirable to be able to predict accurately future demand requirements for crude oil and natural gas, and so a mathematical model has been developed that can be used with readily-available standard data:  it is referred to as the 'modified logit-function demand model'.  It is based on saturation curve extrapolations for the appropriate energy intensity (i.e. fuel consumption/GDP), population and GDP/capita.  When new input data become available, revised and hence improved projected-demand estimates can be derived readily.

TI RAIL TRANSPORT CONSIDERATIONS IN THE UKS ENERGY-POLICY
SO APPLIED ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The present UK government (1994) appears to have no long-term UK transport policy which integrates the needs of the economy in a sufficiently environmentally benign way with the needs of goods and passenger transportation.  An integrated, sustainable and environmentally aware UK transport policy is desperately needed, in which forms of transport other than the fossil-fuelled motor car are allowed to play more important roles.  Ways in which rail may fulfil its potential role in such a future transport policy are highlighted.

TI TIMBER-LABELING SCHEME TO ENCOURAGE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF TROPICAL-FOREST
   SUSTAINABILITY
SO APPLIED ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The excessive greenhouse effect due to air-borne pollution, is of increasing concern, and the importance of reducing emissions to minimise the likelihood of further atmospheric degradation is recognised universally. One of the contributory phenomena, namely, the adverse influence of deforestation, is considered in this paper.
   Some of the tropical countries' timber exports should be decreased if sustainability of the diversity of timber species is to be ensured. To attempt to achieve this, a scheme is proposed which takes into account (i) deforestation (and the burning of timber, whether in situ in the forest or removed for later combustion elsewhere); (ii) the negative effects of population growth; and (iii) haulage distances from the country of the timber's origin to the UK, the latter resulting in the consumption of fossil fuels, which are themselves becoming increasingly scarce resources. The devised multi-criteria assessment procedure, though only a crude first step, indicates which timber imports, from which countries, to the UK should be reduced or prohibited This assessment should be updated annually. Implementation of analogous procedures by all the timber-importing countries would ensure the necessary reafforestation and encourage the sustainable management of forests worldwide.

AB The rational use of energy is essential for the long-term sustainability of future generations. Man's future prosperity depends upon the quality of energy education provided for all citizens, as well as the progress made by scientists and engineers in devising and applying less polluting, more energy-efficient technologies. Unfortunately, few individuals have acquired an adequate knowledge with respect to energy use and its environmental consequences, because the broad subject of 'energy' has not been taught in a coherent manner. In particular, the desirable evolution towards a more energy-effective society is inhibited by widespread ignorance as to exactly why and how we should become less dependent on fossil fuels. To overcome this energy 'innocence, 'illiteracy', 'innumeracy' or 'apathy, relevant energy education needs to be promulgated, with greater vigour, in a more comprehensive and coherent manner throughout our education system.

AB A long term field experiment began in 1979 at Wagga Wagga, N.S.W., to compare the sustainability of a range of rotation, tillage and stubble management systems on a red earth th. This paper reports yield, yield components and grain protein of wheat for 1979-90. Rotations considered were alternating lupin-wheat (LW), lupin-wheat-wheat (LWW), continuous wheat (WW) with and without N fertilizer (100 kg N/ha), and alternating sub-clover-wheat (CW). Soil N supply at the start of the experiment was high following many years of sub-clover based pasture. From 1979 to 1983, there was a negative grain yield response to N fertilizer and no response to a legume in rotation except in the drought of 1982 when low yields were recorded from LW. Thereafter, a positive grain yield response was usually produced to N fertilizer in WW rotations, until 1989 and 1990, when these crops displayed aluminium toxicity symptoms. Overall, average grain yields from legume I rotations were higher than WW with added N fertilizer. Since 1983, LW rotations consistently produced higher mean grain yields than CW, but mean grain protein and total N uptake were lower. Yields and N uptake by the second wheat crop in a LWW rotation indicated little carryover of benefits from the lupins. Slightly higher mean grain yield and harvest index, but lower mean grain protein, were produced by direct drilling, compared with cultivation before sowing, following lupins or sub-clover. However, retaining stubble rather than burning in autumn consistently reduced grain yields. There was no evidence that early burial of wheat stubble following summer rain, rather than incorporation in autumn, improved grain yield or total N uptake.
   The build-up of giant brome grass and diseases, particularly where stubble was retained and crops direct-drilled, casts some doubt on the long term sustainability of these short term rotations in this environment.

TI EFFECTS OF BURNING AND GRAZING ON SUSTAINABLE UTILIZATION OF UPLAND SNOW
   TUSSOCK (CHIONOCHLOA SPP) RANGELANDS FOR PASTORALISM IN SOUTH ISLAND,
   NEW-ZEALAND
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English
DT Article

AB The upland (800-2000 m) snow tussock (Chionochloa spp.) rangelands of South Island, New Zealand have a long history of burning that pre-dates human occupation during the last millennium. Their present extent in part reflects their ability to displace a range of woody vegetation, including forest, through tolerance of periodic fire. Research has confirmed the general tolerance of these grasslands to fire, though recovery of some features (e.g. biomass and flowering potential) may take more than 14 years.
   Mammalian grazing, by contrast, is a recent phenomenon, associated with European settlement and pastoralism over the last 150 years, on these mostly Crown (i.e. public-owned) lands. Such grazing, particularly when combined with regular burning, has usually resulted in prolonged reductions in tussock biomass, vigour and stability, as well as in the control and yield of water, potentially the most valuable product for humans from the upland grasslands. Fire promotes vegetative growth, flowering and seed germination within 2 years of burning. It also increases the palatability of these long-lived dominant grasses which are vulnerable to severe grazing by introduced ruminants, especially in the immediate post-fire recovery period when nutrients are reallocated from roots to leaf tissue.
   Management constraints, particularly restriction of grazing during the post-fire recovery period, have been inadequate to prevent continued degradation of the grasslands through weakening or displacement of the dominant tussock grass cover and a consequent loss of stability in many areas. Under pastoralism, the productive potential of the grasslands, together with their water, soil and nature conservation values have generally declined. Existing pastoral practices in many areas clearly represent non-sustainable utilisation of the rangelands for pastoralism. Recovery will be difficult and costly, both economically and socially. Some representative areas have been formally reserved and are being monitored to serve as baseline references.

AB Legume-based pastures have long been an integral part of rice growing in the southern New South Wales irrigation areas and still offer potential to improve the productivity, profitability, and sustainability of the temperate rice-cropping system.
   This paper reviews both historical and current aspects of pastures in temperate rice rotations in southern New South Wales and highlights the importance of pastures in sustaining this cropping system as environmental pressures increase. Topics discussed include pasture species and rotations, their role in improving soil fertility and sustainability, the value of pastures in weed control, and their management for maximum profitability.

AB Surface soil pH can influence biological activity, nutrition and various chemical processes in the soil. Low pH or acidity is causing major concern in southern Australia, prompting requests for details on the extent, severity and distribution of acidic soils in Queensland.
   By creating a soil pH database, using an appropriate base map, rainfall isohyets and GIS technology, a coloured pH map of surface soils was produced at a 1:5000000 scale for the entire State. As most samples were from virgin or little disturbed sites, the map generally reflects naturally occurring soil pH. Developed horticultural, agricultural and fertilized pastoral areas are likely to have lower pH than that mapped.
   About two thirds (63.1%) of Queensland's soils have acidic surfaces, 9.5% neutral and the remaining 26.9% are alkaline. The major proportion (74%) of the > 1200 mm rainfall zone is strongly acid, and the remainder is medium acid or acid. Much of the sugar growing areas occur in this zone.
   Surface soil pH generally decreases as rainfall increases and to a lesser extent from subtropical to tropical climate. In addition to climate, identification of the soil type assists with predicting pH, as the organic, coarse and medium textured soils and massive earths are more likely to be acid and have low buffering capacity. Depending on the land use, such soils may require regular liming or minimizing of net acidifying practices for long term sustainability.

AB Krasnozems (Ferrosols) characteristically have high contents of citrate-dithionite extractable Fe and moderate to high contents of clay throughout the profile. They typically have low cation exchange capacity (2-20 cmol(c) kg-1), high P sorbing ability, and a significant anion exchange capacity at depth. The chemistry of krasnozems is dominated by the variable charge characteristics of the organic matter and the oxy-hydroxides of Fe and Al which occur in the predominantly kaolinitic clay fraction. The effects of surface charge characteristics, organic matter, and extractable iron and aluminium on the cation and anion exchange capacities, P sorbing abilities and pH buffer capacities of Australian krasnozems are reviewed. A selection of reports of nutrient deficiencies and toxicities in these soils is presented and briefly discussed. Published data on the chemical composition of the soil solutions of krasnozems are reviewed.
   Data from a suite of paired (undeveloped and developed) krasnozem profiles from eastern Australia indicate that exchangeable Ca and Mg, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), pH buffer capacity (pHBC) and total N decrease significantly (P < 0.05) in the A horizon following development, while exchangeable K, ECEC and pHBC decrease (P < 0-05) in the B horizon. The decreases in the A horizon are shown to be a direct consequence of the decline in organic matter which occurs following development. Because of the crucial role that organic matter plays in the chemical fertility of krasnozems, they are less likely to maintain their fertility under exploitative conditions than other productive clay soils such as Vertosols.
   It is concluded that the sustainable use of krasnozems will depend on maintenance or enhancement of organic matter levels, maintenance of surface and subsoil pH by regular application of amendments, minimization of erosion, and replacement of nutrients removed in harvested products.

AB The physical properties of krasnozems and euchrozems in Australia have received little attention due to the widespread perception that they are 'good' soils.  We present data from three locations which are representative of these soil types in the South Burnett region of southern Queensland.  At each location, paired sites were chosen where continuously cropped and uncropped land existed side by side.  The effect of continuous cropping on physical fertility, relative to that of soil in virgin condition, is assessed and related to published data from other locations where available.
   Continuous cropping has reduced infiltration rates from 80 mm h-1 or more to values as low as 25 mm h-1.  Originally low bulk densities ranging from 0.6 Mg m-3 at the surface to 1.3 Mg m-3 at 70 cm depth have been increased to corresponding values of 1.0 and 1.4 Mg m-3.  Local maxima of 1.3 Mg m-3 occur between 15 and 30 cm depth.  Penetration resistance has been increased markedly at low water contents as a result of increased cohesion, with an uncropped soil having values <2.5 MPa over the available water content range comapred with values of >6 MPa in the continuously cropped soil.  Organic carbon in the surface soil has been reduced from 4-5% to 1% and aggregate stability under rain has been reduced, the % aggregates <0.125 mm diameter increasing from 10% to 20% or more.  Soil water storage has been reduced together with crop water extraction, with these effects attributed to a loss of water storage pores in the top 30-50 cm of the profile and restricted root development.  The problems of rehabilitating these soils are briefly discussed.
   Continuous cropping under dryland conditions has greatly reduced the physical fertility of krasnozem and euchrozem soils and made them more susceptible to variation in seasonal conditions.  Available data suggest degradation is also occurring on krasnozems used for intensive vegetable production.  Methods of rehabilitating physical fertility of degraded krasnozems are required, as are farming systems which are more sustainable in the long term.

AB The destructive effects of indigenous insects on pasture plants are a significant cause of diminished pastoral productivity in New Zealand. Identification of white clover genotypes with natural immunity against native insects has not been successful, so farmers use chemical sprays to control pest populations. An alternative strategy to reduce insect damage to white clover is through development of a transformation system using Agrobacterium-mediated transfer DNA. We have developed a rapid procedure, where transgenic white clover plants regenerate directly from the cotyledonary axil of germinated seedlings and can be transferred into the glasshouse within 42 days of culture initiation. This technology offers the opportunity to improve the sustainability of white clover in New Zealand pastures by introducing pest resistance genes directly into these plants. Insect feeding bioassays have identified several serotypes of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) with delta-endotoxins active against larvae of the lepidopteran pest, porina moth (Wiseana spp.). By transforming white clover (genotype WR8) with a cryIA(b) gene from Bt we demonstrated reduced survival of a test insect, Orocrambus flexuosellus. We are currently transforming elite white clover genotypes with a cryIB gene which encodes a delta-endotoxin considerably more active against Wiseana larvae than the CryIA(b) protein. As the technical difficulties of achieving insecticidal levels of Bt delta-endotoxin in plants are overcome, issues concerning the production and release of transgenic white clover cultivars need to be resolved. We propose methods by which transgenic white clover cultivars could be produced from this outbreeding species. We also evaluate issues associated with maintaining transgenic plants in the pasture environment, dispersal of pollen and containment of germplasm, and most importantly, the impact of these plants on both grassland and polyphagous pests feeding on a diverse mixture of pasture species.

AB The goals of sustainable food production and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions may be in conflict when green manures are used in flooded rice systems. A field study was initiated in early spring 1992 near Sacramento, California to quantify the potential for enhanced methane emissions following a green manure amendment to rice. Replicate flux measurements were made twice a day every 3-4 days throughout the growing season in four treatment plots: burned rice straw, spring incorporated rice straw, burned straw plus purple vetch and spring incorporated straw plus vetch. Seasonal methane emissions ranged from 66-136 g CH4 m-2 and were 1.5 to 1.8 times higher from the straw plus vetch treatments relative to the straw only treatments. No significant differences in emissions were found between the two straw only treatments or the straw plus vetch treatments. Methane fluxes were exponentially related to soil temperature, but no effect of redox potential or floodwater depth were observed. The potential impact of these results on the global methane budget is discussed.

DE BROWN BEAR; SWEDEN; POPULATION ESTIMATES; MORTALITY RATES; HUNTING
AB The density of adult (greater than or equal to 3 years) female brown bears Ursus arctos was estimated in two areas of Sweden from ratios of radio-marked and unmarked females consorting with radio-marked adult males during the breeding season. The resulting densities were 1.2 +/- 0.81 (95% confidence interval) adult females/1000 km(2) in a northern study area and 1.06 +/- 3.44 adult females/1000 km(2) in a southern area. These estimates were extrapolated to obtain a population estimate for Sweden using relative densities throughout the range of the species in Sweden, based on hunter-kill statistics, and observed rates of reproduction and juvenile and subadult survival. The total population in spring 1991 was estimated to be about 620 bears, with almost all females confined to four geographically separated areas, termed female core areas. A supplementary estimate, based on estimated kill rates of adult females in the study areas, was about 660 bears. Estimates based on hunter kill rates of marked bears gave minimum and maximum estimates of about 300 and 900 bears, respectively. Although these are not confidence intervals of the total population estimate, we believe that the true population size is included within these limits. Densities within the female cove areas varied from 50 to 100% of those in similar habitats in European Russia. The bear population in Sweden appeared to have increased at a stable rate of about 1.5% annually during the past 50 years. Mean annual rate of legal harvest during 1943-1991 was estimated to be 55% (+/- 2.1% SD), suggesting a maximum sustainable rate of 7.0% for this population. The harvest increased at a rate of 9.6% annually during 1981-1991, and apparently was at the maximum sustainable level during 1987-91.

AB A broad understanding of the structure and functioning of the Okavango Delta ecosystem has provided a basis for evaluating the kinds of perturbations that are likely to affect the ecosystem as a whole. Sediment introduced into the system results in constant changes in the distribution of water on the fan surface. This promotes the occurrence of a variety of habitats in different stages of wetting and drying, and accounts for the overall habitat diversity in the system. It also promotes regeneration of saline soils that are locally toxic to vegetation on islands in the Okavango Delta. Water abstraction from the lower reaches of the fan by activities such as dredging may be rendered useless by changes in the distribution of water on the fan over relatively short time spans. However, water abstraction in itself is not necessarily a problem. Ideally it should be none fr om the apex of the fan, provided it is small relative to the total inflow (1-2%), and does not disrupt sediment supply to the system from source areas, such as by the construction of a weir ol dam. An additional impact of the construction of an impoundment in the catchment would be an. increase in the total dissolved solid concentration of inflowing water. The system is adapted to low total dissolved solid concentrations and, by affecting the nature of plant communities at the apex of the fan, the system as a whole could be affected.
   The dominance of transpiration over evaporation in this wetland ecosystem results in the accumulation of dissolved substances, notably silica and calcium and magnesium carbonate below surface, where they are biologically not deleterious. Sustained removal of vegetation may result in salinization of surface water, and would have a large impact on the ecosystem. Additional impacts that could alter the structure and functioning of the ecosystem include eutrophication that may result from agricultural development in the catchment, which may profoundly affect the nature of vegetation communities in the upper reaches of the fan, and thus the patterns of sediment and water dispel sal. We no not regard the present utilization of al eas around the periphery of the Delta as a direct threat to the ecosystem itself.

AB Surveys of local population resource use and attitudes are essential to the success of tropical conservation projects aiming to promote sustainable development. The following is a report from a survey of landowners participating in a voluntary conservation program for the black howler monkey Alouatta pigra known as the Community Baboon Sanctuary (CBS) in Belize, Central America.
   Interviews revealed a variety of issues requiring consideration by CBS managers: continued urban flight may jeopardize community stability; hunting and agricultural production methods will require management to lessen impact on wildlife resources and habitat; protection of the black howler monkey is enthusiastically supported for a variety of non-economic reasons; a majority of respondents feel they have benefited from participation in the CBS, but showed diminished confidence in deriving direct economic benefit from increased tourism to the CBS when compared to benefits from tourism at local or national levels.
   The continued success of the CBS will depend on locally-driven sustainable resource use and agricultural development in addition to well-planned tourism development in order to foster conservation of biodiversity.

AB Rural inhabitants in Amazonia can overexploit many mammalian species by game hunting, and tropical forests lose their value as a source of game meat when mammal populations decline. Implementing a sustainable hunt should reduce overexploitation of animals, and therefore help retain the value of intact Amazonian ecosystems. Rural folk in the Tahuayo region of the Reserva Comunal Tamshiyacu-Tahuayo of northeastern Peru appear to be overharvesting primates and lowland tapir Tapirus terrestris, but are apparently not overexploiting artiodactyls and large rodents. Converting the current overhunting in Tahuayo to a more sustainable harvest would require cessation of hunting of overexploited species and the setting of artiodactyl and large rodent harvests at or below current levels. Costs of implementing a more sustainable hunt in Tahuayo would incur a 26% reduction of economic benefits for hunters and reduce the extraction of mammalian biomass by 35%.

DT Article
AB In the chain of developing food security, plant genetic resources conservation is the first link. As a result of national and international efforts, national and regional genebanks are now established in about 100 countries.
   Initially genebanks concentrated on collecting and saving ex situ threatened material of landraces of the most important crops. This is now gradually complemented with conservation of wild forms of cultivated plants and their relatives as well as biodiversity in general. This development have received international recognition on the highest level with the Convention on Biodiversity, last year.
   The Convention introduces a number of requirements on the states becoming parties to the Convention, concerning e.g., access to plant genetic resources, national strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, measures for ex situ conservation, and transfer of knowledge and technologies from developed to developing countries. In this context, particular reference is made to the specific competence of the Institut fur Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung to contribute in this transfer to cover the extreme need for taxonomy and taxonomists in the developing countries.
   With regard to problems relating to the collecting of material and information, the cost factor for actual collecting of material in developed countries is considered small, while the opposite is true for the collecting of the information. The situation in developing countries tends to be the reverse.
   With respect to maintaining both material and information, both in ex situ and in situ conservation. and seed versus vegetatively propagated material the conclusion is that developed countries comes away with in general lower cost level than developing for the ex situ as well as for in situ conservation.
   Considering the utilization of the genebank material in breeding and plant improvement in developing countries it seems likely that the cost part of this aspect will be low while the probability of gain is high, thus the prize per unit gain becomes lower. With regard perspectives, the developing countries have a very demanding period ahead. In many cases. know-how and scientific competence have to be developed at the same time as material and information has to be rapidly saved from extinction. Considering the economic and population situation in most of those countries a massive support is needed from the international community.
   For Europe, this means that in addition to present internal needs for steeply increased funding to own plant genetic resources conservation due to committments to the Biodiversity Convention, the contribution to developoing countries should be drastically increased.

AB Two types of sustainability ought to be discussed in connection with biomass use for energy, the long term sustainability of biomass production as such, and the overall ecosystem sustainability under the existing and future global climatic conditions. This framework will stress the importance of using biomass as an energy resource, for reducing the use of fossil fuels.
   An integrated view of the environmental effects of short-rotation forest plantations should include an analysis of the effects from production to conversion and an analysis of the range of the specific environmental effect in relation to other alternatives for producing energy or wood products. Many negative effects from the utilization step of short-rotation forest plantations can be minimized depending on the choice of land, cultivation methods and target levels yield.
   Short-rotation plantations is an environmental sound energy resource if. (1) the biomass production systems are not pressed to maximum production, (2) cultivation measures are taken to minimize nutrient leaching, (3) the short-rotation plantations are designed for visual adaptation to the landscape, and (4) directed silvicultural measures are taken to retain and improve important habitats and protect marginal forest areas.

AB Studies on climate change and energy production increasingly recognise the crucial role of biological systems. Carbon sinks in forests (above and below ground), CO2 emissions from deforestation, planting trees for carbon storage, and biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels are some of the key issues which arise. This paper assesses various forestry strategies and examines land availability, forest management, environmental sustainability, social and political factors, infrastructure and organisation, economic feasibility, and ancillary benefits associated with biomass for energy.
   Halting deforestation is of paramount importance and should have priority above all other options, although it will not be easy to implement for a variety of well known reasons. There is also great potential for reforestation of degraded lands, agroforestry and improved forest management. We conclude biomass energy plantations and other types of energy cropping could be a more effective strategy for carbon mitigation than simply growing trees as a carbon store, particularly on higher productivity lands. Use of the biomass produced as an energy source has the added advantage of a wide range of other environmental, social and economic benefits. The constraints to achieving environmentally-acceptable biomass production are not insurmountable. Rather they should be seen as scientific and entrepreneurial opportunities which will yield numerous advantages in the long term.

AB Several woody and herbaceous energy crop species have been selected as high-potential candidates for supplying biomass feedstocks.  Successful methods for their establishment and maintenance have been developed.  Recommended species vary as a function of region of the country and soil type.  Yields are equally variable.  The crops that have received the most research and development include hybrid poplars (fast-growing trees) and switchgrass (a perennial grass).  Some information is also available on other tree crops, thick-stemmed perennials and annuals.  Supplying large volumes of biomass to energy facilities on a daily basis requires that consideration be taken of the harvest timing, storage and delivery characteristics of different feedstocks as well as their yield, cost and energy properties.  Our summary suggests that a combination of crops will be needed to provide large amounts of low-cost and environmentally sustainable year-round supplies of biomass feedstocks.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive and consistent methodology to account for the costs and net carbon flows of different categories of forestry and biomass energy projects and describes the application of the methodology to several sets of projects in Latin America.  The results suggest that both biomass energy development and forestry measures including reforestation and forest protection can contribute significantly to the reduction of global CO2 emissions, and that local land-use capacity must determine the type of project that is appropriate in specific cases.  No single approach alone is sufficient as either a national or global strategy for sustainable land use or carbon emission reduction.  The methodology allows consistent comparisons of the costs and quantities of carbon stored in different types of projects and/or national programs, facilitating the inclusion of forestry and biomass energy projects in a possible CO2 emission reduction regime.

AB Growing interest in woody biomass for energy in the midwestern U.S. will require information on species and site productivities.  We investigated 3, 6 and 14 year yields of the nitrogen-fixing tree species, European black alder, at three spacings on a marginally productive soil in central Indiana, U.S.A.  The highest yield was 10 Mg ha-1 yr-1 at age three at the closest spacing of 0.5 x 1 m.  Other spacings and ages provided smaller yields.  Fertilization with phosphorus and potassium only provided a response in the initial 3 year rotation.  Whole-tree and stem-only harvests removed varying levels of nutrients from the site.  However, on these marginally productive sites where N and sometimes P are limiting, sustainable harvesting could be maintained due to the nitrogen-fixing capability of this species and the effects of N fixation on P availability.  Preliminary economic analyses indicated that growing biomass on farms could be profitable, but only with farm or forestry program cost-sharing assistance.  Where establishment expenses could be reduced by wider spacings, the use of seed rather than seedlings, or farmer-substituted labor, returns to the farmer were competitive with row-crop and timber production.

These responses were both abolished in Ca2+-deficient environment. The stimulation of the acini with a pharmacological (100 pM) concentration, however, induced a rapid [Ca2+]c increase followed by a gradual decay, and a rapid initial rise in amylase output followed by a gradual decay. In the Ca2+-deficient environment, the initial phases of responses remained but the second decay phases were selectively abolished. These results indicate that the binding of CCK-g to the high-affinity state on the acini induces recurrent Ca2+ spikes, which may maintain the sustainable secretory responses in the pancreatic acinar cells.

AB Natural products, especially those derived from higher plants, have historically played a pivotal role in the discovery of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, in the recent past less emphasis has been placed on natural products as new leads, especially for agricultural applications. An important, if not predominant, consideration fostering this lack of interest in natural product-derived leads has to do with the issue of sustainable and economic supplies of the natural product to meet the needs of the development process and ultimately the clinical use of the drug or the agricultural application of the substance. A brief overview of alternative strategies to resolve supply issues and their relative strengths and weaknesses is presented.

AB The first main message of this paper is that our purpose of developing information systems in business is to achieve sustainable effects in the firm. This implies widening our focus from information systems to include business processes and persons. It also involves widening our focus from methodology to development processes. The second main message is that we should widen our focus from business process re-engineering to business process reshaping. The idea is to focus on the purpose (reshaped business processes) rather than on a specific approach (such as business process re-engineering). This enables us to focus on the purpose of achieving sustainable effects in the business firm. We can then apply different approaches in different situations, using a larger variety of action. In the last part of the paper, some opportunities and challenges related to widening your focus in the above respects are discussed. The paper ends with the third main message that achieving sustainable effects from information systems development and widening the focus to business process reshaping are two different applications of the same idea: Consider the larger context of the processes you are involved in.

ID MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE-YIELD
AB Relationships between various biological reference points (BRPs) used to define thresholds and targets of fisheries management strategies were examined for a range of combinations of life history characteristics. Rank orderings of the selected BRPs were strongly influenced by the degree of density dependence in the underlying spawning-recruitment (S-R) relationship. The validity of F0.1, F(max), F20% (the fishing mortality at which spawning per recruit is 20% of the maximum), and other reference fishing mortality rates as approximations to F(msy) or as thresholds of overfishing is highly dependent on life history characteristics, particulary the degree of density dependence in the S-R relationship. It is recommended that F40% be adopted as a target fishing mortality rate when the S-R relationship is unknown and that threshold levels of biomass be related to the estimated or assumed degree of density dependence in the S-R relationship. Two new methods of calculating threshold biomass levels are suggested as alternatives to the familiar 20% B0 rule.

AB Conventional agriculture appears to be decreasing in energy efficiency and has some adverse effects on the environment. Therefore, the marriage of agriculture and ecology is welcome, but the debate on how to achieve goals for sustainability is far from concluded. The most important aspect of sustainability is creating systems that have an indefinite future. This point is too often ignored. A number of ''terrible'' questions can be asked about sustainability. A list of 24 ingredients required for a sustainable agriculture is given. We want sustainable agriculture to be scientific, safe and sensible. People won't stop eating if the agriculture is not sustainable, but someday there may be little to eat unless sustainability is seriously addressed.

AB Fifty per cent, more or less, of the soil organic matter from farm lands has been lost. The remainder is perhaps more resistant to loss and therefore is stable but that which has been lost was perhaps the most important half--it resisted erosion, it made soils permeable, it increased water-holding capacity and it produced healthy crops. The 50 per cent that has been lost is via two major mechanisms. One is loss per unit weight of soil by decomposition (mineralization) induced by cultivation, and the other is loss, by erosion--loss by wash away and blow away of the surface soil which contains the most soil organic matter. Both mineralization and erosion are downhill processes. If they are not in equilibrium with reverse processes, the land cannot be sustainable. If agriculture is to be sustainable, we have to look at soil organic matter, first and foremost, as a means for maintaining stable-tillable soil. Mining of soil for nutrients and letting soil organic matter levels decrease can never result in sustainable agriculture. The role of soil organic matter as a source of nitrogen and other nutrients is less important than that of providing excellent physical and biological properties of soil. Use of water-soluble polymer soil conditioners can help.

TI HIGH-PRECISION IRON AS A LIMITING FACTOR IN CROP PRODUCTION
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB It is generally believed that if the foliage of plants is visibly green, iron-deficiency problems do not exist. There are at least five conditions under which plants may respond to iron even when green: (1) If the soil solution or irrigation water contain more than 1 or 2 me/L bicarbonate, (2) If leaf concentrations of iron are below between 40 to 70 mg/kg dry weight, (3) In the new leaf growth of most trees and vines, (4) During the first one of more days in the life of a seedling, and (5) When crops are pushed to very high yields. SPAD leaf color readings or chlorophyll analyses may detect some of the possibilities. The Sufficiency Values for iron have to be less than the maximum of 1.00 in order for these iron responses to occur. Considerable programs in plant breeding and genetics are being conducted to improve the efficiency of plants for iron nutrition, but these efforts will mostly insure that iron is not a severe Liebig type limiting factor. Many or most of the physiology which relates to the five factors above, even with iron-efficient cultivars, will continue to result in slight Mitscherlich type limiting factors that involve iron. Avoidance of environmental mismanagement will continue to be a major factor in preventing iron deficiency. Sustainable practices help avoid iron deficiency.

AB Experts believe that it will be necessary to produce grain for a total of eight billion persons before world population becomes stabilized. This is thought to be exceedingly difficult for environmental reasons and on a sustainable basis. Sound procedures are suggested to work towards such a goal. Perhaps the best way to produce that much grain is to increase the price of it sufficiently so that farmers can use high-precision technologies that are sustainable. The needed grain will then be produced.

AB Most of the food in the world is produced by a billion farmers who each tend an average of about one hectare of land. Modern technology is forcing the average size of farms to increase, but most sustainability and productivity per unit of land come with the small sizes.

TI GENERALIZED ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND RULES FOR USE OF FERTILIZERS
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB Use of synthetically formulated fertilizers is perceived as not being environmentally sound. This is not the case when principles outlined in special rules are followed. Following the rules is the road to sustainability and not away from sustainability. Simple procedures, such as choice of plant species and cultivar, can do much to modify the needs for various inputs. Plant nutrients obey environmental rules or laws; they enter into geochemical and biological cycles. The application of fertilizers sets into action a chain of events, the consequences of which may be far removed from where they were applied on the farm. These reactions and their ecological implications must be properly managed to avoid problems. Most environmental problems related to soil result from so-called Liebig-type limiting factors which prevent response to needed inputs. Any inputs are then wasted and may degrade the environment.

ID CALCIUM
AB Agriculture has failed to be sustainable several times in the history of the world because of soil failure (Rush, 1987). Irrigated soil eventually leads to sodicity and salinity unless extreme care is taken. Gypsum is a key ingredient for the maintenance of agriculture on many soils. Waste-product gypsum is available in a large number of locations at very little or no cost. Advantages of gypsum in addition to prevention and correction of sodicity include greater stability of soil organic matter, more stable soil aggregates, improved water penetration into soil, and more rapid seed emergence. Gypsum have an important role in making a better environment, especially for growing plants.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Tobacco will wipe out ten percent of the world's population at its present level of use. Cancer of various kinds is the major effect. Over the life span of 70 years, this means that about 100,000 per million will die of tobacco-induced cancer in the USA. There will be an equal number of cancers for other reasons. Many natural products in food we eat and even the air we breath can induce cancers. Legislation controlling use of pesticides aim at keeping the risk of cancer at less than one in a million over a life span of 70 years. Against a background of 200,000 per million or even half that, one in a million is virtually impossible to detect, even with the best of science. Risk analysis is far from being an exact science. The procedures used to assess risk, even though full of assumptions, are reasonably safe. Most likely they err on the safe side by orders of magnitude. The Delaney Clause, California Proposition 65 which banned all pesticides known to be carcinogenic in California, and failed California Big Green of 1990 all mean well but they detract from a farmer's ability to deal with the more real problems of creating a sustainable agriculture. The present analytical revolution has increased fears of pesticides but it should do the reverse; perceived risk is a bigger problem than real risk.

TI PRECISION NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT - IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND NEEDS FOR

SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
AB The inadequacies in plant nutrition and fertilizer application (dosage not according to the requirements; improper N-P-K ratio; lack of Ca, Mg and micronutrient supply; limited variety of fertilizers; problems related to storage, time of application, means of distribution; etc.) lead to serious environmental problems (e.g. soil acidification -> mobilization of potentially toxic elements: ''chemical time-bomb effect''; P load of surface waters -> eutrophisation -> unfavourable changes in aquatic ecosystems, rapid silting-up of canals and reservoires; nitrate pollution of drinking water resources -> human health problems; accumulation of toxic compounds from fertilizers; etc.) in many parts of the World, both in developed and developing countries. (Most of) these side effects - however - are not inevitable and uncontrollable consequences of fertilizer application. Precision nutrient management is the key task of sustainable agricultural development, economic biomass production and efficient environment protection.
   The objective of precision nutrient management is to satisfy the nutrient requirements of crops, without any environmental side-effects. The main criteria of such a system, are: (i)   fertilizer application according to crop requirements (involving their nutrient uptake dynamics) and land-site characteristics (climate, relief, moisture supply, nutrient status and other properties of soils); (ii)  reduction of nutrient losses (surface runoff, leaching, volatilization, organic and inorganic immobilization); (iii) increase of the ''efficiency'' of soil nutrients, applied manure and fertilizers.
   The scientific preconditions of this system are adequate knowledge on the: nutrient regime of soils: spatial and temporal variability of the various forms (''soluble'', ''exchangeable'', ''mobile'', and ''available'') of plant nutrients in soils [soil testing]. transport and transformation processes of plant nutrients. nutrient requirements and nutrient uptake dynamics of various crops [plant analysis and plant physiology]. effect of plant nutrition on the biomass production. actual and potential inputs of plant nutrition on the environment (soil, surface- and sub-surface waters, biota, ''food-chain'' up to human health).
   The technical preconditions are: availability of a great variety of fertilizers applicable for various crops under different natural conditions and land management practices. possibilities for uniform and or differential fertilizer application according to the spatial variability of a given landsite. possibilities for splitted fertilizer application according to the nutrient uptake dynamics of a given crop.
   The main task of the scientist - extensionist - farmer - environmentalist community in the future will be: ensuring the above-mentioned preconditions. broadcasting the present knowledge and providing the necessary help (education, extension and advisory service, technical assistance, etc.) to the land user. establishment of proper society control mechanisms (legislation, financial policy and other economy regulations) to stimulate (or even press - when and where it is necessary) the land users for sustainable land use, including precision nutrient management.
   The effective realization of these tasks guarantee simultaneously rational biomass production, a pleasant environment and a promising future.

AB The problem of stability applied to biotic processes is discussed.  Using the examples of a model of the interdependence of the phytomass volume on the concentration of carbon acids in the atmosphere, the energy-balance climatic model of Budyko and others, the concept of the stability of the non-stationary quasi-equilibrium solution of these systems is developed.  Le Chatelier's principle and feedback mechanisms for ensuring stability of the biosphere are discussed.

AB The United States National Plant Germplasm System contains 3159 accessions from 36 species of annual Medicago. Although there is increasing interest in the annual medics for use in sustainable agriculture, the U.S. collection is under utilized because of lack of agronomic information. Development of a core collection could facilitate easier access to the germplasm collection and enhance its use. The core collection should consist of a sample of accessions that represents the range of variability within the germplasm collection with minimum redundancies. To select a core collection of annual Medicago species, a subset of 1240 accessions was evaluated during the summer of 1990 for 16 agronomic and morphological traits. Accessions within species were grouped by cluster analysis utilizing an unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages. Intraspecific phenotypic diversity determined the number of accessions for that species selected for the core collection. One accession per cluster was selected for each species for the core collection. Accessions were chosen within a species to represent the greatest diversity in geographical regions. The selected core collection of 211 accessions was reevaluated during the summer of 1991. The core collection was found to represent the variability of the germplasm collection and to remain stable between the two evaluation years. This study can be used as a model method for selecting a core collection for multispecies germplasm collections.

AB This study examines perceptions of the environment in farming communities in the forest ecotone of Ghana. It places local knowledge within a socio-economic and historical context and argues that knowledge is continually evolving, attempting to solve existing problems and discovering new ones. It maintains that favourable conditions exist in farming communities for environmental actions and development approaches based on sustainable development, since these areas have suffered from the negative effects of degradation. However, major constraints exist within the wider political economy and policy framework, which is still locked into environmentally-hostile export-oriented production, and political models which marginalize rural people.

TI SUSTAINING THE FORESTS - THE COMMUNITY-BASED APPROACH IN SOUTH AND
   SOUTH-EAST ASIA
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of sustainability emphasizes four basic principles when applied to rural communities: that basic needs must be met; that resources should be subject to local control; that local communities must have a decisive voice in planning; and that they should represent themselves through their own institutions. These principles have been notionally accepted by development planners and conservationists at all levels. Yet, throughout the tropical forest belt, they are being systematically overridden by international and national policies and development programmes, leading to increasing poverty, social conflict and rapid deforestation. Traditional knowledge and systems of land use have proved far more environmentally appropriate, resilient and complex than initially supposed by outsiders. Forest peoples have successfully opposed many socially and environmentally destructive development schemes proposed for their lands. However, these societies are not resisting all change: population increase and the internal dynamic for development have also created social and environmental problems. A review of community-based initiatives in South and South-East Asia shows that in some countries, positive initiatives have been taken by local and national governments to promote a community-based approach. Notable successes have been achieved but many other initiatives have failed. The examples show that, besides the four principles noted above, environmentally successful management also depends on innovative political organization at the community level.

TI NGOS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN ZIMBABWE - NO MAGIC BULLETS
SO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL-EROSION
AB A number of case studies of NGO projects have suggested that NGOs may have an important role to play in addressing environmental problems in developing countries. Drawing on research conducted in Zimbabwe, this analysis seeks to broaden and contextualize the discussion of NGO involvement in sustainable development initiatives. It reviews the theoretical basis for the current emphasis on NGOs, assesses the environmental problems in Zimbabwe within their historical and social contexts, and summarizes the findings of recent research on the characteristics of the NGO sector in the country. The purpose is not to evaluate specific NGO environment projects, but rather to assess the mechanisms through which the NGO sector as a whole might make a significant contribution to sustainable development, and the problems in doing so. It is argued that one major obstacle faced by NGOs is the demand made upon them to find simple, neat and comprehensive solutions to complex development problems. The tendency on the part of donors and NGO supporters to expect success stories is called here the 'magic bullet syndrome', and it is argued that this emphasis on simplicity and on success is unrealistic and counterproductive.

DE FREE TRADE; SUSTAINABILITY
AB This special issue on trade and the environment brings together a number of papers that are constructively critical of the conventional economic wisdom on the topic. We think that this criticism is warranted because of the decidedly uncritical way in which ''free trade' has been advocated in much of the literature, and especially in policy. The papers analyse the validity of the underlying assumptions on which the conventional wisdom is based, and provide suggestions for ways to facilitate trade that is also adequately protective of the environment, sustainability, and other social values. In this introductory piece we discuss trade, the environment, and sustainability, summarizing arguments in the papers included in this issue, and adding a few additional points not covered by them.

DE EXTERNALITIES; FREE TRADE; GATT; INTERNATIONAL TRADE; SUSTAINABILITY
AB Mainstream economic theory argues that trade, and especially free trade, is beneficial to everyone involved. This fundamental idea - which has the character of a dogma - still plays an important role in international discussions on trade issues, notably in relation to development and environment. The purpose of this article is to critically assess the ''free trade dogma'' and to investigate the validity of widely used arguments concerning the relations between trade and development and between trade and environment. It is argued that the trading system is not something inherently good, and especially, the developing countries' benefits from trade have been very dubious. Furthermore. the trading system has contributed to environmental problems in several ways, e.g., generating undervaluation of natural resources, stimulating economic growth with environmental deterioration as a consequence, and ''magnifying'' and creating externalities. The critical approach makes a case for reducing trade.

DE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY; INTERNATIONAL TRADE; TRADE AGREEMENTS
AB For an economic order to remain within ecological boundaries, countries need to respond to ecological feedback effects. Resulting environmental compliance costs have so far hardly influenced trade flows and firm location decisions. Future developments of economic integration and the increasing urgency of stricter environmental objectives are shown to change this picture. Primarily for the case of transnational and global environmental problems countries will need to be relieved from the threat of competitive disadvantage caused by environmental production process regulation that the current international regulatory trade framework implies.
   The first option to do so, international harmonization of environmental regulation, is connected to a range of shortcomings, especially for countries differing in natural endowments and preferences. For counterbalancing measures, two regulatory frameworks are analyzed based on (a) a physical inventory system or (b) a direct environmental compliance cost comparison. The adequacy of the physical system is shown to be limited, whereas the cost basis option can be applied on a broader range. It cannot fully re-establish the optimal situation that would be achieved by an (often unlikely) environmental agreement, but would encourage countries to take necessary unilateral environmental action. Changing current trade regulation in that respect will be crucial to foster sustainable development.

DE FREE TRADE; NAFTA
ID SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The prospect of a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has alarmed environmentally concerned professionals and citizens because of potential for exacerbated environmental destruction in each country. The concern in the trade and business community is that provisions for environmental protection would hobble the trade agreement and could effectively negate the positive economic benefits. The purpose of this paper is to consider the various environmental and economic implications of NAFTA and suggest policies that should allow for both a functional NAFTA and environmental protection. This paper summarizes the various potential environmental impacts along with existing free-trade mechanisms for environmental protection. It evaluates the rationale for a transition from current free-trade doctrines to those of sustainable free trade. Also recommended are several suggestions including the creation of a companion North American Environmental Protection Treaty (NAEPT). This treaty would contain trade-related policies beneficial to the environment, but inappropriate to a trade agreement. It would include short-term expansion of GATT articles for protection of the environment, and longer-term transformation of GATT into a General Agreement on Trade and the Environment (GATE). A form of countervailing duties called recompensing duties, and a form of Pigovian tax called a retributive environmental impact (REI) tax designed to ease adverse social, economic and environmental impacts during the transitional period of upward harmonization of standards are proposed. Specific recommendations for NAFTA, NAEPT and GATE are provided.

TI AN ECOLOGICAL-ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF DEREGULATION OF INTERNATIONAL

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper discusses the ecological-economic implications of deregulation of trade as promoted by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 1 This includes both environmental 2 and socio-economic factors such as standards of living and equity. We outline fifteen overlapping problems with deregulation or ''free'' trade. We argue that many environmental problems cannot be resolved equitably, efficiently, or sustainably by unregulated markets. and that there is no alternative to public intervention in certain situations. We repeat the 1987 Brundtland Commission's question of how far into international trade should regulation penetrate (WCED, 1987)? The Commission's call for GATT's environmental reform 3 has not yet been heeded.

AB The importance of spontaneous lac host-trees for preserving the fragile agroecosystem of the main lac producing areas of China, located in the tropical part of Yunnan province, is analyzed.  In upland fields, the fire-resistant vegetation consists mainly of these trees.  Farmers deliberately preserve young sprouts during the cultivation cycle.  This benefits both soil fertility and lac production.  Host-trees, mainly Dalbergia and Ficus, form a range of multipurpose trees which although limited to some ten species allows maximum use of the heterogeneities of the village territory.  Finally, lac host-trees are associated with some environmental values important to farmers.  This circumstance contributes to the sustainability of lac host-tree agroforestry in spite of current problems in the lac market.

AB This paper investigates the amount of energy required to construct buildings, and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere from the fossil fuel components of that energy. Energy requirements and carbon dioxide emissions are compared for typical commercial, industrial and residential buildings, using New Zealand as an example. A modest change from concrete and steel to more wood construction could lead to a substantial reduction in energy requirements and carbon dioxide emissions, but the sustainability of such a change has significant forestry implications.

AB Energy use and environmental degradation associated with its use in developing countries are expected to increase well into the 21st century, with adverse ramifications on sustainable development prospects worldwide. This paper examines various energy policies to promote sustainable development in developing countries, noting that many such policies imply lower overall growth rates. Short-term policies such as measures encouraging efficient use of energy are generally energy specific, while long-term measures encompass broader development policies having an impact on energy resource development and use patterns. Economic and institutional barriers and constraints which may impede the effectiveness of these policies exist in many developing countries. These barriers and constraints often constrain general development prospects as well.

AB For farmers to embrace sustainable agricultural practices, they must be convinced that sustainability is, profitable as well as good for the environment. Researchers from the World Resources Institute have analyzed both current farming practices and,alternative, organic ones in parts of India, Chile, and the Philippines to determine which practices are both profitable and more sustainable. Can governmental farming policies be changed to make sustainable agriculture more profitable and thus more attractive to farmers?

AB Tropical deforestation provides a significant contribution to anthropogenic increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration that may lead to global warming. Forestation and other forest management options to sequester CO2 in the tropical latitudes may fail unless they address local economic, social, environmental, and political needs of people in the developing world. Forest management is discussed in terms of three objectives: carbon sequestration, sustainable development, and biodiversity conservation. An integrated forest management strategy of land-use planning is proposed to achieve these objectives and is centered around: preservation of primary forest, intensified use of nontimber resources, agroforestry, and selective use of plantation forestry.

AB Fuelwood consumption in Northern Nigeria exceeds the sustainable production, and the deficit is currently met through long-distance transport from the southern part of the country at an artificially low cost. Current household fuel consumption patterns and factors affecting stove choice are discussed. Little has been done to promote more efficient woodstoves in the region, but prospects for stove programs are only good where fuelwood is marketed and the policy environment is conducive.
   At subsidized official prices for kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and electricity, wood is more expensive on a net usable heat basis, but the high capital cost of stoves for these fuels prevents many households from switching. Moreover, these fuels are often only available at much higher parallel market prices, which result in wood being the less expensive choice. There is little prospect for substitution of coal, solar cookers, or biogas digesters.

TI AGRICULTURES SHARE IN THE EMISSION OF TRACE GASES AFFECTING THE CLIMATE

SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION

AB This paper discusses agriculture's share in the world-wide emissions of climate-affecting gases and in the global warming potential (GWP). Proposals also are presented to reduce these emissions adequately, using a cause-oriented approach.
   Largely due to the fertilization and cultivation of agriculture as well as the burning of biomass, agriculture has a very high share in the anthropogenic emissions of NH3, N2O , CH4 and CO at >95%, 81%, 70% and 52%, respectively, while its share in the NO(x) and CO2, emissions is relatively small at 35% and 21%. The GWP of agriculture, based on annually 16.1 x 10(9) tons of CO2, approaches 63% of the GWP of the energy sector or 80% of the GWP of its CO2 emissions. At 34% and 32%, respectively, the main originators in the GWP of agriculture would seem to be CO2 (changing land use) and CH4 (animal husbandry/rice cropping/biomass burning) followed at 15% by NO2 (technical and biological N fixation/(cultivation and recultivation/biomass burning) and 10% and 9% by CO and NO(x). The GWP of 3 German dairy cows corresponds with 13.2 tonnes CO2 per year the GWP of two average German automobiles. However, the ozone-destroying effect of N2O and the climate-relevant effects of NH3 are not yet included here.
   As with the therapy for other 'modern' boundary-crossing environmental damages, such as acidification or eutrophication, global climate change therapy likewise needs a therapy for the respective effects of reactive compounds of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur also emitted by agriculture: Proposals for reducing these emissions within the agricultural sector include need-oriented plant, animal and human nutrition, more efficient external and internal nutrient recycling, the cessation of further clearing by burning, along with intensified afforestation mainly in the tropics, targeted measures to reduce nutrient losses/emissions, and measures for more efficient use of nutrients in plant, animal and human nutrition. These measures would at best result in reduced pollution of the global environment but not put it to an end. Decisive, therefore, is both the tolerable extent of mankind and its long-term sustainable way of life.

AB In recent years conservationists have realized that the maintenance of protected areas is closely linked to rural development. As part of their efforts to improve local people's standards of living, they have sought the advice of researchers who work in communities, especially those that border on nature reserves. Ethnobotanists, who are turning their attention to the cultural and ecological crises confronting the regions in which they work, are natural allies in this venture. The joint efforts of conservationists and ethnobotanists are being supported by non-profit organizations, intergovernnental agencies and research institutes. The search for new drugs and other natural products from plants is an important element in this collaboration, but it cannot be divorced from the broader objective of promoting the survival of biological and cultural diversity. Conservationists will support biodiversity prospecting and related efforts only if there is a clear benefit for local communities and protected areas. An example of the concrete actions being taken by conservation agencies is the People and Plants Initiative, a joint effort of the World Wide Fund for Nature, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The main objective is to support the work of ethnobotanists in developing countries in studies of sustainable plant use and application of their work to conservation and community development. The initiative provides training workshops and relevant literature; coordinators work in collaboration with local people to create inventories of useful plants and appraise the impact of harvesting specific plant resources in and around protected areas. Phytochemical screening of medicinal plants and preparation of extracts are carried out as part of some projects.

AB Severity of powdery mildew was assessed on seven cultivars and lines of Kentucky bluegrass propagated by seed and tissue culture. Tissue culture plants were started from embryo axes cultured on Murashige and Skoog medium containing different concentrations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), and incubated (1 to 4 weeks) or not incubated in the dark prior to transfer to a lighted culture room. There were significant differences in disease severity (DS) among seed propagated and tissue culture regenerated plants. DS ranged from highly susceptible (100% of leaf covered by mildew) (DS = 9) to resistant (DS = 3.0). In some tissue culture regenerants the disease severity was significantly affected by the tissue culture process. Ten clones expressing resistance were selected, and plants propagated vegetatively. In six clones, disease resistance was sustainable in subsequent vegetatively propagated plants, while resistance was lost in four of the selected clones. Results are discussed with a view to using tissue culture to produce Kentucky bluegrass genotypes with resistance to powedery mildew.

AB The word adaptation and its derivatives are reviewed as well as the characteristics of environmental marginality. Plant traits are discussed in the light of their adaptive significance, specially pointing at their phenotypic expression under stress. Variation in marginal plant populations is discussed on the basis of accumulated knowledge on quantitative traits and isozymes. The common opinion that marginal populations are genetically depauperated is questioned on the basis of observations that show high degrees of environmental heterogeneity. This in turn would cause a disruptive mode of natural selection close to the species margin. Species' modes of adaptation and mating systems are briefly discussed and finally natural selection for stability is suggested to be of significance in marginal areas, a fact that should be duly recognized in modern plant breeding programmes aiming at maximum stability (sustainability) but not necessarily maximum yield.

AB Breeding has been very successful in generating cultivars that in favorable environments, and together with large use of fertilizer and chemical control of weeds, pest and diseases, have increased agricultural production several fold. Today the environmental impact of high input agriculture in more favorable environments causes growing concern. By contrast, the impact of breeding in marginal environments has been elusive. The paper discusses evidence showing that the use of breeding principles developed for, and successfully applied, in favorable environments may be the main reason for the lack of breeding progress in marginal environments. Very little breeding work has actually been done in marginal environments, although the theory of correlated responses to selection indicates that selection conducted in good environments or in well-managed experiment stations is not expected to be very efficient when genotype by environment interactions of a cross-over type exist. The assumptions that heritability is higher under good conditions and that there is a carry-over effect of high yield potential are not supported by experimental evidence. If the target environment is below the cross-over point, selection has to be conducted for specific adaptation to that environment. The concept of wide adaptation has more a geographical than an environmental meaning, and it reduces genetic diversity and increases genetic vulnerability. Eventually the issue of genetic heterogeneity versus genetic uniformity is discussed in relation to specific adaptation to marginal environments.

AB Dinitrogen fixation and legume productivity are greatly influenced through the interactions of legume host, Rhizobium, and the above- and below-ground environment. The benefits of improving legume N-2 fixation include reduced reliance on soil N, leading to more sustainable agricultural systems and reduced requirements for fertilizer N, enhanced residual benefits to subsequent crops, and increased legume crop yields. Most of the gains in N-2 fixation to date have been derived from management of legume cropping systems and through inoculation of legume seed with competitive and symbiotically effective rhizobia. Further gains are possible by developing plant cultivars with tolerance to soil abiotic factors, increased plant yield, and a broader and more effective matching of plant host and rhizobia. Techniques for screening material for superior N-2 fixation and examples of programs to increase fixed N, with attention to the major abiotic stresses, are discussed.

TI THE ENVIRONMENTALLY-SOUND MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS
SO FERTILIZER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Freshwater eutrophication is often accelerated by increased phosphorus (P) inputs, a greater share of which now come from agricultural nonpoint sources than two decades ago.  Maintenance of soil P at levels sufficient for crop needs is an essential part of sustainable agriculture.  However, in areas of intensive crop and livestock production in Europe and the U.S.A., P has accumulated in soils to levels that are a long-term eutrophication rather than agronomic concern.  Also, changes in land management in Europe and the U.S.A. have increased the potential for P loss in surface runoff and drainage.  There is, thus, a need for information on how these factors influence the loss of P in agricultural runoff.  The processes controlling the build-up of P in soil, its transport in surface and subsurface drainage in dissolved and particulate forms, and their biological availability in freshwater systems, are discussed in terms of environmentally sound P management.  Such management will involve identifying P sources within watersheds; targeting cost-effective remedial measures to minimize P losses; and accounting for different water quality objectives within watersheds.  The means by which this can be achieved are identified and include developing soil tests to determine the relative potential for P enrichment of agricultural runoff to occur; establishing threshold soil P levels which are of environmental concern; finding alternative uses for animal manures to decrease land area limitations for application; and adopting management systems integrating measures to reduce P sources as well as runoff and erosion potential.

DT Article
DE FERTILIZER EFFICIENCY; PARTIALLY ACIDULATED PHOSPHATE ROCKS; PERMANENT
   PASTURES; PHOSPHATE ROCK
AB Phosphate rocks partially acidulated either with H3PO4 or H2SO4 were compared against SSP or TSP as phosphate fertilizers for permanent pasture. Eleven field trials were conducted over periods of up to 6 yrs. Fertilizers were surface applied annually. Initial soil pHw values ranged from 5.5-6.3 and Soil P retention from 25% to 97%. The PRs used for partial acidulation were unground or ground North Carolina PR, ground Khouribga PR, and a blend of ground PRs of North Carolina, Arad and Khouribga PRs. From the DM yields, fertilizer substitution values were calculated: fertilizer substitution value was the ratio of total P applied as superphosphate to total P as PAPR required to produce the same DM yield.
   Rates of dissolution of the PR component of PAPRs were also determined in soils collected from two trials.
   Agronomic results demonstrated that 30% acidulated phosphoric PAPRs (about 50% of total P as water-soluble P) were as effective as TSP, when the PR acidulated was from unground North Carolina PR. Results from one field trial indicated that when PAPR was from ground North Carolina PR, 20% acidulated product (water-soluble P 30-40% of total P) was equally effective as TSR Replacement of ground North Carolina PR by a less reactive Khouribga PR did not appear to decrease the yield. Results indicated that per unit P released into soil solution, PAPRs were more efficient fertilizers than TSP. With annual applications, fertilizer substitution value of PAPR 30% tended to increase with time.
   Sulphuric PAPRs prepared from North Carolina PR were generally inferior to phosphoric PAPRs containing similar amounts of water-soluble P. This was attributed to the presence of CaSO4 coatings.

AB 100 years ago, Rudolf Diesel suspected that ''petroleum and these coal tar products'' would become scarce in time; the first oil crisis in 1973 sparked off a world-wide search for alternative fuels.  Biological fuels made from renewable resources, such as vegetable oils and their esters, are most promising as self-igniting fuel for diesel motors.  The principal suitability of almost all vegetable oils and fats, the positive effect with respect to a save in CO2 and to better emissions, and a higher suitability of transesterified oils i.e. biodiesel as super diesel are explained.  Questions of production and quality are discussed on the example of the CD process which has been developed in Leer, and there are reports on methods of analysis and results of application.  The connection between environment and agriculture, politics and the provision of energy for the future is clarified, an assessment of the position of oilseeds in the comparison of vegetable sources of energy is made, and the development whose contours are being formed at this moment in Europe - and throughout the world in future - of increasing utilization of biomass for energy and technical sectors is discussed.  An important point is the far-sighted treatment of the desired sustainable development with regard to taxes, to which a clear reply is given.

AB Effects of chitosan and Aspergillus flavus to enhance elicitation of phenolic compounds in viable peanut seeds were conducted at two water activity levels. In vitro effects of phenolic acids on A. flavus growth and aflatoxin B-1 production were also studied. Chitosan enhanced elicitation of free phenolic compounds (FPC) at Aw. 85 and .95 levels. A. flavus treatment initially decreased and subsequently increased FPC content, but bound phenolic compounds (BPC) decreased during incubation. Chitosan + A. flavus treatments caused an increase in FPC that reached a plateau between 24-48 h at Aw .85 while BPC levels increased over the same time period at both Aw levels. The major free and bound phenolic acids detected were p-coumaric and ferulic acids and an unknown phenol that eluted at a retention time of 22 min. Generally, chitosan treatment significantly enhanced elicitation of free ferulic and p-coumaric acids and bound p-coumaric acid at Aw .95. Free unknown phenolic and bound ferulic acids at Aw .85 were enhanced by chitosan. A. flavus treatment caused significant induction of bound p-coumaric and ferulic acids and free unknown phenol at Aw .85. Chitosan + A. flavus treatment measure to reduce or eliminate pre-harvest contamination by A. flavus and aflatoxins contributes to sustainable agriculture, especially to developing countries.
   The enhanced elicitation of preformed phenolic compounds by chitosan may provide seed tissues an additive or synergistic effect in controlling aflatoxin-producing fungi and preventing aflatoxin contamination. Further, such investigation will help elucidate the biochemical basis of elicitor-host interaction that contribute to defensive responses of host tissues. Identification of biochemical factors in induced resistance involves a refinement in the separation and identification of induced phenolic compounds. Methodologies such as spectrophotometric assay or reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) may be used to evaluate phenolic compound induction by these elicitors. Tn addition, these compounds can be tested on their effects on A. flavus mycelial growth and subsequent aflatoxin production in vitro.
   Hence, a study on the possible role of phenols on the natural resistance of peanuts to A. flavus invasion was conducted with the following objectives: 1) to quantitate changes in free and bound phenolic compounds influenced by chitosan, A. flavus, and water activity (Aw) levels by Folin-Ciocalteu assay; 2) to separate, identify, and quantitate free and bound phenolic acids influenced by elicitors and Aw levels; and 3) to determine the effects of phenolic acids in liquid cultures at different concentrations on mycelial growth and aflatoxin B-1 production by A. flavus.

TI FORESTRY IN BRITISH-COLUMBIA - A STUDY OF ENVIRONMENTAL-ISSUES
SO FORESTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper is an account of a tour of British Columbia from January to March 1993, hosted by logging companies, the Ministry of Forests and representatives of the environmental movement. Overall 85 per cent of BC's forests are under public ownership although the forest is largely managed by logging companies under various forms of long-term tenure. The Ministry of Forests has a remit to regulate the industry, approve sustainable Annual Allowable Cuts and account for environmental values. A significant body of public opinion believes that the Ministry falls far short of its stated objectives.
   Forests were visited on Vancouver Island and in the southern and central interior. The Ministry is promoting an image of integrated resource use but I found little evidence of this. Allowable Cuts are not locally sustainable and integrated resource planning is either poor or non-existent, with little effort being made to balance objectives. Interest groups are participating in the Commission on Resources and the Environment (CORE) process that is seen by many as the last hope for a peaceful settlement of conflicts. A recent Government announcement allowing all but 33 per cent of one of the last undisturbed watersheds on Vancouver Island to be logged could easily end CORE's chances of a successful conclusion.

TI FOREST RESEARCH PRIORITIES IN CANADA, 1993 - AN OVERVIEW FOR THE
   CANADIAN-COUNCIL-OF-FOREST-MINISTERS
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB The Forestry Research Advisory Council of Canada in cooperation with provincial and territorial forest research advisory committees has prepared this fifth annual review of forest research priorities for the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers.
   The top five priorities from each committee were scored from 5 points for highest priority down to 1 point for lowest. The resulting 11 research topics in descending order of priority are: 1.  Integrated forest landscape management systems and decision support. 2.  Inventory, growth and yield, ecological site classification. 3.  F-cosystem functioning, soil and biodiversity conservation. 4.  Pest and weed management and alternatives to chemicals. 5.  Ecological effects of natural and human-caused disturbances. 6.  Lower-cost silviculture and harvesting, natural regeneration. 7.  Forest fire management and control. 8.  Socio-economic knowledge and resolution of resource use conflicts. 9.  Mixedwood management. 10. Incentives for private investment. 11. Planting stock quality and tree improvement.
   Eight issues likely to affect future research priorities were identified by more than one respondent, as follows: 1.  Global trade, competition, and world public opinion. 2.  Concern and input about sustainable forestry and the environment. 3.  Public participation. 4.  New policies on forestry, tenure, sales, and forest protection. 5.  Lack of long-term research funding, communication, and coordination. 6.  Shortage of fiber, long-term viability of the industry. 7.  Land claims and forestry on aboriginal lands. 8.  Increasing need for information at all levels.
   Other concerns include climate change, government debt, population growth and shifts, and protected and old-growth forests.
   Discussion of these priorities and issues at a meeting of FRACC and representatives from the provincial and territorial committees produced some general conclusions, as outlined below.
   To resolve resource use conflicts and to manage forests sustainably for all benefits, managers need better information that only research can provide. The goal is management systems that produce a blend of outputs from the forest and maintain the diversity and mosaic structure of natural forest ecosystems. This kind of forestry will meet the desires of most Canadians and go far to restore public confidence in forest management.
   In short, research must provide additional knowledge to enable forest managers to: Sustain the diversity and resilience of the forest ecosystems. Improve forest health and resistance to pests. Increase forest productivity for all values. Reduce forest management and fire protection costs. Access all available knowledge and data in making decisions. Determine the socio-economic value of Canadian forests. Improve profits and competitiveness in the forest industry.
   Many feel that forestry research in Canada is quite well focused on these questions, but more effort is required to ensure sufficient long-term funding and to improve local application of research results.
   The usefulness of this annual survey of research priorities was reviewed. It was concluded that the annual meeting of FRACC with representatives of provincial and territorial research advisory committees and the annual presentation to CCFM are very useful. However, a survey of priorities every year is, in the light of experience, unnecessary. A biennial review of priorities is recommended, with presentation to CCFM and subsequent publication. In the alternate years, a work shop of FRACC and provincial and territorial committee representatives is suggested, which would examine a major research topic in depth and present the results and conclusions to CCFM. A report could be published if appropriate.

LA English
DT Article
DE ISOBARIC REACTOR; ENERGY FLOWS; FUSION-FISSION HYBRID
ID TRANSPORT
AB The dominant mechanisms of energy flow in a novel magnetic confinement device have been examined. The plasma is contained in the space between two concentric cylinders. There is uniformity in the direction parallel to the curved surfaces of the cylinders, i.e., the toroidal direction, and the confining magnetic field is purely toroidal. The plasma has a rectangular cross section, bounded by a planar electrode at one end and a thermionic emitter at the other, and cylindrical walls inside and outside. There is a modest pressure gradient, i.e., NT similar or equal to constant. The temperature is high in the core of the plasma, where fusion occurs, but falls to low values near the walls and end-plates. It is hoped that the quasi-isobaric character will eliminate or reduce serious instabilities and that plasma behavior will be near classical. The high-N, low-T periphery should reduce damage to the walls from energetic plasma partides. The contributions of alpha-particle slowing down, electron cyclotron radiation transport, atomic processes, bremsstrahlung, conduction, convection, and heat exchange between electrons and ions to the energy balance in the plasma have been evaluated. Radiofrequency heating using waves in the lower hybrid range can balance the differential energy equations for electrons and ions throughout the plasma. For a device producing 125 MW effusion power, there is a class of magnetohydrodynamic equilibria that is energetically sustainable, with Q(dt) similar or equal to: 0.3. The inner and outer radii and height of the reactor are 31.4, 38.7, and 7.3 m, respectively. A high magnetic field is required, in the range of 20 to 40 T. The temperature T rises from 200 eV near the walls to 2.7 keV in the fusion core, where N-c similar or equal to 1.5 x 10(14) cm(-3). The results obtained here are significantly different from those obtained in an earlier study that assumed a slab geometry. This device may be acceptable as the fusion driver of a fusion-fission hybrid reactor. Major technological developments are necessary before such a device can become viable, but there are also some advantages relative to a tokamak reactor.

DT Article
DE LOCAL BREED; SELECTION SCHEME; RISK; HERITAGE COMPONENTS; SUSTAINABILITY
AB We have identified local animal breeds which fall between the main improved breeds and rarer vanishing breeds. This subject requires a particular approach. These breeds are at a sort of crossroads for many interests and are of importance in regional agricultural systems to whose identity they contribute. The first step is to understand the technical and social practices used by farmers to manage their flocks and herds and the local breed (selection criteria, risk management). The concepts of 'economic conventions' (how 2 men conduct their dealings in a situation of uncertainty) provide a model for analysing the transition between incompatible qualification systems of breeding animals: pastoral Practices are seen as a 'domestic' universe and a breeding scheme as an 'industrial' one. To change the breed management system it is necessary to master uncertainties which appear. Based on work in Corsica we established a model for transition stages. 'Civic' elements are useful to include the heritage components in an organisational process of actor-groups as well as a genetic gain process. In this way, management of local breeds contributes to sustainable regional development.

AB More than five hundred environmental nongovernmental organizations, most of them less than a decade old, operate in Latin America. Their popularity as vehicles of social change, the inability of governments to address environmental problems, new sources of international funding, and the idea of sustainable development have contributed to the proliferation of these organizations. Merits and limitations of this movement are assessed by case studies from Mexico and Venezuela. Conservation strategies have shifted from protectionist models to the politically popular notion of sustainable development.

TI PRESERVATION OF COMMON LAND VERSUS TAKING INTO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP -
   REFLECTIONS ON THE CHANGE OF LAND LAWS FROM AN EXOLOGISTS POINT-OF-VIEW
   - A CASE-STUDY OF THE MOGOD MOUNTAINS IN NORTHERN TUNISIA
SO GEOGRAPHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
LA German
DT Article
AB Long-term floristic and geoecologic analyses prove that the vegetation cover as well as the natural balance in the Mogod Mountains were considerably spoiled during the last decade by the excessive exploitation of natural resources. The extent of the damage depends on the distance to the settlements and on the kind and intensity of landuse. Regions with a very high degreee of exploitation (by excessive grazing, firewood and charcoal production) are found mostly on common land used as pasture ground.
   Genealogical enquiries have led to the conclusion that on the one hand the very complicated land laws often cause considerable problems during the redevelopment - Henchir Skhira being an example for this. On the other hand it has become obvious that no sastifying solution of the ecological problems can be achieved by way of a merely partial consolidation.
   As a matter of fact the necessary social and administrative conditions for a complete consolidation do not yet exist. Therefore the traditional collective landownership should be preserved. Instead of changing the land laws, rights for the use of land should be granted to individuals. Additionally, voluntary changes in the social structure (e.g.group dynamic processes) should be induced. Although models for an ecologically sustainable landuse already exist, it is also of great importance to revive the traditional ability of the local inhabitants to adapt to the different potentials of landuse.

DT Article
AB Since the joint announcement from the Japanese and Australian governments in 1987 of their intention to establish a putative new form of urban development in Australia, the multifunction polls, a major debate has taken place over preferred forms of future cities and the role of international investment. This article charts the development of this debate, in particular examining the controversial decision to locate the MFP in what its critics regard as a polluted swamp in the north of Adelaide.

TI AIRBORNE GEOPHYSICS - APPLICATION TO A GROUNDWATER STUDY IN BOTSWANA
SO GROUND WATER
LA English
DT Article
AB A ground-water study carried out in the Serowe area of eastern Botswana between 1985-1988 has provided the opportunity to evaluate the role of a multiparameter low-level airborne geophysical survey in a hydrogeological investigation. The survey included magnetic, VLF (very low frequency), and coaxial EM (electromagnetic) measurements. In total, 7,500 line kilometers were flown over an area of 3,300 km2 with a nominal ground clearance of 20 m and a line spacing of 400 M.
   The main aquifer, the Ntane Sandstone Formation (Karoo age), is confined between mudstones below and basalt above, and is broken into a series of graben and horst structures by numerous E-W striking faults. All bedrock, however, is completely masked by a 20-60 m thick overburden of sands, calcretes, silcretes, and sandstones known collectively as the Kalahari beds.
   Airborne magnetic and VLF geophysical surveys have been used to penetrate this masking cover. Images and stacked profiles obtained from the survey revealed structural and geological features of major hydrogeological significance. This provided the information necessary for the formulation of a conceptual model.
   The results helped guide the subsequent exploration drilling program in an efficient and effective manner, cutting down the need for extensive ground surveys. The investigation confirmed the availability of a 35,000 m3/day resource, sustainable for a 25-year period. Highest yields were obtained from fracture zones associated with VLF anomalies. Potential wellfields were identified in confined sections of the aquifer, with production boreholes to be sited, where possible, on fractures associated with VLF anomalies.

TI CONSERVATION BY NATIVE PEOPLES - PREY CHOICE IN A DEPLETED HABITAT
SO HUMAN NATURE-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY BIOSOCIAL PERSPECTIVE
LA English
DT Article
DE SUBSISTENCE HUNTING; CONSERVATION; FORAGING THEORY; AMAZONIA; PERU; PREY
   CHOICE
ID GROUP SELECTION; ECOLOGY
AB Native peoples have often been portrayed as natural conservationists, living a ''balanced'' existence with nature. it is argued that this perspective is a result of an imprecise operational definition of conservation. Conservation is defined here in contrast to the predictions of foraging theory, which assumes that foragers will behave to maximize their short-term harvesting rate. A behavior is deemed conservation when a short-term cost is paid by the resource harvester in exchange for long-term benefits in the form of sustainable harvests. An example of the usefulness of such an operational definition is presented using data on patch and prey choice decisions of a group of subsistence hunters, the Piro of Amazonian Peru. Results indicate that the area around the Piro village is depleted of prey, and that hunters allocate more time to patches where return rates are highest. This response is consistent with both a conservation strategy and foraging theory. Contrary to the expectation of the conservation strategy, however, hunters do not restrain from pursing opportunistically encountered prey in the depleted areas. The implications for conservation policy are briefly discussed.

TI FROM OPPORTUNISM TO NASCENT CONSERVATION - THE CASE OF THE SIONA-SECOYA
SO HUMAN NATURE-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY BIOSOCIAL PERSPECTIVE
LA English
DT Article
DE AMAZON; HUNTING; CONSERVATION; ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; NUTRITION; TOURISM
AB Siona-Secoya hunters of the northwest Amazon strive to maximize short-term yields to provision their households with meat. The observed patterns of hunting more closely resemble the predictions of optimal foraging theory (OFT) than they do a conservation ethic. In the past the Siona-Secoya worried little about conservation because they believed that good shamans attracted abundant game. When hunting was poor, shamans performed yage' ceremonies and appealed to supernatural game-keepers for the release of more animals from the underworld. The sustainability of Siona-Secoya hunting was aided by factors such as low human population density, dispersed settlements within large hunting territories, settlement movement, and limited hunting technology. Today, increasing involvement in the national economy is leading the Siona-Secoya to invest more time in agriculture and wage labor, and less in traditional foraging activities. Colonization, deforestation, and industrial pollution now pose the greatest threats to wildlife in eastern Ecuador. Because of these changes, the Siona-Secoya are becoming interested in environmental protection and conservation. Several of their efforts to protect forest resources and mitigate pollution are discussed and evaluated.

AB Urban structures are the focal point both of environmental problems and potential solutions to the ecological crisis. The major social and ecological problems are located in the big cities of the world, and the urbanization process is still accelerating. The highly industrialized nations have the possibility and the responsibility to change the conventional urban planning concepts into Sustainable Urban Management. We discuss existing computer-supported methodologies as approaches to Sustainable Urban Management. However, the opportunities Information Technology (IT) offers in managing complex dynamical systems such as evolving cities can only lead to solutions if potential risks of the technology are considered at the same time.

AB The emerging paradigm for sustainable development of the Earth's resources demands an eco-systems approach. This approach requires that the base of data for sustainable resource decision making has the characteristics of being multi-sectoral, spatial, and diversified. The scientific assessment of such massive data assemblies and the subsequent decision making process must have the technological tools to integrate, abstract and summarize the information. The problems are particularly acute in Developing Countries. National decision makers are faced with enormous quantities of ''environmental'' data, much of it of poor or unknown quality, as well as yawning data gaps. Modern information systems technology provides a significant opportunity to address the information management issues of developing countries, but the transfer of this technology presents a number of challenges, including, the management of very large spatial databases, harmonization of disparate information of variable quality, integration of data from different environmental and socioeconomic sectors, dealing with and uncertainty, and abstraction and summarization in a manner which facilitates decision making.

AB A gap exists between the needs of today's workforce and the output provided by the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry. To minimize this gap, sustainable development is defined as the process in which ICT solutions can continue to provide increasing business benefits within reasonable economic, organizational, and schedule limits. This process is often difficult to achieve for organizations because the needs of the workforce are not positioned as driving forces that shape technology solutions and change is not managed as a fundamental component of technology development. This paper presents Enterprise Information Architecture (ELA) as a business-driven framework to assist in the definition, design, and implementation of ICT solutions that link an organization's strategic, organizational, and business process components. These characteristics of an EIA are presented as fundamental components of sustainable development for an organization.

ICT can help in diagnosing the 'urban malaise' and developing solutions. ICT 'building blocks' are available, such as: TLC infrastructures, ICT services, intelligent buildings, process control. The review of ICT potentiality refers to: i) realize a better liveable city scenario (agora city), ii) harmonize the attraction from outer globalization and the local diversity assets, and iii) contribute for a sustainable city.

AB The environment of health care delivery is changing dramatically, matched by design trends in the organizations that are responsible for care delivery, whether at the hospital or the national level. However, the emerging goals of these organizations have a certain amount of uniformity independent of background, cultural assumptions or organizational size: they are all committed to the delivery of services that maximize satisfaction of system beneficiaries at a minimum of expense. Achievement of these goals will in part require the development of a management and delivery coordination infrastructure that links the key resource utilizers and administrative operators at the point of production. Merged computer and telecommunications systems connecting at user interface nodes called workstations represent a critical enabling technology for meeting the organizational goals described above. Future delivery systems will need to provide compassionate care, retaining the most highly regarded traditions of medical practice without ignoring considerations of cost, clinical outcome and financial sustainability. This paper describes some of the limitations of the current delivery system, and attempts to identify key design concepts and paradigms that might serve to guide future system development.

DT Article
AB As a result of a massive public health system and state-of-the-art tertiary medical care services, Cuba's health profile now indicates a high incidence of chronic noncommunicable diseases; Cuban health authorities concluded that this required a community-based primary care solution.  In the early 1980s the Ministry of Health (MINSAP) implemented a national family medicine program with the goal of providing one ''Medico de la Familia'' (family physician) for every 700 persons.  To attain and ensure the sustainability of this primary care model, MINSAP reformed the medical education curriculum. The reform strategies created a primary care ''specialty'' and provided a broad-based interdisciplinary approach to primary care training. The reforms place primary care in a prominent position within the predoctoral medical education curriculum.   Cuba's approach is an innovation for a country that attained impressive medical advances through a specialized high-technology medical system.

AB There has been an active political and academic debate about the meaning of sustainable development, which has led to a growing number of definitions and policy paradigms. This paper explores the traditional, economic definition of sustainable development along with a multiobjective framework for temporal decision-making. The fields of operations research and ecology are used to provide a perspective on issues of intergenerational equity and ecological integrity as well as economic eaciency. A simple, dynamic renewable resource allocation model isused to look at how resource management objectives and decisions change under varying definitions and problem scope. Impacts from temporal manipulation of how decisions are made, using amultiobjective approach, have suggested adjustments to decision-time steps according to initial conditions and time-horizon. Potential use of this form of policy alternative includes the regulation of many open access resources, including water resources.

DE sustainable development; indicators
AB Sustainable development, as proposed by the Brundtland Report, requires carefully managed change to improve environmental and economic conditions as well as the quality of life for all people. Some of the problems involved in this demanding challenge faced by individuals, local communities, nations and the international community are discussed. In particular, nine indicators of sustainable development - gleaned from economic, socioeconomic and environmental studies - are critically reviewed. It is argued that a programme of detailed theoretical and empirical research is needed to develop a series of measures or indicators of sustainable development for strategic decision making and detailed environmental management.

TI Pollution prevention for sustainable development: the land-use question
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE pollution prevention; sustainable development; land-use planning
AB The central argument of the paper is that effective pollution prevention can be achieved only by integrated land-use planning which offers the broad framework for co-ordinating technological and non-technological means to achieve sustainable development. The paper first reviews the role of land-use in preventing or contributing to pollution over time, focusing especially on contemporary efforts to promote environmental protection through land-use planning and management. The relationship between land-use, pollution and sustainable development is analysed by examining the most important types of land-use-related problems, discussing their causes and identifying a number of land-use-related constraints to sustainable development. Finally, a land-use planning and policy framework approach to pollution prevention for sustainable development is outlined which emphasizes the need for integrated analysis of pollution problems and adoption of comprehensive approaches to their solution. Scientific, spatial, temporal and policy issues are addressed in the context of the proposed approach.

AB Despite a growing interest by academics and policy makers in sustainable development, there have been relatively few attempts to examine the economic development implications of adopting such policies. This is especially true at the local level, where very few studies have been undertaken. This paper attempts to remedy this situation through an investigation of strategies introduced by local authorities in the United Kingdom. Existing policies are examined and suggestions made for future policy developments.

   ANALYSIS
AB Industrial survival in a hyper-competitive global market-place increasingly will depend upon development of a sustainable competitive advantage. A competitive advantage, in turn, increasingly will require knowledge-intensive high-value-added content in each operating system. The degree of value-added is measurable in terms of various forms of 'productivity' (performance/cost), but conventional measures of productivity are limited in their usefulness. Output divided by labour, or output divided by labour plus capital, do not adequately assess the degree of knowledge-intensive value-added content of an operation. More sophisticated forms of productivity measurement have been developed which have been demonstrated to have a high correlation with success. Much improved strategic allocation of always limited resources can result.

AB The central assumption underlying Agenda 21 (adopted at the UN Conference on Environment and Development) is that sustainable development is divisible, and that programmes can appropriately be devised for the sustainability of component parts - sectors, resource categories and levels of society.  The author addresses two key concepts - ''sustainable livelihoods'' and ''environmentally sound technology'' - and demonstrates the pitfalls in a disaggregated approach to operationalizing sustainability, both technical and in terms of equity.  Stressing the fundamental need to maintain the resilience of ecological and economic systems over time, he highlights the importance of incentives, the level of activity and the distribution of income for the achievement and maintenance of that resilience.

TI THE ENVIRONMENT AS RADICAL POLITICS - CAN THIRD-WORLD EDUCATION RISE TO
   THE CHALLENGE
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The pattern of industrial development which has been adopted globally in the last two centuries by both capitalist and socialist economies has caused unprecedented damage to the physical and ecological health of our planet. This paper argues that any challenges to these systems, including educational challenges, will involve political understanding and activism. It examines the potential of educational structures in Third World regions, using the Caribbean as the main example, for implementing eco-political education. This would involve encouraging students to use ecological and social justice criteria for comparing consumerist with sustainable development approaches to rethinking and refashioning the international economy, particularly the Third World share of it. It would involve teachers and students exploring how political and economic structures could be challenged and altered to obtain a fairer quality of life for the majorities now living in poverty and an adjustment of the opulent and wasteful lifestyles of affluent minorities primarily responsible for environmental degradation. Finally, those in eco-political education would work to achieve such goals within broad movements and pressure groups in rich and poor countries.

TI BIOLOGICAL DYNAMIC FARMING - AN OCCULT FORM OF ALTERNATIVE AGRICULTURE
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE BIODYNAMIC COMPOUNDS; ALTERNATIVE AGRICULTURE; FOOD TEST; SPIRITUALISTIC
   PURPOSE
AB An analysis of the theory of biodynamic farming is presented. The founder of biological dynamic agriculture, the Austrian Rudolf Steiner, Ph.D., (1861-1925), introduced methods of preparation and use of eight compounds forming the nucleus of his agricultural theory. His instructions were based on insights and inner visions from spiritualistic exercises and not on agricultural experiments. His purpose was to show mankind a form of agriculture that enables not only the production of healthy foods but also the achievement of harmonious interactions in agriculture and a spiritual development of mankind through ''cosmic forces'' captured in the foods. However, many of his statements are not provable simply because scientifically clear hypotheses cannot be made as his descriptions were unclear and not stringent. Those predictions that can, be tested scientifically have been found to be incorrect. It was concluded that Steiner's instructions are occult and dogmatic and cannot contribute to the development of alternative or sustainable agriculture.

TI AGRICULTURAL POLICIES AND PERFORMANCE IN THE GAMBIA
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN AND AFRICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper examines the performance of Gambian agriculture in relation to the past and present government policies that have been implemented for the development of the sector.
   Gambian agriculture is still largely based on the traditional system of shifting cultivation using very small independent farming units. Yields are generally low. Post-independence agricultural policy focused on institution building and hence encouraged the creation of agricultural institutions, kept producer prices low and highly subsidized agricultural inputs.
   Gambian agriculture has been unable to respond greatly to these inducements and other initiatives as yields remain practically stagnant and production revolves around a declining trend. The faulty implementation of subsidized credit programme resulted in regressive income transfer to a small group of influential Gambians who defaulted on large loans. The result was a weakening of the financial system and the collapse of development banks.
   There was a policy turn-around during the economic recovery programme and the subsequent programme for sustained development. Agricultural input subsidies are being progressively removed to assure long term policy sustainability though producer prices are still lower than the free market levels.
   Agricultural employment policy focuses on self-employment and the development of informal sector employment. As the size of formal agriculture is small, the wage policy had no immediate relevance and is under consideration for removal.

TI CHALLENGES TO EVALUATION IN RURAL COALITIONS
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY-DEVELOPMENT; HEALTH PROMOTION; EMPOWERMENT; PARTICIPATION
AB This article will explore methodological and practical evaluation issues when conducting formative assessments in predominantly rural African-American communities. An overview of the nature of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs (ATOD) in rural areas is presented. Attention is given to a community organization and development (COD) approach to coalition formation for community-based health promotion programming. Principles based on Freire's (1989) conceptualization of community empowerment as a process of social transformation at the community level are noted. The application and dynamics of third-party evaluation in rural settings to support coalition maintenance and sustainability for ATOD are discussed. The establishment and role of an Evaluation Planning Team (EPT) are also noted. Based on programmatic and process evaluations of 35 coalitions organized between 1989 and 1993 in rural counties within the state of Georgia, the lessons learned through an action-oriented evaluation methodology are detailed. This evaluation approach encourages coalition members to maintain a major role in the design, execution, and interpretation of all assessment activities.

TI ENVIRONMENTALLY ORIENTED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT - VARIOUS APPROACHES TO
   SUCCESS
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
AB Due to increasing environmental awareness, it is becoming more and more important to develop products less damaging to the environment.  There are various approaches to the development of environmentally oriented products, all of which can produce good results.  However, when these various approaches are studied, none seems to provide the complete answer.  Their success depends on the situation in which they are applied.  It is concluded that, in order to obtain environmentally improved products, all the various approaches must be involved in the design process.  Following the Dutch National Environmental Policy Plan, which is based on a sustainable development, we have to choose for higher quality and innovation first.  Next, the least input of resources can be attained by closing the material cycle; reduction and selectivity of material use; preference for renewable and recycled material; saving of energy as much as possible.  Finally, minimization of hazardous waste, especially of toxic emissions, has to be strived for.

TI EDUCATION OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERS
SO JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB In this report, a joint IAHR and UNESCO panel addresses the current developments in hydraulic engineering and their implications for the education of hydraulic engineers. The framework of underlying basic sciences, geosciences and engineering sciences and the large variety of engineering subjects involved must be seen in the broader context of the natural and social environment. In addition to its classical tasks, hydraulic engineering has evolved to deal with water quality, environmental issues and ecology, and it is further broadened by the new challenges posed by the need for sustainable development and by the threat of global changes. New developments in science and technology and computer sciences must be reflected both in contents and methods of teaching. Education must also provide engineering skills and procedures as well as professional preparation including the ability to work in interdisciplinary teams. In view of these developments, continuing education will have a major role to play, and large-scale systems and international aspects will be of increasing importance. These developments call for suitable IAHR activities.

DT Article
AB This paper examines an information strategy for Africa; it reinforces the significant role information services play in securing sustainable development in the African Continent.  The importance of having a coherent and systematic information strategy as a tool for donor agencies to respond to the information and sectoral needs of developing countries is discussed by reviewing IDRC's five-year experience with information activities in Africa and its strategic approach.  The paper gives a brief account of the history of the development of an information strategy for Africa, a consultative process which allowed the Africans themselves to assess their information problems and prioritise their needs.  It then reviews the results of IDRC's post-strategy project activities in Africa and the impact of the strategy on these activities.

TI SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR PROJECT-MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB There is increasing evidence that the nature of corporate planning in business is moving toward external strategic concepts of sustainable competitive advantage (SCA).  There is some evidence that this is beginning to happen in the larger contracting and development enterprises in construction.  The construction sector in most economies is still largely dominated by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  There has been little evidence of SCA being applied by SMEs.  It is argued by some that such concepts are inapplicable to the SME segment of the construction industry.  This case study documents the results of a strategic-planning workshop undertaken for an Australian project-management consultancy.  The paper describes the background to the company and gives full details of the strategic-planning discussions and assessments made.  These resulted in a business strategy being identified.  The extent to which this strategy was implemented and whether it resulted in an SCA for the company is considered in light of events at the strategic-planning session.  The result is a detailed example of the way that strategic-planning concepts can apply at the SME level and an evaluation of the extent of their success in implementation.

AB The sustainable management of erodible pastoral hill country is a major focus of land use research in New Zealand, A multi-disciplinary study, using a high resolution lake sedimentation record, is being conducted to determine the role that cyclonic storms and natural and human-induced vegetation changes play in the erosion history of a landslide-prone hill country watershed.
   Sediment cores from Lakes Tutira and Waikopiro in northern Hawke's Bay were analysed to construct the magnitude-frequency history of storm-induced erosion since European settlement. Pulses of sediment representing individual storms can be clearly identified and are correlated to a storm history derived from analysis of a 93 year daily rainfall record. Correlation and dating are confirmed by pollen and diatom analysis, Cs-137 distribution, tephrochronology and reference to a well documented land use history. Annually laminated, organic rich deposits, which occur in the uppermost sediments and represent the annual decomposition of biogenic material associated with eutrophication, are also used to confirm the chronology.
   A high correlation was found between storm sediment thickness and total storm rainfall (R-2 = 0.8). Although sediment producing storms (> 150 ram) occur on a near annual basis, the two largest storms (> 600 ram) contributed 54% of the total sediment thickness.
   The presence of well defined 'storm sediment pulses' has enabled the lake storage component of a sediment budget to be calculated for Cyclone Bola (1988), the most recent and largest rainstorm on record. The integration of this budget with the storm-magnitude-frequency history will be used to develop watershed-based models to predict the impacts of land use changes and the erosion response to climate scenarios.

TI FARMING SYSTEMS OPTIONS FOR UNITED-STATES AGRICULTURE - AN
   AGROECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Agricultural productivity gains since the 1950s have resulted from the development of farming systems that rely heavily on external inputs of energy and chemicals to replace management and on-farm resources. The intensity to which the natural environment has been modified to attain this productive capacity has directly resulted in degradation of the natural resources, notably land and water, that sustain these systems. The search for solutions to increasingly complex and interrelated agricultural problems including sustainable agriculture, environmental quality, food safety, and rural development requires a shift in both the scientific method and scale in which agricultural research is organized and conducted. Farming systems research and extension (FSRE) and other systems-oriented approaches fitted to agriculture an viewed as essential approaches for addressing complex agricultural problems, and for developing more efficient and sustainable farming systems. This article provides a brief synthesis of research information from several technical reports that were presented at a special symposium held during the American Society of Agronomy annual meetings in IM. The reports cover a wide range of topics including FSRE, agricultural systems, systems engineering, information systems, and sustainable development.

AB In the developed countries, the conventional experiment station-based agricultural research system generally has served farmers well. In developing countries, however, the same model has had less success in addressing needs of many farmers, particularly those operating diversified farming systems in resource-poor and risk-prone environments. Hence, in the 1970s, the farming systems research and extension (FSRE) approach-which has a high degree of complementarity with experiment station-based research-evolved to address their needs. Prior to this was the development of some analogous farm-based approaches in the USA (e.g., balanced farming). In the USA, increasing concerns about limited research resources and ecological sustainability have sparked interest in harnessing the power of the farm-based and systems-oriented FSRE approach in a way that is complementary to other approaches and in a manner that produces results acceptable to all stakeholders (e.g., farmers, station-based researchers, extension/development staff, and planners of policy/support systems).

AB Creating sustainable options for farming systems in the USA requires addressing both technological and nontechnological barriers. It is necessary to continue research, development, and validation of technologies that enhance agricultural productivity, environmental stewardship, and the quality of rural life. Changes in agricultural practices, however, will come about only when economic, policy, informational, and attitudinal barriers to adoption of these technologies are reduced. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation (WKKF), through its Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) Initiative, is supporting a cluster of community-based IFS projects. The goals of these projects are: (i) for farmers to adopt more integrated and resource-efficient farming systems that maintain productivity and profitability while protecting the environment and the personal health of farmers and their families, and (ii) to assist farmers and others in rural communities in addressing the barriers associated with adopting more resource-efficient and integrated systems. Each IFS project represents a collaboration among individuals and organizations within a community that share concern for the health of their farming systems in the short- and long-term. All WKKF-funded IFS projects are tied together through leadership development, information networking, and the addressing of public policy options necessary to foster sustainable systems. It is the hope of WKKF that it can assist those with an interest in and commitment to fostering more sustainable agriculture in overcoming the existing barriers and creating an agricultural system that can truly sustain many future generations.

AB In the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act (FACTA) of 1990 (the 1990 Farm Bill), Congress authorized expansion of funding and scope for competitively awarded federal money for agricultural research. Enabling legislation for the new National Research Initiative (NRI) stipulated that an emphasis be placed on research supporting sustainable agriculture where appropriate, and that at least 30% of the funds be allocated to multidisciplinary research by 1993 with at least 20% of funds earmarked for mission-linked efforts. Challenges facing the NRI, in terms of agricultural sustainability, include: (i) how to incorporate appropriate stakeholder involvement, (ii) lack of consensus on how to operationalize the accepted definitions of ''sustainable agriculture'' and ''mission-linked systems research,'' (iii) the need to assess social/economic impacts, (iv) perceived lack of opportunity for broadly multi- or interdisciplinary research, and (v) the dearth of proposals addressing issues of agricultural sustainability. If Congressional intent is to be met with the NRI, these issues must be addressed. Plant and soil scientists have a significant role to play in assisting the NRI to become more focused on promoting sustainable agriculture.

DT Article
ID HOMELESSNESS
AB In this paper we outline the development of the Papakainga Housing Scheme, which has been predominantly applied in rural regions of the North Island of New Zealand. The objective of this policy which was introduced in 1985 has been to remove legal impediments that have prevented Maori people building dwellings on collectively owned ancestral land. By 1992, a total of 901 loans had been approved, but the future of the programme is uncertain. We consider that the outcomes of this housing policy are, at best, ambiguous. The policy fits well with Maori concepts of land and home, and facilitates a return to tribal areas. However, designing special programmes for particular groups is as odds with current state policies that promote the 'level playing-field'. In addition, the scheme will not achieve its full potential without the promotion of employment and other social services to create sustainable rural communities.

TI ACCELERATED SOIL-EROSION IN WATERSHEDS OF YUNNAN PROVINCE, CHINA
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
ID SEDIMENTS; LAKE
AB Soil erosion in agricultural watershed consist of a natural (geologic) component and an accelerated (human-induced) component. There is little information available, particularly in developing countries, on the accelerated component of soil and nutrient erosion, or its effect on agricultural sustainability. Lakes and watersheds are physically linked ecosystems, and lake sediments preserve historical records of material export from watersheds. We used paleolimnological methods to calculate sediment accumulation rates for four lakes in Yunnan Province, China. We estimated trap efficiencies of three of the lake basins, calculated recent erosion rates for their watersheds, and calculated low-disturbance rates that approximate natural erosion. Human activities in recent centuries caused a 15-fold increase relative to natural erosion rates of non-carbonate, clastic materials from two small [350 km2 (135 mi2)] watersheds. Phosphorus export from these watersheds increased approximately 19 fold. The degree of human influence appeared to differ between the two larger [2700 km2 (1042 mi2)] watersheds. Accelerated soil and nutrient erosion rates from Yunnan watersheds are high, and may ultimately destabilize agricultural productivity and the agrarian economy.

TI CHANGE IN POLISH AGRICULTURE - BUILDING FROM STRENGTH
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The conversion of the Polish economy from a communist system to one which has more emphasis on market forces is necessitating change in Polish agriculture. The objective of this paper is to discuss sustainability in addition to efficiency and equity as a measure of successful agricultural development. In fact, the large, if modestly productive, land base of Poland is managed by family farmers. These farmers already practice many techniques characteristic of sustainable agriculture, including integration of livestock with crop production arid crop rotations with legumes. It is critical to see these as strengths upon which to build a new farm economy.
   Dramatic and often painful changes are occurring in Polish agriculture as the economy of Poland goes through the transition from a communist system to one with more emphasis on market forces. For many reasons, changes in the structure of Polish agriculture are inevitable. These include inequities between rural and urban incomes partly resulting from small farm sizes, low prices for farm products, and the lack of a strong agricultural infrastructure, e.g., supply, services, processing and sales (Tomszak, 1991).  Relatively low crop yields per hectare also imply a lack of production efficiency compared to Western Europe as well as other Eastern European countries. The predominance of small, private family farms (Table 1) is the most important and unique feature of Polish agriculture (Rocznik Statystyczny, 1989). Only in Poland were farmers (peasants) so strong that the Communist party, during Stalin's period, could not destroy the family farm sector. Eventually, peasants acted like enzymes which step by step (for example, by traditional education of their children) ''decomposed'' communism in Poland. The small average farm size may be inadequate to ensure a satisfactory standard of living for Poland's future farmers; however, the development of food policies to guide the transition from the communist era should recognize and nurture the inherent strengths of the Polish agricultural community.
   The objectives of this paper are to discuss the concepts of equity and efficiency with special reference to the human and biophysical resources available to Polish agriculture and to suggest, in addition to equity and efficiency, a third measure of successful agricultural development-sustainability.

TI CONSTRAINTS OF SAHELIAN SANDY SOILS AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS FOR
   SUSTAINABLE RAIN-FED CROP PRODUCTION
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Constraints to sustainable production of the main food crops, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and millet (Pennicetum thyphoides (M.) Schulm), are diverse but site specific in the Sahel. Contraints were assessed at three Sahelian sites (N'Dounga, Chikal and Kala Pate). Results suggest that constraints other than water may limit sustainable cereal crop production. Rapid hydraulic conductivity (> 0.25 m h-1), low soil fertility (less than 13 mg total N kg-1, 8 mg Bray-1 available P kg-1, 30 mg exchangeable K kg-1), soil mineralogy dominated by quartz/kaolinite/iron-oxide, low available water holding capacity (< 12 Mg m-3), and low nutrient holding capacity (CEC < 4 cmole(+) 100 g-1) were common to all sites. At Kala Pate  where soil pH was < 5, crop roots and leaves were affected by Al and Mn toxicities. Soil liming or acid tolerant cultivars are needed more than fertilizer or water management. At N'Dounga where surface soil pH was 6.5, constraints were the fewest. Constraints at Chikal were the late onset of the rains and high surface soil temperatures, therefore, production strategy should insure water availability early and/or late in the growing season. Due to the socio-economical environment at these sites, biological nitrogen fixation, acid and/or drought tolerant cultivars, dust mulching, domestic garbage, animal traction, and agroforestry may offer sustainable alternatives.

TI ADOPTION OF SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION PRACTICES - ENGLISH CABBAGE FARMERS
   IN MALAYSIA
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The objectives of the research reported in this article are to determine (1) the extent to which sustainable production practices have been adopted by English cabbage producers in Malaysia, (2) whether cabbage yields and sustainable farming practices are inversely related, and (3) factors conducive to farmers adopting sustainable practices. Sustainable practices examined involve pest (insect, disease, weed) control, fertilization, and soil erosion control. Results indicate that farmers who adopt more sustainable practices do not suffer yield sacrifices. A strategy to help farmers understand reasons for possibly using less agricultural chemical and inorganic fertilizers is shown to be the single most effective approach for promoting the more widespread adoption of sustainable practices in the study area.

TI PROVIDING RELEVANT EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN
   AGRICULTURAL SCIENTISTS - FOUNDATION FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Agricultural scientists in Sub-Saharan Africa face unique and diverse challenges as they work to increase food production to meet demand. The total resource context within which they work is difficult and rural infrastructure is poorly developed. Many countries now face balance of payment problems, along with declining per capita income and food production. Difficult climatic and soil conditions, unfavorable or inadequate policies/support systems and civil unrest have all inhibited progress. Improved and appropriate technologies have not been developed for the conditions faced by limited-resource farming families in low income countries. Most national program scientists trained outside of Africa arrive home unprepared to sort out the complexity inherent in agricultural development. Educational constraints in the African context include inadequate recurrent funding, limited laboratory and field equipment and facilities and an orientation toward basic and classical elements of education rather than toward practical applications. The different training requirements of industrialized country-based and African scientists become obvious when comparisons are made in their institutional bases, their monitoring and support systems, the immediate needs of the society and the policy/economic systems that are available to encourage the adoption of improved technologies. We describe the need for scientists to have a more generalized orientation, to be wilting to work in an interdisciplinary setting and to be able to interact directly with farmers. They also need to pay relatively more attention to adapting technology to fit the environment rather than a high cost approach to modifying the environment to fit the technology. In addition to developing relevant technology, scientists must become well prepared for research management and administration. Whether advanced degree programs in more developed countries can contribute to meaningful education and training for African scientists for the Sub-Saharan region remains an open question.

AB Lawyers are information and communication specialists. They are trained to gather information, determine which items of information are relevant ''facts,'' and present those facts to decision-makers in a persuasive manner which recommends a particular outcome. In this information gathering function, lawyers are much like scientists. Yet facts can be subjective and interpretive. Like historians, anthropologists, political scientists, sociologists and others, lawyers are scientists of human behavior, and of how to regulate human behavior.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Policy decisions in rural development and contingent management functions are influenced by agricultural economists whose neo-classical orthodoxy is increasingly criticized. Over recent years, the need for a pluralistic research methodology has come into focus as being more appropriate to sustainable agricultural development as a wide range of professional disciplines are interfaced in this context. The arguments for greater pluralism and the underlying scientific discourse are explored. The purposes of this article are: (1) to share with interfacing disciplines considerations within the agricultural economics profession to broaden its research methodology; and, thereby, (2) to encourage greater professional interaction among these disciplines. Arguments include selected sources from the recent International Conference of Agricultural Economists (1991) and the author's experience in supervising graduate students and departmental research.

SO JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE

DT Article
ID CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR; DEMAND; QUALITY; CHOICE; ATTRIBUTES; MODELS; MARKET
AB This paper is based on the theoretical structure proposed in studies by Lancaster in which it is assumed that: preferences for goods are derived from preferences for the characteristics which goods possess; the product can be described as a set of quantitative and qualitative characteristics; the price of the product may be defined as a set of implicit prices representing the consumer valuation of various characteristics. The primary objective of this paper is to examine the impact of product and shop characteristics on the value of the product as perceived by consumers and revealed by willingness to pay different prices for different characteristics. The core interest is to estimate the relationship between garment price and wool content. This is accomplished by analysis of the data of 732 knitted garments from retail shops in Melbourne, Australia. The results of the analysis indicate that both product and shop characteristics account for a considerable amount of variation in retail prices in the knitted market. Consumers value the presence of wool in knitted garments, and the proportion of wool in the garment raises the level of sustainable retail prices relative to fibres other than speciality fibres. Estimation of a retail-price function is expressed in terms of premiums and discounts for both quantitative and qualitative characteristics of knitted garments.

   Methods: Fifty patients underwent both renal revascularization (71 kidneys) and the repair of aneurysmal or symptomatic aortic occlusive disease between 1982 and 1992. Hypertension was present in 96% of patients and diabetes was present in 10%. The preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) was 25.18 +/- 8.29 ml/min (creatinine level 3.1 +/- 1.5 mg/dl). Operative management included bilateral renal artery repair (n = 21), unilateral repair alone (n = 17), and unilateral repair with contralateral nephrectomy (n = 12). The relative percent change in the postoperative EGPR (equal to or greater than 7 days after operation) increased by at least 20% in 42% of the patients, had decreased by 20% or more in only 4%, and was otherwise categorized as unchanged in the remaining 54% of the study group.
   Results: The 30-day operative mortality rate was 2.0% (1 of 50). Forty-five of the surviving 49 patients (91.8%) were available for follow-up (median 49 months). During this period nine patients (18.4%) eventually required dialysis, four within 6 months of operation, and 19 patients died. Neither subgroup experienced a retrieval of renal function after operation. Five-year survival rate was 61%, and a trend was noted between the risk of death and the relative change in EGPR after operation (p = 0.13). The likelihood of eventually requiring long-term dialysis was highest among those patients with low preoperative functional renal reserve as measured by preoperative creatinine level of 3 mg/dl or greater (p < 0.0001), or preoperative EGPR less than 20 ml/min (p = 0.0001). Blood pressure was cured or improved in 50% at late follow-up.
   Conclusions: Early improvement of renal function may be observed in nearly one half of patients subjected to combined aortic and renal revascularization. Nonetheless, renal preservation may not be sustainable in patients with compromised preoperative function. Intervention before marked functional decline remains the best option for minimizing the risk of eventual dialysis.

TI THROUGH A GREEN LENS - THE CONSTRUCTION OF CUSTOMARY ENVIRONMENTAL-LAW
   AND COMMUNITY IN INDONESIA MALUKU ISLANDS
SO LAW & SOCIETY REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB In the Maluku Islands of Eastern Indonesia, a center of global diversity in coral reef systems and the historic center of trade in cloves and other spices, tenure practices known as sasi have flourished for at least a century.  This article analyzes changes in the ways Dutch colonial officials, Indonesian government officials, and environmental NGOs have interpreted Moluccan customary law and local institutions.  Dutch colonial accounts of sasi, a generic name for a historic family of institutions, laws, and ritual practices that regulated access to fields, reefs, and rivers, suggest that sasi was a synthetic, highly variable body of practices linked to religious beliefs and local cultural ideas of nature.  During the past two decades, as international and national conservation discourses have proliferated and a movement has developed to support indigenous Indonesian cultural communities, Indonesian NGOs and the Ministry of the Environment have promoted, and largely created, images of sasi as an environmental institution and body of customary law promoting sustainable development, conservation, and social equity.  This article focuses on how sasi has been continuously reinterpreted by a variety of actors, following the trajectory of changing institutional interests and images.

AB Biosphere 2 is the first man-made, soil-based, bioregenerative life support system to be developed and tested. The utilization and amendment of local space resources, e.g. martian soil or lunar regolith, for agricultural and other purposes will be necessary if we are to minimize the requirement for Earth materials in the creation of long-term off-planet bases and habitations. Several of the roles soil plays in Biosphere 2 are 1) for air purification 2) as a key component in created wetland systems to recycle human and animal wastes and 3) as nutrient base for a sustainable agricultural cropping program. Initial results from the Biosphere 2 closure experiment are presented. These include the accelerated cycling rates due to small reservoir sizes, strong diurnal and seasonal fluxes in atmospheric CO2, an unexpected and continuing decline in atmospheric oxygen, overall maintenance of low levels of trace gases, recycling of waste waters through biological regeneration systems, and operation of an agriculture designed to provide diverse and nutritionally adequate diets for the crew members.

SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN

DT Article
AB Despite the large number if islands within its Exclusive Economic Zone, Solomon Islands has a relatively limited amount of coral reef to support inshore marine fisheries. The nations population is growing rapidly and continues to depend heavily on inshore marine resources, particularly finfish, for subsistence. In the past decade, there have been substantial exports of beche-de-mer (processed sea cucumber), trochus shell, pearl oyster shell, green snail shell, turtle shell and crocodile skin. In late 1993, export of turtle shell and crocodile skin was banned in response to an obvious need for the conservation of these species. The export of pearl oyster shell was also prohibited in late 1993, to foster the development of aquaculture, by improving the supply of wild spat and by ensuring that there were sufficient numbers of wild oysters to provide broodstock for future hatcheries. Since 1986, there has been active research in Solomon Islands on the aquaculture of giant clams to improve their future export value and provide opportunities to reseed denuded reefs. Simple controls, e.g. minimum and maximum size limits, have been placed on the harvest of several non finfish species, and closed seasons have been self-imposed on sea cucumber and trochus by some communities. Increased use of self-imposed regulations by customary owners and a variety of conservative commonsense management measures would help to ensure that the stocks of the main export commodities, such as sea cucumber, trochus and green snail, provide sustainable and lucrative harvests in the future.

AB The oceans have a major influence on world climate and are an important source of food, most of which comes from the coastal zones, These zones, and the traditional, sustainable, life-styles of the fishing communities that live there, are under immense and growing pressure, Urbanization, pollution, sea level rise, and the destruction of natural coast defences and fish nursery grounds are undermining sustainability, Although chemical pollution in some areas, with some substances, is falling it remains a serious problem over the world as a whole.
   The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, held at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, recognized the need for more effective protection of the resources of the coastal seas, and a number of specific actions are set out in Agenda 21. But action is still not being taken on a scale which matches the problem, There are four probable reasons: first, the sea is still assumed to be too big to damage; second, jurisdiction is inadequate; third, serious national and international conflicts of interest remain; and fourth, economic distortions hamper sound judgement, The northern seas, which suffer less from these problems, should be demonstration areas for sound marine resource management.

AB The paper discusses the recent trends in environmental protection within an industrial society. The potential conflict between environmental sustainability and economic development is discussed with particular reference to Germany, Environmentally orientated management is considered to be the most appropriate means of achieving this economical cost-efficiency and ecological sustainability. However, producers have a responsibility to achieve these aims against a framework of increasing environmental legislation, both national and international, and widely adopted philosophies such as the polluter pays and precautionary principles, Finally, the paper discusses the relevance of these aspects for both industrialized and developing countries.

TI INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL-MANAGEMENT - THE DUTCH GOVERNMENTAL VIEW
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN

DT Article
AB In the last 10 years concern for the economic and ecological value of the North Sea has increased. Many different users are putting increasing pressure on the resources of the North Sea and its adjacent estuaries. Its uses include shipping, fisheries, the oil and gas industry, mineral extraction, and-along its shores-recreation. The North Sea suffers pollution directly from some of these sources, but also indirectly from discharges from land, from rivers and from the atmosphere. The resilience of the North Sea ecosystem puts limits on the human use. These limits have in a number of cases been exceeded. It is necessary to define and assess the sustainable use of the North Sea ecosystem. The sustainable use may be defined as the long-term use of current and future potential while ensuring sustainable conservation of the ecological value of the North Sea and adjacent vulnerable water systems. Integrated environmental management for the North Sea implies that policymakers assess all interests and resolve any conflicts which arise. This paper considers the problem of input of organic substances into the North Sea. It considers a target scenario of sustainable use and ecological health, in relation to what concentrations of organic substances are permissible. Secondly, it considers a target percentage reduction in current inputs. Thirdly, it is necessary to give the measures to be taken to deal with the major sources of the pollution, i.e. to define target groups. Finally, the paper gives examples of the statutory instruments available to implement the chosen policy.

AB This paper focuses on goods transportation, but the general reasoning is also relevant for passenger transport. Many factors influence transport development and transport mode distribution. These factors are grouped and listed for clarity and to produce an overview. The interactions between the factor groups and transport and the complexity of the interdependence are discussed. At present, there are no formal models that fully explain goods transport development and transport pattern and that satisfactorily link policy changes and their effects on transport. Results pertaining to goods transport from two Scandinavian longterm planning models are summarized. Additional information is drawn from project work dealing with Western European countries.

   IMPLICATIONS FOR FERTILIZER CONSUMPTION
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper traces the major developments in the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and related environmental policy and examines their impact on the use of crop nutrients, The objectives of the CAP were set out in the Treaty of Pome in 1957 and have not been explicitly revised, The Community has, however, progressed from being a significant importer to a major exporter of food, Various changes in the policy measures/reforms, have been implemented, each to control the continuing increase in farm output, The latest of these in May 1992 reduced commodity prices towards world market levels, introduced 15% set aise for arable land, as well as agreeing a number of agri-environmental measures, Further changes are anticipated following the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and as new trade agreements are reached with the countries of the former Eastern Bloc, Inevitably, existing farm systems will be subject to careful reappraisal, The Community's environmental objectives were added to the Treaty in 1987 with the passing of the European Single Act, The interaction between agriculture and the environment has been a prominent concern, The Directive 91/676, which seeks to protect water against pollution caused by nitrate from agricultural sources, is the first Directive to have a major direct impact on farm practice, The Fifth Environmental Action Plan for 1993-2000 'Towards Sustainability' selects agriculture as one of five industries for specific attention, The plan seeks an extensification of agriculture and a reduction in the use of chemicals, Changes in the amount of plant nutrients from both farmyard manure and mineral fertilizers used in agriculture are quantified, Methods of determining the efficiency with which they are utilized are assessed, New advisory techniques which will improve the efficiency of nutrient use on the farm are considered, as are the implications for the future demand for nutrients from mineral fertilizers, This paper is the view of the European Fertilizer Manufacturers Association.

AB The paper outlines the evolution of fisheries development policies (aquaculture excluded), from an international perspective as seen within the various UN and FAO fishery committees, It begins with the first FAO Technical Committee on Fisheries in 1945 and extends through the various periods corresponding to post-war reconstruction (1945-1958), geographical expansion (1959-1972), establishment of a new economic order of the oceans (1973-1982), and transition towards global concerns (1983-1992). It underlines the gaps between government resolutions at the international level and effective implementation at national policy level. This identifies the elements to be considered in responsible fishing policies. Finally, the FAO International Code of Conduct for Responsible fisheries is presented as the conceptual framework for achieving sustainable fisheries development and UNCED's objectives within the framework of the 1992 Convention.

ID PULP-MILL EFFLUENTS
AB The changing concepts and challenges that the process industry has to face in relation to environmental protection are discussed, The original requirements on industry to reduce emissions of contaminants through the installation of filters and waste water treatment facilities or through process modifications and introduction of 'clean production' strategies were mainly based on economic and technical considerations rather than on an effort to avoid environmental impacts, The introduction of concepts such as 'assimilative capacity of the environment' and 'critical load' provided useful instruments for setting effect-related emission standards, resulting in acceptable environmental protection, However, the actual requirement for 'sustainability' has forced industry to focus not only on controlling emissions of contaminants and pollutants, but to take a global environmental approach, including the choice of raw materials and energy sources, recycling and re-utilization of wastes and to take responsibility for the fate of their products, during their whole lifecycle.

AB The coastal zones are areas of high biological productivity and intense human pressure. Environmental challenges arise from pollution and from urban and industrial development, Administrative, social and legal challenges centre upon the need for sound management of coastal zone resources, as an important component of national strategies for sustainability, A number of specific actions have been set out in Agenda 21, the principal product of the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. But these need to be carried forward within cross-sectoral, integrated coastal area management procedures.
   International action is also needed because marine ecosystems rarely coincide with national boundaries, and are affected by international economic, social and legal decisions, International scientific co-operation on marine issues is already well established, and many regional action plans and Conventions have been adopted, Technological cooperation is less advanced, Such efforts need to be intensified, and continuously adapted, Sound plans for the future must be based on good science, critical economic evaluation of resources, sensitive evaluation of social and cultural factors and of the needs of local communities, evaluation of the risks of climate change, sea-level rise and other changes, and monitoring as a basis for continuing adaptation.

AB Demand is driven by conventional market forces over much of the world among consumers with strong positive attitudes to meat as a nutritious, tasty and premium food; price in relation to income, availability, quality (including leanness) and relevance to life-style remain the dominant forces operating. But in the developed world, there are emerging concerns about how meat is produced, which are likely to have negative effects on demand, particularly that of the current younger generation, and which may well begin to affect Government policies towards the meat industry.
   The industry needs to establish strong information and education programmes, but also to examine its procedures to provide greater consumer assurance about practises and controls. Also the scientists and technologists serving the industry need to help it move towards sustainable lower input, less environmentally damaging systems, less reliance on drugs, stimulants and additives, sensitive exploitation of the new genetics and with more consideration for the animals involved.

TI THE FUTURE OF PLANNING
SO MITTEILUNGEN DER OSTERREICHISCHEN GEOGRAPHISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB In this paper ''planning'' centrally means landuse planning reflecting wider urban policy concerns in the fields of economic development, social and community policy, housing policy, transport planning, and environmental policy. A cursory historical look provides the background for a description and interpretation of recent developments. The 1990s represent a decade of continuity in some respects and of sharp change in others.
   The most likely priorities of planning are the regeneration of urban areas that have lost their traditional function and need a new one, the reconciliation of wealth-creation and environmental protection objectives and the rebuilding of damaged social fabric'. Cities appear increasingly to be differentiating themselves, with a polarization between populations and between areas: all tend to contain areas of economic decline and social deprivation, and an urban underclass might develop. In this context a new problem is to be tackled: the pressure of migration from outside: within Europe from Eastern and South Eastern Europe, North Africa and the-Commonwealth of Independent States to Western and Central Europe.
   Often the 1990s plans are driven by the imperative of providing new commercial spaces as part of the new global logic of competition, and the new environmental policies involve a new and complex relationship between land use policies and policies in other areas (water and solid waste management, protection of the natural environment, transport). Sustainable urban development is one of the main new movements in planning. Good environmental quality can be an important element in promoting local economic development and preventing further decentralization. However, over the long term the major structural economic forces (the globalization of the economy, the shift to the informational economy) are leading to an increasingly volatile and footloose pattern of location.

TI PUBLIC DEBT AND DEFICITS IN DENMARK - IS FISCAL-POLICY SUSTAINABLE

DT Article
AB This article reviews the recent behaviour of public finances in Denmark, defines the concept of fiscal sustainability, suggests a stock-flow consistent accounting framework for public debt and deficits, and, finally, discusses the sustainability of fiscal policy, in a medium term perspective (1994-98).  Provided that the gradual contraction of fiscal policy, as contained in the tax reform of 1993, is actually implemented, we find that current fiscal policy in Denmark is sustainable in the medium term.  However, this result may be seriously undermined if the economy is disturbed by a weaker growth performance and higher real interest rates.

TI TRADITIONAL HEALTH KNOWLEDGE AND PUBLIC-POLICY
SO NATURE & RESOURCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Indigenous or traditional knowledge of human health and medicine currently forms the basis of primary health care for the majority of the world's population.  A new role for traditional health systems in addressing the health care needs of developing countries and indigenous communities requires that they be included as a matter of policy in the planning process, and in national and international budgeting for health care provision.  This should be done in consultation with traditional medical practitioners and their representative organizations.
   The new respect that is emerging for traditional health knowledge should be matched by new investments in appropriately designed research, in the development of training capacity to preserve and perpetuate traditional knowledge in the context of an integrated system of modern and traditional health care, and by investments in the sustainable use of medicinal plants.
   Such an approach, involving the collaboration of traditional custodians, non-governmental organizations, representatives of national and international health, environment and economic development agencies and national and international funding bodies, has the potential to yield new and sustainable solutions to the wider health needs of developing countries and indigenous peoples.

AB Two very interesting trends have developed in the world: there has been an enormous rise in the awareness of knowledge as the key sustaining component of organizations and communities, and there is a growing recognition of the importance of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in planning and decision-making for sustainable development. As this article explains, the use of advanced information and communications systems can lead to a greater awareness of and sensitivity to indigenous knowledge, and should allow traditional ecological expertise to be integrated with western science in the addressing of sustainable development issues.

AB The landmark United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) in 1992, has given a new impetus to the use of indigenous ecological knowledge by scientists and local communities in forging innovative strategies for sustainable resource management.  The Canadian International Development Research Centre (IDRC) is one of many institutions worldwide whose mandate has been recently broadened to address the challenges put forward by UNCED's Agenda 21 and Convention on Biodiversity.  The Centre is profiled in this article to illustrate how the organization has responded to the challenge of integrating aspects of community and indigenous ecological knowledge into research projects that promote sustainable and equitable development.  The development of IDRC's post-UNCED corporate programme framework and its focus on community involvement for sustainable development activities are presented here in the context of recent publications and international gatherings on this issues.

AB Land degradation, associated with farming systems based on annual pastures and crops, is threatening the long-term viability of Australian agriculture. Perennial pastures could play a significant role in reducing some forms of land degradation i.e. dryland salinity, erosion, and soil structure decline. In terms of sustainability, the key differences between perennial and annual pastures relate to rooting depth and the water uptake pattern throughout the year. Deep-rooted perennials can use water when annual pastures are dead, recover leached nitrate (and reduce acidification), and can provide soil cover and root mass to restrict wind and water erosion. Deeply penetrating roots also create biopores and improve soil structure and drainage. In addition, problems normally associated with water repellency are reduced as perennials are not required to germinate each year. There is an urgent need to breed plants that can colonise hostile Australian subsoils characterised by high soil strength, acidity, and high concentrations of toxic elements. In terms of the four perennial grasses considered in this workshop, we believe that the deeper rooting habit of phalaris and tall fescue offer more scope for overcoming degradation than cocksfoot and perennial ryegrass. Plant breeders need to consider the considerable benefits of deep-rooted lines and lines which are able to colonise soils with hostile subsoils.

AB A comparison of three marine protected areas in Indonesia illustrates many of the problems in management planning and implementation.  Major factors influencing management are proximity to urban areas, the protected area's economic potential, current uses and the resolution of jurisdictional disputes.  Isolation does not prevent resource depletion.  Improving the economic conditions of local residents and gaining their commitment to environmentally sustainable commercial and subsistence resource uses within and near protected areas are vital to implementing area management.

TI THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE - ITS IMPLICATIONS IN CAPTURE FISHERIES

SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper attempts to clarify the research, management and legal implications of a potential application of the Precautionary Principle to capture fisheries, particularly in the international context. In the process, the paper also looks at related issues such as the burden of proof, the use of best available scientific evidence and technology, the reliance on prior scientific consensus, assimilative capacity and acceptable levels of impacts, etc., in the fishery context. It is argued that, if narrowly interpreted, the precautionary principle could lead to socio-economic havoc. If reasonably interpreted, however, the Principle offers a golden opportunity to progress towards sustainable fisheries development and suggestions are made for the implementation of precautionary approaches in fisheries management.

AB Forty peanut Arachis hypogaea L. entries received from ICRISAT plus four U.S. cultivars were evaluated three years for resistance to early leafspot Cercospora arachidicola Hori., late leafspot Cercosporidium personatum (Berk. and Curt.) Deighton, and southern stem rot Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. Early leafspot ratings for RMP-12 were two standard deviations below the mean of all entries all three years of the test. The disease scores for RMP-91 were low in two of the three years. None of the entries were consistently superior to the four U. S. cultivars in late season leafspot scores. Stem rot incidence for Tamnut 74 was lower than the mean of all entries in two test years, while PI 414331, RMP 91, Robut 33-1, and PI 393516 showed indications of above average susceptibility. Foliar diseases were severe on Tamnut 74. The pod yield of Southern Runner in these irrigated tests was two standard deviations above the test mean in all three years of the test. However, the reaction of Southern Runner to leafspots and stem rot was not consistent when compared with the test mean. The high pod yield combined with average or above resistance to late leafspot and southern blight adds attractiveness to the culture or use as a parent of this cultivar. The pod yield of RMP- 1 2 was above average in two of the three years and the southern blight incidence was equal to the test mean. Multiple disease and agronomic evaluations under natural field culture can be useful in the choice of genotypes for use as parents and cultivars for peanut improvements programs with focus on low input and sustainable agriculture.

AB The forest land available for timber production in Finland covers 20 million hectares. Just over two thirds of these forests are owned by ordinary Finnish families who naturally want to make sure that these forests stay healthy and remain in plentiful supply. Measures such as strict air pollution control, research and multiple-use silviculture and the increase of protected forest areas ensure that the biodiversity of this renewable asset remains intact for future generations.

AB The world population continues to grow rapidly while also demanding a safe, secure food supply. This supply is produced on a limited soil and water base which needs to be protected today and for future generations. By adapting to the control methods that are being used, current and new pests are changing and thriving under the conditions we provide while we produce food. A resource efficient and sustainable food production chain requires that producers of crops and livestock have a selection of safe, effective tools to manage pests to acceptable levels, and to minimize their ability to adapt. At present, the problem exists that those with responsibility for pest management, like government policy makers, government regulators, the pest control industry, research and expert committees, food producers and consumers, lack a long-term strategic plan on how to manage pests safely and effectively. Such a strategic plan would clearly identify effective pest management as a major key, one that would give food producers the means of providing for food security while maintaining soil quality and wildlife habitat. Because of the speed at which pest resistance or adaptation is occurring, the process of developing the long-term strategy must be put in place quickly.

AB Accumulating tensions call into question the sustainability of the American political system, which ultimately depends on public faith in the justifying myth.  This article takes sustainability as a policy problem, and attempts to reconstruct the significance of recent, scattered events in American politics from the standpoint of central theory in the policy sciences.  The resulting construct emphasizes the significance of intellectuals in the decision processes of modern society and the continuing task of the policy sciences.

TI BUSINESS STRATEGY, RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL
   IMPERATIVES
SO R & D MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental imperatives are seen by many business leaders to represent a major issue for the 1990's and beyond. The debate about the environmental sustainability of economic activity has important implications for the development of business and places considerable emphasis on the need for planned corporate change. The strategic significance of the environment is particularly critical to R&D as this is characterised by long planning horizons and provides the setting for the development of future products and processes.
   The purpose of this paper is to examine the connections between environmental imperatives, strategic change and R&D management. To this end the paper reviews the strategic nature of environmental pressures on business. From this base, consideration is given to the responses required by business, in meeting these pressures. The paper concludes by suggesting that the application of management techniques in concert with organisational change is needed for R&D management to build environmental considerations effectively into innovation. These suggestions can be used to gauge how far individual businesses have developed the systems and structures to enable them to move towards sustainability. The implication of the paper is that R&D management will not only need to apply new management techniques but will have to play a leading role in innovative organisational structures in order to fulfil the full potential  of   environmentally  sensitive products and processes.

AB This paper examines the capacity of the inner city area of Tokyo based on the assumption that the citizens should lead comfortable lives making use of various urban facilities and services. The results of quantitative approaches show that the living and working population in Tokyo already exceeds the limit for comfort, especially in terms of the congestion of commuter trains and roads, the ability for waste disposal, the prevention of air pollution and the supply of affordable housing. Therefore, decentralization policies should be taken in order to reduce the demand for urban facilities and services. Other-wise, citizens' lives in Tokyo will never improve.

Some of the key factors that are reviewed include ethnobiology, articulation of concerns for biological resources, demographics, land tenure, history of civil conflict, cognizance of environmental costs, the quality of spatial information and the linkages with decision making, the history of local involvement in planning frameworks, and the level of locally initiated habitat protection and monitoring. Three Pacific Rim island examples, from Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and British Columbia, are explored.

AB This paper is concerned with women and empowerment.  It stresses the ideological perspective of gender roles in Bangladesh and the realities of poor rural women's lives.  The conceptualization of gender in Bangladesh is culturally constructed and socially organized.  Ideologically, women are powerless in the economic and social arenas.  Persistent poverty in the country has compelled the structure of the household to change.  Now many poor rural women break the ideological norm of the society and work outside the culturally determined ''private sphere'' for their survival.  These women gain access to a resource base and new power relations within society in general and in the household in particular.  The sustainability of this gain for women lies in their empowerment, and NGOs working at the grassroots can play a crucial role in this regard.  The role that NGOs have already had in Bangladesh are exemplified in this paper for a better understanding of empowerment and its implications for future development planning.

AB To become sustainable, development trajectories need altogether a tighter integration of environmental policies and economic processes, and a greater attention to be given to the cost-effectiveness of policies.  This could result from an extension of the use of economic incentives within a mixed strategy trying to exploit potential synergies between various types of instruments.  Scientific uncertainties and controversies coming from the active frontier of environmental problems should lead to the definition of second best strategic criteria and the search for ''minimum regret'' strategies also aiming at satisfying other social objectives. This is what is at stake with a fiscal reform incorporating ''ecotaxes'', as it is shown from an assessment of the European project of a new mixed carbon/energy tax''.

AB Ecosystem evolution is driven by general laws for open system aiming at immortality (first genetical then also cultural) of its components. Evolutionary impulses spread downward from ecosystem disturbances to population strategies to genome structures (opposite to the upward causation of traditional theory). Environmental cycles work as winding engine pushing evolution a step further at each round. Natural selection is being slackened with time while memory elaborates to conscious level. General trend is from unsustained growth to stability, individuation, increased diversity, standing biomass to productivity to dead mass ratios. Progressive evolution is interrupted by biospheric crises, or backward developments. Human activities contribute to the latter while for sustainable existence it will be necessary to switch from the crisis to the progress scheme. Human morals are grounded in million years of pre-human and pre-historic human evolution. However to be taught by nature means to comply with its progressive rather than backward tendencies. Human history as a continuation of the animal history is a perpetual struggle against natural selections.

AB The rapid rate of tropical forest loss in recent years has prompted efforts to develop sustainable land uses. The success of these efforts has been hindered by the lack of an operational definition of sustainable land use and the overuse of a traditional-modern dichotomy to evaluate sustainability. To address the former problem, six dimensions of sustainable land use are identified, permitting a more objective evaluation of sustainability. In response to the latter problem, a household ecology model is proposed that views all land use as responding to the social, economic, political, and environmental context in which it occurs. A mosaic of land uses developed by smallholder colonists in Costa Rica is described, and the sustainability of its components is discussed. The mosaic includes intensive cattle raising, intensive agriculture with permanent cash crops, and forests. Steps that can be taken to further encourage sustainable elements of this land use mosaic are identified.

DT Article
AB Durban Harbour is one of the busiest in Africa, its estuarine waters also being a popular angling venue for city-dwellers who pursue their sport from light-tackle boats or from the shores around the 21-km harbour perimeter.  Light-tackle boat competition data and shore-angling data from the South African National Marine Linefish System for the years 1976-1991 were used to analyse angler catch rates and catch per species for the Harbour.  A total of 85 species of both marine and estuarine-associated ichthyofauna was caught.  The Harbour is used as a nursery area by juvenile fish and as a feeding ground and refuge by adult fish.  The catch composition varied inter-annually, but it was dominated by the Haemulidae, particularly Pomadasys commersonnii, and the Mugilidae.  The majority of fish caught by light-tackle boat anglers were above the minimum legal size, but fell within small size-classes.  The catch rate declined over the 16 years, probably attributable to a combination of loss of habitat, flooding in 1987, poor water quality, disturbance by harbour traffic and possibly overexploitation of fish stocks.  It is concluded that careful management and efficient policing of the Harbour are essential prerequisties to ensure sustainable catches in the future.

AB The authors argue that modern agriculture nowadays is facing widespread criticism from the outside. This criticism brings into focus agriculture's economic structures, ecological and moral problems as well as farmers' cultural dispositions and habits. In the eyes of most of the farmers this is alarming as this criticism promotes heavy demand on social codetermination of what and how farmers produce. This indicates a new quality of social change in the country: The well-known loss of farmers' influence in the past could easily turn into a real banishment of agriculture out of rural society. Particularly new is that a majority of farmers - though they suffer from it - can percieve the criticism. They don't reject it and to a certain extent even accept its underlying principles. However, this doesn't soften the contradictions as the rude conditions of economic selection don't give way to a correction of course on farm level. A sustainable solution can only be achieved if adequate changes of political framework are initiated.

SO SPORT SCIENCE REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB One of the most intriguing results emerging today from the instruction, practice, and feedback literatures in cognition and neuromotor learning shows a reversal effect in which subjects who are trained under highly structured, fully assisted conditions achieve greater success during acquisition but falter later during retention and transfer trials. Conversely, students educated under top-down approaches show an opposite profile; they achieve lower levels of performance during acquisition but higher levels during later transfer and retention, thereby exhibiting more long-term learning. This research is controversial, but if upheld for real-world skills, it indicates that important gains perceived initially by learners, teachers, and coaches under highly structured bottom-up approaches may be superficial and not sustainable in the longer term. To ensure long-term learning, the most effective approach is a more holistic top-down methodology. This phenomenon is reviewed within a potential research framework for sport pedagogy.

DT Article
AB By its very nature, investment in R&D is a challenging proposition. It is a decision made today for an uncertain return in the future. Moreover, it has become more complex with the introduction of sustainable development considerations into the decision-making process. In this paper, the effect of environmental policy, on the economic framework within which new technologies must compete is discussed, and analytical techniques which help assess these complexities are described. The return on an R&D investment is determined by the competitiveness of the resultant innovation at the time of its eventual application. A nae, technology is competitive relative to a given economic framework (which includes such factors as alternative technologies, availability of investment capital, trained human resources, etc). Government involvement in establishing goals and timetables for environmental protection significantly affects the evolution of the economic framework in which new technologies must perform. lo be successful in the 'sustainable development' age, the R&D investor must be able to anticipate the effect and development of government environmental and economic policy. Mathematical modelling is a valuable tool to help the investor and policy-maker appreciate the key risk factors and to understand the effect of environmental and economic policy on desired outcomes. For R&D, most model development has focused on policy development and is not very useful for supporting the business decisions associated with effective R&D investment In this paper, the interaction between government policy and business decision-making is discussed and a methodology, supported by a model, is presented to aid R&D investors to take environmental and sustainability issues into account when assessing the future competitiveness of technology.

DT Article
AB As more countries economically develop, their low costs allow them to become highly competitive, particularly in the area of manufacturing. Consequently, it is only by developing more advanced technologies that currently developed countries can maintain a sound balance of trade while trading freely with developing countries. As a neighbor of the rapidly developing countries of Southeast Asia, a region in which the environmental problems associated with economic and population. growth are becoming acute, it is natural for Japan to be particularly eager to achieve rapid technological progress - perhaps more so than the US or Europe. In this context, the author discusses macro-engineering, a topic that includes such things as large scale infrastructure projects which are greatly needed in less-developed countries. The author also reviews civilization theory and considers modern culture and its effects on large-scale migrations, racial self-determination in the absence of a capable administration, and the prospects for sustainable growth on the Limited Earth. The development of a macro-engineering diplomacy is proposed as a fundamental framework for solving global environmental problems, which might result in avoiding wasted efforts at national and regional levels.

AB This paper examines the way 'environment' has been conceptualized within the British planning system from the 1940s to the 1990s.  Drawing on texts of development plans and related planning strategy statements, it identifies a shift from a view of the environment as setting, to a stronger interest in active environmental care which in turn has been challenged by an emphasis on marketable assets.  Although there are now efforts to develop more complex conceptions of environmental care related to the notion of environmental sustainability and to use these as policy principles in development plans and development regulation, it is argued that the system has persistently enabled economic and material policy preoccupations to prevail.  This could also be the fate of the environmental sustainability agenda.  Nevertheless, the rhetoric of sustainable development could challenge this and help to transform concepts, techniques and forms of argumentation in the planning system.

DE SUSTAINABILITY; LAND USE PLANNING; ENVIRONMENT; VALUE THEORY
AB This paper explores the opportunities and contradictions in applying concepts of sustainable development to land use policy. The conceptual framework is provided by 'stock maintenance' models of sustainability and a distinction is made between material, postmaterial and non-instrumental dimensions of sustainability which relate in complex ways to the use and development of land. Though concepts of sustainability are gaining ground in planning and related disciplines, translating theory into policy remains problematic. Principles of sustainability challenge the presumption in favour of development and sit uneasily with the utilitarian notion of 'balance'. They require an alternative ethical basis and, especially in the postmaterial realm, are inherently bound up with value theory. These issues are illustrated by the problem of defining 'critical natural capital'. Political commitments to sustainability were made, and to some extent encoded in planning policies, before the challenge to a demand-led economy was fully grasped. Far from effecting reconciliation, defining what is sustainable will expose conflict more starkly and at an earlier stage in the planning process. As environment-led plans and decisions are challenged by development interests, there will be opportunities to test these conclusions in specific empirical contexts.

AB Although expert-systems technology has been used in a number of mining applications, it is considered that the benefits of building small expert systems are often out-weighed by the overheads associated with maintenance and support. A new computer software technology known as case-based reasoning (CBR) promises to deliver small decision-support systems that are economically viable. This is because the knowledge that they contain can be controlled and maintained by their users.
   A case-based reasoning tool has been used in a pilot study with Anglesey Aluminium Metal, Ltd. The results are encouraging and suggest that a combination of case-based reasoning and participatory design and implementation techniques can deliver sustainable improvement to mineral processing operations.
   Traditional, rule-based expert systems are often an ineffective way of implementing decision-support facilities. An explanation of why this should be so is given and it is shown that case-based reasoning may provide an 'appropriate technology' solution. Experience of providing advanced information systems for mining companies within the RTZ Group is drawn on to indicate how sustainable benefit may be achieved, and the pilot study with Anglesey Aluminium Metal is used as a practical illustration of the development of a CBR application. Finally, potential application areas are reviewed and some observations are made concerning the implementation process. References have been chosen for their accessibility to readers with little or no experience of artificial intelligence.

AB Nutrition energy transfer from sows to piglets is unusually intensive in the suckling period. Due to this transfer, the sows increase their relative standard energy metabolism up to four times, that means to the boundary of the long-term sustainable maximum. They cannot cover these large energy outputs by feed intake, therefore they are catabolizing their own body tissues during suckling and lose about 15 % of their live weight. Through milk which is an energy-rich high-fat diet, up to 1.76 MJ/kg and day of energy (in the first week) are transferred to piglets, and/or up to 2.26 MJ/kg0.75 and day of energy (in the second week), which enables them to double their live weight at birth within the first 7 to 10 days.  Milk transfer is of behavioral character in the system dam and litter. In a short time, it assumes a form of cyclic, collective synchronized suckling which is repeated more than twenty times a day and consists of several phases.

AB Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries are going through unique political, economic, institutional, and social changes associated with the heritage of serious pollution problems from the past. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the water quality management strategies CEE countries may take including the rationale of introducing Western policies in the short run. The policy to be selected must be viable under the existing pressing financial conditions and should feasibly be expanded towards a long-term sustainable scenario as economy improves. As a basis the present economic, social, and institutional setting is outlined, and the stare of water quality and the role of emissions of various origins are summarized. A special focus is devoted to municipalities with low and unbalanced levels of infrastructure; the development of these infrastructures could be aburden even for stable economies. An overview and evaluation are given for the water supply, sewerage, and wastewater treatment for urban areas with populations greater than 25,000 in five countries of the CEE region together with a discussion of legislation issues. Major elements of cost-effective development strategies are discussed and illustrated by examples. They incorporate improved demand management and the closing of material cycles, the upgrading of wastewater treatment facilities to match the level of sewerage, the application of regionally variable effluent (and/or ambient) water quality standards and their gradual tightening based on a river basin approach, the innovative selection of combined chemical-biological technologies (for both upgrading and new design) depending on local conditions and the multi-stage development of wastewater treatment plants. The policy suggested for the next couple of decades is characterized by a number of non-uniformities which raises considerable implementation challenges.

AB Across the world, transboundary water pollution interferes with man's use of water, degrades aquatic ecosystems, causes human health impacts, and increases tensions between nations. While developing nations are just beginning to assess the extent of transboundary water quality degradation, developed countries have learned over the years that pollution prevention, not cleanup actions or end-of-pipe treatment is the most cost-effective approach to fighting water pollution. The extent of transboundary water pollution across the world is reviewed in the paper, and key elements are outlined for addressing pollution prevention needs through joint institutions as part of international commissions. The Great Lakes/St. Lawrence River basin in North America is used as an example of where multimedia pollution prevention initiatives are being implemented to resolve transboundary pollution problems. The joint institutions for the Great Lakes cleanup utilized under the auspices of the International Joint Commission (U.S. and Canada) are described. Lessons learned from this experience include: (1) significance of multimedia pollution prevention measures to address toxic substances, (2) use of ecosystem-based watershed approaches targeted to high priority catchments, and (3) political advantages of employing joint institutions to facilitate progress, undertake oversight and verification functions, foster public participation, and establish credibility and trust among the parties through joint fact-finding.

AB A very basic problem of open material flows resulting in accumulation of pollution is not adequately addressed in present societies. Developed countries with expensive water-related infrastructure still contribute to local and global pollution. Developing countries to a great extent lack water treatment facilities and environmentally sound water management Large scale end-of-pipe wastewater treatment is one of the spectacular examples of technologies that must change in order to provide a sustainable solution. In order to start the way towards a solution of increasing worldwide pollution problems, a new holistic approach to resource management must be applied. The final goal of such an approach is to close the cycles of residuals that damage the environment, and recover resources lost in residuals emitted from all human activities. Water management should be integrated with management of other activities such as waste handling, industrial production, transportation, energy production, etc. The most important action is to apply pollution prevention strategy, i.e. to prevent pollution formation at the source during all human activities. Different kinds of effluents should be separated instead of mixed together. Recycling of water, nutrients and solid residuals should be arranged on a lowest possible level of human settlements. Technologies exist that can solve the problem of pollution from wastewater on a very basic level of a single house or residential area. Stormwater flows with different origin can be separated and disposed locally or re-used in a: single house. Industries should modify technologies so that, eventually, wastewater is not produced at all, instead all fluid, solid and gaseous residuals are recovered and recycled. Tools for implementation of such solutions are: legislation and administrative actions coupled with education programmes on all societal levels, increasing public awareness, competition rules of the market economy based on long-term profits. The goal is sustainability of the society by resource recovery and re-use. Demonstration projects, in which the rules of preventive approach and novel technology is applied may constitute a practical way of implementing such an approach.

AB The drainage area of the Gulf of Bothnia is 48 1,000 km2, of which about 2/3 is located in Sweden and 1/3 in Finland. About half of the drainage area is forest and only 4% is agricultural land.
   The total annual load of nitrogen on the Gulf of Bothnia is 175,000 tonnes, of which 55,000 tonnes comes from Sweden, 39,000 tonnes from Finland, 77,000 tonnes with atmospheric deposition on the sea surface, and 4,000 tonnes from nitrogen fixation. The Swedish pulp and paper industry discharged 2,300 tonnes of nitrogen into the Gulf of Bothnia in 1991, corresponding to 1% of the total nitrogen load.
   The annual load of phosphorus on the Gulf of Bothnia is 7,900 tonnes, of which 2,600 tonnes comes from Sweden, 3,700 tonnes from Finland and 1,600 tonnes with atmospheric deposition. Discharge from Swedish pulp and paper industry contributed in 1991 with 270 tonnes of phosphorus, corresponding to 3% of the total phosphorus load.
   The annual load of metals from Sweden, Finland and the atmosphere has been estimated at 3,200 tonnes of zinc, 14 tonnes of cadmium, 790 tonnes of copper and 300 tonnes of lead. The Swedish pulp and paper industry is assumed to be responsible for 2% of the zinc load, 4% of the cadmium load, 0.6% of the copper load and 0.6% of the lead load.
   The objective of this paper is to inform about nutrient and metal sources, located in Sweden and Finland, and to discuss where pollution abatement ought to be initiated. The loads of nitrogen, phosphorus and metals from the Swedish pulp and paper industry are not negligible in comparison with other minor anthropogenic sources, but when compared, e.g. with the atmospheric deposition directly on the sea surface, the contribution is small. An integrated national and international strategy, with clearly defined priorities and responsibilities, is urgently needed. Such an approach is only possible if an understanding of ecological and economical processes is used to implement a policy that will lead to a sustainable society and development.

AB The processes influencing nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) renovation in a natural wetland which had received oxidation pond effluent for twelve years were studied, and compared with current literature perceptions. Mass transport studies showed that 30-70% of the influent P was removed from the water column, which was much greater than published values suggest could be predicted for this highly loaded (approximately 34 g p m-2 y-1) system. Sediment traps studies showed that deposition of particulate P immediately downstream of confluences with arms of the wetland not impacted by sewage effluent (natural wetlands) was the dominant cause of P removal. Separation of the deposited-P into chemically definable fractions along with studies on the water chemistry, suggested that P deposition was associated with iron-organic complexes contributed dominantly from the natural wetlands.
   Considerable spatial and temporal heterogeneity was also demonstrated for nitrogen transformations. During summer most of the influent-N was in nitrate form which was all transformed during passage through the wetland. Isotope (N-15) dilution studies indicated that approximately 60-70% was denitrified, 25-35% converted to ammonium (dissimilatory reduction), and 5-10% assimilated. For most of the year, however, influent N was mainly in reduced forms. Despite this, significant quantities of nitrate were exported from the wetland especially at higher flows in spring-early summer. Assays on the sediment showed that there was a marked increase in nitrification activity at the confluence with natural wetlands. It is suggested that marked changes in sediment redox potential at these confluence sites provide ideal conditions for nitrification of sorbed ammonium which is subsequently flushed from the system in 'flood events'.
   The distribution and type of nutrient processing observed in this wetland are attributable to its configuration. The implication of these results to the sustainability of nutrient renovation in wetland treatment systems is discussed.

AB In urban areas there are many problems with water management: combined sewer overflows, peak flows, man-induced droughts, consolidation of the soil, damage from frost penetration, etc. It is preferable to look at all these problems In relation to each other, according the concept of integrated water management. This paper focuses on the possibilities for urban stormwater infiltration.
   The results of three studies are presented. The first study concerns the flooding of the Shirako River in Tokyo. It is shown that with the help of stormwater infiltration the floods can be reduced remarkably. The second study concerns combined sewer overflows and the discharge from treatment plants for catchments in Denmark and the Netherlands. When looking at the total yearly discharge from the combined sewer and the treatment plant. it is shown that infiltration is more effective than detention. The third study shows the impact of urban stormwater infiltration on the groundwater flux in an area in the south of the Netherlands.
   To relate the different results from the three studies an analogy is introduced with the human body. The combination of problems results in a so-called urban hang-over. It is shown that the positive effects of urban stormwater infiltration within an integrated approach are more significant than looking at all the effects separately.

AB Stormwater infiltration in urban areas gives cause for concern with regard to the risk of soil and groundwater pollution. Compared with conventional storm drainage, infiltration introduces different and widely unknown conditions governing the impacts and the fate of the pollutants, and it is therefore difficult to assess the overall environmental impact. This paper gives a state of the art assessment of the water quality aspects of stormwater infiltration and proposes ways of managing the inherent problems. The major stormwater pollution sources are highlighted and the different processes operating in the soil and groundwater are described. The paper also discusses how the environmental risk of urban stormwater infiltration can be assessed, and outlines the possibilities for designing environmentally safe infiltration systems.

AB The impact of river regulation has been to reduce flood frequencies on the Murray floodplain below Mildura. The lower frequency of inundation of wetlands reduces the number of successful breeding and regeneration events in floodplain biota, causing a decline in the health and vigour of many floodplain plants and animals. The potential for rehabilitation of floodplain wetlands through increased flushing flows has been demonstrated. The ultimate aim is to enhance habitat value and achieve maximum biodiversity. Future opportunities are identified for hydrological manipulation within river operating strategies to extend beneficial management on a floodplain scale to improve wetland habitat. These can be combined with rehabilitation techniques such as specific water allocations, grazing controls and physical works on individual wetlands to ensure preservation and sustainable management of natural wetlands along the South Australian Murray Valley. Results so far indicate that successful restoration of the wetlands will take a number of flushing events and will be dependent primarily on the acceleration and protection of natural regeneration processes.

TI WHAT MAKES RURAL FINANCE INSTITUTIONS SUCCESSFUL
SO WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER
LA English
DT Article
ID CREDIT MARKETS; INFORMATION
AB Providing affordable credit to the rural population has long been a prime component of development strategy. Governments and donors have sponsored and supported supply-led rural finance institutions both to improve growth and equity and to neutralize or mitigate urban-biased macroeconomic policies. But because of high risks, heavy transaction costs, and mounting loan losses, many of the programs have drained state resources to little purpose, reaching only a small part of the rural population and making little progress toward self-sustainability.
   There are, however, a few success stories. This article reviews the policies, modes of operation, incentives, and financial performance of four publicly sponsored programs in Asia that are widely perceived to be successful, to find out what economic, social, and institutional factors contributed to their success.

TI Vegetation and man in South America from a historical perspective
SO PHYTOCOENOLOGIA
LA German
DT Article
AB The history of interrelations between vegetation and man in South America can be divided into three phases: Indian phase, colonial phase and industrial phase.
   The vegetation regions of South America are related to the main groups of land-use in the Indian phase - a. hunting, fishing and gathering, b. aboriginal shifting cultivation combined with hunting, fishing and gathering, c. permanent cultivation and grazing, d. without land-use (Fig. 1).
   For these vegetation regions the adaptations of human land-use to the natural environment are treated. The good adaptation to the ecological conditions during the Indian phase of land-use has led to minor impacts on vegetation - with the exception of areas with permanent cultivation. As a contrast human influence during the colonial phase has been considerably stronger as a result of the implementation of inadequate land-use forms, exploitation without regard to sustainability and a strong increase in population figures. Yet still vast areas remained untouched by any human impact.
   The anthropogeneous impact during the industrial phase is similar in all vegetation regions and is not necessarily related to these. It is briefly presented with examples of mining, industry, hydroelectric and road construction. Following road construction, which has made large areas accessible in the first place, particularly in the Amazone basin, large-scale vegetation changes and devastation have taken place as results of slash-and-burn-cultivation and cattle farming.
   A general map of recent land-use area illustrates the enormous change of the past decades.

TI MEASURING THE SUSTAINABILITY AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF TROPICAL FARMING
   SYSTEMS - A MODEL FROM SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB New technologies must be developed in sub-Saharan Africa which are sustainable and economically viable. This paper discusses a methodology for measuring the agricultural sustainability and economic viability of tropical farming systems for new technology evaluation. The approach is based on the concept of interspatial and intertemporal total factor productivity, paying particular attention to valuation of natural resource stock and flows. Agriculture is a sector which utilizes natural resources (e.g. soil nutrients) and the stock and flows of these resources affect the production environment. However, in many cases, the stock of these resources is beyond the control of the farmer and must be accounted for in an agricultural sustainability and economic viability measurement. For example, soil nutrients are removed by crops, erosion or leaching beyond the crop root-zone, or other processes such as volatilization of nitrogen. Agricultural production can also contribute to the stock of some nutrients by leguminous plants such as agroforestry systems. Using a data set available at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, we compute the intertemporal and interspatial total factor productivity indices for four cropping systems in southwestern Nigeria using stock of major soil nutrients as the natural resource stock. Results show that the sustainability and economic viability measures are sensitive to changes in the stock and flow of soil nutrients as well as the material inputs and outputs. Where the contribution of natural resource stock and flows are important (such as in the case of alley cropping), the measures provide markedly different results from conventional TFP approaches. The advantage of this approach is that interspatial and intertemporal total factor productivity measures are computed using only price and quantity data, thus eliminating the need for econometric estimation.

AB The use of contour hedgerows of woody legumes to control soil erosion has been promoted amongst smallholders in the Upper Mahaweli catchment of Sri Lanka since 1988. The success of this program depends greatly on the properties of the different production systems occupying the alleys created by these hedgerows such as: profitability, time taken for profit to be realized, labour requirements, seasonal distribution of labour, environmental and economic stability, biophysical sustainability, the contribution of the system to the domestic needs of the farm family, adoptability of the system and successful management of the hedgerows. These properties were used to evaluate seven desktop farm models with different combinations of. seasonal crops, coffee-pepper intercrop, fodder-dairy, woodlot, and analog forest established in the alleys. The analog forest is a perennial polyculture which, like the traditional forest garden, is structurally and functionally analogous to the natural forest. It was found that a model with 40% seasonal crops, 20% perennial crops (coffee-pepper) and 40% analog forest made the best compromise between the properties under consideration. It is recognized that the socio-economic conditions that determine the appropriateness of this model in the Sri Lankan context are not universal and the extension of the analog forest concept into other tropical uplands is discussed.

TI ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC-CONDITIONS OF ORGANIC COFFEE PRODUCTION IN
   LATIN-AMERICA AND PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA
SO ANGEWANDTE BOTANIK
LA English
DT Article
AB Prospects and limitations of organic coffee growing are described under the presently increasing demand for this produce in Europe and North America. In 1991 the consumption of organic coffee, certified according to US-statutes was equivalent to 0.18 % of the total coffee market in the western world (2.9 mio t green coffee). In the most important European countries this market is expected to rise to a trade volume of at least 4400 t in 1995. Agronomic limitations of organic coffee production mainly relate to balanced nutrient supply. While low yielding plantations may cover their nitrogen requirements through leguminous shade trees, systems of high production intensity must add organic fertilizer, preferably compost materials. Preparation and transport of such materials - if available in required quantities - may render organic plantations uneconomic. Examples for the crucial impact of site and management factors on the severity of pests and diseases like the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and coffee rust (Hemileia vastatrix) are given. The importance of organic coffee growers' and marketing organizations for long term profitability and sustainability of such coffee production systems is stressed. Chances for organic coffee cultivation as an alternative to coca growing in Latin America are discussed.

TI APPROACHES TO THE ETHICAL EVALUATION OF ANIMAL BIOTECHNOLOGIES
SO ANIMAL PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE ANIMAL TRANSGENESIS; ANIMAL WELFARE; BIOTECHNOLOGY; ETHICS
AB The paper explores a scheme for the ethical evaluation of animal biotechnologies, exemplified by animal transgenesis. It begins with an overview of prominent ethical theories (deontological and consequentialist) and proceeds to apply them to four ethical principles, viz. autonomy, justice, non-maleficence and beneficence, in relation to the interests of the treated animals and of different groups of people affected by the technology. Evaluation is facilitated by use of a schematic device - an 'ethical grid'. The importance of public education and attitudes to biotechnology is illustrated by reference to recent public opinion surveys in the European Community. The paper concludes with a discussion of the impact of future trends in global population, food resources and environmental change, which emphasizes the need for a reappraisal of priorities in animal production systems. It is suggested that attempts to eradicate hunger, to improve animal welfare and to devise sustainable agricultural systems will be facilitated by greater investment in the emerging academic field of agricultural bioethics.

TI BUILDING COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK OF CAPABILITIES
SO CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Facility location decisions made by many U.S. manufacturers during the past decade yielded disappointing results.  These decisions were typically tactical, stop-gap actions which have resulted, at best, in short-lived benefits.  Many firms moved manufacturing overseas to obtain a factor cost advantage, only to find that the cost advantage was fleeting, and that the distances the move introduced between manufacturing and other key groups (e.g., customers, suppliers, development, and sales) had constrained their ability to compete.  This article explores the impact that facility location has on the critical capabilities that define a company's ability to compete.  It discusses the shortcomings of the ''traditional'' approach to facility location, which ignores the internal workings of the company, and outlines a new capability-centered approach that creates sustainable benefits by fostering the development and growth of the unique set of critical capabilities required by a company's strategy, customers, and competitive environment.

DT Article
ID CATCH-EFFORT DATA; APPROPRIATE; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES
AB Three approaches are commonly used to fit surplus production models to observed data: effort-averaging methods; process-error estimators; and observation-error estimators. We compare these approaches using real and simulated data sets, and conclude that they yield substantially different interpretations of productivity. Effort-averaging methods assume the stock is in equilibrium relative to the recent effort; this assumption is rarely satisfied and usually leads to overestimation of potential yield and optimum effort. Effort-averaging methods will almost always produce what appears to be ''reasonable'' estimates of maximum sustainable yield and optimum effort, and the r2 statistic used to evaluate the goodness of fit can provide an unrealistic illusion of confidence about the parameter estimates obtained. Process-error estimators produce much less reliable estimates than observation-error estimators. The observation-error estimator provides the lowest estimates of maximum sustainable yield and optimum effort and is the least biased and the most precise (shown in Monte-Carlo trials). We suggest that observation-error estimators be used when fitting surplus production models, that effort-averaging methods be abandoned, and that process-error estimators should only be applied if simulation studies and practical experience suggest that they will be superior to observation-error estimators.

LA English
DT Article
AB A study of Blanding's turtles conducted during 27 of the last 3 7 years provided demographic data sufficient to examine how life-history characteristics may constrain population responses of long-lived organisms. Eight independent estimates of annual adult survivorship exceeded 93%. Nest survival was variable and ranged from 0.0 to 63% annually, with a mean of 44% from 1976 to 1984 and 3.3% from 1985 to 1991. Recruitment of juveniles and adults was sufficient to replace individuals estimated to have died during the study. A life table for the population resulted in a cohort generation time of 3 7 years and required a 72% annual survivorship of juveniles between 1 and 13 years of age to maintain a stable population. Population stability was most sensitive to changes in adult or juvenile survival and less sensitive to changes in age at sexual maturity, nest survival, or fecundity. The results from the present study indicate that life-history traits of long-lived organisms consist of co-evolved traits that result in severe constraints on the ability of populations to respond to chronic disturbances. Successful management and conservation programs for long-lived organisms will be those that recognize that protection of all life stages is necessary. Programs such as headstarting or protection only of nesting sites, in the absence of programs to reduce mortality of older juveniles and adults, appear to be less than, adequate to save long-lived organisms such as sea turtles and some tortoises. The concept of sustainable harvest of already-reduced populations of long-lived organisms appears to be an oxymoron

TI EASTERN HEMLOCK REGENERATION AND DEER BROWSING IN THE NORTHERN
   GREAT-LAKES REGION - A REEXAMINATION AND MODEL SIMULATION
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations are currently extremely high in the upper Great Lakes region, and browsing may have severe negative effects on many forest species, including the eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), a former forest dominant. We suggest that this problem must be examined in an expanded spatial and temporal context It may be incorrect to generalize from limited evidence on one scale of observation (stand level) to explain a regional, long-term failure of tree species regeneration We reviewed hemlock life-history characteristics, its long-term behavior on a regional scale, and evidence from recent studies in the context of long-term forest ecosystem processes. We then conducted 400-year computer simulations within a neutral model framework (see Caswell 1976), relative to browsing to test whether other factors might adequately explain the lack of hemlock regeneration in the northern lake states. The results suggest that browsing is not the critical step blocking hemlock forest re-establishment on a regional scale. We suggest that the interaction of climate, disturbance, hemlock life history, ecosystem processes, and historical land use produce positive feedbacks that prevent hemlock regeneration usually before deer browsing can occur. There is need to modify current single-species forest management and silviculture, and to manage forests at a landscape scale in a way that maintains regional biodiversity and sustainable forest ecosystems. These modifications should include reduced deer levels and maintenance of larger patches of mature ecosystems. But we caution against broadly invoking the negative effects of any single factor such as browsing as a basis for management changes without a thorough assessment of all factors.

DT Article

AB Repeated and lingering famine in the Horn of Africa has produced enormous pastoralist refugee Populations in a region where livestock production is a major form of land use. Permanently settling destitute pastoralists has a record of failure. It can disrupt host land-uses, causing social and ecological problems, and prevent the utilization of very large grazing areas where pastoralism may be the only ecologically and economically sustainable land-use. Herd reconstitution should be considered an option in relief and rehabilitation programmes for pastoralists. This paper examines a design where the most proven and immediate way of sustaining stockless pastoralists - farming - can be used to facilitate restocking objectives. Using data gathered in Somalia, estimates of livestock carrying capacity are linked with forage resources, land area, livestock units, and the frequency of good, average, and poor (drought) water years, to explore the possibilities for incorporating restocking into refugee rehabilitation efforts.

TI FOREST RECONSTRUCTION AS ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Land restoration involves reconstruction of the native biota in a sustainable form. If reconstruction involves deliberate manipulation of biological organisms and the physical-chemical environment to achieve specific human goals, it qualifies as ecological engineering. Restoration which uses natural processes to achieve endpoints which are unpredictable but can be accepted because they are ''natural'' is not ecological engineering. In Japan a system of forest reconstruction has been developed which is based on knowledge of the potential vegetation of a site, knowledge of the methods of germination and growth of the species which compose the mature vegetation and a method of site preparation and planting. This ecological engineering approach has been used on 285 sites, in a variety of habitats, to form dense stands of vegetation to hide industrial complexes, control visual, noise and chemical pollution, stabilize soil and beaches and provide urban green space. The technique has also been used to restore tropical rain forest.

AB The concept of a sustainable energy sector has received wide attention since the publication of the Brundtland Report in 1987. This paper analyses the possibilities of establishing by 2010 and 2030 an energy system in the Nordic countries which prevents the critical loads of NO(x) and SO2 respectively on the most vulnerable Nordic ecological systems being exceeded. In addition, the present concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere should not be significantly exceeded within a time horizon to around 2050. Different scenarios have been investigated in order to analyse the scope for attaining such a sustainable energy development within the limits of existing technologies and known potentials of renewable energy sources. Data on the technologies are available in a special catalogue.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS VERSUS STRUCTURAL-CHANGES AS SUSTAINABILITY
   ALTERNATIVES - AN EMPIRICAL-EVALUATION OF NITRATE POLLUTION-CONTROL
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA English
DT Article
ID COSTS
AB The debate on the appropriate criteria for environmental sustainability encompasses a variety of approaches, ranging from conventional environmental standards through to complete system changes. In this paper, the relevance of the sustainability debate to practical decisionmaking is tested in an empirical context of nitrate pollution control in eastern England. Five alternative criteria (no control, aggregate and uniform standards, low and zero nitrogen-input systems) are specified for examination. These are assessed and compared by using a linear programming model. Conventional environmental standards are seen as more cost-effective than low and zero input systems. It appears that various approaches can be consistent with sustainability objectives and are relevant to environmental management problems. The choice of approaches has significant environmental and economic implications in practice. However, all the control alternatives have their own strengths and each may be preferable in some specific circumstances.

AB Since package tourism began on a small scale at the start of the 20th century, tourism and travel to Bali have gone through a series of overlapping and interlocking phases. By the 1930s the destruction of 'authenticity' and the process of transformation were already apparent to some. Tourism expanded and diversified. In the 1970s world travellers, and later 'surfies', contributed to the distinctiveness of Kuta, a way station on the Asian overland trail. Kuta grew, drew vibrant commerce, package tours, and a new youth scene, displacing world travellers to the periphery-the 'interior' or 'up country'-in search of elusive authenticity. Tourism became introspective, as the gaze of mass tourists and chic tourists focused on hotels, resorts, and each other; international, as world consumer goods displaced local products; and youthful, with the emergence of specialised package holidays, centred on action and consumption. Resort cycles were grafted onto each other in an unwieldy social and geographical synthesis, as Bali, increasingly diverse yet inconspicuous, became 'whatever you want it to be'.

   SUSTAINABILITY

LA English
DT Article
AB This paper outlines the concept of environmental sustainability (ES), shows why it is important to make it a top-priority goal, and why that will be difficult to attain but essential. The ES equation of impact = population x affluence x technology, is outlined. When the world approaches stability in both population size and the throughput of energy and materials per unit of production, we may indeed be approaching sustainability. As the world's population is apt to double every 40 years, and as only a few countries (e.g. Japan and Sweden) have managed so far to reduce the energy intensity or production, we are hurtling away from sustainability rather than even approaching it, Environmental sustainability can be approached by implementing four priorities: first, by using sound microeconomic means; second, by using sound macroeconomics to differentiate between use and liquidation of natural capital by means of environmental accounting; third, by using environmental assessment to incorporate environmental costs into project appraisal; and fourth - until the first three become fully achieved - by following operational guidelines for sustainability. Thus:
   1) Sound Microeconomic Aleans involve: (1) Getting the prices right: to reflect full social marginal opportunity cost; use the 'full cost' principle, or the 'cradle-to-grave' approach. (2) Repealing perverse fiscal incentives. (3) Strengthening the 'polluter pays' principles. (4) Including non-monetary values in project justification- (5) Adopting the transparency principle that markets can function efficiently only if relevant information is available at low cost. This involves the participation of people in decisions affecting them, and advertising who is polluting what and by how much.
   2) Sound Macroeconomics by Environmental Accounting is essential to discern decapitalization and to shift to using income rather than drawing down capital assets. Environmental accounting clarifies what is liquidation of natural capital from what is income. This is essential because decapitalization is frequently confused as income. Environmental accounting warns us when liquidation of potentially renewable resources exceeds their regeneration rates, such as in many forests.
   3) Environmental Assessment is part of the project selection process. The purpose of EA is to ensure that the development options under consideration are environmentally sustainable. Any environmental consequences should be addressed in project selection, planning, siting, and design. EAs identify ways of preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for, adverse impacts.
   4) Sustainability Guidelines: Until the first three rules are heeded and duly acted on, the following guidelines will be necessary: 1, Output Rule: - waste emissions from a project should be within the assimilative capacity of the local environment to absorb without unacceptable degradation of its future waste-absorptive capacity; and 2, Input Guide: - harvest rates or renewable resource inputs should be within regenerative capacity of the natural system that generates them. Depletion rates of non-renewable resource inputs should not exceed the rate at which renewable substitutes are developed by human invention and investment.

TI REFLECTIONS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL-DEVELOPMENT
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Of the renewable resources of The Biosphere, agricultural land, including its water resources, is very high among the most important, because it is elemental for human and domestic-animal life. The stability and sustained fertility of the soil largely depend on both prevailing soil-climate conditions and on anthropogenic influences.
   There are strict limits to the human interference which soil substrates, ground, soil, and surface water, flora, fauna, and microorganisms, can tolerate under moderate, let alone subtropical and tropical, soil-climate conditions. Economic, social, and aesthetic, yield of agricultural resources is limited even where economically and technically optimal use is made of capital and labour. A 'maximum sustainable yield' varies as a function of the soil-climate location, the established land-use system, and the technology applied, but only as long as this yield is not exceeded is the enduring availability of the resource ensured.
   With the demand for land and energy to produce food and agricultural raw materials rising throughout the world, per caput food production continuing to fall (especially in Africa), and the cultivated area per caput declining worldwide, the urgent question for the long term is how to preserve the natural resources of water, soil, and vegetation cover, and how to arrest desertification, deforestation, salinization, soil degradation, and soil erosion.
   These reflections centre on the call for farming systems which are suited to given locations and do no harm to the environment, and also for sustainability of agricultural production - two aspects which have been badly neglected in the past. The necessary simultaneous tasks of developing farming systems and preserving resources, can be tackled only in relation to specific locations and in a conducive development 'climate', where appropriate general conditions prevail. As a rule, the microeconomic development options for coping with these tasks can be improved only at a supra-farm and community level, and require new, environmentally oriented national agricultural and rural development policies.

ID SECURITY
AB The discussion above sought to clarify some of the key aspects of the relationships among impoverishment, population, and environmental degradation, and to pose a conceptual framework for addressing the issue. At various times, impoverishment has been identified: as a root cause of environmental degradation; as approximate cause; and as a contributing factor, merely reinforcing the linkage between environmental degradation and poverty often caused by wealth and greed. Despite an abundance of recent literature on the topic, it is not clear how environmental degradation and impoverishment are linked. What is apparent is that the relationship amongst these elements is complex, multidimensional, conditional and, at present, indeterminate. Although much of the evidence linking impoverishment and environmental degradation is anecdotal, it appears that the key issue is one of equity. Considerations of international equity, national equity, and intergenerational equity, must form the cornerstone of any strategy to confront the joint issues of environmental degradation and impoverishment.
   Promoting equity as a key principle or strategy, however, does not reduce the complexity of the issue; equity has an economic dimension, a political dimension, and a social dimension; numerous case-studies can be found to illustrate these dimensions, and a few are noted in our above discussion. This framework is also tied to the goal of sustainable livelihood security, which recognizes that security has both political and environmental components. Despite the complexity of these issues, it is still possible to develop general recommendations to be used as a guide to the design of intervention strategies by agencies providing development assistance. Accordingly, five such. recommendations are noted last above.
   The conceptual framework developed in this paper sought to extend the work on the impoverishment, population, and environment, issue begun by Leonard (1989), Holmberg (1991), and others. It is clear, however, that much more study of these complex interrelationships is needed before the linkages amongst them are well identified and understood. In addition, it is not enough to accept the importance of equity as a key principle of sustainable livelihood security; development agencies must be willing to act on this principle, and to design intervention strategies which aim at reducing and eliminating the inequities which are a major cause of environmental degradation.

DE SUSTAINABILITY; COMPATIBLE USES; FILTERS; SINKS; TRANSFORMERS
AB Wetlands have been intricately linked with humankind throughout the ages. Evidence of rice culture dates to the earliest age of humans, long before the era of historical records. Drain-field and raised-field agriculture occurred in wetlands throughout large areas of Mesoamerica before Hispanic exploration of the region. About 40% of the world's population uses rice as a major staple; rice culture currently occupies about 15% of the world's wetland area. Wetlands are valued for high biological productivity; as filters, sinks, and transformers for sediments, nutrients, and pollutants; and as buffers between aquatic systems and human activities on upland areas. Because of their varied ecological functions, wetlands are of interest to ecotoxicologists as potential sites for detoxifying pollutants. Estimates are that wetlands occupy about 3 to 6% of the world's land area. Attempts to define, delineate, monitor, and regulate the use of wetlands in the United States have proven to be extremely complex. Considerable progress has been made in classifying and monitoring changes in wetland areas on a nationwide basis, but less success has been achieved in defining and delineating wetlands. The United States experience should be a useful model for developing countries to study as they attempt to deal with wetland management and protection. As long as the world's population continues to grow at exponential rates, it seems highly probable that pressure to use wetlands to meet society's demands will increase. Consequently, opportunities to set aside reserves will decrease, and the role that wetlands play in maintaining quality of life will depend more and more on our collective ability to develop and promote compatible uses on wetlands.

AB For economists, sustainability and environmental valuation are connected in two ways. At the micro level, proper environmental valuation is required if projects are to be approved and rejected consistently with sustainability requirements. This is cost benefit analysis. At the macro level, many take the view that sustainability requires that national income measurement be modified so as to account for environmental damage. Such natural resource accounting is possible only if environmental damage is valued for incorporation into the economic accounts. The paper reviews the techniques that economists have developed for environmental valuation. In regard to cost benefit analysis and sustainability, it is noted that the technique on which most interest focuses, the Contingent Valuation Method, involves the extension of the domain of consumer demand analysis to include the natural environment. Contributions questioning the appropriateness of this are reviewed, and it is argued that they merit more attention from economists than they have received to date. In regard to natural resource accounting, it is argued that while there is little prospect of it achieving what its proponents claim for it, the modelling that it necessarily implies has the potential to both clarify valuation issues and play an important role in informing the policy process.

AB The hyperbolic relationship between power output (P) and time to exhaustion (t) is described as: (P- theta(PA)) . t = W', where theta(PA) is the power asymptote (or 'critical power'), which theoretically represents the highest sustainable power output, and W' is a constant which represents a limited amount of work which can be performed above theta(PA) (or 'anaerobic capacity'). The purpose of this study was to determine the validity of W' as anaerobic capacity, using maximal oxygen deficit as the criterion measure. Thirteen women (mean (+/- SD) age 23 +/- 2 years, height 1.67 +/- 0.07 m and mass 60.8 +/- 8 kg) and 13 men (mean age 23 +/- 2 years, height 1.74 +/- 0.1 m and mass 71.3 +/- 14 kg) performed two sets of five bouts of high-intensity cycling exercise to exhaustion, each bout on a separate day and at a different relative power. Individual W' were calculated by nonlinear regression of time with power, with time as the dependent variable. Oxygen deficit was determined during each bout, and the mean of the values obtained from the power output which elicited the highest values was used as the criterion for anaerobic capacity. Mean (+/- SE) values for anaerobic capacity for women were 179 +/- 10 J.kg-1 (W') and 177 +/- 10 J-kg-1 (oxygen deficit) and for men, 224 +/- 10 J.kg-1 (W') and 235 +/- 9 J-kg-1 (oxygen deficit). The W' estimates and criterion measures were the same (F1.24 = 0.61, p = 0.44), and there was no method-gender interaction (F1.24 = 0.26, p = 0.62). It is concluded that anaerobic capacity can be estimated accurately by the W' parameter of the power-time relationship during high-intensity exercise.

AB Conserving blodiversity has in recent years become a concern of the global elite because of the commercial potential of the emerging biotechnologies. But much of this blodiversity resides In the Third World tropics which are currently being drained of their biological and mineral wealth. This process goes on because the costs of the resultant degradation are entirely passed on to the poor of the Third World countryside who perforce have to depend on resources gathered or produced with their own labour from their surroundings. The elite have always found a substitute whenever a particular resource, or a particular locality, has been exploited to exhaustion. Indeed, given their record, commercial interests are likely to abandon the new found concern for conservation once they acquire control over adequate levels of genetic resources in ex situ storages. Long term conservation of biodiversity must therefore be attempted through empowering and suitably rewarding people of the Third World countryside whose well being is linked to the sustainable use of biological resources and conservation of the biodiversity in their own localities.

AB Bio-economic analyses indicate that the catch from the handline fishery on the Saya de Malha and Nazareth Banks (in the southwest Indian Ocean) is about equal to the estimate of maximum sustainable yield, and that the maximisation of fishery profit could be attained from roughly one-quarter of the contemporary fishing effort. The consequence of implementing quota management (ITQs) to effect an appropriate increase from the prevailing near zero fishery profit is investigated. Also included is an assessment of the likely value of future entitlements to engage in the fishery following the introduction of this form of management.

SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB The tropical moist forest of Honduras runs the risk of vanishing in the near future. Lessons from past experience in setting up forest protection schemes demonstrate that it is impossible to maintain forest reserves when the needs of the forest-dependant rural dwellers are ignored. Ten integrated management areas were established on the North Coast of Honduras as small-scale models of sustainable community forest development.
   Preliminary results of the CIDA-COHDEFOR Hardwood Forest Development Project indicate that forest management has been incorporated into pit sawing operations by delimiting forest boundaries, undertaking forest inventory and practicing silviculture. Lesser known species are being increasingly used for local and foreign consumption. The organizational and administrative capacity of the beneficiary groups have also been improved.

AB The increasing power and availability of computers has encouraged both the development of computer-based simulation models and their use in making decisions. It has therefore become increasingly important to understand what a model is, when it can be used validly and in what circumstances it can be said to predict. There are also several types of models not all of which are suitable for all purposes. This paper offers some guidelines for soil scientists. Models must be properly validated, particularly when used in decisions, and a recently published validation scheme is summarized. It is suggested that models should be analysed not only for sensitivity to changes in their parameters but in some circumstances to changes in parameter variance, particularly where the model may not be linear with respect to its parameters. Non-linearity may be a problem where parameters are subjected to spatial averaging or interpolation. Models are sometimes developed and validated at one scale and then used at a larger scale. Problems may result, and some questions are suggested that should be asked when a change of scale is envisaged. Some of the modelling challenges implicit in the evolution of sustainable forms of agriculture are discussed.

AB A quantitative model of the balance between inputs and outputs of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in African land use systems (NUTBAL) was recently developed at two scales: supra-national (38 sub-Saharan African countries) and regional (Kisii District, Kenya). Calculating inputs (mineral fertilizer, organic manure, wet and dry deposition, biological nitrogen fixation, sedimentation) and outputs (removal of above-ground crop parts, leaching, denitrification, water erosion) led to the conclusion that there are considerable net fertility losses in each growing period.
   In this paper, NUTBAL is elaborated into a decision-support model (NUTMON) to monitor the effects of changing land use, and suggest interventions that improve the nutrient balance. As input and output determinants cannot all be quantified equally well, the model recognizes primary data, estimates, and assumptions. The NUTMON determinants are mostly scale-neutral and can therefore be used to monitor nutrient balances at farm, regional, national and supra-national level. This is essential since the hierarchical levels interact. A number of recent interventions at the regional level (Kisii District, Kenya) are elaborated, including national fertilizer and produce price policies, fertilizer supply in small packages, zero-grazing, agroforestry, soil conservation measures, and increasing fertilizer use efficiency. It is shown that a major nutrient conservation effort in Kisii reduces nutrient depletion by approximately 50%, but does not entirely redress the N and K balance. To achieve the latter without reducing crop production, 75% of the district would have to be converted to a rotation system of maize and green manure cover crops, whereas 25% can remain under tea.
   NUTMON has the potential to become a dynamic tool for land use policies, geared towards a balanced nutrient status in African land use systems. It can assist decision makers in determining the effects of cuffent and alternative land use scenarios, taking account of both the productivity as well as the long-term sustainability of agro-ecosystems.

AB Nutrient depletion may be reduced by effective land use planning using a nutrient balance model and linear programming techniques to optimize the distribution of land use over different land units. This technique plans the geographical distribution of land utilization types and creates a more sustainable basis for agriculture in an area. In contrast with traditional land use planning where land utilization types are matched with land units on the basis of maximizing present agricultural production, this approach focuses on long-term effects. A case study was carried out in an area of 3340 ha in the southern part of a settlement scheme in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. Land units vary between young fertile volcanic soils and relatively old, leached unfertile soils. Land utilization types vary between extensively grazed pasture and intensively cultivated annual and perennial crops. Information on land units with its land qualities and on land utilization types was stored in a geographical information system which was integrated with a nutrient balance model (NUTBAL). This model, initially developed for Kenya and calibrated for local conditions in Costa Rica, was based on separate assessments of 5 nutrient input factors: mineral fertilizers, organic manure, wet and dry deposition, nitrogen fixation and sedimentation, and 5 nutrient output factors: harvested product, crop residue removal, leaching, denitrification and erosion. For every combination of land unit and land utilization type the nutrient balance was modelled. With a linear programming model, the land utilization types were distributed over the different land units, such that nutrient depletion was minimized in the area within a set of boundary conditions. Two different scenarios were elaborated. One in which all land utilization types were redistributed and one in which the location of forest areas was fixed at their present location.
   The optimized land use distribution based on cuffent land use types was compared with the actual distribution which had an average nutrient depletion of 22, 5 and 13 kg ha-1 yr-1 for respectively N, P and K. There was little difference in nutrient depletion between the two scenarios. The first scenario resulted in a nutrient depletion of 18, 3 and 9 kg ha-1 yr-1 and the second one in 19, 3 and 10 kg ha-1 yr-1 for N, P and K respectively. However, there was a large difference with the actual situation on one hand and the two scenarios on the other. In both cases there was a slight increase in the estimated agricultural production. The introduction of a nutrient depletion model in land use planning seems to constitute a useful complement to the existing procedures.

AB This paper explores the changing political ecology of soil and water management-the articulation of physical and political-economic processes-in the Loess Plateau of north-central China. Market-oriented reforms and the shift from collective to household farming have created a diverse array of tenure, management, and financing arrangements. In the process relationships between farm households, the collective, and the state have been altered, with profound implications for land use and sustainability. The paper reviews the political ecology approach and its relevance to environmental management in China. An outline of the physical and economic context of soil erosion in the Loess Plateau is followed by examination of the impact of reform on rural environmental management. Local innovations in the organization of environmental management are highlighted. The conclusion comments on the utility of the regional political ecology approach and suggests some critical issues for further research.

AB Native peoples have often been portrayed as natural conservationists, living in ''harmony'' with their environment. It is argued that this perspective is a result of an imprecise definition of conservation that emphasizes effects rather than actual behavior. Using foraging theory as a contrast, an operational definition of conservation is offered. Foraging theory assumes that foragers will behave to maximize their short-term harvesting rate. Hunting decisions that are costly in terms of short-term harvest rate maximization, yet increase the sustainability of the harvest are deemed conservation. Using this definition, alternative hypotheses are tested using data on the inter-specific prey choice decisions of a group of subsistence hunters, the Piro of Amazonian Peru. Results indicate that hunters do not show any restraint from harvesting species identified as vulnerable to over-hunting and local extinction. Decisions are made that are consistent with predictions of foraging theory.

DT Article
AB A critical discussion is presented of the dimensions of the concept 'sustainable development'.  The concept is shown often to confuse constituents of well being with its determinants, and to be unclear with respect to the level and rate of growth of sustainability.  The roles of population growth, technical progress and changes in preferences are often ignored.  Principal threats to countries are then enumerated.  The poor are identified as both the main cause and the victims of environmental degradation.  Options in the alleged choice between economic growth and environmental protection are presented, and it is argued that higher growth may be needed for environmental protection.  The technical question of the relation between growth and pollution, the physical question of the relation between pollution and the environment and the biological question of the relation between the environment and human beings are raised.  As a consequence of these factual questions, the relation between income and degradation has to be evaluated.  Several policies are then presented, including the problems of late starters, the international location of 'dirty' processes and the role of prices and of transnational corporations.  Finally, the need for global institutions (such as the Global Environmental Facility) is elaborated within the context of prisoners' dilemma outcomes and free rider problems.

AB During the past two decades, rapid advances in biotechnology and molecular biology have affected the understanding and treatment of human and plant diseases. The human and Caenorhabditis elegans genome-sequencing projects promise further techniques and results useful to applied nematology. Of course, biotechnology is not a panacea for nematological problems, but it provides many powerful tools that have potential use in applied biology and nematode management. The tools will facilitate research on a range of previously intractable problems in nematology, from identification of species and pathotypes to the development of resistant cultivars that have been inaccessible because of technical limitations. However, to those unfamiliar or not directly involved with the new technologies and their extensive terminology, the benefits of the advances in biotechnology may not be readily discerned. The sustainable agriculture of the future will require ecology-based management, and successful integrated nematode management will depend on combinations of control tactics to reduce nematode numbers. In this review we discuss how biotechnology may influence nematode management, define terminology relative to potential applications, and present current and future avenues of research in applied nematology, including species identification, race and pathotype identification, development of resistant cultivars, definition of nematode-host interactions, nematode population dynamics, establishment of optimal rotations, the ecology of biological control and development of useful biological control agents, and the design of novel nematicides.

AB Ten million chemical substances are registered scientifically, but only 1 per cent, 100 000, are known to be traded internationally, and only a fraction of these are assessed to establish (eco)toxicological risks through international and national authorities.  Only a few of the substances are natural or systemic; most are xenobiotic and poorly evaluated with respect to their environmental effects.  It is not only the chemical accidents that make newspaper headlines, but the creeping accumulation of pollutants in soils, sediments and groundwater which degrade the environment for future generations.  Ecotoxicological risk assessment still neglects this 'hidden pollution', as it usually deals only with the bioavailable fractions of chemicals in the environment.  The 'lost' (residue) fractions, however, can have non-linear and time-delayed effects (chemical time bombs).
   As governments need to protect their natural resources (soils, sediments, groundwaters) against negative impacts from chemicals, an ecosystem approach may help them to overcome the shortsightedness of current 'acute' ecotoxicological risk assessments.  The Netherlands' risk philosophy on chemicals in the environment is discussed as an example.  The National Environmental Policy Plan-2 (1994) stresses the chain of events associated with a chemical from the raw material, the side effects of its transport, production, use and disposal, to its final effects in the ecosystem, including the time-delayed responses of pollution.  A revised ecotoxicological assessment policy under the new NEPP will have to take account of such chemical time bombs.

TI EUROPEAN FEATURES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - A CONTRIBUTION TO THE
   DIALOG
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
ID AGRICULTURE; DIVERSIFICATION; PRODUCTIVITY
AB Within the framework of agricultural policy-making, the world-wide demands for sustainable development in general are related to the sustainable development of rural areas in particular. According to the definitions of sustainability, four fundamental aspects are considered: (1) food security; (2) employment and income generation; (3) environmental and natural resource conservation; (4) people's participation and empowerment. Different priorities may be set in the implementation of these aspects, expressing different attitudes toward nature, society and the ethical decisions involved. In line with these differences, different strategies for agricultural development are favoured, each with specific consequences for rural development. In this paper, we consider some of the basic features of the above-mentioned problems, focusing on technical aspects but touching upon some underlying social and ethical issues as well. We compare basic requirements of sustainable development with some features of recent strategies, such as integrated agriculture (integrated pest management and integrated plant nutrition systems) and low external input sustainable agriculture (LEISA). Special attention is given to the principles underlying autonomous ecosystem management (AEM), as applied in organic types of agriculture (OA). By aiming for the multi-purpose efficiency of the agro-ecosystem and its subsystems, OA complies with the requirements for a sustainable use of natural resources. Its impact on the environment, nature and landscape meet the requirements of European Community (EC) and national policies. Its economic performance is remarkably similar to that of comparable conventional farms. Yields tend to be somewhat lower than those of high external input agriculture (HEIA), but enough to meet the EC's efforts to diminish overproduction, and OA seems to meet society's need for sufficient good-quality food. Also, higher labour demands in organic agriculture, labour diversification and upgrading at the farm, and the social networks between farmers and consumers make a significant contribution to sustainable social development. This presentation of various development perspectives can widen the options for choices. Far from offering a blueprint or turnkey solution, these considerations are meant as a contribution to a challenging dialogue on agriculture's role in sustainable rural development.

TI FOSSIL ENERGY AND RURAL RECONSTRUCTION - POTENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE
   DEVELOPMENT
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Environmental problems such as smog, acid rain and the greenhouse effect have drawn increased attention to the role of fossil energy. To obtain sustainable development, a reduction in fossil energy consumption is necessary, in urban as well as in rural areas. In rural areas, land use and land exploitation as well as energy consumption depend on such factors as soil properties, water management systems and physical layout. These factors, and in this way the energy consumption, can be influenced by rural reconstructions. Modern rural reconstructions aim at improvement of land and water use conditions, accessibility, and conditions for outdoor recreation and for nature development. Energy productivity and consumption for various land uses as related to reconstruction of the countryside have been studied. This research paper focuses on the improvement of water management and parcellation, the rural road system, outdoor recreation and landscape-ecological systems. Results are applied to the Melderslo Land Reallocation Project in the southern Province of Limburg, in the Netherlands. Environmental problems require a reduction in fossil energy consumption, part of which has to be achieved in rural areas. This study shows that rural reconstruction can contribute to this goal.

AB Agricultural land use in the Netherlands, compared with that in other countries in Europe, is very intensive and labour productivity is high. However, there have been important regional differences in agricultural development in recent decades. Analysing these differences from a spatial perspective, three zones can be distinguished within the Netherlands: a central zone, a peripheral zone and an intermediate zone. The spatial problems are most pronounced in the central zone (urban-agrarian congestion) and in the periphery (problems of regional development). Another striking feature is the difference between the higher and the lower parts of the country. The greatest spatial problems occur in the higher parts of the Netherlands and particularly in the sandy areas, but within both the lower and the higher parts, there are still many differences in the relationship between agriculture and spatial organization. Within the higher parts of the Netherlands, the northern sandy area occupies a relatively favourable position. From a trend survey, it appears that future developments are surrounded by considerable uncertainties. In this situation, the elaboration of alternative directions seems necessary. Sustainability can be defined in different ways, and depending on this definition, the spatial conditions for a sustainable agricultural development vary. On the basis of a risk-avoiding attitude towards the environment and nature, regions with a less intensive agriculture which have had less environmental decay are a favourable starting point for a sustainable agricultural development. This holds especially for the North of the country.

ID AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB Traditional agro-ecosystems in Central Mexico have pre-Hispanic origins. Agricultural practices and society have coevolved through a long period of time. These agricultural systems can be characterized as follows: They have been practised during an extensive time-span; they are organized on an ecological basis so as to be largely self-sustainable, and they tend to use a larger input of human labour than of agricultural machinery. The individual aspects of the systems are simple but they are integrated into a complex network in which they become interdependent, and the system depends on that integration for its functioning. Agricultural knowledge is transmitted informally from one generation to the next within the context of family organization. The most important variable in these systems is the workforce, which has gradually been attracted to jobs in industry and to seasonal migration.
   This paper deals with some of the above characteristics of Mexican traditional agro-ecology in relation to the management of land, water and vegetation in Central Mexico. It discusses alternatives practised by peasants in view of a declining workforce and the possibilities of sustaining present practices under the pressures of an industrializing society.

AB The role of organic matter in soil fertility has been well known for hundreds of years, but the role of humus quality and its environmental functions has been discovered only during the last 30 years. We outlined in an earlier study our equivalent humus parameter for the characterization of humus content and humus quality, EH(G)=H(t ha-1) K, where H(t ha-1) is the humus content in tonnes per hectare at a depth of 1 m and K is the humus quality parameter calculated from extinction ratios of 1% NaF and 0.5% NaOH soil humus extracts. K values vary greatly; soils with raw organic materials show values around 0.0 1, whereas soils with the best humus quality (chernozems) have values of about 10. In investigations in recent years, we started from our general database of about 4000 sampling sites and extended the research with particular humus quality investigations over many hundreds of soil profiles for equivalent humus values. Compared with their humus status expressed in our results in log EHG values, podzols have the lowest values ( 1.50-1.70), brown forest soils are in the medium range (1.90-2.50) and chernozems have the highest values (3.00-3.20). The results represent 81.14% of the cultivated area of Hungary. As K values increase as a result of humification, which produces long-chain humic acids, and their C/N values decrease, we express at the same time the polyfunctionality of humic substances, by a general environmental protection capacity, EPC(G) = D(x) H-2 K, and a special environmental protection capacity, EPC(S) = D(x) H-2 R, where D(x) is the thickness of the soil layer in centimetres, H is the humus percentage and R = K/(C/N). This system is suitable for evaluation of the humus status in landscape planning, in land use and in the maintenance of soil fertility. Because of the important role of humus in binding toxic elements and xenobiotics, the results are of value for sustainable land use.

AB In modem maize production we have enhanced productivity primarily by changing the cropping environment to fit our maize hybrids. This strategy is becoming increasingly expensive, both in cost of inputs and in the environmental impact of these products, particularly when inappropriately applied to the field of production. In sustainable com production, hybrids are needed that are productive under a range of environmental conditions. There is increasing evidence of the potential for building genetic tolerance into maize hybrids for some major stress conditions such as drought stress, heat stress, cold temperatures and freezing, which can help to maintain productivity under adverse growing conditions. In several cases where genetic differences are simply inherited (controlled by one or a few major genes), they are easily incorporated into hybrids by choosing parents, making appropriate crosses and selections, and testing promising genotypes under stress conditions. Maize is generally grown in Hungary where soils are fertile, but increasing population pressure has pushed production into less favourable areas. In these suboptimal conditions we should genetically adapt maize hybrids to the adverse soil environment; this is receiving most attention by com breeders who intend to develop hybrids as components of a sustainable agricultural system. Maize lines and hybrids have shown differential responses to nitrogen fertilizer, and lines selected for high nitrogen use efficiently produced higher yields than lines selected for high yield under high nitrogen conditions. As with any breeding programme, the first step in adapting hybrids for sustainable systems is to define objectives carefully and describe the systems in which the hybrids will be produced. The choice of parents in a sustainable breeding programme is a critical initial step. We have found several appropriate traits of interest in high-yielding, well-adapted inbred lines that have superior combining abilities, in contrast to bringing in those traits from nonadapted introductions. From our point of view, to develop maize hybrids for sustainable systems, it would be desirable to identify genetic combinations that not only tolerate stress conditions but that also respond to favourable growing conditions. On the basis of our results we can conclude that maize breeding will be central to the planning and implementation of more sustainable systems for the future.

AB In the Netherlands. several research projects are being carried out to develop sustainable farming systems that are characterized by markedly reduced inputs of pesticides and fertilizers. In these long-term projects, weed management appeared to be a serious constraint on the introduction of sustainable agriculture. A method to monitor the population dynamics of annual weeds in crop rotations and to compare the results for farming systems is presented. Preliminary results show that, after 3-5 years, weed densities tended to be higher in the integrated systems than in the conventional reference systems. This trend in the population dynamics of weeds is discussed with respect to differences in inputs in weed management (active ingredients) . possible effects on crop yields and improved strategies to prevent increases in weed abundance.

AB In Hungary, there is a consensus on implementing ecological knowledge and principles in game and wildlife management. These aims can be achieved by the determination of relatively homogeneous game management regions and by regional planning. In this way game populations in ecologically similar areas can be managed on the basis of common long-term strategies; the objectives of nature conservation, forestry, agriculture and game management may also be harmonized. On the basis of game management, forestry and agricultural land use data, the opportunities for defining game management regions were investigated. In the analyses, spring population estimates and catch data of 682 game management units for 1990 were used. The game management units were classified using cluster and discriminant analyses. Statistical procedures revealed eight main groups of game management units; these groups were classified into three types (big game, small game and intermediate) on the basis of population density and type of game species killed. The boundaries of management regions were set in accordance with the geographical distribution of the three types as well as the natural characteristics of the country (e.g. forest distribution, mountains and rivers). Finally, six large game management regions were determined, in which 21 sub-regions could be distinguished. On the basis of their greater homogeneity, and knowing that management objectives can be more clearly defined and realized in smaller areas, sub-regions are suggested as operative planning units.

AB Two years after the start of changing the political system in Hungary, the discussions on the need for a transition in agriculture, and especially on the future prospects of agriculture, have still not ended. Experts, researchers and members of several interest groups related to agriculture still uphold extremely different opinions about the causes of the present crisis, and about the direction of future development. Questions concerning the present situation and the future of Hungarian agriculture can be answered only if we look at the problems from a broader perspective. First of all, the time-span of analysis should be expanded into both the past and the future. The present situation can be better understood if it is considered as a stage in a long-term development process. On the other hand, to speak about sustainability without looking into the future is meaningless. The application of a system theory can help to explain the need for the disintegration or decentralization of the structure of our agricultural system. If sustainable development is preferred, viable family farms have to play a dominant role in the new structure, even if at present there are no favourable conditions for them. Broadening the perspective of our analysis is also required to include the state and development of the national economy, the directions of expected changes of internal relations and external markets, including the time and effects of membership of the European Community, expected sociological and demographical trends in Hungarian society, the complex relationships of agriculture to regional development and to the environment as a whole, and the possible or required non-food and non-agricultural use of land and other natural resources.

AB Information on an environmental problem by itself is not likely to lead to a behavioural change in people unless there is some incentive for change. The aim of this study is to propose a specific programme for various groups in rural areas to take part in a project on alternatives to the present changes of land use. The groups mainly consist of farmers. schoolchildren and women. Not only is the economic contribution from the European Community agricultural policy taken into account, but at the same time a cultural incentive is to be implemented. Sustainable development in rural areas does not seem to be achievable if it is based on the results of scientific research alone. Specific environmental education is necessary for the groups of people directly involved in carrying out this kind of development.

AB Agricultural landscape use serves many purposes and many different people. For this reason, many public and private institutions are involved in the problem of optimal landscape use. In farms and rural family households basic decisions are taken on the intensity of agricultural landscape use. The decision-makers of these private institutions try to adapt optimally to the socio-economic framework. Public institutions play a key role in creating the socio-economic framework by policy-making. Thus, their members determine at least the use of agricultural landscapes and whether the use is ecologically and economically efficient and sustainable or not. To guide landscape use in an optimal direction, however, is a hard task for public decision-makers because nobody knows exactly what an ecologically and economically efficient and sustainable use of agricultural landscapes is. This problem results from unknown values, unknown interrelations between technology and nature, and unknown evolutionary processes in nature and in societies. Thus, there is a broad area for speculation about optimal landscape use. Such speculation, however, can be minimized by analysing options for action systematically. This is demonstrated in the case of an agricultural landscape in Southern Germany. In this case study, eight parts of a naturally homogeneous region are analysed by using multi-criteria valuation, linear programming and trade-off analyses. By combining these methods, the ecological and economical status quo of the uses of an agricultural landscape and possibilities for its improvement are evaluated to find out how the landscape can be used ecologically and economically in the most efficient way. Trade-offs representing a production frontier between the production of marketable and nonmarketable landscape goods are identified. With these findings, efficient agricultural policy options are revealed for the simultaneous achievement of ecological and economic efficiency and sustainability.

AB Hungarian planners have always been concerned with keeping in contact with the international trends of urban and regional planning. Studies of planning documents and analytical material, however, had little influence on the Hungarian planning process as long as the overall social context was fundamentally different from that elsewhere in Europe. Now, the need to learn and adopt the European planning systems and approaches has become an urgent actuality, and it is now that we experience the difficulty of giving up the outdated and customary approaches. The principles of contemporary planning are associated with sustainable development. This concept implies a commitment to facilitate much-needed development and to strike the right balance between that development and the interests of conservation. Thus planning is not a regulatory tool for preventing or restricting change, but, properly used, it can help to secure economy, efficiency and amenity in the development and use of land. The implementation of these generally accepted principles would involve appropriate legislative changes, as well as changes in the process of planning, the approach to planning problems, and in the structure and activity of planning organizations. Examples are presented of new planning approaches needed and emerging in Hungary under the impact of the contemporary processes and challenges. The topics to be considered are related to green belt policies, urban renewal actions, partnership schemes, public participation and the interrelationships of planning and management.

AB Many countries are now facing the realization that further development of the countryside is seriously hampered by the lack of attention given to ecological aspects. Land use and development of such for the future is urgently in need of planning in which ecological knowledge is embedded. Recently, a set of computer programs called ECONET was developed at the Agricultural University of Wageningen which anticipated such a need within a multiple land use planning environment. The program is based on the island biogeography theory, which stresses the importance of 'green corridors' for the movement of species from niche to niche, and on the meta-population theory. Based on network mathematics, the spatial relationship between niches of ecological importance can now be analysed within a vector-based geographical information system (GIS) environment, and the most important infrastructure areas to be reserved for the propagation of species can be determined. The program can be used for impact analysis studies in situations where plan alternatives are to be looked into. The state of the art for such strategic planning for sustainable rural development is presented by means of some case studies.

AB Problems in the relationship between agricultural dynamics and nature conservation affect the core of sustainability. In the Netherlands, this relationship has been a central issue in the successive national plans for physical planning in the last 25 years. In reality, physical planning and politics have not proved to be very successful in guiding agricultural dynamics within limiting conditions of sustainable development. From these experiences, some important lessons have been drawn which have given rise to new concepts for planning and policies for the rural areas. The concepts are as yet tentative and many questions still need to be answered.

AB Species distribution patterns within naturally fragmented habitat have been found to often exhibit patterns of pronounced nestedness. Highly predictable extinction sequences are implied by these nested species distribution patterns, thus the patterns are important to both the philosophy and practice of conservation biology. A simple thermodynamic measure of the order and disorder apparent in the nested patterns is described. The metric offers (i) a measure of the uncertainty in species extinction order, (ii) a measure of relative populational stabilities, (iii) a means of identifying minimally sustainable population sizes, and (iv) an estimate of the historical coherence of the species assemblage. Four presumptions govern the development of the metric and its theory: (i) the fragmented habitat was once whole and originally populated by a single common source biota, (ii) the islands were initially uniform in their habitat heterogeneity and type mix, and have remained so throughout their post-fragmentation history, (iii) no significant clinal (latitudinal) gradation exists across the archipelago so as to promote species turnover across the archipelago, and (iv) all species of interest are equally isolated on all is lands. The violation of these conditions promotes species distributions which are idiosyncratic to the general extinction order expected in fragmentation archipelagos. While some random variation in extinction order is to be expected, idiosyncratic distributional patterns differ from randomness and are readily segregatable from such noise. A method of identifying idiosyncratic species and sites is described.

AB Characteristics of dog populations and their accessibility for rabies vaccination were compared in an urban and a semi-rural area in Zambia. A total of 1190 households were interviewed. In the urban study area (Mutendere, a low income suburb of Lusaka) only 11 % of the households kept dogs with a dog:human ratio of 1:45. In the semi-rural area (Palabana) dogs were kept by 42 % of households with a dog:human ratio of 1:6,7. In conjuction with the study of the dog populations in these two areas, immunization of dogs against rabies was provided by door-to-door visits in both study areas and also through central point vaccination in the urban area. The attitude of the public towards free rabies vaccinations was positive, although some misconceptions regarding indications and modalities of treatment following exposure to suspect dogs were found.
   Approximately 50 % of the dog removals were as a result of disease and the demand for dogs was higher than the supply. Although only information on the owned segment of the dog population was obtained during the study, the proportion of ownerless dogs appeared to be very low. Generally, there is a need for better co-ordination between the different services involved in rabies control in Zambia to enhance the sustainability of vaccination programmes and improve the treatment of persons bitten by dogs.

AB Human population in the world is projected to grow from about 5.2 billion in 1990 to around 8.0-8.5 billion 35 years hence in 2025. About 44% of the world's population lived in an urban setting in 1990 compared with 34% in 1960. By 2025 the proportion will have grown to 60%. These demographic shifts have had, and will continue to have, major implications for the way in which food is produced and in the sustainability of cropping systems and protection of ecological resources. Particular attention is required to the type of agro-ecological zone and the influence of urbanization.

TI POPULATION-GROWTH AND NATURAL-RESOURCE USE - DO WE NEED TO DESPAIR OF
   AFRICA
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Population growth can lead to increases in agricultural output per head on a more sustainable basis. This was the conclusion of Boserup in 1965. The powerful mechanisms she identified can be illustrated by a study of Machakos District, Kenya during 1930-1960, which shows that, if policies are supportive, agricultural and non-farm incomes grow faster than even the rapid population growth rate experienced in Africa. Land use capability is not fixed, but can be transformed by investment, new technologies and good management. Lack of investment and consequent degradation are most likely at low population densities. While the study cannot foretell the future, Java illustrates a similar theme at even higher densities. It is essential that research understands the position the farmer has reached, and contributes, with other sources of information, to the technologies he or she can choose.

AB The most pressing problems facing the world in the 21 st century are considered to be population growth together with depletion of the world's resources, social instability, poverty in developing countries, consumerism and the division between North and South. None is held solely responsible, for all these factors interact, and all will contribute to the global challenge facing the next generation. The removal of barriers between North and South is called for, enabling a transfer of knowledge and technology from one to the other. Systems are required that do not squander materials and energy, and that provide for collaboration and cooperation between North and South in technical research and economic development. Only then will the ultimate goal of global sustainability be achieved.

TI DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH IN THE PACIFIC - WHICH WAY TO DIE
SO PAPUA NEW GUINEA MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Development in the Pacific has largely ignored the importance of health as a pathway and an outcome. This paper reviews the effects of development on health and health services in the region. It aims to highlight the plight of development that happens without considering the sociocultural and physical environments of the small island countries. The review shows that health and social conditions in the Pacific are deteriorating. The process of development has been externally controlled without community participation. Pacific leaders have been preoccupied with economic development and have not been cognisant of health and social consequences. During progress an enjoyable life can be achieved through sustainable development with community participation. However, indicators of economic growth in the Pacific do not correlate with those of health. The increase of rape, suicide, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and crime suggests that Pacific islanders are increasingly disillusioned by the present developmental approach: they have ceased to enjoy life before death. it is suggested that decentralized development planning with community involvement, integrating health and social considerations, would be the way out of this dilemma.

AB The agronomic and economic value of bee effected pollination is discussed in terms of world food production, our diet and the well-being of society. Improved agronomic practice has increased food supply over the past 50 years, but has caused a depopulation in both numbers and species of native bee pollinator within agricultural environments. This negative impact has resulted from land clearing, cultivation, irrigation, pesticides, overgrazing, and large tract of monocultures. Populations of honey bees available for crop pollination are also decreasing. As a result, we need to develop management systems for non-Apis species. The overall direction of these studies has been to provide options to seed growers or horticulturists and beekeepers in their choice of pollinator for several crops. In Europe, preservation and management of habitat has been proposed as the principal method to maintain pollinator numbers with some effort directed toward developing management systems for native bee species including bumble bees, Bombus spp., for specific crops. In North America, efforts have focused on the development of non-Apis species with significant success for the alkali bee, Nomia melanderi, various mason bees, Osmia spp., and the alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata. Three of these non-Apis species are briefly discussed in terms of biology and management system. For the alfalfa leafcutter bee, the detailed studies necessary to successfully integrate a native bee into a sustainable agricultural system are outlined.

TI FIJI - OPTIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SO SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
DE FIJI; ISLANDS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Fiji is prosperous island octonarian with a relatively large and varied resource base. Yet environmental and social strains are becoming more apparent as economic growth continues apace. There has been a growing awareness that new and more sustainable form of economic activity need to examined as short-term supplements and possible long-term replacements for the present core economic sectors. Two such sets of options are examined: a rediscovery of past methods and activities, and small-scale ventures which have emerged 'from below' as village-based operations. These have considerable promise but also limitations. This paper argues that unless there is a more fundamental shift towards cultural reappraisal away from a dominant developmentalist ethos, then sustainability cannot be achieved.

SO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper charts the increasing magnitude of budgetary imbalances in The Bahamas, and the accelerated growth in public sector indebtedness which has resulted. Arresting this trend and imposing a measure of sustainability on the public sector's debt will require significant expenditure restraint, and a major overhaul of the tax base. The urgency of such reforms is underscored by the weak medium term prospects for The Bahamian economy.

AB In this paper we argue that the organization's search for market imperfections reflects the information dispersion in the economy. We describe, within a Bayesian framework, the relative importance of and the mechanisms by which externally- and internally-based informational rents arise endogenously. We argue that, rather than viewing the strategic planning process as one where the firm must,pursue only one source of information, search should be viewed as evolving within a dynamically related system; progressing from externally-based to internally-based sources of rent as markets evolve.

TI REASSESSMENT OF MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR WONOGIRI RESERVOIR IN CENTRAL
   JAVA
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Principles of sustainable development are inviting a change in the approach used for reservoir management. Instead of designing and planning new reservoirs, more emphasis will be placed on management of existing reservoirs. Reservoir storage reallocation and reassessment ofreservoir operational rules are considered to be the two main problems to be addressed by reservoir research in the near future. Appropriate techniques for solving these two problems are necessary. An attempt at developing a sound methodology for a reservoir reassessment has been presented here. A simulation approach, based on the four probability criteria, has been used in this context for storage analysis. Reservoir management strategies have been reassessed using an implicit stochastic optimization model. The methodology has been applied to Wonogiri Reservoir located in Central Java, Indonesia. Analysis of the storage capacity indicated that the current capacity is larger than that required for the irrigation of an area of 25,319 ha, corresponding to the Wonogiri reservoir final development phase. Thus, the present size of the reservoir allows for additional multipurpose use of the reservoir storage. Optimization of the reservoir yield demonstrated that the reservoir can provide for municipal and industrial water supply and hydropower generation in addition to the current use of reservoir storage for irrigation water supply.

TI COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT OF RURAL WATER-SUPPLIES - LESSONS FOR

DT Article
AB External support agencies and national governments are advocating community management of rural drinking water supplies and sanitation facilities as an appropriate and realistic way of guaranteeing the long-term sustainability of systems in developing countries. Experience with community managed rural water supplies in the developed world can provide useful insights and guidance for the conceptualization, planning, and implementation of community managed water projects. Lessons from a successful water supply program in Western Canada suggest that a sustainable community managed water supply project must be demand driven, that the implementing agency provide an enabling environment, and that beneficiaries be legally empowered to assume ownership and responsibility for the completed systems.

AB Earth is the home planet, right for life. But rights, a notable political category, is, unfortunately, a biologically awkward word. Humans, nonetheless, have rights to a natural environment with integrity. Humans have responsibilities to respect values in fauna and flora. Appropriate survival units include species populations and ecosystems. Increasingly the ultimate survival unit is global; and humans have a responsibility to the planet Earth. Human political systems are not well suited to protect life at global ranges. National boundaries ignore important ecological processes; national policies do not favor an equitable distribution of sustainable resources. But there are signs of hope.

AB Soil information is a prerequisite for rational land-use planning for sustainable agricultural production. Landsat imagery provides a basic tool to study soil characteristics of judicious utilization of soil resources in the various development plans of a region. The Mahanadi Basin is endowed with a variety of geological formations, varied landscapes and faulted hills, dykes, intervening valleys, plateau and plains with luxuriant forest vegetation and ground water potential. The region remains undeveloped in spite of its rich natural resources. Recently an attempt to use aerial photographs as a base map was used for terrain analysis of the Mahanadi Basin. The results of the study are presented here.

AB The determinants of major parasitic infections in women have never been studied systematically. Much work remains to be done before vital gaps in our knowledge will be filled. The protocol presented here categorizes the determinants of parasitic diseases, and functions as an inventory for research needs and priorities. In this paper, the synoptic inventory is tested by matching it against the scientific knowledge of schistosomiasis that is at hand. Available data and existing lacunae are discussed. We conclude that the environmental, economic, socio-cultural, nutritional, genetic, biological and immunological factors which determine schistosomiasis in women are largely unknown. There is an urgent need for systematic and interdisciplinary investigations before appropriate and sustainable interventions can be initiated.

AB Forest-covered home gardens around the tropical world vary in their structure, but serve to supply food and other products for direct family consumption or marketing. Little quantitative data exist defining home garden structure. Thus, this study was undertaken to examine the variation in home garden structures in response to market or household needs and the subsequent variation in light interception and productivity.
   Four home gardens were studied in the Department of the Peten, in northern Guatemala. Areal extent and height of canopies were mapped in transects through four gardens representing a range of site water regimes and market orientation. Light intensities incident on the ground were measured along each transect to assess light use. Results showed structural complexity, with full canopy closure in the one or more layers within the canopy for most gardens. The garden architectures made efficient use of light and space, with intensive management for food and fuel production. Farmers grew the crops for both cash and family subsistence. One home garden on a comparatively dry site with shallow soil seemed less structured, with only a single broken canopy layer, but with diverse species of plants.
   The results indicate that development of gardens in this area utilized existing trees, thinning them to leave the most useful, and inserting other desirable trees and shrubs in the understory and in open spaces. This strategy seemed to maximize light use, regardless of market orientation.
   This look at the structure and composition of four home gardens, in a forested area of current immigration, demonstrated (1) variety of organization and plant components, (2) different architecture for different soil/site conditions and market orientations, and (3) efficient use of available light through the arrangement of plants.

TI SOIL-CONDITIONS, VEGETATION STRUCTURE AND BIOMASS OF A JAVANESE
   HOMEGARDEN
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE WEST JAVA; HOMEGARDEN; SOIL CONDITIONS; VEGETATION STRUCTURE; BIOMASS
AB The soil of a west Javanese homegarden was a clay-loam, humic Cambisol of medium fertility, with neutral to weak acid reaction. The 0.13 ha large garden contained about 60 plants species (excluding weeds), of which 39 supplied useful products and the remaining were ornamentals. Tree coverage was 81% and total ground cover, including ground litter and weeds was 99%. The vegetation was multi-layered. Total biomass was estimated to 126 t ha(-1), including 4.4 t ha(-1) of ground litter. Of the total biomass, 95% belonged to the tree compartment Cocos nucifera, Eugenia aromatica and Lansium domesticum alone constituted 75%.
   The homegarden resembled young secondary forest both in structure and biomass, and may be considered as a man made forest kept in a permanent early successional state. The nutrient pool stored in the vegetation was generally low compared to the soil reserves. Only the pool sizes of N and K constituted a significant percentage (5.5 and 11.7%, respectively) of soil reserves.
   It is concluded that the sustainability of the homegarden is connected to the medium fertile soil with large nutrient reserves, the large plant biomass directly and indirectly protecting the soil against erosion and drying, and a high species diversity providing a large variation in crop phenology and stability in nutritional supply. All this is in contrast to what has been experienced in most attempts of practising monoculture on sloping lands on Java.

DE WEST JAVA; HOMEGARDEN; PRODUCTIVITY; NUTRIENT CYCLING; SUSTAINABILITY
AB In a 0.13 ha homegarden in West Java, Indonesia, a 16-week study of production, nutrient in- and outputs as well as internal circulation was carried out in 19S9. Total annual agricultural production was 11.4 t ha(-1), of which 6.8 t ha(-1) were timber and firewood. Two thirds of the production was sold, the rest consumed by the owners. The productivity is more than twice the productivity of ricefields in the area, but can be raised further. Nutrient inputs in rainfall, streamwater and via N-fixation were estimated to a total of: 33 kg N, 7 kg P, 115 kg K, 79 kg Ca and 55 kg Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). Outputs in streamwater, harvest sold and erosion were estimated at: 42 kg N, 11 kg P, 151 kg K, 278 kg Ca and 83 kg Mg. Litterfall and pruning returned 10.0 and 7.5 t dry matter, respectively, per hectare to the soil annually. Throughfall was on average 92% of incident rainfall. Total amounts of nutrients circulated internally in the homegarden each year were estimated al: 223 kg N, 38 kg P, 373 kg K, 135 kg Ca and 50 kg Mg per hectare. This corresponded to 22, 44, 50, 20 and 30% of nutrients stored in the plant biomass, respectively. The balance is negative for all elements, the magnitude depending on whether the part of harvest consumed by the family itself is regarded as internal circulation or as an output. Compared to available soil reserves the system is likely to be sustainable for many years ahead, but may be vulnerable because of the high fraction of plant nutrient storage cycled annually.

   SUSTAINABILITY; ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS; HUMAN ECOSYSTEM
AB An analogue approach to analysing the traditional homegardens of Kerala vis-a-vis natural climax ecosystems is adopted. The traditional homegarden is apparently a climax ecosystem, where ecological succession is consciously manipulated by human beings. High intensity of vertical and horizontal space use, the highly dynamic chronological structure and the capacity to perform essential ecological processes make this ecosystem relatively sustainable. Homegardens in Kerala effectively serve as human ecosystems with their low input demand, staggered supply of outputs, and enhancement of habitat quality. However, recent trends in agrarian structure and the high market orientation exert pressures on the homegarden, and its sustainability as a human ecosystem is in question.

SO AMBIO

DT Article
AB Highly developed countries with expensive water-related infrastructure, sophisticated waterworks and treatment plants, still contribute to local and global pollution. Many developing countries still lack water-treatment facilities and environmentally-sound water management. These problems are especially accentuated in some of the large and fast growing cities of the world. Means of solving the problems involve a new holistic approach to resource management. The goal of such an approach is to close the cycles of residuals that damage the environment, and to recover resources lost in residuals emitted from human activities. The most important step is to apply pollution prevention, i.e. pollution control at the source. Present knowledge suggests technologies that can solve the problem of pollution from human settlements on a single-house level. Alternatively, wastewater may be treated locally and reused. Ecologically-sound technologies that already exist should be used whenever possible. Water management can be integrated with management of other human activities, such as waste handling, industrial production, transportation, etc. Tools for implementation of such solutions are: legislation coupled with education programs; changing competition rules of the market economy; i.e. developing a sustainable society through resource recovery and reuse. Demonstration projects, in which the rules of preventive approach and novel technology are applied, may constitute a practical means of implementing such an approach.

DT Article
AB The coastal zone is a complex ecosystem under the influence of physical, chemical and biological processes. Under natural conditions these processes interact and maintain an equilibrium in the coastal ecosystem. Man makes a variety of important uses of coastal resources, ranging from harvesting of living resources, extraction of nonliving resources, and recreation, to the disposal of wastes. Man's extensive use of the oceans introduces factors which bring about an imbalance in the natural processes, and may result in harmful and hazardous effects to life hindering further use. Man's pressure on the resources of the coastal zone is already manifest and will increase manifold. This calls for an immediate solution to the protection and sustainable use of coastal resources. The current sectorized approach to the management of human activities will not solve the problem because the different resources of the coastal zone interact in such a manner that disturbances in one cause imbalance in the others. This is further complicated by the sectorized approach to research and limited communication between policy makers, managers, and scientists. This paper discusses strategies for managing coastal-resources use through an integrated approach. The coastal zone is presented as a unified ecosystem in equilibrium and shows that man's extensive use of the coastal resources destabilizes this equilibrium. Examples from the Eastern Africa Region are presented.

DT Article
AB Abundance is defined as having enough of whatever one craves and/or needs in life. Thus, one can speak of physical abundance as being distinct from spiritual or social abundance. Abundance is an inherently personal, experiential concept, not amenable to objective, economic measurement such as income. The Amish people of Canada and USA provide an excellent case study in avoiding poverty traps and achieving a sustainable, abundant and healthy life, on very low incomes. This study of Amish culture has important social lessons and policy implications, both on the micro and the macro level. The study also reveals how the social and material security which the Amish enjoy, is however, achieved at the cost of severely circumscribed personal freedoms of thought and action.

TI FIXATION OF RADIATION, ENERGY AND CARBON-DIOXIDE IN-FIELD CROPS -
   RESULTS AND MODELING
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA German
DT Article
AB Radiation use efficiency and fixation of energy and CO2, respectively, represent important determinants of crop biomass productivity, especially in sustainable crop production systems generating energy via renewable resources. Utilization of environmental inputs by crop stands is strongly correlated with the chemical composition of storage substances. Oil crops show high energy concentrations in rhe seed mass due to high oil contents. The high energy concentration of oil crops is linked with a high CO2 fixation per unit or dry matter. In contrast, crops synthesizing mainly carbohydrates (cereals) are less effective in fixing energy and CO2 per unit of dry matter. Due to high productivity, cereals realize as high energy yields as oil crops when above ground biomass was compared. Environmental factors can affect utilization of solar radiation but also fixation of energy and CO2, respectively. Radiation use efficiency (g dry matter per photosynthetic active radiation intercepted) and conversion of solar radiation into bound energy (energy of dry matter per photosynthetic active radiation intercepted) are enhanced with increased nitrogen fertilization. In these conditions bound energy per unit of dry matter slightly increased in cereals but decreased in oil crops due to higher protein contents in the reproductive organs. CO2-fixation is closely related to both biomass production per unit of area and energy concentration in the biomass. CO2-fixation via seeds and grains varies between 0.54 kg m-2 (linseed), 1.40 kg m-2 (winter rapeseed), 1.06 kg m-2 (winter barley), and 1.62 kg m-2 (winter wheat), respectively.
   Different methods for modelling CO2-fixation by field crops generated rather uniform results. Carbon content in biomass failed to estimate reliably CO2-uptake by different species because oil and protein crops became considerably underrated by this method. Modelling CO2-fixation via determination of energy concentration in plant tissue was advantageous by using a standard analytical procedure giving results which were not affected by compositional differences between species.

AB Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) can be adversely affected by hunting and other human perturbations because of low population densities and low reproduction rates. The sustainable take of adult females may be as low as 1.5% of the population. Females and accompanying young are most vulnerable to hunting, and hunters have not consistently reported the sex composition of the harvest, therefore a method to confirm the sexes of polar bears harvested in Alaska is needed. Evidence of the sex of harvested animals is often not available, but blood or other tissue samples often are. We extracted DNA from tissue and blood samples, and amplified segments of zinc finger (ZFX and ZFY) genes from both X and Y chromosomes with the polymerase chain reaction. Digestion of amplified portions of the X chromosome with the restriction enzyme HaeIII resulted in subdivision of the original amplified segment into four smaller fragments. Digestion with HaeIII did not subdivide the original segment amplified from the Y chromosome. The differing fragment sizes produced patterns in gel electrophoresis that distinguished samples from male and female bears 100% of the time. This technique is applicable to the investigation of many wildlife management and research questions.

AB We evaluate a proposal to double sockeye salmon production from the Fraser River and conclude that significant changes will be required to current management processes, particularly the way available catch is allocated, if the plan is to be consistent with five major principles embodied in the concept of sustainable development. Doubling sockeye salmon production will not, in itself, increase economic equity either regionally or globally. Developing nations may actually be hindered in their attempts to institute other, nonsalmon fisheries in the North Pacific Ocean as a result of the possible interception of salmon. Further, other users of the Fraser River basin will have to forgo opportunities so that salmon habitat can be conserved. If doubling sockeye salmon production is to meet the goal of doing more with less, it will be necessary to develop more efficient technologies to harvest the fish. If increasing salmon production is to reflect the integration of environmental and economic decision making at the highest level, then a serious attempt must be made to incorporate environmental assets into national economic accounting. Finally, to promote biodiversity and cultural self-sufficiency within the Fraser River basin, it will be important to safeguard the small, less-productive salmon stocks as well as the large ones and to allocate a substantial portion of the increased production to the Native Indian community.

TI VARIATIONS ON A SIMPLE DYNAMIC POOL MODEL
SO FISHERY BULLETIN

ID CATCH-EFFORT DATA; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; REPRODUCTION; PARAMETERS;
   MOVEMENTS
AB A simple dynamic pool model (the ''base model''), defined by a linear weight-at-age relationship and a Cushing (convex power) stock-recruitment relationship, results in an explicit solution for the fishing mortality rate corresponding to maximum sustainable yield F(MSY). This solution's sensitivity can be examined by comparing it to solutions derived under alternative model specifications. Four such modifications are considered here: 1) replacing the Cushing stock-recruitment equation with an equation of the Beverton-Holt form; 2) generalizing from linear growth to a flexible form of von Bertalanffy growth; 3) allowing the ages of recruitment to the fishery a(f) and the mature stock a(m) to diverge; and 4) allowing for a finite maximum age in the stock. Exact polynomial solutions for F(MSY) are derived for each specification (except the fourth), and the potential bias introduced by use of the base model is examined for each. In all cases, the solution to the base model is within 10% of the solution to the alternative model under a range of parameter values.

TI A MANAGEMENT PLANNING CONCEPT FOR SUSTAINED YIELD OF TROPICAL FORESTS IN
   SABAH, MALAYSIA
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The paper presents a forest management planning concept presently under development at the Forestry Department of the State of Sabah, Malaysia. This planning procedure forms part of a comprehensive forest management system directed towards the sustainable production of timber and other produce in the commercial dipterocarp forests which cover an area of about 2.5 million ha, or approximately 40% of the total landmass of the State. In order to ensure application of this system, different field techniques are presently tested in an area of 55 000 ha logged-over forests (Deramakot Forest Reserve). The planning procedure is an amalgamation of methods successfully applied for sustained yield management in many other parts of the world and consists of a combination of enterprise-level and compartment-level management planning, the latter being a component which so far has not been applied in Sabah. This procedure is aimed at serving the forestry sector in Sabah as a tool to facilitate the changeover from pure exploitation of the forest to sustainable practices.

TI AGRICULTURE, SUSTAINABILITY AND THE IMPERATIVES OF POLICY REFORM
SO GEOFORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB Agriculture stands alone among resource sectors in Western industrialized countries as having the fastest growth in production/productivity during post-war years. Yet that growth in productivity and accompanying high levels of sufficiency has been at the expense of such goals as adequate income, community stability and resource/environmental conservation. In the process, agriculture has mimicked trends in the economy as a whole through increased segmentation and differentiation, throughput of non-renewable resources and divergence of natural and economic processes. Within the context of prevailing policies and market forces in OECD countries in general and Canada in particular, this paper evaluates the problems facing the sector and the nature of the trade-offs being made in the pursuit of high-input agriculture. It is argued that, while agri-business and market forces are generally responsible for a weakening of the links between environment and economy, numerous market distortions, precipitated by agricultural policy, do much the same. To achieve a better balance among the production and consumption functions of the land and to achieve an approach to future agricultural production which is sustainable will require changes in many of the rules, standards and conventions influencing the growth of food and fibre. From a policy perspective, the main task ahead is to redesign and implement programs which will encourage new 'opportunity sets' for the economic and competitive viability of the farmer and agricultural system, while at the same time meeting the nutritional needs of society and ensuring the protection of important environmental services and amenity values.

TI THE FIRING RATES OF HUMAN MOTONEURONS VOLUNTARILY ACTIVATED IN THE

AB 1. To quantify the net influence of muscle afferent feedback on the firing rates of human motoneurones, the discharge frequencies of single motor axons in the common peroneal nerve were recorded during sustained voluntary efforts performed in the absence of feedback from the target muscle. These data were compared with the firing rates of single motor units in the intact tibialis anterior muscle. In five subjects, recordings were made from fifty-two motor axons innervating tibialis anterior during acute deafferentation and paralysis of the dorsiflexor muscles produced by anaesthetic block of the nerve distal to the recording site.
   2. Maximal sustainable firing rates were determined for twenty-four motoneurones, twelve of which were classified as relatively low threshold (estimated recruitment level less-than-or-equal-to 10% maximal) and six as high threshold. Mean firing rates of the low-threshold motoneurones (21.7 +/- 2.7 Hz; +/- S.E.M.) were significantly higher than those of the high-threshold motoneurones (14.0 +/- 4.4 Hz). The mean firing rate of the twenty-four deafferented motoneurones during maximal efforts to contract the paralysed muscle was 18.6 +/- 1.9 Hz, significantly lower than the maximal firing rates of single motor units recorded from the normally innervated tibialis anterior muscle (28.2 +/- 0.6 Hz).
   3. During half-maximal efforts, the mean firing rate of eight deafferented motoneurones (10(-8) +/- 1.1 Hz) was significantly lower than that of intact motor units (16.5 +/- 0.2 Hz). A similar finding was apparent during minimal efforts; the mean discharge frequency of seven deafferented motoneurones during weak voluntary efforts was 6.0 +/- 0.9 Hz, compared with 7.3 +/- 0.13 Hz for intact motor units. Overall, the range of motoneurone firing rates (from minimal to maximal levels of voluntary effort) was significantly affected by the acute deafferentation, but was shifted significantly to lower rates.
   4. During sustained maximal voluntary efforts of at least 30 s duration the firing rate of deafferented motoneurones decreased over the first 5 s but was then maintained, i.e. there was no progressive decline as occurs with normally innervated motor units during fatiguing contractions. This observation supports a reflex origin for the normal decline in motoneurone discharge.
   5. It is concluded that muscle afferents in the common peroneal nerve provide a net facilitation to the tibialis anterior motoneurone pool, reflexly increasing the motor output at all levels of voluntary drive by approximately one-third.

Remediation strategy with Brassica species may be practical to reduce soil concentrations of Se to non-toxic levels. Collecting germplasm native to or growing in semi-arid and arid saline regions like Pakistan and India, may provide California and Western U.S. grown with additional plant materials to evaluate Se removal by Plant uptake in saline/Se contaminated soils.

AB The article describes three ideas for implementing the data and information and capacity building commitments made at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) as they related to the marine environment. The three selected examples are: Large Marine Ecosystems, the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction, and a coral reef monitoring and training initiative. These ideas are at various stages of development. The examples were chosen to demonstrate interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches to sustainable develop ment of the oceans.

TI LAND-BASED POLLUTION AND INTEGRATED COASTAL MANAGEMENT
SO MARINE POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Land-based sources of marine pollution and other activities degrading the marine environment are among the most intractable environmental problems of today because they involve so many essential and widespread human activities. Over 20 years of regional conventions, international guidelines and control efforts have not resolved the problem. This was taken up as a major issue in UNCED, which emphasized a national and regional approach closely associated with integrated coastal area management. A follow-up intergovernmental meeting is planned for 1995, but other measures will also be needed at all levels. Integrated coastal area management is the key to a successful approach to this difficult problem, especially since available financial assistance is inadequate. The small island developing States are a special case featured in Agenda 21 which are also the topic of a follow-up conference. The islands may be able to demonstrate approaches to small-scale integrated management and sustainable development that could serve as a model for larger countries.

TI TOWARD A DEFINITION OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE YAMPA VALLEY OF
   COLORADO
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Intensive tourism development in the town of Steamboat Springs and the surrounding Yampa Valley threatens to change the conditions that attracted visitors in the first place. This paper addresses a definition of sustainable development as the baseline for development in the valley. The historic evolution of the area is traced relative to social, economic, and natural environmental conditions. A set of indices that are typically used to determine carrying capacity for sustainable development are outlined. However, these quantitative indices do not form a definitive measure of sustainability. Based on a study of present land-use procedures and recent projects, qualitative indices supported by public opinion are found to be the determinants of acceptable levels of development in the valley. In addition, development in Steamboat Springs is found to have effects throughout the valley. Sustainability is thus defined by qualitative indices supported by public opinion and must be understood in the context of a valley-wide system.

SO NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB Non-sustainability of programmes and projects has become an overriding concern for the water supply and sanitation sector. Poor programme conceptualization, unimaginative planning, use of inappropriate technologies and rigid management approaches have contributed to high rates of programme failure. Five major water supply programmes undertaken during the UN Water Decade in the Western Sudan were analysed for their management approaches, appropriateness and sustainability. Results prompt the conclusion that sustainable projects need to adopt an adaptive and flexible management approach and to employ a conceptual framework which emphasizes community management, the empowerment of women, selection of appropriate low cost technologies, built in operation and maintenance strategies, cost recovery and institutional support to government.

AB In this Article, Professor Pound proposes a broad model for corporate governance in the post-takeover era. He argues that the takeover mechanism, which was the common method of effecting changes in corporate policy and control in the 1980s, has largely been supplanted by other, more democratic mechanisms. These mechanisms range from formal proxy fights to informal discussions between board members and investors. Professor Pound argues that this evolution reflects the reassertion of a ''political model'' of oversight after a long period of dormancy. Using empirical evidence, he illustrates that this model is preferable to the takeover model as a means of monitoring corporate management. Importantly, he predicts that the political model will prove more sustainable than other current, broad-based reform proposals because it better accords with American principles of democratic governance.

TI THE COEVOLUTION OF POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT - THE ECOLOGY AND IDEOLOGY
   OF FEEDBACK RELATIONS IN PAKISTAN
SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A new approach to the study of population and environment is proposed, based on Norgaard's theory of ''co-evolution.'' This theory is applied to two developments currently underway in Pakistan: the transfer of tree cover from public forests to private farms, and the partial replacement of woodfuel by dungfuel in household hearths. Both developments are characterized by feedback from the ecosystem to the sociosystem, which consists of a shift of regulatory mechanisms and complexity from the former to the latter. The efficacy of this feedback depends on an accurate perception of the process by the participating population. These perceptions are more accurate in the case of the forest-farm transition than the woodfuel-dungfuel transition, and this explains why the latter appears less sustainable than the former. Accuracy of perception also varies systematically between government officials and local peoples, primarily due to openness to explanations of behavior based on population/resource pressure. It is concluded that external development agencies have a potentially important role to play in demystifying perception of feedback processes between ecosystem and sociosystem.

AB Graziers in Australia and South Africa are subjected to similar climatic conditions, and drought remains a major concern for both. However, these countries have adopted different strategies to deal with drought relief. While Australia has made drought-stricken farmers ineligible for disaster relief, South Africa has introduced a system of relief that encourages farmers to undertake sustainable practices that also reduce the probability and duration of agricultural drought.

TI HOW HEALTHY IS SOUTH-AFRICA MEDICAL SCHEMES INDUSTRY

DT Article
AB An analysis of the membership demographics, the financial health and especially the sustainability of the South African medical schemes industry is presented. From the financial and in particular the actuarial analyses it is obvious that the current system is unsustainable, and if a private health care sector is to survive at all it will have to contain costs far more effectively than it has in the past. It is suggested that medical schemes (and other mechanisms of funding health care) review their funding policies and move towards advance funding of pensioner benefits, and also that the schemes be actuarially valued on a regular basis.

DE INTANGIBLE RESOURCES; CAPABILITIES
AB This article is concerned with the role of intangible resources in business strategy. In particular it is concerned with identifying the intangible sources of sustainable competitive advantage. Sustainable competitive advantage results from the possession of relevant capability differentials. Regulatory and positional capabilities are concerned with intangible assets; functional and cultural capabilities are concerned with competencies. A framework linking intangible resources to capabilities has been devised and is used as the basis of a new technique for identifying the relative contribution which the different intangible resources make to competitive advantage. The results of the use of this technique in six case studies are reported.

TI THE COMMUNITY - PERSPECTIVES FOR ITS SUSTAINABILITY
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
AB The community has been the core social planning unit throughout history. It was through a process of dialogue and consensus building within the community that problems were perceived and defined, and plans for solutions agreed upon and implemented.
   The rural communities of the Maya zone of Mexico and Central America are undergoing an accelerated transformation of their economic and political context and physical environment. However, after decades of neglect or domination by the centralized bureaucracies, existing communities and new social groups often lack the experience necessary to address the new opportunities for participation, planning, and management to achieve the goals and objectives of the people.
   This article reports on the problems and results of a program of community participation and sustainable development. In the participatory planning process the social group can create its own shared unity of purpose and sense of achievement. Thus, the participatory planning process is not only a tool for the identification and resolution of problems at the local level but is also a means for creating a sense of social well being, and recreating the community.

TI HOLISTIC SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT - IMPLICATIONS FOR PLANNING PROCESSES,
   FOREIGN-AID AND SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH
SO THIRD WORLD PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID RURAL-DEVELOPMENT; PARTICIPATION; APPRAISAL; PROJECT; LDCS
AB Sustainable development has been given several different interpretations. The earliest concept emphasised the need for economic development to be compatible with constraints set by the natural environment. More recently, it has also been stressed that economic development should be compatible with political and social institutions. So a holistic concept of sustainable development has emerged in which economic, ecological, social and political factors need to be simultaneously considered. Participation by individuals, particularly at the community level, is seen as an important means for achieving sustainable development and formulating development goals. These goals grow out of an organic interactive participatory process. Methods of project appraisal are reviewed in the light of sustainable development concepts. Then, the role of research and foreign aid in promoting sustainable development is addressed. To make the discussion more concrete, this analysis is carried out by considering the case of the South Pacific in general, along with a specific research project, namely giant clam farming. The paper concludes by pointing out important linkages which exist between planning processes, international cooperation in research and foreign aid.

ID GROWTH
AB The paper explores the interactions between the early concems of development economics, and the new issues which the discipline is called upon to address. Particular emphasis is placed on the meaning of development in the context of economic history, of industrialization and modernization, ''people-centered'' development, sustainability, political and civil liberties and development ethnics. The conclusion is that economists are responding to the challenges of these new concems, though these dimensions of development are as yet only imperfectly understood and articulated.

AB This paper examines the postsocialist transition in Eastern Europe, the reforms in China and the ''postdirigiste'' transitions in Latin America. The paper analyzes: the initial conditions that gave rise to processes of reform in the different countries; the main strategies for economic reform - shock treatment, gradualism and mixed strategies - discussing their conditioning factors and rationale; the actual record of these policies in terms of key indicators of economic performance such as inflation, GDP growth, external sector sustainability, progress in privatization and the social costs of adjustment. In addition, the paper discusses interdependencies between economic and political reforms during the course of systemic transformation.

AB Objectives-To determine whether beta carotene is therapeutically equivalent to retinyl palmitate in the formulation currently recommended by the World Health Organisation.
   Design-Randomised blind equivalence trial.
   Setting-Rural area in Senegal.
   Subjects-Children aged 2-15 years suffering from vitamin A deficiency as defined by abnormal results on eye cytology were randomly allocated treatment with retinyl palmitate (n=256) and beta carotene (n=254).
   Main outcome measure-Reversion to normal results on eye cytology as defined by the reappearance of goblet cells and normalisation of the epithelial cells.
   Results-Seven weeks after the supplement was given the percentages were 51.2% (124/242) children taking retinyl palmitate and 50.0% (123/246) of those taking beta carotene, who had reverted to normal eye cytology, a difference of 1.2% (95% confidence interval 0.8% to 1.6%). According to an equivalence testing procedure, the two treatments were statistically equivalent; the null hypothesis of non-equivalence was rejected (one tailed p value=0.03).
   Conclusions-Beta carotene supplementation seems to be a promising candidate for the alleviation of vitamin A deficiency. It could be given either as high dose capsule or through increased dietary intake. The challenge now is to improve dietary intake of vitamin A in programmes that are effective and sustainable at the community level.

AB The term agricultural sustainability has often been used to mean maintaining certain conditions. The concept is a multifaceted one involving agronomic. ecological, economic, social and ethical considerations. This review examines a number of methodological approaches to the analysis of sustainability, from conventional land evaluation techniques to more innovative views based on a historical perspective or a co-evolutionary approach.

TI AGROCLIMATIC ANALYSIS - A TOOL FOR PLANNING SUSTAINABLE DURUM-WHEAT
   (TRITICUM-TURGIDUM VAR DURUM) PRODUCTION IN ETHIOPIA
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Long-term weather data for six locations representing different eco-regions of Ethiopia were analyzed to generate information for appropriate management practices and research priorities of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var. durum) in Ethiopia. Among the weather elements examined, rainfall was variable and seasonal. The annual rainfall showed a random year-to-year variation both in space and time. Rainfall distribution during the growing period was much more variable than the seasonal total, resulting in a limited growing period. Dependable rainfall is much lower than the mean, particularly for the low-rainfall regions (Asmara, Metahara and Melkasa).
   A close relationship between the amount of rainfall and the length of the growing season was observed. The beginning of the rainy season (planting time) ranged from early June to mid-July and the end of growing season varied from early September to November. The growing season (moisture-available period) ranged from 60 days (Metahara) to 140 days (Debre Markos). The results suggest that crop improvement strategies and cropping systems for sustainable durum wheat production should be designed for the different climatic-soil zones based on a realistic assessment of prevailing weather conditions.

AB The problem of nitrogen pollution in European surface- and groundwaters has become a focus of recent European and Scandinavian directives, with legislation calling for a 50% reduction of N losses by the years 1995 and 2000, respectively. This paper provides a conceptual framework upon which management strategies to reduce losses of diffuse nitrogen pollution to surface waters may be based. The control of nitrogen pollution may take place through an increase in the complexity of the landscape, not throughout the catchment area, but rather in specific zones, the river corridor in particular. Within river corridors, riparian areas have been recognized globally for their value as nutrient removal ''buffer systems''. Studies have identified vegetation uptake and microbial denitrification as the primary mechanisms responsible for N removal in these systems. For these processes to function optimally on an annual basis, both vegetation and water regime must be managed. The establishment and management of riparian buffer zones in suitable places within river corridors, will provide a stable and sustainable water-protection function. This will complement future nitrogen input control strategies, needed for both the long-term protection of groundwater and surface waters in Europe as a whole, and for the proposed 50% reduction in nitrogen loading to the Baltic and North Sea coastal waters by the turn of the century.

AB In an attempt to limit erosion, to stabilize hillside farming practices, and to increase farm income, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) along with the Dominican Secretary of Agriculture implemented the Natural Resource Management Project (NARMA) in 1982. In 1985, over 90% of the farmers in the watershed were participating in NARMA's programs, greatly reducing hillside erosion rates. During the summer of 1990, 150 hillside farmers from 22 communities within the Ocoa watershed were surveyed and 20 officials from the Dominican government and local funding agencies were interviewed. This study documents the outcomes of NARMA's key programs and identifies major constraints to sustainable conservation projects.

AB In 1985 the University of Calgary in Canada and Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, Nepal jointly established the Diploma in Anaesthesiology (DA) programme in Nepal To evaluate the impact of the DA Programme and provide a data base for long-term planning we conducted a national survey in 1992. We sought to describe anaesthesia manpower and workloads, and to make an inventory of facilities, equipment, and supplies in different sized hospitals. Twenty-seven hospitals providing surgical services were included nine inside and 18 outside the Kathmandu valley. Seventeen of the 21 respondent hospitals had at least one specialist anaesthetist. The results identify both strengths and weaknesses in Nepal's anaesthesia services and provide important guidelines for planning When the DA course was launched there were only seven specialist anaesthetists in Nepal. The shortage of anaesthetists was an important factor limiting surgical services, and after DA graduates were posted to zonal (50 bed) and regional (150-200 bed) hospitals the surgical case loads doubled. There are now about 40 specialist anaesthetists in the country, of which half are DA graduates, but many hospitals have only one anaesthetist. That isolation, plus lack of continuing education (CME), are important factors threatening quality of care Recognizing the singular role of the DA programme in alleviating Nepal's shortage of anaesthetists, we conclude that it should be renewed and strengthened to meet the needs of the next decade Techniques commonly used at the zonal level: regional, draw-over, and total IV anaesthesia, should be stressed. At the same time fresh initiatives are required in CME and higher education for the renewal of teaching staff Serious deficiencies and mal-distribution of equipment, supplies and drugs were found, with considerably poorer inventories in smaller- and intermediate-sized hospitals To accommodate better the chronic shortages of anaesthetic gases and scarcity of reliable anaesthetic machines in hospitals of that size, we conclude that they should not attempt to stock N2O. Using air-O2 for all inhalational anaesthesia would streamline equipment needs reduce the risks of hypoxia, and simplify training. Since much equipment, even of relatively recent acquisition, was unserviceable, establishment of regional repair and maintenance centres and training of service technicians are urgent needs. Lastly we believe that the community of professional anaesthetists, through their Society, must play a pivotal role in determining standards of practice of anaesthetists and developing innovative means to maintain communications and disseminate CME.

LA English

DE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT QUOTAS; ALASKA; RURAL DEVELOPMENT; FISHERIES;
   NATIVE COMMUNITIES
AB In the continually changing realm of groundfish management in the North Pacific, a new category of resource harvesting became operative as of December 1992. The Community Development Quota (CDQ) program is designed to provide western Alaskan native villages an opportunity to participate in the economic bounty of the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands pollock fishery, as well as promote local economic growth, employment, and educational opportunities. Reserving a portion of the Total Allowable Catch for these communities signifies a revolutionary new approach to resource management in the Bering Sea and to sustainable development in rural Native villages. On the surface, CDQs are similar to previous allocative measures, but closer scrutiny reveals several major variances, primarily in scope and design. To provide the reader with a useful framework in which to view the new fishery, this article will present a brief background of CDQs and potential community impacts, discuss inherent problems and implications of the program for these communities, and compare the system to a terrestrial equivalent: resource management under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.

TI SUSTAINING LOCAL INVOLVEMENT

DT Article
AB In examining OECD member countries' experience of urban regeneration programmes three issues in particular stand out: whether the real focus of urban policy is the regeneration of urban economies, or the more equitable distribution of benefits; in consequence, the nature of the main policy objectives to be pursued; whether problems of urban decline can be tackled effectively by policies targeted on spatially delineated areas of disadvantage.
   This paper examines these issues and argues that any measures to tackle urban problems require improved co-ordination of public programmes, the promotion of sustainable development and the involvement of the local community.

AB In the course of the last decades the export oriented countries of Asia have registered the highest rates of growth in the world.  They have also shown that their model of development is sustainable under changing international economic conditions. In broad terms, the main feature of the trade and industry policies of these countries has been selective intervention to create comparative advantage and acquire competitiveness in increasingly sophisticated goode. This article describes the policies pursued and their results so as to assess to what extent these policies can be transferred to different Latin American contemporary circumstances. The analysis focuses on three countries well advanced in outward oriented industrialization (South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore), three countries that followed the former in achieving high rates of export growth (Thailand, Malasia and Indonesia), and Turkey that was extraordinarily successful in its export promotion policies.

AB The target zone exchange rate literature, initiated by Krugman (1991), has relevance for the question of what is the optimal level of reserves. In particular, Krugman and Rotemberg (1990) show that there is a well defined boundary between a target zone that is subject to speculative attack and one which is sustainable. This boundary is defined by whether reserves are sufficient or not. This paper reviews briefly both the target zone and speculative attack literature. The appropriate level of reserves for Ireland is then calculated and discussed.

AB The way to sustainability for poor cities proposes a systematic framework for achieving sustainability based upon community ecology that recognizes and builds on the complex interdependence of activities within any city.  The author stresses the need for much greater attention to local knowledge and institutions and to those aspects of a better quality of life that depend not on high resource use but on health, participation, social interaction and integration and more freedom to choose satisfying lifestyles. It also considers how basic needs can be met without high levels of resource consumption.

AB The fate of seed of six annual medics produced in spring 1987 and used in the pasture phase of cereal-pasture rotations was followed over four years. The medics were sown at low and high density, and seed set beyond 1987 was prevented by cultivation in 1988, and by herbicides in 1989 and 1990. The breakdown of hard seed was measured in the summer and autumn of each year, and the number of seedlings was counted after the first seasonal rains in the final three years. The survival of seeds buried at three depths was monitored. Seed of Medicago noeana lived longer than that of M. rotata and M. polymorpha. Survival of M. rigidula and M. truncatula seed was intermediate and there was no effect of planting density on survival. Breakdown of hard seed was least in the first year and increased in the second and third years. Within any year breakdown began in late summer or early autumn, beginning earlier as the seed aged. Seed burial enhanced germination in the year following seed set, depressed it in the second and third years, and had little effect in the fourth year. The net effect of seed burial on survival was therefore slight. The results suggest that the use of medics that have harder seeds than currently available cultivars, and medics in which germination is delayed until late in the autumn, will increase the sustainability and productivity of cereal-pasture rotations in semi-arid areas.

LA English
DT Article
ID STAND
AB The establishment of cooperative or 'community' forests in buffer zones surrounding national parks in developing countries is a popular means for protecting the parks. The success of such endeavours depends, in part, on a sustainable supply of timber. Consequently, comprehensive forest management planning and, specifically, the determination of annual timber harvests must be made an integral part of management activities of project staff and supporting organizations. The regulation of a community forest on the Osa Peninsula was achieved by specifying and simulating polycyclic silvicultural prescriptions to generate the required periodic timber yields. The long-term scheduling of harvests was formulated as a classic 'Model I' linear programming problem, modified for polycyclic systems. First period harvest was maximized subject to area, cutting cycle, and volume control constraints. The model was used in a case study of a 1200 ha community forest comprised of 15 landowners. The results suggest that the cooperative will have difficulty supplying a proposed portable sawmill, particularly once the conversion of the forest from the unmanaged to managed state is complete.

TI FORESTS AND UNCED 92 - A FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB The conservation and protection of the world's forests has become a critical international environmental issue in recent years as the demand for forest products has increased significantly, and population growth and the rate of deforestation have reached perilous levels. These realities are challenging our stewardship of the resource.
   Strictly regarded in economic use terms for centuries, forests are increasingly being recognized tor the social, cultural, spiritual and recreational values and benefits they furnish to humankind. At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED '92), convened in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, significant global progress was achieved in altering the outdated approach to forest management reflected in the concept and practice of ''sustainable yield'', substituting it with the futuristic vision inherent in ''sustainable forest development'' (based on the paradigm envisioned in the report of the Brundtland Commission, 1987).
   Canada has played an active role in advancing this change with respect to forests in the discussions leading up to and including the Conference. The key priorities expressed in Canada's National Forest Strategy, the domestic action plan which is underpinned by the shared vision of Canadian industry, labour, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governments on sustainable forests, were advanced as our negotiating pillars in Rio. The outputs which emerged from the ''Earth Summit'' proceedings in the Conventions on Climate Change and Biological Diversity, Agenda 21, and particularly, the Guiding Principles on Forests, are all intimately linked with this Canadian position and constitute the groundwork for future dialogue and action on sustaining the planet's forests.

AB ''Sustained yield'', and its derivative ''Sustainability'' have become a very common and frequently used term outside forestry and forest science.
   Almost every political committee - both international and national - is referring to these terms when discussing conceptional issues.
   The occurring difficulties in using this term in practice led the author to a critical discussion of the sustained-yield concept in forestry. It was the intention to discuss ethical and political contents of the concept that might be helpful for its further development not only in forestry.

TI TOWARDS A WORLD HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE OBSERVING SYSTEM
SO HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
LA English
DT Article
AB There are considerable difficulties in assembling global hydrological data sets in near real time, data that might be used for deciding investment for sustainable water resources development and management, for environmental protection and for studying global change. Several reasons exist for these difficulties, a new one is that many countries have recently been cutting back on hydrological networks and the services that operate them. This means that knowledge of the World's water resources is getting worse when the global demand for water is accelerating. By way of contrast, meteorologists have ready access to large volumes of global data, much of it in real time, principally through WMO's World Weather Watch (WWW). A World Hydrological Cycle Observing System (WHYCOS) is proposed to facilitate access to global data and support hydrological services in need. A world-wide network of about 1000 stations is planned for the largest rivers, together with associated data bases and products to meet the needs of users.  WHYCOS would start in Africa with a 100-station network and be expanded to other regions. It is a necessary tool for averting the coming water crisis and essential to the drive towards sustainable development.

ID ENTITLEMENT THEORY; REASSESSMENT; AFRICA; LIGHT
AB Famines are not explainable as short-term crisis events; they are more a function of long-term trends resulting from a failure of policy to deal appropriately with demographic, environmental, productivity, and political pressures, all of which make segments of society and regions highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Optimal strategies for famine prevention must, therefore, build on a recognition that institutions and their policies play a key role, and that long-term forces are as relevant as short-term factors- An end to armed conflict will go far to prevent famine in Africa, but without sustainable economic growth, supported by well-designed public action and improved private participation, the risk of famine will persist.

TI SUSTAINABLE YIELDS OF MAJOR CROPS IN SATPURA REGION OF MADHYA-PRADESH
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB A field experiment was conducted during 1980-90 with rainfed sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], maize (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], gram (Cicer arietinum L.) and irrigated wheat (Triticum aestivum L emend. Fiori & Paol.) in farmers' fields to study sustainable yield index. The crops were grown in a wide range of soils in the region. The mean yields obtained were 2-3 times by following the improved production technology compared with the control. The sustainable yield index was 0.60-0.81, indicating that minimum guaranteed yield would be more than 60-81% of the potential yield (1.61-3.86 tonnes/ha), with higher probability in gram and maize. The sustainable yield index was 0.32-0.59 in the control, and it was highest in maize (0.8 1) and the lowest (0.60) in gram. In respect of performance of crop varieties, the highest sustainable yield index (0.92) was noted in 'Punjab 1' soybean and the lowest (0.57) in 'Lok 1' wheat, indicating that the minimum guaranteed yield would be more than 92 and 57% of the potential yield (1.67 and 4.27 tonnes/ha) respectively in these crops.

TI PUTTING THE AGROCHEMICAL INDUSTRYS IPM TRAINING AND EXTENSION
   RESPONSIBILITIES INTO PRACTICE IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE AGROCHEMICALS; PESTICIDES; INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT; TRAINING;
   EXTENSION
AB The potential benefits of IPM to farmers and environment are well documented. But the agrochemical industry can also profit in the long term by assisting farmers to make the change from over reliance on pesticides towards sustainable pest management. More directed and selective use of agrochemicals within IPM systems results in resistance management, longer product life, improved grower satisfaction and minimum operator contamination. In practice this change of strategy requires more than the launching of new 'IPM-compatible' products. Research priorities, sales language, product information (including labels) and customer training must all be critically reviewed. Such reviews are most urgently needed in developing countries, where the private sector may be the only available source of farmers' pest control information, but where companies are most reluctant to invest due to small profit margins and the formidable logistics of influencing thousands of scattered small scale growers. The development of such a strategy for rice, vegetables and other tropical crops is described, stressing minimum doses or action thresholds and conservation of indigenous natural enemies. For extension, a social marketing approach will be employed for improving farmers' pest/beneficial recognition skills, understanding of natural population regulation, pesticide application quality and personal protection.

AB Cataract remains the leading cause of blindness worldwide, curable though, by a simple procedure. The backlog of cataract patients in developing countries is mounting despite sustainable and downright efforts by health ministries, international voluntary and non-governmental organisations [1]. The current situation has put many developing countries in a difficult dilemma. The authors present a review of a pilot-project in decentralised eye-care in Mutasa District, Zimbabwe. Cataract surgery is performed by a district general doctor as an alternative to clearing the cataract back-log in developing countries, as suggested in several studies [2-5]. It is important to persuade the health ministries to adopt this simple and cheap policy [6, 7].

AB A production model was developed that simulates the harvest of a predetermined number of eggs of house cricket, Acheta domesticus (L.), per day by regulating the numbers and ages of adults in the breeding colony. With a discard age of 24 d, the production model predicted a sustainable harvest of almost-equal-to 4,000 (4,440) and 6,000 (6,660) crickets per day when four or six pairs, respectively, of newly emerged adults were added per day to an initial breeding colony of 50 pairs. Natality was based on the number of nymphs surviving to 7 d per surviving female, after which little nymphal mortality occurred. Ovipositional surface area availability was not a limiting factor in egg production.

AB High concentrations of B and Se found in some arid environments are detrimental to sustainable agriculture. Vegetation management may be a remediation strategy designed to reduce soil B and Se concentrations to nontoxic levels. Two separate field experiments were conducted to study B and Se uptake in four different plant species grown in soil containing high concentrations of B (water-extractable B ranging from 1-10 mg kg-1 soil) and Se (total soil Se ranging from 0. 1-1.2 mg kg-1 soil). The four species were Brassica juncea L. Czern and Coss (Indian mustard), Festuca arundinacea Schreb cv. Fawn (tall fescue), Lotus corniculatus L. (birdsfoot trefoil), and Hibiscus cannibinus L. (kenaf). In the 1990 experiment, there were no differences in either tissue B or Se concentrations among the species. The mean tissue concentration was 105 mg B kg-1 dry matter (DM) and 0.75 mg Se kg-1 DM, respectively. In the 1991 experiment, mean shoot tissue concentrations of B ranged from a low of % mg kg-1 DM in tall fescue to a high of 684 mg B kg-1 DM in leaves from kenaf. Indian mustard accumulated the greatest amount of Se (> 1 mg Se kg-1 DM), while the mean tissue concentration among the other three species was 0.36 mg Se kg-1 DM. For both experiments, soil samples were taken prior to planting and after harvest for each species to a depth of 0 to 30 and 30 to 60 cm, and analyzed for water-extractable B and total Se. Summary data from all species indicated that extractable soil B and total Se concentrations were reduced between 0- to 60-cm soil depth by 52 and 48% in 1990, and by 24 and 13% in 1991, respectively. Planting any of the four species tested in B-laden soils may lead to a reduction in both B and Se concentrations in the soil.

AB The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) historically has focused largely on the protection of human health. In recent years, however, the Agency has devoted greater attention to the ecological component of environmental problems. This paper analyzes EPA's authority to evaluate and implement ecological protection, and examines how the Agency uses that authority. The article also addresses the concept of ecological risk, and the relationship between environmental quality and sustainable economic development.

TI ORGANIC AGRICULTURE IN OHIO - AN ECONOMIC-PERSPECTIVE
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Production agriculture is under pressure to become more environmentally sound and sustainable. The current intense use of farm chemicals is a major source of contention. There are several ''technologies'' that may allow farmers to produce with fewer chemical inputs. The economic incentive for a farmer to adopt one of these technologies is influenced by the relative costs of the various inputs, relative values of outputs, and the physical nature of input and/or output substitution. This paper evaluates farm-level profitability of organic farmers relative to ''conventional'' farms by statistical comparison of random samples of all Ohio farms and of Ohio certified organic producers. Results suggest that while Ohio certified organic farmers receive premium prices for commodities and have dramatically reduced expenditures for fertilizers and other chemical inputs, they also realize reduced yields and have smaller farm units. Whole-farm profits do not differ greatly between organic and conventional farms. This fact relies importantly on the existence of premium commodity prices. A significant increase in the volume of organic marketings, without offsetting increase in the demand for organic commodities, would result in substantial reductions in organic price premium.

TI SPRING WHEAT YIELD TRENDS AS INFLUENCED BY FERTILIZER AND LEGUMES
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The benefits and environmental impacts of using fertilizers rather than legumes to promote more sustainable agricultural production systems are in question. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the long-term consequences of withholding fertilizer N and P on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields, and to determine if inclusion of legume-green manures (GM), or hay crops in rotations can maintain wheat yields. A 34-yr crop rotation experiment being conducted at Indian Head, Saskatchewan, on a Udic Haploboroll with heavy clay texture, was used to assess the influence of fertilizer (N and P), sweet-clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) GM, and alfalfa-bromegrass (Medicago sativa L. - Bromus inermis Leyss.) hay on yield trends of hard red spring wheat grown on wheat stubble in rotations of varying cropping intensity. When no fertilizer was applied, yields of wheat grown on wheat stubble trended steadily downward for fallow-wheat-wheat (F-W-W),(decline of 0.41 bu/acre/yr) due to increased soil erosion and declining fertility; yield trends declined less sharply (0.16 bu/acre/yr) for unfertilized continuous wheat, because of less soil erosion. Inclusion of GM in an unfertilized GM-W-W rotation increased the yields of wheat grown on stubble, but the yield trends were still negative (decline of 0.39 bu/acre/yr), probably because legumes do not provide any P to the system. Even though the unfertilized F-W-W-hay (H)-H-H system had low available P, it maintained stubble wheat yields at a generally constant level (decline of 0.08 bu/acre/yr) due to low soil erosion and because the hay-containing system markedly increased N-supplying power of the soil. The addition of N and P fertilizer at rates based on soil tests resulted in a positive divergence in yield trends of wheat grown on stubble in F-W-W and continuous wheat systems as both available N and P were maintained at a high level. Legumes probably will require added P if they are to sustain crop production in a manner similar to that provided by responsible use of fertilizers.

AB Macroeconomic reform, initiated by the New Zealand government since 1984, was the driving force for new resource management legislation. Before that time, planning procedures were found to be deficient as new economic and environmental objectives were required to have more flexibility, innovation and integration. The Resource Management Act 1991 was the result of over five years of legislative development. The outcome has been a broadly based consensus on land use resource management aims and means for achieving these. The Act delegates powers to the lowest level of government where matters can be properly considered and administered - at regional and territorial level. The aim has been for fewer rules and costs with improved environmental quality.

TI THE WIND POWER CONTRIBUTION
SO NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB The UK has the best wind resource in Europe with an accessible potential that is comparable with the total UK electricity consumption; wind farms on land could realistically make a contribution of about 10% to UK needs within little more than a decade.  Much progress has been made with wind turbine technology since the 1973 oil crisis stimulated the development of the modern wind turbine. Machines now being installed typically have rotors about 35 m in diameter mounted on tapered tubular steel towers about 35 m high.  Each turbine has a rated output of about 400 or 500 kW and will deliver, on average, about one-third of this; each, therefore, saves the emission into the atmosphere of over 1000 tonnes of CO2 per year.  Turbines are typically installed in groups of about 20, sited in very windy areas and feeling their output to consumer via the electricity distribution systems.  Britain's first windfarm was commissioned in Cornwall in December 1991, and in the subsequent 18 months a further 15 were completed, giving an installed capacity of over 100 MW.  These windfarms have been privately financed, and a key element in their financing has been the premium price paid for their output (up to December 1998) as a result of the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation Orders specified by the Government in 1990 and 1991.  Details of the next round of Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation for Renewables are due to be announced soon, and are anxiously awaited.  The evidence so far is that given sustained support through the 1990s, wind-generated electricity will be fully competitive with electricity from clean coal-fired power stations, as well as from nuclear power, by the end of the decade.  Windfarms need to be sited in exposed rural areas, and it has been suggested that the public would find them visually unacceptable.  The evidence so far is that in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, a large majority of the public find them visually acceptable, and indeed welcome them as symbols of the clean and sustainable generation of electricity.

TI COMPARISON OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ELECTRICITY FROM DIFFERENT
   SOURCES
SO NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB There is a variety of techniques for comparing the environmental impacts of electricity from different sources. Only monetary valuation of the impacts offers the prospect of providing comparison on a single baseline.  Unfortunately, practical and methodological problems generally prevent accurate valuation.  For fossil fuel electricity generation the major environmental externalities result from acid deposition, tropospheric ozone and global warming. For nuclear power the main issues are major reactor accidents and long-term waste disposal.  Some broad estimates of environmental externalities (in p/kWh) are given from each, based on available scientific evidence and valuation studies.  The uncertainties and methodological problems associated with valuation prevent any reliable statement about the relative magnitudes of externalities resulting from fossil and nuclear generating options.  In both cases, some of the impacts are incompatible with stricter interpretations of sustainability.  The important environmental impacts of most renewable electricity generating options concern human amenity.  With some exceptions, where areas of more than local significance for ecology or recreation are concerned, the monetary values of the impacts will be small.  For most electricity conservation technologies, the externalities are negligible.  Energy conservation and renewable electricity supply will therefore form key components of a sustainable energy system.

AB The decline in soil organic matter with cropping is a major factor affecting the sustainability of cropping systems. Changes in total C levels are relatively insensitive as a sustainability measure. Oxidation with different strength KMnO4 has been shown to be a more sensitive indicator of change. The relative size of soil C fractions oxidised by 333mM KMnO4 declined with cropping, whilst the relative size of the unoxidised fraction increased. Changes in delta(13)C ratio have been used to measure C turnover in systems which include C3 and C4 species.

ID SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT; CONSEQUENCES
AB Social impact assessment (SIA), an applied form of social research essential to good development planning, has expanded to many Third World settings and is currently being adapted to conservation and protected area initiatives. The ex ante or pre-project focus of SIA, ordinarily a virtue, is diminished in value as projects increase in complexity, uncertainty, and duration. Protected area development, by design and definition, embodies each of these characteristics. This paper makes the case for continuous, multi-stage SIA, drawing on insights from adaptive management as recently applied to environmental impact assessment. Such an adaptation of protected area social impact assessment (PASIA) conforms well to the complete project cycle review approach used by the World Bank, the particular institutional focus of the paper.

AB Population pressures within southern Africa are forcing people to increasingly crop land of a diverse and fragile nature where the risk of environmental degradation is high and current yields are low. Much of the earlier tillage research is not applicable to these conditions as efforts have concentrated on commercial farming with tractors for the higher potential regions. It is only in the last 10-20 years that attention has increasingly focused on the tillage requirements of small-scale farmers in these harsh water-scarce semi-arid regions. There is now a clearer understanding of the basic environmental constraints to crop production in terms of climate, poor soil fertility and structure and considerable advances have been made towards improved systems but there is still a lack of appropriate tillage system recommendations. All too frequently researchers have omitted the farmer input from their considerations and endeavours. Consequently limited consideration has been given to the social (e.g. land tenure), economic (e.g. credit), energy (labour and draught power) and technical constraints experienced by the small farmers they are trying to help.
   The need to develop more adoptable interim systems is therefore indicated but the slim margins within which small farmers must operate highlight the continuing need for sound tillage research to backstop the development of sustainable conservation systems.

ID SOIL
AB Soil tilth has been defined in terms of a 'Physical Index' based on the product of the ratings of eight physical properties - soil depth, bulk density, available water storage capacity, cumulative infiltration or apparent hydraulic conductivity, aggregation or organic matter, non-capillary pore space, water table depth and slope. The Physical Index and a tillage guide were used to identify the tillage requirements of different soils varying in texture from loamy sand to clay in the semi-arid tropics. The physical index was 0.389 for a loamy sand, 0.518 for a black clay loam and 0.540 for a red sandy loam soil and the cumulative rating indices in summer and winter seasons were 45 and 44 for loamy sand, 52 and 51 for red sandy loam and 54 and 52 for black clay loam soils, respectively. The compaction of the loamy sand by eight passes of a 490 kg tractor-driven roller (0.75 m diameter and 1.00 m length) increased the physical index to 0.658 and chiselling of the red sandy loam and black clay loam increased the physical indices to 0.686 and 0.729, respectively. The grain yields of rainfed pearl millet and guar and irrigated pearl millet, wheat and barley increased significantly over the control (no compaction) yields by compaction.
   The chiselling of the soils varying in texture from loamy sand to clay at 50 to 120-cm intervals up to 30-40 cm depth, depending upon the row spacing of seedlines and depth of the high mechanical impedance layer, increased the grain yields of rainfed and irrigated maize on alluvial loamy sand, rainfed maize on alluvial sandy loam and red sandy loam, rainfed sorghum on red sandy loam and black clay loam, irrigated sorghum on black clay loam and rainfed black gram on red sandy loam, pod yield of rainfed groundnut, tuber yield of irrigated tapioca and fresh fruit yield of rainfed tomato on red sandy loam and sugarcane yield on black clay soil, significantly over the yields of no-chiselling systems of tillage such as disc harrow and country plough.

AB Research on different tillage systems and their role in soil and water conservation in south Asia is reviewed. Tillage has shown marked influence on soil hydraulic characteristics and to some extent on soil chemical and biological properties particularly organic matter cycling. The importance of conservation tillage in reducing runoff, soil loss and in ensuring sustainable agricultural production in the region is emphasized. The role of other tillage practices, for example contour cultivation, contour bunding, terraces and tied ridging, in increasing the profile water storage is discussed.

AB The preservation of the non-renewable soil resource is a vitally important aspect of the long-term development of conservation tillage and pasture production systems in the Pacific region. Improved grasses and legumes are commonly sown in New Zealand and Australia to increase pasture and animal production. Pastures sown by conventional cultivation are becoming increasingly expensive and time consuming. Crops and pastures sown in rotation by conservation tillage methods (including no-tillage) are becoming more common.
   This paper summarises major soil and plant management factors and their interactions with the environment and machinery, which improved biological reliability and sustainability of no-tillage in the Pacific region. Collectively the research has demonstrated that the habitat of seeds under no-tillage together with their resulting seedling microenvironments, are pivotal to yield and are influenced by micromanagement of the soil, surface residues and soil fauna in the sown slot zone. These parameters are themselves influenced by the action and the design of seed drill openers. Soils under sustained no-tillage systems, involving organic matter return, contain vapour-phase moisture even in dry soils, often together with oxygen-enhanced diffusion potential largely unmatched by tilled soils. Description of technology designed to create and exploit such environments is made.
   The causal processes of failures and the high biological risks associated with conventional no-tillage drills are also explained. Provided appropriate pest control measures are taken, this technology has resulted in biologically predictable, reliable and sustainable crop establishment and production systems.

AB Research in southern African savannas relating tannins in woody plant foliage to palatability, forage value, soil nutrients and ungulate population dynamics is reviewed in the light of a recent international workshop on browse/browser relations. The importance of tannins is highlighted, yet there remain nagging outliers to all suggested patterns. Effects of tannins may vary with chemical structure. Their prime mode of action, as digestibility reducers or as potential toxins, remains uncertain. Herbivores differ in their adaptations to cope with tannins, and hence in their susceptibility to these effects. Plants appear to show much intraspecific variability in leaf tannin levels. Standardization of the chemical tests used for tannins is essential for interpreting patterns. Understanding the role of tannins in browse palatability and use has important implications for livestock production and for resource conservation. Stocking with browsers adapted to cope with tannins would be a more sustainable option than using chemical supplements to neutralize the effects of tannins in browse fed to grazers like cattle.

AB For an industry facing both internationalization and impending maturity, available strategic prescriptions suggest four options which are at variance with each other. To assess the validity of competing strategic prescriptions, the outcomes of these four options are examined empirically by means of a longitudinal study of the vehicle components industry. Rather than going for strategies based on market domination, large British vehicle component companies would generally have performed better had they concentrated on resource-based priorities; market domination has generally only proved feasible in national markets, and the outcomes of such strategies have proved little short of disastrous. Explanations are explored through a case study of one British national market leader and through international comparisons from Germany, the U.S.A. and Japan, which highlight the importance of manufacturing policies as primary sources of sustainable competitive advantage.

DT Article

   COUNTRIES; GROWTH; WEALTH; AID
AB The basic premise of this paper is that private voluntary savings, is the sustenance and safeguard of the future economic growth and development of the region. Nonetheless, by definition, an internal imbalance between saving and investment triggers the international transmission mechanism of external savings. This effect appears immediately in the balance of payments of the countries. The globalization of finance and integration of the world economy, generates a close linkage between trade and finance which is necessary to descry. As a result, the determinants of savings in Latin America, are studied in the context of a policy of external opening, liberalization of her markets, especially the financial markets, and the careful analysis of how external shocks are absorbed. Arising as of special interest in this new policy, is the ''stabilizing'' or ''destabilizing'' influence of the exchange rate on relative prices. The nominal exchange rate, can be used as an anchor for stabilization purposes in order to control inflation. These findings allow the outline of a new policy for growth and development in Latin America; a policy that restores the importance and priority of voluntary private savings in the economy, through the new vitality of liberalized markets, the reduction of the fiscal deficit and of regulation. The final goal is to achieve the twin objectives of price stability with sustainable and balanced growth. The Mexico of Salinas and the Argentina of Menen, are two good examples of this new vision.

TI LAND RECLAMATION IN EGYPT
SO TROPENLANDWIRT
LA German
DT Article
AB Land reclamation in Egypt is of ancient origin, which for several millennia focused on the alluvial soils of the Nile Valley and Delta. The assumption of power by Mohammad Ali marked the beginning of a rapid increase in cultivated land expansion as he embarked upon large scale reclamation works and canal construction/expansion. Much of the reclamation efforts during this period were directed toward the saline clay soils of the Northern Delta between the two branches of the Nile, land reclamation in the deserts was only minor. During the second half of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century land reclamation in Egypt made only small progress. After the 1952 revolution a new attempt in land reclamation was made. Efforts from there on have increasingly focused on the reclamation of desert sands, as most of the remaining areas of undeveloped alluvial soils are relatively small and/or have particularly difficult reclamation problems.
   This paper reports in its main part on the historical background of land reclamation in Egypt and discusses the problems in connection with Egypt's efforts to increase its arable land area by land reclamation. Finally the question is raised whether the reclamation of desert sands is sustainable, especially under consideration of Andreae's hypothesis that ''with rising income expectations and standards of living, higher agricultural yield levels are necessary. And this is why in the course of development land which has been regarded until now as fairly fertile will become marginal land, and the previously marginal land will go out of production.'' Besides this the question of water supply to irrigate the newly reclaimed land is still open.

TI THE DETERMINATION OF MIXING RATIOS IN AFFORESTATION ASSORTMENTS -
   SATISFYING FARMERS NEEDS FOR MULTIPURPOSE FORESTS
SO TROPENLANDWIRT
LA German
DT Article
AB A method is presented which determines the mixing ratio of tree species in afforestation assortments in such a way that the utility of afforested land is maximized with respect to the needs of rural populations. The approach is based on the assumption, that forest land has to fulfill many functions in the daily life of rural populations and that for each function certain species are preferred. Combining the most important functions of forest land with frequencies of tree species used and preferred for those functions, that mixing ratio of trees is found, which satisfies the demands and needs of a specific rural population the most. The technique combines systematic group discussions with representative cross-section surveys. It is expected, that by considering several functions of forests, a higher contribution to the standard of living of target populations can be achieved, than when emphasizing one major function only. In addition, the participation of a target population in the planning process of an afforestation project may increase their responsibility for afforestation sites and thus help to ensure the sustainability of such projects. The approach is demonstrated by an example from Burkina Faso, showing that the local demand for firewood, timber, fodder, ingredients for food preparations etc. can be satisfied to a large extent already by six tree species.

AB In this paper we review results of research to summarize the state-of-knowledge of the past, present, and potential future roles of tropical forests in the global C cycle. In the pre-industrial period (ca. 1850), the flux from changes in tropical land use amounted to a small C source of about 0.06 Pg yr-1. By 1990, the C source had increased to 1.7 +/- 0.5 Pg yr-1. The C pools in forest vegetation and soils in 1990 was estimated to be 159 Pg and 216 Pg, respectively. No concrete evidence is available for predicting how tropical forest ecosystems am likely to respond to CO2 enrichment and/or climate change. However, C sources from continuing deforestation are likely to overwhelm any change in C fluxes unless land management efforts become more aggressive. Future changes in land use under a ''business as usual'' scenario could release 41-77 Pg C over the next 60 yr. Carbon fluxes from losses in tropical forests may be lessened by aggressively pursued agricultural and forestry measures. These measures could reduce the magnitude of the tropical C source by 50 Pg by the year 2050. Policies to mitigate C losses must be multiple and concurrent, including reform of forestry, land tenure, arid agricultural policies, forest protection, promotion of on-farm forestry, and establishment of plantations on non-forested lands. Policies should support improved agricultural productivity, especially replacing non-traditional slash-and-burn agriculture with more sustainable and approaches.

AB Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates indicate that potential changes in seasonal rainfall and temperature patterns in central North America and the African Sahel will have a greater impact on biological response (such as plant production and biogeochemical cycling) and feedback to climate than changes in the overall amount of annual rainfall. Simulation of grassland and dryland ecosystem responses to climate and CO2 changes demonstrates the sensitivity of plant productivity and soil C storage to projected changes in precipitation, temperature and atmospheric CO2. Using three different land cover projections, changes in C levels in the grassland and dryland regions from 1800 to 1990 were estimated to be -13.2, -25.5 and -14.7 Pg, i.e., a net source of C due to land cover removal resulting from cropland conversion. Projections into the future based on a double-CO2 climate including climate-driven shifts in biome areas by the year 2040 resulted in a net sink of +5.6, +27.4 and +26.8 Pg, respectively, based upon sustainable grassland management. The increase in C storage resulted mainly from an increase in area for the warm grassland sub-biome, together with increased soil organic matter. Preliminary modeling estimates of soil C losses due to 50 yr of regressive land management in these grassland and dryland ecoregions result in a 11 Pg loss relative to current conditions, and a potential loss of 37 Pg during a 50 yr period relative to sustainable land-use practices, an average source of 0.7 Pg C yr-1. Estimates of the cost of a 20 yr rehabilitation program are 5 to 8 x 10(9) US$ yr-1, for a C sequestering cost of approximately 10 US$ per tC.

ID TILLAGE; SOILS
AB Soil organic matter, a major sink for carbon, is controlled by many factors that have complex interactions. The management of crop residues is of primary importance. Reduced tillage and no-tillage practices result in a significant build-up of soil organic matter because they greatly reduce the rates of decomposition of both the native soil organic matter and of the crop residues. The crop residues decompose slower because most remain on the soil surface where there is less biological activity, and the native soil organic matter decomposes slower because there is less tillage for aerating the soil and for breaking the aggregates that ''pose organic compounds to the soil microorganisms. Crop residues, however, are highly variable. Although most crop residues contain about 40 percent carbon, the nitrogen contents range from very low to more than 3.5 percent. For carbon to be stabilized in the soil as organic matter, there must be adequate nitrogen available in the system and this factor is frequently overlooked. Climate is often the most critical factor determining the sustainability and enhancement of soil organic matter. As temperatures increase, organic matter decomposition, particularly in frequently tilled soils, is greatly accelerated. As precipitation decreases, there is less biomass produced for replenishing decomposed carbon. Consequently, soil organic matter maintenance becomes increasingly difficult in either hot or arid regions, and particularly difficult in areas that are both hot and arid. Semiarid regions comprise almost 40% of the world's land area so management of crop residues in these fragile areas is important in relation to the global C picture.

ID ATMOSPHERIC CARBON; OPTIONS; DIOXIDE
AB Biomass can be grown to act as a carbon (C) store, or as a direct substitute for fossil fuels (with no net contribution to atmospheric CO2 if produced and used sustainably). There is great potential for the modernisation of biomass fuels to produce convenient energy carriers such as electricity and liquid fuels. Bioenergy accounts for about 15% of primary energy used throughout the world, and 4% of energy used in Western Europe. Several European countries plan to significantly increase their use of bioenergy and some already obtain over 10% of their energy from biomass fuels. The European Community (EC) is planning to implement policies which will more than double the use of biomass by 2005, with biofuels taking 5% of the motor vehicle fuel market, and a resultant reduction in CO2 emissions of about 180 million tonnes (Mt), equivalent to 50 Mt C/yr. The potential contribution of biofuels is even greater, especially with all the 'set-aside' land being taken out of production. Use of 15-20 million hectares (Mha) of agricultural land for biomass crops could represent an annual sink of some 90-120 Mt C or else offset between 50 Mt C and 120 Mt C from fossil fuel emissions, depending on the fuel displaced (7-17% of total EC carbon emissions). Policies are needed that will encourage the penetration of biofuels into the market such as increased support for research, development and demonstration, subsidies for biofuels, and carbon taxes on fossil fuels.

AB Weed management treatments with various degrees of herbicide inputs were applied with or without a hairy vetch cover crop to no-tillage corn in four field experiments at Beltsville, MD. A hairy vetch living mulch in the no-treatment control or a dead mulch in the mowed treatment improved weed control during the first 6 wk of the season but weed control deteriorated in these treatments thereafter. Competition from weeds and/or uncontrolled vetch in these treatments without herbicides reduced corn yield in three of four years by an average of 46% compared with a standard PRE herbicide treatment of 0.6 kg ai/ha of paraquat plus 1.1 kg ai/ha of atrazine plus 2.2 kg ai/ha of metolachlor. Reducing atrazine and metolachlor to one-fourth the rate of the standard treatment in the absence of cover crop reduced weed control in three of four years and corn yield in two of four years compared with the standard treatment. Hairy vetch had little influence on weed control or corn yield with any herbicide treatments.

AB Weed management experiments with kidney beans were conducted at one irrigated site in 1991 and at two irrigated sites near Staples, MN during 1992. Green foxtail was the most difficult weed to control at the three research sites which agrees with survey results from dry bean growers regarding their worst weed problems. Hairy nightshade increased rapidly when weed management methods were reduced. Dry bean seed yields were highest in cultivated check plots on the farmer's field and in conventional practices plots at the Irrigation Research Center. Net economic returns, averaged over 1991 and 1992, for producing kidney beans at the Irrigation Research Center were $899/ha using conventional practices, $791/ha with cover crop practices, $734/ha with cultivated checks, $690/ha with herbicides only, and $208/ha on weedy checks. Kidney beans are an economical crop for North Central growers, but adequate weed management technologies are necessary for profitable production.

AB Many claims in support of soil conservation policies have been flawed by excessively deterministic reasoning and unwarranted spatial overaggregation. A case study remedying these flaws demonstrates that soil erosion in the Bolivian Andes worsened during recent decades (1953-91) due to changes in production as peasants shifted labor from conservation techniques to nonfarm employment. These findings reflect in three policy issues concerning sustainable resource management oriented toward development (''conservation-with-development'') are discussed: (a) environmental consequences and economic causes of increased nonfarm employment by part-time peasant farmers; (b) environment-related aspects of technology innovation and technique modifications in labor-scarce peasant production; and (c) the environmental perceptions of peasant farmers in participatory development planning.

TI PEASANT HOUSEHOLD MODELING - FARMING SYSTEMS EVOLUTION AND
   SUSTAINABILITY IN NORTHERN ZAMBIA
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Chitemene slash-and-burn cultivation continues to be a dominating cropping system in northern Zambia even after the introduction of modern technologies such as hybrid maize and fertilizer. The rationale of farming systems evolution in northern Zambia where labour markets have been absent or highly imperfect, has been analyzed by goal programming based on the theories of Chayanov (1966) and Nakajima (1986). Carrying capacity estimation is incorporated in the models and discussed in relation to the sustainability of land use systems in the area.
   The major changes in agricultural technologies in northern Zambia during this century has been the introduction of cassava, maize and fertilizer technologies. Cassava has had the most significant impact since the land could support much higher population densities and since the dependence on the chitemene system no longer was critical for the survival of peasants. By switching from finger-millet to cassava as the main staple the peasants could reduce their total labour requirement to meet their basic food needs by as much as 40%. The results also show that the maize-fertilizer technology has been unable to replace the chitemene system because economic incentives to continue the system exist as long as there is suitable woodland available. Nevertheless, the introduction of the maize-fertilizer technology may have resulted in reduced chitemene cultivation. The rapid expansion of maize production in northern Zambia from the late 70s to the late 80s depended critically on the government policy of equity pricing and input subsidisation. The models predicted that the removal of fertilizer subsidies would result in a dramatic reduction in maize production.

AB Deforestation and degradation of forest and agricultural land in the tropics contribute to the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, although the magnitude of the flux is under much debate. There is a great potential to control deforestation and further land degradation through increasing productivity and sustainability of the tropical landscape. Increased sustainable development will not only improve the economic well-being of the people living in the tropics but it has a great potential to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations through reduction of emissions and increase in area of land that serves as carbon sinks.

AB The importance and role of the geosciences in studies of sustainable agriculture include such traditional research areas as, agromineral resource assessments, the mapping and classification of soils and soil amendments, and the evaluation of landscapes for their vulnerability to physical and chemical degradation. Less traditional areas of study, that are increasing in societal importance because of environmental concerns and research into sustainable systems in general, include regional geochemical studies of plant and animal trace element deficiencies and toxicities, broad-scale water quality investigations, agricultural chemicals and the hydrogeologic interface, and minimally processed and ion-exchange agrominerals. We discuss the importance and future of phosphate in the US and world based on human population growth, projected agromineral demands in general, and the unavailability of new, high-quality agricultural lands. We also present examples of studies that relate geochemistry and the hydrogeologic characteristics of a region to the bioavailability and cycling of trace elements important to sustainable agricultural systems.

ID POLICY
AB In many developing countries, a large proportion of the population resides and works in rural areas. Agriculture is the dominant sector in rural areas and has the greatest concentration of poverty: landless workers, small tenant farmers, and small farm owners. Thus, any development strategy that is directed towards increasing employment and alleviating a country's hunger must concentrate on sustainable agricultural growth. Historically, economic development, in most countries, has been based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly land resources - in large part because these resources have been undervalued by private markets and political systems. Soil erosion and land degradation have been serious worldwide. Due to reasons such as high population pressure on land, and limited fossil energy supplies, land degradation is more serious in the developing world. Empirical studies show that soil erosion and degradation of agricultural land not only decrease land productivity but that they can also result in major downstream or off-site damage (e.g. reduction of hydroelectric production) which may be several times that of on-site damage. An earlier analysis identified the factors that determine the agricultural production growth rate in 28 developing countries. This study involved statistical estimation of an aggregate agricultural growth function based on cross-country data. The overall results showed that price distortions in the economy and land degradation had statistically significant negative impacts while the change in arable and permanent land was positively related to the growth of agricultural production and food production in 28 developing countries from 1971 to 1980. These results emphasize the importance of 'getting prices right' and implementation of sustainable land and water management practices if future growth in food and agricultural output is to be realized and sustained in developing countries.

CT INTERNATIONAL CONF ON AGRICULTURE AND THE ENVIRONMENT
CY NOV 11-14, 1991
CL COLUMBUS, OH
AB Sustainable agriculture has become a popular code word for an environmentally sound, productive, economically viable, and socially desirable agriculture. This paper reviews reasons for growing interest in agricultural sustainability (mainly the unanticipated, adverse side-effects of conventional farming), examines the proposed ends and means of sustainability, and discusses two issues frequently debated - the profitability of sustainable farming and the adequacy of food production from sustainable systems. The concept of agricultural sustainability does not lend itself to precise definition, partly because it implies a way of thinking as well as of using farming practices, and because the latter cannot be specified as final answers. Consequently, people's beliefs and values will continue to mold public understanding of the concept. Two different views of sustainable agriculture are held. One is that fine-tuning of conventional agriculture - more careful and efficient farming with sensitive technologies - will reduce or eliminate many undesirable effects of conventional agriculture. The other is that fundamental changes in agriculture are needed, requiring a major transformation of societal values. Those who believe that only fine-tuning is needed tend to argue that sustainable farming is inherently unprofitable. If widely adopted, it would not feed the world's expanding population as well as conventional agriculture. Those who see a need for more fundamental changes in conventional systems believe that sustainable farming, on the contrary, can be even more profitable than the conventional, especially when the calculation of profit counts all of the benefits and costs of farming. Further, resource conservation, protection of the environment, and farming in partnership with nature - all requirements of sustainability - will enhance, not reduce, global food production. Other issues, such as the connections between sustainable farming and the rest of the food and fiber system, and the implications of sustainability for rural communities and society as a whole, have yet to be addressed significantly.

AB Maintenance of biological diversity and nutrient cycling mechanisms are global principles that are common to all agroecosystems and therefore essential in the design of sustainable agricultural systems. Regional or site-specific factors include climate, soils and socio-economic preferences and conditions. These regional factors differ greatly among agroecosystems and may assume major importance in some. Research and development on global commonalities has potentially the most universal impact across all agroecosystems. Interdisciplinarity, participation of farmers and a whole farm level approach are fundamental to such research and development.

AB Global agriculture is entering a challenging and difficult period with an increasing human population and an accelerating need for food, fiber, feed, and raw materials for other industries. This challenge will need to be met on fewer hectares of available land and a reduced supply of the fossil fuel inputs that have catalyzed the increased productivity of the past five decades. Agriculture in some forms has negative and lasting effects on the environment. The research and education community is seeking a more resource-efficient, sustainable system of food production that has less negative impact on the environment. This system is characterized by increased resource use efficiency, greater reliance on internal or renewable resources, increased short- and long-term profitability, enhancement of soil productivity, minimal negative environmental impact, and social viability for families and communities. Agricultural research over the last half century has contributed many components to sustainable productivity, but its focus in the future will be more on systems, interactions among components, and the impact of the activity on the broader environment and community. Education in agriculture is moving from a concentration on memorizing detail and cook-book approaches to a development of creative thinking and problem solving skills. We are building the capacity to access and apply a wide range of information resources. There is a growing congruence of classroom teaching and adult education in extension, an evolution that will lead to better curriculum planning for a life-long educational and learning experience. All the key players in US agriculture will take greater responsibility for their own learning in this system, being empowered to conduct both on-station and on-farm research, design learning activities, and evaluate progress and applications of information to real world challenges. This paper describes what is happening in the US in research, in teaching, and in extension. We also envision a new paradigm for education in the future. Instead of preparing to react or adjust to a predictable future, an empowered rural populace can begin to design a more desirable future. With increased focus on scarce resources, fragility of the environment, and the lessons of nature, we can take creative approaches to systems design and begin to make decisions today to create a more sustainable future for tomorrow.

AB Differences between conventional and sustainable paradigms of agriculture are much more a matter of differences in farming philosophy than of farming practices or methods. The conventional model of agriculture is fundamentally an industrial development model which views farms as factories and considers fields, plants, and animals as production units. The goal of industrial development is to increase human well-being by increasing production of material goods and services and simultaneously increasing aggregate employment and incomes. The underlying assumption of the industrial model is that a higher quality of life can be derived from increases in income and consumption of goods and services. A fundamental strategy for industrial development has been to specialize, routinize, and mechanize agricultural production in order to achieve the economic efficiencies that are inherent in large-scale industrial production. New technologies are designed to remove physical and biological constraints to production and, thus, make unlimited progress possible. Sustainable agriculture, on the other hand, is based on a holistic paradigm or model of development which views production units as organisms that consist of many complex interrelated suborganisms, all of which have distinct physical, biological, and social limits. People are viewed as part of the organisms or systems from which they derive their well-being. Quality of life is considered to be a consequence of interrelationships among people and between people and the other physical and biological elements of their environment. Fundamental strategies for sustainable development include diversification, integration, and synthesis. Whole systems have qualities and characteristics that are not contained in their individual parts or components. The same set of components or parts may be rearranged spatially or sequentially resulting in a unique system or whole for each new arrangement. People increase their well-being by using information and knowledge to manage or rearrange the components of systems, resources, processes, and technologies in ways that enhance the productivity or 'well-being' of those systems. Human progress is limited only by our ability to enhance the social, biological, and physical systems of which we are a part. Sustainable agriculture requires a holistic systems approach to farm resource management. A component approach focusing on individual farming practices, methods, and enterprises may have been appropriate for the era of agricultural industrialization. However, a systems approach which focuses on knowledge-based development of whole farms and communities will be required to address the environmental, economic, and social challenges of the post-industrial era of agricultural sustainability.

AB Rhetorical definitions of agricultural sustainability abound. However, definitions that can be put to operational use in economic analysis have not been adequately developed. An economic definition of sustainability using natural resource accounting techniques is put forward. Two case studies are examined and physical and economic measures of natural resource impacts are developed. Five policy scenarios are tested to determine the public and private gains possible from different approaches to agricultural support and economic incentives.

AB It is argued that sociology and the other social sciences can contribute to agricultural sustainability in several ways, one of which is to help in assessing and understanding the social forces that affect agricultural research and agricultural policy. Many of the conditions that gave rise to expansion of sustainable agriculture in the 1980s are changing, and sustainable agriculture faces several fiscal and political vulnerabilities. A typology of sustainable agriculture research is developed to illustrate the point that scientists and proponents of sustainable agriculture can help to address these vulnerabilities by deversifying their approaches to developing environmentally sound agricultural technologies.

AB Biodiversity is a salient feature of traditional farming systems in developing countries and performs a variety of renewal processes and ecological services in agroecosystems. It is of fundamental importance to understand the role biodiversity can play in reducing pest problems, if vegetation management is to be used effectively as a primary IPM tactic in small-scale sustainable agriculture. The maintenance of biodiversity in traditional agroecosystems is not random, but depends on a complex set of indigenous technical knowledge systems (ethnoscience). Thus, the ensemble of traditional crop protection practices used by indigenous farmers represents a rich resource for modem workers seeking to create IPM systems that are well adapted to the agroecological, cultural and socio-economic circumstances facing small farmers throughout the developing world.

AB Cassava is a food crop of increasing importance for the rapidly growing rural population in Africa. Easy to grow even under harsh agronomic conditions, cassava is the primary source of carbohydrates for more than 200 million people, including the poorest on the continent, and provides food security to most subsistence farmers. Several pests including phytophagous arthropods, plant pathogens and weeds constrain cassava production on the continent. The exotic species introduced accidentally from the Neotropics constitute the largest group of pests. The long cropping cycle exposes cassava to relatively few additional pests in Africa, and enhances sustainable pest management interventions such as biological control, host plant resistance and cultural practices. Historically, cassava plant protection focused on resistance breeding, but since the invasion of several devastating exotic pests in the 1970s, a wider range of pest management solutions are now being pursued. Plant protection interventions that are developed and tested by teams of multi-disciplinary scientists with input from extension agents and client farmers are urgently needed. Appropriate technology development requires an understanding of key pest-host-agroecosystem interactions in the context of the agronomic practices of the farmer and the socio-economic importance of the crop. A regional project to develop, test and implement ecologically sustainable cassava plant protection in West Africa is presented as a general model for developing appropriate pest management in Africa.

AB There is a need to develop viable farming systems for tropical uplands dominated by low-activity clay soils; such systems should ensure sustained crop production while protecting the soil resource base.  Alley cropping has the potential to meet this need. For over a decade, the alley cropping technique has been tested, with varying results, in various agroecological zones. Results obtained thus far show that the best potential is on the high base-status soil in the humid and subhumid zones, and that crop production can be sustained in this ecozone with low chemical inputs. Further research is needed for other ecozones, particularly with inclusion of better adapted or indigenous hedgerow species. The potential and limitations of the alley cropping technique are highlighted and areas of future research discussed.

   FERTILIZER; SHADED PERENNIALS
AB This review encompasses results of fertilization experiments on several agroforestry systems - alley cropping, perennial shade systems, home gardens in which fertilizer use is a likely management alternative. Fertilizer response was found to be most common in alley cropping, variable in perennial shade systems, and rarely reported in home gardens.  Level of nutrient removal in harvested products is probably the overriding factor in determining fertilizer response; greater accumulation of organic residues. slower growth under shade, and longer periods of nutrient uptake probably also contribute to the relatively smaller fertilizer response of the perennial shade systems and home gardens. Considerable knowledge gaps exist regarding the breakdown of organic residues, and interactions between mineral and organic amendments. Systems based on annual crops (e.g., alley cropping) are likely to be less nutrient-efficient and sustainable than systems based on perennial crops, due to reduced fixation and transfer of N to the crops, the tendency ot' the trees to compete for and sequester nutrients, relatively high P requirements of the crops, and the high labor cost of tree management. The possible benefits of fertilization of specific components in home gardens, and relative advantages of including low-value tree legumes, high-value shade trees, and fertilization in shaded perennial systems are only beginning to receive research attention.

DE FARMING SYSTEMS; MODIFIED STABILITY ANALYSIS; RECOMMENDATION DOMAINS;
   SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB Farming systems research and extension (FSRE), as used by the global Association for Farming Systems Research-Extension, applies to a family of methodologies used to generate, evaluate and disseminate agricultural technologies in association with farmer participation. FSRE shares many attributes with Diagnosis and Design as practiced in agroforestry. The history of FSRE is traced from 1965 to the present, showing the formalization of the methodology and its critical use in sustainable agricultural technology development. In on-farm research, a primary basis for FSRE, research and extension merge in practice. The definition of recommendation domains (a fundamental concept of FSRE) is based on analysis and interpretation of multi-environmental research results as evaluated by varied criteria.
   In this paper, we present the results of three research projects to demonstrate the nature of farmer criteria for evaluation. Modified Stability Analysis (MSA) is used to demonstrate the relationship of on-farm research to specific extension messages. Design of on-farm research to make it amenable to analysis by MSA is discussed.

TI THE ECONOMICS OF ROTATING SAVINGS AND CREDIT ASSOCIATIONS

DT Article
AB This paper analyzes the economic role and performance of a type of financial institution which is observed worldwide: rotating savings and credit associations (Roscas). Using a model in which individuals save for an indivisible durable consumption good, we study Roscas which distribute funds using random allocation and bidding. Each type of Rosca allows individuals without access to credit markets to improve their welfare, but under a reasonable assumption on preferences, random allocation is preferred when individuals have identical tastes. This conclusion need not hold when individuals are heterogeneous. We also discuss the sustainability of Roscas given the possibility of default.

AB Miscanthus grasses are perennial   C4 plants with a high biomass per area production. The potential use as sustainable crops in view of energy or fibre use is considered. In particular the species Miscanthus x giganteus GREEF et DEU. is discussed and found to be suitable for the production of energy and/or raw material for the paper industry. The taxonomy and the cytological background of the species is not clearly distinguished. The cytological, anatomical and morphological observation in the present study indicate, that this species have hybrid characteristics with a triploid chromosome set. The origin of the species is unknown and it is proposed, that M. sacchariflorus and probably M. sinensis are involved in the hybridisation. Based on the present results, that this species is to be classified in the section Triarrhena.

AB The improvement of the food situation in the tropics will depend on reliable production methods adapted to the various conditions within the tropical belt. Besides appropiate technologies for crop management practices, the conservation of soil-biological resources deserve special attention aiming at sustainable soil productivity. The present review demonstrates the importance of soil-microorganisms such as VA mycorrhizal fungi which substantially improve the exploitation of phosporus in soil for plant nutrition, thus enabling a more economic use of costly P fertilizers specially under the precarious soil conditions in the tropics.  The authors appraise the crucial role of VA mycorrhizae under various stress conditions in relation to present knowledge and further research needs, with primary emphasis on two distinct tropical environments: the humid and arid/semiarid tropics.

LA English
DT Article
AB U.S. agriculture has been very productive during the past fifty years. A number of unexpected consequences, however, are believed to be detrimental to the long-term interests of our nation's agriculture and natural resources. In response to this issue, the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 mandates that the U.S. Department of Agriculture conduct research and education programs on alternative agricultural systems. These must be productive, economically viable, and environmentally sound; they must conserve natural resources, make optional use of on-farm resources, and enhance the quality of life for farmers and ranchers, members of rural communities, and society as a whole. The Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) Program has evolved as an important initiative for development and promotion of alternative agricultural practices and production systems. This article describes sustainable agriculture and its role in the development of a philosophy for identification of research, education, and policy initiatives for twenty-first-century U.S. agriculture.

TI PRACTICAL ASSESSMENT OF PEARL-MILLET (PENNISETUM-GLAUCUM) CROP LOSS
   CAUSED BY GRASSHOPPER PESTS (ORTHOPTERA, ACRIDIDAE) - A MAJOR OUTBREAK
   IN NORTH-WEST MALI
SO BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB The impact of Sahelian grasshopper species on short cycle pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) was studied at two sites in north-west Mali and techniques of crop loss assessment were investigated. At one of these sites an on-farm study was carried out with the co-operation of seven village farmers. The grasshoppers Diabolocatantops axillaris (Thunberg) and Kraussaria angulifera (Krauss) were the principal destructive species, primarily causing grain loss through their feeding upon millet heads. Leaf damage was found to be sustainable to a high level before influencing yield, although direct grain loss through head damage was shown to be an important determinant of final yield. It was concluded that the best means of determining the yield loss attributable to grasshopper attack for late-season patterns of damage was to estimate head damage immediately prior to harvest. In this estimate, heads were assigned to one of ten classes according to the severity of the damage. Studies at a second site demonstrated the existence of a linear relationship between estimates of head damage and actual grain weight loss. On the basis of these findings it is concluded that the average loss of yield incurred as a result of grasshopper attack in the study village, Mamaribougou Freybe, was 25.7% + 3.0, -2.5. A system is proposed by which such village-level crop loss estimates may be undertaken.

AB Peat formation is a true carbon sink, the carbon being sequestered out of the system and converted into peat through biological activity. Peat swamp forests originally represented major ecosystems in Indonesia and ranged between 16.5 - 27 million hectares. In their original state, Indonesian peat swamp forests sequestered between 0.01 - 0.03 Gigatonnes of carbon annually. These important ecosystems have however in recent years been reduced through drainage and conversion to agricultural lands and other activities. Their present status as carbon sequestering systems have thus also been reduced significantly. An understanding of the global importance of peat (and thus the urgency of maintaining peat swamp forests) and identifying alternative ways of making these areas productive in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner should have high priority among scientists and policy-makers alike.

AB There are 144 Mha tropical forests in Indonesia, of which 64 Mha are ''Production Forest''s and 31 Mha are ''Conversion Forest''s. These are subject to deforestation with a rate of 1.3 Mha/yr. The deforestation is followed by changes in land use, mainly for agriculture, man-made forests and settlements. Such activities have released carbon to the atmosphere by as much as 192 Tg C/yr. New plantations are expected to contribute in stabilising the carbon budget by taking up some 210 Tg C/yr. by the year 2030.
   Policies to be implemented in order to improve the forest resource, hence increase carbon sequestering, may include options to maintain existing sinks through sustainable forest management and expand new sinks through industrial forest plantations and estate crops on abandoned and so called critical lands. In addition, ''participatory'' forest practices may be promoted to reduce shifting cultivation as a source of greenhouse gasses.

TI CUTTING THE GROUND FROM UNDER THEM - COMMERCIALIZATION, CULTIVATION, AND
   CONSERVATION IN TONGA
SO CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC
LA English
DT Article
AB The increasing commercialization of agriculture in Tonga has led to the adoption of agricultural practices that favor short-term monetary gain over the traditional techniques associated with more sustainable forms of agroforestry. Newer forms of cultivation and the overuse of the relatively small amounts of land available for commercial development will almost certainly lead to greater environmental deterioration than is now evident. The shortage of available land arises largely from the tenure system instituted last century, which distributes land by hereditary entitlement. Until recently this system has been considered the most equitable in the Pacific Islands, but it is now encouraging misuse of land. Because of population growth, proportionally fewer eligible men can now acquire garden land. At the same time, noble estate-holders still control large tracts of land, and thousands of customary allotments that have been allocated formally to individuals are underused because the registered landholder has moved away, often overseas. The land that is available for reallocation tends, therefore, to fetch high rents for only short lease periods. As a result, wealthy businessmen and nobles who control land have become the more successful agricultural entrepreneurs. Smaller operators obtain land through informal, often insecure, arrangements. Commercial growers often try to increase cash returns on crop yields by shortening fallow periods, thereby reducing the quality of both soil nutrients and revegetation. Trees are felled to facilitate mechanical tillage, a practice that disturbs soil structures. The increasing use of biocides, particularly on recently introduced monocultures, will further affect the environment in ways that are not yet adequately understood.

AB Biotechnology is a recent addition to international crop improvement. For its contribution to be effective, it must be fully integrated with conventional agricultural research. Based on recommendations contained in a National Research Council (NRC) report, the Agency for International Development (A.I.D.), in collaboration with the International Agricultural Research Centers (LARCs) and National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS), prioritized biotechnology research relevant to agricultural problems of the developing world and identified those suitable for mutually beneficial research. A new plant biotechnology project was designed, awarded, and implemented to address these priorities while complementing other international programs. The Agricultural Biotechnology for Sustainable Productivity (ABSP) project supports separate public and commercially oriented research efforts by providing multiple routes for the development and release of germplasm. These efforts are implemented through collaborative research agreements which include support for regulatory review, field testing, and legal/contractual agreements for protection of intellectual property fights (IPR). Efforts to determine the research priorities, innovative modalities for collaborative agreements, and value decisions on which these are based are reviewed as an example of ongoing international biotechnology initiatives.

AB Depletion of the fossil fuels and climate change caused by the greenhouse effect is threatening the sustainable development of mankind. Since the CO2 produced by burning fossil fuels is the dominant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 disposal is expected to be an effective option for mitigating climate change. However, if we took the option of CO2 disposal and continued relying on fossil fuels, it could not be the sustainable use of energy resources. Therefore we need some theoretical framework for realizing the sustainable development.  In this paper we have developed a model to demonstrate the way of sustainable use of energy resources under constraints on CO2 emissions. Computed results have shown that present energy system based on fossil fuels shifts to the system based on renewable resources in the ultra-long term with appropriate incentives. CO2 disposal plays an important but a transitional role in this analysis.

   SEQUESTRATION; PHOTOBIOLOGY
AB Biological systems are among the most promising, environmentally sustainable alternatives for reducing atmospheric CO2 levels. Biomass can act as a reservoir of carbon, or as a direct substitute for fossil fuels with no net contribution to atmospheric CO2 if produced and used sustainably. We examine the role of biomass in mitigating global warming and contributing to the development of future energy strategies. we conclude that the use of biomass for fossil fuel substitution would be far more effective, in reducing atmospheric CO2 than to simply sequester CO2 in forests in most circumstances. Furthermore, since bioenergy could be less costly -than coal and petroleum, this strategy  has an economic advantage over many of the carbon mitigation options.
   Photobiology and photochemistry are possible future routes for CO2 reduction.   The use of microalgae in photobioreactors is feasible for CO2 removal as has been demonstrated in a number of laboratories. Energy balances with such systems need to be optimised since parameters such as light (actual and artificial) and waste heat play crucial roles.

AB There has recently evolved in the United States a number of independent power plants producing power for the grid while cogenerating heat for use in large, commercial greenhouse operations. The state-of-the-art of these greenhouses is 10 to 50 acres under glass with productivities on the order of 300,000 pounds of tomatoes per acre per year which is achievable through computer controlled climate, hydroponic growing systems, supplemental carbon dioxide, and energy conserving structures and systems. While the greenhouse structures and growing systems are high tech and capital intensive, the combination of high productivity in the wintertime when the prices are highest and the relatively low cost for cogenerated heat result in economic attractiveness as a commercial venture. Furthermore, from an environmental perspective, these state-of-the-art systems can be designed for zero water releases to soil or surface waters and very efficient point application of both fertilizers and pesticides compared to field crop broadcast applications.
   The primary objective of this paper is to present an engineering systems analysis of how such systems can mitigate, through greenhouse photosynthesis, carbon dioxide releases from both from fossil-fuelled power production at the greenhouse site and from the avoidance of fossil energy for field crop production and distribution. A second objective is to propose the use of environmentally benign fuel cells as the power production technology of choice (200 to 500 kilowatts/acre) to not only produce electricity with high efficiency (40 to 50 percent or more as electricity) and cogenerate useful heat for greenhouse winter warming, but also ''trigenerate'' useful carbon dioxide in the form of exhaust. This exhaust, which is very low in NO(x) and SO(x) coming from the fuel cell, can be used directly in the airspace of the greenhouse for both heat and the value of the carbon dioxide as a fertilizer, which can further increase crop productivity by 10 to 20 percent. The third objective is to show that when greenhouse biomass residues, along with other locally available agricultural wastes, can be anaerobically digested to produce a biogas that fuels the fuel cell, the system can produce power and food with a net short term sequestering of carbon dioxide in the form of food.
   In summary, this linking of technologies can result in both ''sustainable power'' and ''sustainable agriculture,'' the combination of which might be called ''sustainable agri-power.'' Also to be briefly explored will be applications to crops other than vegetables, such as fruits, flowers, spices and forest products, supplemental lighting for increased productivity, summertime cooling and thermal energy systems, and even more novel applications such as wastewater treatment through constructed wetlands, short rotation tree crops for energy production and, even further along, biotechnology applications.

ID DEGRADATION; GROWTH
AB We face major and intimately interlinked problems of population, environment, and development. They are so profound and pervasive that they surely represent a unique-scale challenge for Humankind. The issues and policy responses will preoccupy the best understanding on the part of political leaders and scientists alike during the planning process leading up to the United Nations Conference on Population and Development which is to be held in Cairo from 5-13 September 1994.
   Scientific aspects are to be addressed at an earlier conference that is to be attended by representatives of some 80 of the world's academies in New Delhi in late October 1993. The present paper reviews the principal factors and analyses relating to the three problems, with emphasis upon their interactive relationships. It concludes with an extended list of strategies to reduce both population growth and environmental degradation - twin challenges to be tackled within a framework of sustainable development, to which both will make critical contributions.

TI CONTRADICTIONS IN SUSTAINABILITY
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Issues of environment and development are increasingly being analysed within the framework offered by sustainability and sustainable development. This article explores a number of deep-seated contradictions and tensions that exist within these concepts at least as they are currently construed. It is noted that these contradictions are often glossed over in intellectual and policy debates, but are nonetheless profound and should be made explicit.
   The contradictions identified and discussed in the paper are as follows: the paradox of technology (cause or cure?); uncertainty and decision-making (humility or arrogance in the face of ignorance?); intergenerational and intragenerational equity (a politically impossible trade-off?); economic growth versus ecological limits (is 'sustainable development' an oxymoron?), the reconciliation of individual and collective interests, applying both to individuals in their society, and nation states in the international community: the potential conflict between the diversity of democracy and purposeful action; differing kinds of resilience in the face of change (resistance, marginal change, and adaptability); and the question of whether or not optimization is antisustainability.
   In conclusion we ask what the implications of this labyrinth of contradictions are for moving towards a sustainable state. Are these contradictions too profound and thus insurmountable, or does Homo sapiens' apparently innate ability to live with contradiction and logical inconsistency offer a way out?

TI APPLYING ENVIRONMENTAL INTERPRETATION IN PROTECTED AREAS OF
   DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES - PROBLEMS IN EXPORTING A UNITED-STATES MODEL
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Interpretation is most effective when its form and content are adapted to the situations in which it will be presented. Although many developed countries have a long and rich tradition of interpretation, the physical, financial, and socio-economic, differences among and within developing nations suggest that this tradition will not always apply there. As our colleagues in developing countries look for interchange and suggestions, the temptation to impose our model - and the difficulty for them to accept it - will be great.
   Interpreters in developing countries need to pursue a different model - one which gives relative emphasis to interpretation's role in strategic environmental education for target audiences. Though not altogether excluding the visitor service function that is frequently emphasized in US protected areas, interpretive programmes in many developing countries are often included as just one component of country-wide environmental education master-plans aimed at establishing sustainable development as a national ideology.
   Host countries sometimes accept the conventional model too readily, often because the only available training materials are translated from these sources. When application falls short of expectations, in-country interpreters usually blame themselves or conclude that interpretation 'just isn't for us - rather than questioning the model they have been handed. Universities must also share some of the responsibility for this sorry state of affairs. International students studying at US or European institutions sometimes return home better prepared to work as interpreters in those countries' protected areas than in those in their own countries. Trainers and teachers, whether working at home or elsewhere, need to do a better job of listening to their students. They need to learn what it is like to be an interpreter in that student's country, and they need to learn what it is like to be part of the audience. Would we accept anything less of our own mentors and interpretive trainers?
   Clearly, a superior strategy to exporting our model of interpretation is to assist developing countries in arriving at their own. Over many decades, interpreters in the US and other developed countries have developed a profound knowledge about their craft. Although much of it will not apply everywhere, some of our ideas may have widespread application. The key will be to determine which ones these are. Working with our developed country colleagues, learning with them and through them, we can explore together a range of possibilities that neither of us is able to envision alone. Filtered through our cultures and individual realities, the ideas which have merit will be identified and put to test. Others will be rejected. In the very best scenario, both parties will learn, and sustainable environmental quality will be the result.

AB The advent of new forestry in the United States represents a traumatic shift in the philosophy of national forestry praxis, a broadening of values to include aesthetics and sustainability of natural ecological process. The ethics of traditional forestry are shown to be 'Stoic utilitarian' and positivist, while the ethics of new forestry adhere closely to the 'land ethic' of Aldo Leopold. Aesthetics in traditional forestry are shown to be modernist, and to have developed from, and in opposition to a Romantic aesthetic of the late nineteenth century. This transition is traced from the first U.S. landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted Sr., to the first U.S.-born forester, Gifford Pinchot. The language and precepts of new forestry are shown to parallel those of postmodernism, and the possibility of a broadened aesthetics of forestry, developed through postmodernist criticism, is outlined. The language of gardening is used as a model of forestry praxis, with traditional forestry adhering to the principles of vegetable gardening, while new forestry offers an opportunity to flesh out an entire spectrum of gardening genres.

DT Article
DE ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY; BIOLOGICAL
   FUNCTION; ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS; NATURAL VALUE; ARTIFACTS; AUTONOMY
AB This paper examines and compares the ontological and axiological character of artefacts - human creations - with nonhuman natural entities. The essential difference between artefacts and natural entities is that the former are always the result of human intention and design, while the latter are independent of human purpose. Artefacts have functions; natural entities do not.
   The connection to human intentional purpose implies a different kind of value for artefacts. Artefacts are evaluated solely by their instrumental (and anthropocentric) use, while natural entities can be appreciated for their independent and autonomous existence.
   This distinction has normative implications, especially for environmental policy and the development of an environmental ethic. Intervention in natural processes, even to 'improve' nature, must be limited, for human action changes natural entities and systems into artefacts. A moral imperative requires respect for the autonomy of nature and resistance to the human domination of nature.

AB Sustainable growth is emerging as a normative concept in recent work in economics and environmental philosophy. This paper examines several kinds of growth, seeking to identify a sustainable form which could be adopted as normative for human society.
   The conceptions of growth expressed in standard economic theory, in the writings of John Dewey, and in population biology, each suggest particular accounts of how the lives of individuals and communities ought to be lived. I argue that, while absolute sustainablity is not possible, the latter two conceptions together suggest a regulative ideal of sustainable growth which is acceptable at the social level, and which encourages the development of genuine community.

AB The good life, as practised in modem society, not only is unsustainable but also is frequently not really good. Quality in living is necessarily subjective, it cannot be defined in physical terms, and can be found in many manifestations. The search for quality is conducted within ourselves and not in a shopping mall. Several suggestions for modes of living that provide quality but do not burden or injure ecosystems are presented. The condition of life systems on our planet demand that we cultivate simple lifestyles that are inwardly rich.

TI SELECTING VILLAGES FOR IMPACT IN WATER-SUPPLIES - AN EXPANDED ROLE FOR
   THE BASE-LINE STUDY
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB Success, and indeed sustainability, of water supplies stands to gain from careful selection that gives priority to villages that have an apparent need for improved and more convenient water supplies. Water supply planners should thus insist on more objective and painstaking selection procedures through refined selection criteria. As the justification for village selection differs between villages, the expected impact of improved water is also different. It is argued that a conceptual link should be made between village selection and expected village impact. Both selection and prediction of impact at village level could become part of baseline studies, which would then take on a wider purpose than such studies have at present. The baseline study envisaged should thus form a basis for need-oriented planning, and make a connection between selection and impact.

TI THE BAMAKO INITIATIVE - WHERE IS IT GOING
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
AB The Bamako Initiative was launched in September 1987 as a means of increasing access to essential drugs through community participation in revolving drug funds. The response of the public health community was highly critical of the Initiative. Issues raised included equity and access; problems of integration, management and logistics; the relative importance given to drugs; and sustainability and dependency.
   The Initiative has evolved in part in response to these criticisms, now focusing on increased accessibility and quality of services, and the strengthening of health system management. An evaluation carried out in 1991 reviewed the main areas of criticism. In all areas, a relative approach was found to be useful. For example, while substantial problems of equity and affordability exist, in some cases, services of a given quality have been made available more cheaply than before.
   The most important outstanding policy issues were considered to be: the need to strengthen community support mechanisms for those without economic access to services and to develop payment mechanisms compatible with seasonal income patterns; the feasibility of regional cross-subsidization of revenues; the development of an improved model of community participation; and the nature and extent of external support to the programme.

LA English
DT Article
DE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; RURAL DEVELOPMENT;
   SWAZILAND; SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB High population growth and deteriorating economic conditions imperil Africa's natural environment. Conservationists are trying to cope with the threat by working in rural communities. Yet it is unclear whether they can be effective when social and economic change in rural areas is so rapid. Northeast Swaziland provides a case study. The landscape has been transformed since the 1950s, and conservationists are the only people now giving nature conservation a high priority. Land uses incompatible with local nature reserves are supported because they provide jobs. Thus, conservationists find themselves facing a world where wildlife is increasingly devalued as the forces of change accelerate. This paper concludes: (1) conservationists must expand their influence into rural communities, (2) an integrated development and conservation plan is required for northeastern Swaziland, and (3) only the alleviation of poverty will secure the future of nature conservation in Swaziland as well as the rest of Africa.

The government of Indonesia imposed a ban on the export of raw and semi-processed rattan in 1988. To determine whether and how the ban has affected smallholders, we interviewed farmers in two rattan-growing regions in Kalimantan. Since the ban, prices and rural incomes have dropped, cultivation has slowed/stopped (at least temporarily), and farmers have switched to and/or intensified other types of activities.

DE ENERGY PLANNING; OPTIMAL ALLOCATION; USEFUL ENERGY
AB Demand for energy in India is constantly on the rise and the conventional supply options available have failed to cope with this increase. The emergence of efficiency improvement, carrier substitution and renewable energy as alternative sources of energy supply, make adherence only to macro-level energy planning unrealistic. A micro-level (district/taluk) energy planning becomes pragmatic under these circumstances to pursue the goal of sustainable development and to harness locally available energy resources. This paper considers the energy consumption pattern in Bangalore North taluk in 1987-88 and projects the demand for energy in 1995-96. Taking into account the different energy sources used to provide different end-use services through different end-use devices, the paper presents a linear programming formulation for optimum allocation. The model considers the conventional and new alternative technologies for meeting the demand for energy service. The results show that substantial savings could be achieved by this optimal allocation. The cost savings could be to the tune of Rs 41.879 million in Bangalore North taluk during 1995-96 (terminal year of Eighth Five-Year Plan). Energy savings of about 27% and cost savings of 16% could also be achieved.

AB This paper describes part of the preliminary data analysis of a research project entitled 'Emergent Environmentalism', funded by the E.S.R.C. It provides a brief overview of the theoretical background of the project as a whole which is concerned with the nature and development of children's early knowledge and awareness of environmental issues. One of the four component studies of the research project, namely 'Emergent Knowledge of The Environment', is then described and discussed. This provides data which illuminate the extent to which four-year-old children know and understand about four selected environmental issues, the sources of their knowledge and an idea of whether they have any sense of concern for the world in which they are growing up. Examples of concept maps that have been constructed for each subject are provided which demonstrate that pre-school children may well have a strong base of accurate scientific knowledge upon which early years environmental teaching may build.

AB In this paper, a generalized, long-term view of the relationship between technology and the environment is set out. The environment is seen as changing in response to resource demands determined by economic conditions and available technology. A framework for technological education is proposed which is compatible with this long-term view. The educational contexts of consumptive, sustainable, management, nostalgic, revived and information technologies are explored. The centrality of economics and value issues to technological education is emphasized.

ID DRAINAGE WATER; IMPERIAL-VALLEY; COTTON; REUSE
AB Use of saline drainage water in irrigated agriculture, as a means of its disposal, was evaluated on a 60 ha site on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. In the drip irrigation treatments, 50 to 59% of the irrigation water applied during the six-year rotation was saline with an EC(w) ranging from 7 to 8 dS/m, and containing 5 to 7 mg/L boron and 220 to 310 mug/L total selenium. Low salinity water with an EC(w) of 0.4 to 0.5 dS/m and B almost-equal-to 0.4 mg/l was used to irrigate the furrow plots from 1982 to 1985 after which a blend of good quality water and saline drainage water was used. A six-year rotation of cotton, cotton, cotton, wheat, sugar beet and cotton was used. While the cotton and sugar beet yields were not affected during the initial six years, the levels of boron (B) in the soil became quite high and were accumulated in plant tissue to near toxic levels. During the six year period, for treatments surface irrigated with saline drainage water or a blend of saline and low salinity water, the B concentration in the soil increased throughout the 1.5 m soil profile while the electrical conductivity (EC(e)) increased primarily in the upper 1 m of the profile. Increases in soil EC(e) during the entire rotation occurred on plots where minimal leaching was practiced. Potential problems with germination and seedling establishment associated with increased surface soil salinity were avoided by leaching with rainfall and low-salinity pre-plant irrigations of 150 mm or more. Accumulation of boron and selenium poses a major threat to the sustainability of agriculture if drainage volumes are to be reduced by using drainage water for irrigation. This is particularly true in areas where toxic materials (salt, boron, other toxic minor elements) cannot be removed from the irrigated area. Continual storage within the root zone of the cropped soil is not sustainable.

AB Land degradation problems are widely recognized in arid Australia. Such problems arise partly because of a very unpredictable climate, great spatial diversity, and the lack of a conceptual framework within which to base approaches to sustainable land management. Furthermore, the concept of 'sustainability' itself is poorly defined, for good reasons.
   Planning for sustainable land use in Australia's rangelands will require assessment of whether pastoral enterprises are sustainable in particular areas. Because of the complexity of the natural and cultural system, there is no simple way of making this assessment. We present a procedure which aims to solve the assessment question efficiently by starting with the least critical and most easily performed analyses and finishing with the most critical and hardest. We suggest determining whether the enterprise is economically viable at a superficial level, then working through the ecological characteristics at increasing levels of complexity, and finally assessing whether the necessary management strategies are socially feasible.
   The procedure highlights what can be done using existing understanding and what issues need further research. Despite the latter, efforts must be made to carry out assessments of this kind so the necessary expertise and databases are in place before political expediency forces less objective assessments.

TI CHANGES IN THE COMPETENCE OF QUERCUS-ROBUR FASTIGIATA TO GROW IN-VITRO
   AS AFFECTED BY SEEDLING ROOTSTOCKS AND DIFFERENTIAL PRUNING
SO JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID REJUVENATION INVITRO; INDUCTION; JUVENILE; APPLE
AB Three physiologically distinct forms of the same genotype of Quercus robur 'Fastigiata;, all derived from adult budwood, were identified following the growth of severely-pruned hedge plants grafted onto juvenile seedling rootstocks. Only explants from the form displaying the juvenile-like characteristic of over-winter leaf retention were capable of establishing sustainable cultures in vitro, although growth was not as rapid as those from a two year old seedling source. Pruning to release correlative inhibition of buds low on the scion framework produced vigorous shoot growth, but explants from these failed to show sustained growth in vitro. Withholding light from stockplants reduced excessive phenolic oxidation in explants taken from flushing unripe shoots, however, despite a beneficial effect on culture initiation, later growth was dependent upon the juvenile- or adult-like physiology of the original explant. A new medium was devised for this subject, which in addition to promoting growth generally, also stimulated the flushing of shoot apices. The relevance to in vitro culture of expression of juvenile habit in the stockplant is discussed.

TI SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND RURAL-DEVELOPMENT - THE IMPORTANCE OF
   BUILDING UP WATER-RESOURCES THROUGH REFORESTATION
SO JOURNAL OF THE AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION OF CHINA
LA Chinese
DT Article
AB Sustainable agriculture is recognized as a modern nomenclature, yet it represents its aged farming practiced and has been employed by chinese farmers since ancient time as early as nearly 4, 000 years ago. Nowadays, there are a number of new terms bearing the nature or content more or less similar to sustainable agriculture.
   In a word, this sustainable agriculture appearing to be a modern and more scientific terminology is a good sign of the importance of preserving natural resource for farming in this advanced technology era, with respect to reconsidering the value of human life in its peaceful coexistance with nature.
   A sound development of rural community depends largely on healthy people and successful farm income through the hard work in the field by team work of the farmers' family members. Each individual farm should observe the righteous way of farm operation must follow closely with the principle of co-existence of natural environment and wisely use the natural resource without hesitation. Soil and water conservation must be fully observed all the time.
   Sustainable agriculture alone could hardly reach a successful rural development. Some sort of joint efforts is eventually required. In addition to the importance of supplying adequate water resources through reforestation, other infrastructure, such as, financing, marketing, social education, transportation, information, etc., also needs careful planning. Strategic support of the government is especially important to successful rural development. It is true to every nation.
   Finally, this international symposium will mark a milestone of beginning the scientific approach of the improvment and application of an ancient art in farming, the sustainable agriculture. It is very desirable to propose that this symposium is able to create a world center of communication for the exchange of information concerning sustainalbe agriculture among members of participating countries for the purpose of technical cooperation among them in the years to come.

TI INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS - ASSESSING AND EXPLORING COMPETITIVE
   ADVANTAGE BY OCEAN CONTAINER CARRIERS
SO LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB Container shipping is a mature global service industry. The competitive pressures of the past several years and the current recession have triggered a re-examination of competitive strategy by most container carriers. The strategies being discussed are service differentiation, the addition of new value-added services and total quality management. But will these provide a carrier with a firm-specific competitive advantage which is also sustainable? This paper introduces a process for identifying the sources of competitive advantage for firms in the industry and how these sources may be used to ensure survival in the coming decade. The paper then evaluates the strategies likely to be successful in the long term and the type of firm which might exploit them.

TI WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE CRITTERS - NAFTAS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON WILDLIFE
   PROTECTION
SO NATURAL RESOURCES JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB On September 16, 1993, United States President Bill Clinton and his counterparts in Mexico and Canada signed the environmental supplement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This environmental agreement addresses two main issues: enforcement of domestic environmental laws through possible trade sanctions and environmental cooperation among the three Parties-both to be implemented by a newly created Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC). Although increased environmental cooperation possesses no legal mandate per se and has been characterized by some as ''green window-dressing,'' the CEC's authority to examine virtually any environmental issue related to trade is precedent setting. For example, the CEC will be able to study trade liberalization's profound effect upon land use practices and habitat conservation.
   The main NAFTA text, apart from the Clinton supplemental agreements, is a 2000-page document that establishes rules for more liberalized trade in most goods and services, protection of intellectual property rights, and various investment and procurement decisions. As part of its effort to reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, the main NAFTA text establishes highly technical disciplines for judging trade-based environmental laws. The environmental supplement does not affect these disciplines, much to the chagrin of many environmentalists. The environmental supplement also does not address United States-Mexico border funding, which will be dealt with in a separate multi-billion dollar financial package and domestic appropriations.
   To date, NAFTA's potential impact on wildlife protection has been overshadowed by the past and future pollution problems spurred by increased investment and trade. Although pollution prevention and control are certainly important, and have an impact upon wildlife, ignoring conservation problems under NAFTA would be extremely foolish. Not only are scientific experts estimating that planet Earth could be losing hundreds of species per day, but United States trade-based wildlife laws are the most likely to be attacked under NAFTA as ''illegal'' non-tariff barriers to trade. In addition, with global natural resources already severely overexploited, it is vital to better define and integrate the concept of sustainable development into the international trading regime. Despite the temptation by conservationists to shoot arrows at NAFTA and other global trade agreements, the most productive course may be to establish rules that properly govern the relationship between international trade and the protection of all living natural resources.

TI AQUACULTURE AND SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH INTEGRATED RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Aquaculture in developing countries can improve the sustainability of small-scale farms provided that it is fully integrated with other enterprises and household activities so as to allow farm families and communities to manage their natural resources effectively. This requires the consideration of pond management and fish husbandry as means to a variety of ends (water storage, soil conservation and fertility, integrated pest management, etc.), not just production of fish. This paper discusses the evolution of this broad Integrated Resources Management (IRM) approach, principally with reference to the Inland Aquatic Resources Systems Program of ICLARM, and gives some examples of relevant activities in tropical developing countries, research methods and future challenges.

DT Article
AB Biosphere 2, a virtually airtight facility for the study of biospheric and ecosystem processes, includes an agricultural area of about 0.2 hectare for growing food for its eight crew members. Since the commencement of an initial two-year closure experiment, this agricultural system has operated without use of toxic chemicals which might pollute the small reservoirs of air, water and soil. It has produced some 90% of the nutritional needs of the crew. Foods produced comprise a wide variety of crops, including grains, starches, vegetables and fruit and a limited amount of milk, eggs, fish and meat from aquaculture and domestic animals. Waste products from both the humans and domestic animals are processed by means of anaerobic and aerobic microbial and plant systems. Inedible crop biomass and animal manure is composted. Since Biosphere 2 is designed for long-term operation and study, soil fertility must be maintained while supporting its diverse crop rotations and intensive production. The agricultural component in Biosphere 2 allows for study of its impact on overall biospheric health and dynamics, including effects on CO2 fluxes, nitrogen and other element cycling, and maintenance of good quality air and water.

TI IMPROVEMENT OF WHITE CLOVER
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The need to reduce economic and environmental costs of livestock agriculture has led to a resurgence of interest in forage legumes, particularly white clover. However, despite a recognition of the benefits accruing from its high herbage quality and the nitrogen fixation from its symbiosis with the Rhizobium bacterium, the widespread use of white clover by farmers has been inhibited by several perceived problems. Foremost amongst these have been a reputation for unreliable yield, lack of persistency under intensive grazing and propensity to cause bloat in cattle.
   Conventional breeding techniques coupled with extensive genetic resources and a growing understanding of the physiological basis of variation in yield and persistency have already resulted in the development of new reliably productive varieties. These varieties will provide a cornerstone for sustainable livestock agriculture in upland and lowland areas of the UK and Europe.
   The successful application of techniques of biotechnology to white clover has accelerated in recent years. An array of approaches is now available which will open the way for its genetic manipulation and subsequent germplasm enhancement. These approaches range from the routine maintenance and propagation of plants in vitro to the production of transgenic plants, and offer possibilities of altering radically the nature of white clover in the future.

TI SUSTAINABLE MINING DEVELOPMENT HAMPERED BY LOW MINERAL PRICES
SO RESOURCES POLICY
LA English
DT Article
AB Sustainable development in mining can be achieved only through continuous exploration, technological innovation, and environmental rehabilitation. The exhaustion of known mineral deposits and the accelerated degradation of the environment necessitates the allocation of more resources to exploration, research into applicable technology, and rehabilitation. Increased investment in these activities might cause mineral prices to rise and thus reverse the long-term trend of declining and stagnating mineral prices. Present mineral price structures raise the question whether the environment is adequately priced by the free market. Market imperfections which do not properly reflect the cost to the environment have created exhaustible resources price levels lower than the socially optimal. Mineral producers of the developing world (the South) are unable to sustain mining development in the face of declining mineral price trends. If the inhabitants of the industrialized countries (the North) are concerned about global environmental degradation, they should be willing to pay mineral prices which internalize environmental costs.

ID CONSERVATION; FARM
AB Organizational assumptions embedded in the production function of neoclassical economics have served to structure production agriculture in the United States for the past 100 years. The narrow focus of the production function on the inputs of land, labor, capital, and management and the use of on-farm profitability as the primary definition of sustainability have come under attack from sustainable agriculturalists, who argue that the social and environmental consequences of production are as important as the economic outcomes. Using diversity of crops harvested as an indicator of sustainability, the production function is operationalized to inform the debate between the conventional, neoclassical model of production and the alternative, sustainable model. Census of agriculture data from 1978, 1982, and 1987 are used in both cross-sectional and temporal models. Results show that increases in expenditures for equipment and machinery, prevalence of corporate farms, higher rates of tenancy, and the prevalence of large farms are associated with lower levels of diversity at the county level. Conversely, higher levels of diversity are found in counties with greater farm labor expenses, where there are more medium-size farms, and where farmers are more likely to farm full-time.

TI SUB-NATIONAL STATE INSTITUTIONS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL
   RESOURCE USE - THE CASE OF THE DAIRY-INDUSTRY
SO RURAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; NEW-DEAL
AB Most studies of state/economy relationships focus on national and global institutions and minimize the importance of local, sub-national institutions. This lack of attention to sub-national states also characterizes most of the studies that examine the role of the state in the structure of agriculture. On the other hand, calls for a new type of sustainable agriculture argue that this type of economic system will be embedded in local political institutions. The nature of these local institutions, however, has gone largely unanalyzed. Through a comparative historical analysis of subnational state intervention in the regional economic structure of the U.S. dairy industry in the New Deal era, this analysis shows how state dairy policy has reflected sub-national interest group politics surrounding food, agriculture, and rural land use. Sub-national states responded to the agricultural crisis of the 1930s by spatially reorganizing agricultural resource use within their territories. The three states examined-New York, Wisconsin, and California-influenced the resource intensiveness of dairy agriculture by managing the spatially segmented boundaries that separated resource-intensive and low-resource dairy production systems.

AB Growing salt-tolerant crops is one of the more cost-effective strategies for coping with soil salinity, which is a significant factor affecting crop production and agricultural sustainability on the Canadian prairies. This study was carried out to determine if salt tolerance data, generated by traditional CI (NaCl/Cacl2) salinization procedures, are appropriate to the prairies, where SO4 salinity predominates. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L., cv. Bonanza) and kochia [Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad.] seedlings were grown in sand culture and salinized with either Cl or SO4 salts. The latter system was designed to mimic the natural salinity of prairie soils. The results showed that plant responses to salinity depend on the kind of salts (sulfates or chlorides) contributing to salinity as well as on the total electrolyte concentration. Growth was significantly better (by an average of 17%) on the SO4 system. However, barley salinized with SO4 salts developed severe Ca deficiency at high salt concentrations (electrical conductivity [EC] 17.5-27.5 dS m(-1)) because of low solubility of Ca. Kochia, which is more efficient than barley in absorbing Ca, was not limited by Ca. Barley and kochia tended to have higher selectivity for nutrient cations (Ca, Mg, and K) over Na when the plants were grown on the CI salt system. This may be an indication of a beneficial effect of the high Ca supply in the NaCl/CaCl2 salt system on membrane selectivity. Our results show that there are many possible interactions between salt concentration, salt type, and plant nutrition. The significance of these interactions for salt tolerance testing may vary from crop to crop and may depend on factors such as the nutrient concentration in the growing medium. From a practical standpoint, however, response functions generated by NaCl/CaCl2 salinization probably provide an acceptable measure of the tolerance of most crops to SO4 salinity.

AB Sustainable swimming speeds, defined as speeds maintained in 1-h tests, were measured for three size-classes (6-6.9 mm, 7-7.9 mm, and 8-8.9 mm) of larval striped bass Morone saxatilis. Probit analysis was used to find failure velocities (the water velocity at which 50% of the larvae fail to sustain swimming speed) and confidence intervals for each size-class. Failure velocities were 1.7, 2.1, and 3.0 cm/s for 6-6.9-mm, 7-7.9-mm, and 8-8.9-mm larvae, respectively. There was a general improvement in swimming performance with age. There was no difference in swimming ability due to the presence or absence of an inflated swim bladder. Striped bass larvae approached the upper range of swimming speeds recorded for other larval fishes and reached speeds of 3-4 body lengths/s, which are comparable to adult fish speeds. The relatively high speeds attained by striped bass larvae may improve feeding success rates by increasing the volume of water larvae are capable of searching for food.

TI SUSTAINABILITY OF HATCHERY-DEPENDENT SALMONINE FISHERIES IN LAKE-ONTARIO
   - THE CONFLICT BETWEEN PREDATOR DEMAND AND PREY SUPPLY

AB The offshore fish community of Lake Ontario is presently dominated by intensively managed, nonnative species: alewife Alosa pseudoharengus and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax at the planktivore level and stocked salmonines at the piscivore level. Salmonine stocking rates per unit area of Lake Ontario are the highest in the Great Lakes, and fishery managers are concerned about the sustainability of the fishery under present stocking policies, particularly with the recent collapse of the Lake Michigan fishery for chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. In this paper, we describe and present the results of a simulation model that integrates predator demand estimates derived from bioenergetics, prey and predator population dynamics, and a predation model based on the multiple-species functional response. Model reconstructions of historical alewife biomass trends and salmonine diets corresponded reasonably well with existing data for the period 1978-1992. The simulations suggest that current predator demand does not exceed the threshold beyond which alewife biomass cannot be sustained, but they indicate that the sustainability of the prey fish community is extremely sensitive to fluctuations in overwinter survival of alewife; an additional mortality of 25% in a single winter would be sufficient to cause the collapse of the alewife population. The model includes a number of assumptions and simplifications with a limited empirical basis; better estimates of salmonine survival rates, an evaluation of the importance of spatial and temporal interactions among predators and prey, and incorporation of the effects of recently observed declines in system productivity at lower trophic levels would significantly increase confidence in the model's projections.

AB The problem period for milk production in northern Australia is early autumn-late spring. Any change to the feedbase that improves the quality and quantity of the diet over this period will increase farm milk production by allowing increases in herd size and production per cow. Farmers will use a range of feed resources which must be integrated effectively to increase productivity (milk output/unit input) and profitability. These new farming systems must be sustainable in the long term.
   Forage resources available to improve the feed supply during winter-spring are reviewed. Those with the greatest potential to increase farm productivity are irrigated temperate pastures and forage crops, and high quality silages produced from maize, grain sorghum and legume crops. High quality legume silages have a special role to play in increasing the protein supply on dairy farms. It should also be possible to produce silages of acceptable quality from the surplus growth from tropical-subtropical pastures. Integrating silage cutting with grazing management should significantly improve pasture utilisation and quality. Feeding this silage in combination with concentrates would allow an increase in stocking rate while maintaining production per cow.

DE VEGETATION MAPPING; TROPICAL FOREST MANAGEMENT; INDIA
AB The principles and methods of the vegetation mapping undertaken at the French Institute, Pondicherry, are dealt with herein. Particularly, the characterisation of the different types of vegetation and especially the originality of the method: the dynamic interpretation of the vegetation and the depiction of the bioclimatic conditions. The programme of the forest map of South India at scale 1:250000, undertaken in collaboration with the forest departments of the concerned states, is then described with special attention given to the source and the collection of data. This map has been conceived to serve as a basic document for the sustainable management of the forests. Three examples of its application are given. They concern the detection of anomalies between the existing forest cover and the prevalent climatic environment; the detection of areas for which protection is urgently needed; the selection of regions showing a particular interest in the field of nature conservation or as gene pool reserve. Finally, an example of a thematic map of sensibility of the forests is given, using the vegetation map as a basis.

AB Wetlands are among the worlds' most important, but also most threatened, environmental resources. Wetland losses have been in progress particularly from the industrial revolution onwards, because wetland functions could not successfully compete for space with other land uses. Wetlands became recently foci of conservation efforts because of the increased awareness of their importance in water management and wildlife conservation, and because of the diversity of their habitats.
   The Netherlands are relatively rich in wetlands: 16% of its' territory is regarded as internationally important wetland and 7% has been registered as such. The major Dutch wetland types are: coastal ecosystems, large riverine systems, base-rich freshwater systems, and nutrient-poor freshwater systems.
   Most threats to the Dutch wetlands are of man-made origin. They comprise: (1) Changes in hydrology leading to changed discharges, currents and desiccation; (2) Acidification; (3) Eutrophication; and (4) Toxification. Long-term threats are largely climate-change related, and concern temperature rise and the UV-B increase in irradiation.
   General conservation goals also apply to wetlands but Ramsar-registered wetlands have a special status. Conservation of the Dutch wetlands is difficult, because of the high population density of the country and its inherent threats. However, ecological targets and standards are increasingly set in national Policy Plans and international agreements. Rehabilitation and creation of wetlands is presently widely advocated, and sometimes realised.
   For ecological research, the sustainability of wetlands should get top priority. Such a research programme would focus on understanding the underlying ecological processes in natural and man-dominated wetland systems to prescribe conservation, rehabilitation and management strategies that would enhance the sustainability of these systems. Within this framework special attention should be directed to studies (1) At the ecosystem level of ecosystem parameters, of which natural oscillations and trends in time, and on which the impact of disturbances are quantified. Particularly these studies, in which often simulation models are used as tools for interpretation, can provide the basis for extrapolations in space and time; (2) On adaptation capacity and mechanisms of (groups of) species to extreme environmental conditions; (3) On (mutual) relationships between plants, animals and microorganisms (e.g. competition, grazing and mineralization); (4) On dispersion between small wetlands. For the contemporary quantitative assessment of the long-term effects of climate changes, the effects of temperature rise and increase in UV-B irradiation on individual species, communities and ecosystems should also be studied.

DE WETLANDS POLICY; ECOLOGICAL OBJECTIVES; THE NETHERLANDS
AB An overview is presented of Dutch wetlands and the perspectives and threats to which they are exposed. The general environmental problems of The Netherlands are reflected in the problems with the preservation of wetlands: deterioriation of water quality is one of the main problems, directly followed by the desiccation of former wet areas. Also splitting up of larger coherent areas into smaller fragments due to infrastructural works does not favour long time existence of complete (eco)systems.
   The policy of the Dutch government and its different ministries towards the protection of wetlands will be described.
   The policy to protect the Wadden Sea and which is based on concepts of wise use and sustainability will be presented as an example of Dutch integral environmental policy for wetlands particularly. Our conclusion is that wetlands policy is tardy but successful.

DE FEE-HUNTING ENTERPRISE; SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT
ID PREY
AB The paper formulates a bioeconomic model of a private fee-hunting enterprise to examine the optimal management of this agroecological system under a wide range of bioeconomic circumstances. An empirical application demonstrates that the economic viability of the enterprise (conceming managers) and the sustainability of the underlying biological resources (conceming public regulators) depend critically on the initial endowment of resources and on the existence of publicly-mandated or self-imposed restrictions on maximum allowable hunting rates. Perhaps surprising is the implication that in some circumstances regulators may be able to promote resource sustainability by relaxing hunting controls.

TI NEGLECT OF BIOLOGICAL RICHES - THE ECONOMICS OF NATURE TOURISM IN NEPAL
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE ECONOMICS; ECOTOURISM; NEPAL; PROTECTED AREAS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT;
   TOURISM
AB Nepal's spectacular parks and reserves have attracted dramatically increasing numbers of foreign visitors. It might be expected that these protected areas would be nurtured as valuable and irreplaceable economic assets. However they are becoming seriously degraded and the financial resources provided for their management have been inadequate. This paper explores why - starting with the hypothesis that so little of the economic value of protected area tourism in Nepal is captured through fees and other charges assessed on foreign visitors that the protected areas are perceived as being of inconsequential value. It is conservatively estimated that $27 million of tourists' total expenditure in Nepal were attributable to the protected area network in 1988, when the costs of managing the parks were less than $5 million but direct fees collected from tourists visiting the protected areas amounted to less than $1 million. These figures suggest the parks are a good investment. But it could also be argued that the costs of park management were more than five times the revenues collected by the government from park tourists. Policy measures are identified which could help Nepal increase the economic as well as environmental benefits from nature tourism.
   Case studies of Nepal's most-visited protected areas emphasize that the lack of funds for protected area management is not the only constraint on effective management. Some important economic and institutional interests have yet to be effectively reconciled with conservation in the protected areas. Most problematic are local people's economic aspirations and the operating practices of the principal government agencies involved - the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation and the Ministry of Tourism. Fortunately there have recently been some encouraging signs of change within both of these agencies.

TI SOIL-HORIZON USE BY THE UNITED-STATES SOIL SURVEY
SO CATENA
LA English
DT Article
AB The mission of the soil survey is to assist mankind in understanding and wisely using soil resources in achieving a sustainable and desirable quality of life. The soil survey in the U.S. is founded on the precept that the soil forming factors and their interactions are distributed geographically in a sufficiently systematic manner that the relationships of soil properties and recognizable landscape features can be mapped and described consistently enough to satisfy the purposes of the survey as stated above.
   There are many more possibilities for designating horizons and layers in field descriptions than there are when applying the defined diagnostic horizons that are used in Soil Taxonomy. The first set are based on qualitative judgements, the latter are based on quantitative measurements. The Soil Survey in the United States has found it useful in meeting our objectives to keep the two kinds of horizon designations separate. Designations of genetic horizons by field scientists is in keeping with the application of the scientific method of developing concepts and hypothesis about how and why soils form and axe distributed in landscapes. The measurement of properties and designation of quantified diagnostic horizons is in keeping with the desire to have standards and definitions for a consistent hierarchical system of soil classification that can be applied more universally. Both systems are open and subject to change as knowledge and experience prevail.

AB Background. Older coronary patients are at high risk of cardiac disability. Exercise conditioning programs have been demonstrated to improve functional capacity, particularly in younger coronary patients. In this study, the effects of aerobic conditioning on submaximal and maximal indicators of exercise performance were examined in 45 older coronary patients.
   Methods and Results. Forty-five patients (mean age, 69+/-6 years; range, 62 to 82 years) entered 3-month and 12-month (n=11) endurance training programs. Training effects were assessed during an exhaustive submaximal exercise protocol with measurement of endurance time, serum lactate, perceived exertion, and expired ventilatory measures. Exhaustive endurance time increased by more than 40% (30+/-10 to 41+/-10 minutes), with associated decreases in serum lactate, perceived exertion, minute ventilation, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure during steady-state exercise. Respiratory exchange ratio during steady-state exercise, an indicator of substrate utilization, decreased, indicating a shift toward greater use of free fatty acids as a metabolic fuel. In a subset of 10 patients, percent body fat was decreased (32+/-8% to 29+/-10%) over a period of 3 months.
   Conclusions. Older coronary patients respond to aerobic conditioning with remarkable improvements in submaximal endurance capacity, out of proportion to the more modest increases in Vo2max. Activities that were exhaustive before training became sustainable for extended periods of time at a lower perceived exertion. Measurements of serum lactate, respiratory exchange ratio, and ventilation during steady-state exercise document that at an identical absolute work load after conditioning, exercise is performed using aerobic substrate to a greater degree, and ventilatory response to a given work load is lessened.

TI CHP SQUEEZED OR PROMOTED BY ENERGY-CONSERVATION AND RENEWABLES

LA English
DT Article
DE CHP; ENERGY CONSERVATION; RENEWABLES
AB 'CHP squeezed or promoted by energy conservation and renewables' and 'energy conservation and renewables squeezed or promoted by CHP' are two aspects of the same problem - the establishment of a sustainable development within the energy sector. The question of whether CHP is squeezed or promoted by energy conservation and renewables can be considered as a simple supply system problem. Introduction of energy conservation into the heat market of an established CHP system will reduce the heat sales from the system; and if the surplus capacity in the supply system is not utilized in another way inefficiency and poor economics might result. This could lead to a bad reputation for the CHP system and the development of CHP will in that case be squeezed by energy conservation. The whole topic as presented above is, however, much more complicated and this paper examines the topic with examples from Denmark.

ID ENGLAND; INDEX; WALES
AB This paper considers the concept of sustainable development and argues that it holds great potential for prompting interdisciplinary work, both between natural and social science and within the social sciences. First, a brief review of the literature on sustainable development is undertaken in order to identify the main research priorities. Second, some indications of how this work might proceed are given using the rural environment of the U.K. as an exemplar. Finally, future research priorities are identified from an interdisciplinary standpoint. It is concluded that the implications of breaking down disciplinary boundaries are far-reaching but necessary to any meaningful research on sustainability.

TI TROPICAL DEFORESTATION AND FOREST MANAGEMENT UNDER THE SYSTEM OF
   CONCESSION LOGGING - A DECISION-THEORETIC ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Deforestation caused by concession logging is often the result of harvest decisions which focus on short-run profits rather than on long-run sustainable harvest yields. A sequential-decision model of this type of behavior is here developed which focuses on a logger's annual decisions of whether or not to remain in compliance with the terms of a concession contract. The contract stipulates harvesting procedures for a sustained forest yield, and noncompliance is taken to result in deforestation. An optimal decision policy for the concession logger is characterized in terms of optimal-stopping theory, and is employed to construct payoff incentives which encourage compliance. In particular, a forest management problem is formulated which focuses on the effectiveness of partial inspection policies in deterring noncompliant behavior. General necessary and sufficient conditions for the effectiveness of such policies are established, and are given a more operational form for the Markov case. A numerical example based on actual concession-contract data is also developed which suggests certain policy implications.

AB Background: Hyperkalemic depolarized cardiac arrest has been the cornerstone of myocardial protection during cardiac surgery for more than than 30 years. Many of the advances in myocardial protection seek to minimize the cellular damage and to reduce the ongoing metabolic processes occurring as a direct consequence of the depolarized state. Ideally, cardiac arrest at hyperpolarized cellular membrane potentials-the natural resting state of the heart-will meet all the requirements of modern cardioplegia, namely, electromechanical asystole and cardiac relaxation, while preserving the vital integrity of the heart itself. Methods and results: To determine whether activation of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels by pharmacologic agents could produce hyperpolarized cardiac arrest, we tested the ability of aprikalim, a known adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel opener, to arrest the intact beating heart. In a normothermic (37-degrees-C) isolated rabbit heart preparation, aprikalim was found to rapidly shorten the action potential duration and produce cardiac asystole that was maintained during 20 minutes of ''no-flow'' global ischemia without a rise in end-diastolic pressure. Cardiac rhythm and function were fully restored by reperfusion alone (developed pressure was 100.6% +/- 7.9% of prearrest value after 30 minutes of reperfusion). In contrast, 20 minutes of unprotected normothermic global ischemia resulted in a 2.7 +/- 0.55 mm Hg rise in end-diastolic pressure and only 58.2% +/- 3.8% recovery of developed pressure after 30 minutes of reperfusion. By way of comparison, 20 minutes of standard hyperkalemic depolarized normothermic rest was accompanied by a 1.2 +/- 0.6 mm Hg rise in end-diastolic pressure and only 80.8% +/- 2.6% recovery of developed pressure after 30 minutes of reperfusion. To directly compare hyperkalemic depolarized cardiac arrest to hyperpolarized cardiac arrest induced by potassium channel openers and to better define the characteristics of such hyperpolarized arrest, we studied a fixed (4 mm Hg rise in end-diastolic pressure-contracture) ischemic injury model.  The time to development of the contracture was prolonged by hyperkalemic arrest (35.8 +/- 1.7 minutes) and significantly more so by hyperpolarized arrest (47.0 +/- 3.3 minutes) when compared with that of unprotected hearts (24.0 +/- 1.2 minutes). Moreover, aprikalim resulted in significantly better postischemic recovery of function (developed pressure was 69.0% +/- 6.7% of prearrest value after 30 minutes of reperfusion) than after no cardioplegia (45.4% +/- 7.5%) or standard hyperkalemic cardioplegia (44.3% +/- 5.7%).  Conclusions: Pharmacologic activation of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels can result in predictable and sustainable hyperpolarized cardiac arrest that is reversible by reperfusion.  This method of myocardial protection was found to fully preserve cardiac electromechanical function after a 20-minute period of global normothermic ischemic.  Furthermore, hyperpolarized arrest induced by potassium channel openers significantly prolonged the period to the development of contracture and afforded a significantly better postischemic recovery of function than obtained in either hearts protected with hyperkalemic depolarized arrest or those not protected by any form of cardioplegia.

TI OUTWARD ORIENTATION AND MARGINAL ENVIRONMENTS - THE QUESTION OF
   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORTE CHICO, CHILE
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper attempts to investigate die tensions that presently exist between economic growth and the semi-arid, marginal environment of Chile's Norte Chico valleys. During the 1970s and 1980s, Chilean economic policies have favored export-oriented growth. In some formerly depressed rural regions that came to enjoy a comparative advantage in international trade, a dramatic growth in export-oriented production has occurred; one example is the table grape. However, this mountainous region can be classed as marginal, with low average rainfall, high annual rainfall variability, high rates of evaporation, a long-term decline in rainfall and the constraints on water supply that these signify, particularly in consecutive years of winter drought. This paper explores the nature of these environmental constraints before examining the nature of the dramatic growth in export-oriented agriculture and the main economic agents that explain this growth. An attempt is then made to assess the impacts of export-oriented growth on the marginal environment of the Norte Chico, focusing in particular on the relationship between land and water. Finally, a theoretical model is created in order to conceptualise the relationship between economic growth and environmental constraints in terms of sustainable development.

TI THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT IN COAL PRODUCTION AND
   UTILIZATION
SO NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
LA English
DT Article
AB Large-scale exploitation of fossil fuels and nuclear power can have an adverse effect on the human and natural environment. That need not be the case, if the effect on the environment is carefully assessed to ensure the development of a sustainable approach. This paper examines the process of environmental impact assessment (EIA) for coal from an international perspective. The concept of EIA is not new. A formalized process of EIA was introduced in the USA in 1970, and more recently similar legislation has been implemented in other countries. The member states of the European Community are required to adopt EIA regulations, as set out in Directive 85/337/EEC. Elsewhere, in Japan and Australia, there are requirements for EIA and a growing need for the process can be seen in developing countries. A comparison is made of the EIA process for coal in the international arena, and exemplary procedures are highlighted. Potential problems such as delays, modifications and additional costs are analysed, and the benefits of EIA, both to industry and environment, are discussed. A database of coal-related EIA would facilitate an exchange of information on the subject.

AB This paper examines the General Environmental Law of Bolivia which was recently passed by its Congress. It is a multi-purpose law with two primary objectives: (i) the protection and conservation of the environment; and (ii) the promotion of sustainable development. In this law, environmental benefits are emphasized by stating genera principles, not by attempting to define the means. Regulations setting forth the means are left to the writing of subsequent complementary codes. This paper shows that much of the controversy surrounding the legislation disappears when it is seen as a guideline rather than an operational part of Bolivia's industrial policy. In essence, the law addresses environmental awareness in a region that is more anxious than ever to speed economic growth.

TI STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL-RESEARCH - THE EMBRAPA EXPERIENCE
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The Brazilian Corporation for Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA) is building a new institutional paradigm to lead it into the twenty-first century. More than 9,500 research managers, scientists and research support staff from EMBRAPA's Headquarters and 41 research centres, as well as research users and partners, are involved. The process includes developing future scenarios for agricultural research, a broad evaluation of EMBRAPA structure and programmes and strategic planning for the organization as a whole and for each research centre. This paper presents the rationale guiding EMBRAPA's search for institutional sustainability for the 1990s and beyond. It summarizes the strategic steps under way in EMBRAPA's change process and it synthesizes success factors and major obstacles influencing the process. It then outlines EMBRAPA's new institutional paradigm: 'Enterprise with social accountability'.

AB Poor nutrition remains a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in South-East Asia. Manifestations of this include protein-energy malnutrition, iodine deficiency diseases, vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency and some non-communicable diseases of adults. The extent of these diseases, and their interactions with infection, make nutrition the single most important modifiable host factor underlying health status in the region. It is vital that long-term sustainable programs for the control of nutrition problems are accorded a high priority within the health sector.

AB Available tests to detect antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have a range of applications, and injudicious selection and inappropriate use can add a significant financial burden to budgets for AIDS programmes in developing countries. There are several ways by which the cost of HIV antibody testing can be reduced; they include use of tests appropriate for existing laboratory capabilities; adoption of cost-effective testing strategies; pooling of serum samples before testing; and ensuring best possible purchase prices. Each approach can significantly reduce the cost of HIV antibody testing alone or in combination, which increases the potential sustainability of antibody testing programmes, even in settings of limited resources.

TI DETERIORATION OF A SUSTAINABLE AGRO-SILVO-PASTORAL SYSTEM IN THE SUDAN -
   THE GUM GARDENS OF KORDOFAN
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE SUDAN; ACACIA; GUM; GRAZING; RURAL COMMUNITIES
AB The development and establishment of agroforestry systems is often suggested as a way to stabilize rural economies in developing countries [King, 1979]. At the same time, some traditional systems are being lost, due to an inability to protect the perennial or tree crop components of the system. These traditional systems and the forces that reinforce or destroy them should be carefully studied by those in the process of encouraging adoption of agroforestry systems in the developing world. The gum gardens of Western Sudan are a case in point. Acacia senegal (hashab*) and Acacia seyal (talh) are the two major marketable gum-producing trees found in the western region of Sudan. The Acacias are grown as part of an agro-silvo-pastoral system that has persisted for more than a hundred years in Kordofan Province, where 70% of Sudan's gum Arabic was once produced, as well as most of its grain and livestock products. After a lengthy drought lasting from 1979 to 1985 gum production in Sudan drastically decreased. It was reported that pest attacks and drought were major causal agents in the decline of gum production [Awouda, 1989; Sungar, 19861. A survey executed in Northern Kordofan Province, starting in August of 1986, did uncover a great number of dead Acacias due to drought and pest attack, but from interviews with gum farmers we conclude that the decline in gum production is largely due to unfavorable socioeconomic relationships exacerbated by the drought, leading to the deterioration of the agroforestry system of production. An inability to get a fair price for gum at the local level and increasing emphasis on a cash economy led to the neglect of the tree components of the system. The gum gardens have long flourished with the intensive husbandry of small-scale farmers. Once these farmers were no longer able to care for them, the gum trees disappeared from the system, indicating that a lack of community stability can be fatal to even a well-developed agroforestry system.

ID CROP RESIDUE; SOIL; NITROGEN
AB Cereal stovers and other crop residues are vital feeds for ruminants during the 6- to 8-mo dry season in mixed farming systems of semiarid West Africa. Reducing the competition between livestock and soil fertility is crucial to the sustained productivity of these farming systems. A 2-yr field study was conducted in Niger on a sandy siliceous isohyperthermic Psammentic Paleustalf to determine the effects of fertilizer N (15 and 45 kg ha-1) and P (4.4 and 17.4 kg ba-1) on dry matter (DM), N, P, and structural carbohydrate distribution in plant parts of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.]. Fertilizer N increased total millet DM by 13%, N uptake by 63%, and P uptake by 29%. Fertilizer P increased total millet DM by 100%, N uptake by 80%, and P uptake by 140%. Fertilizer N increased millet grain yield only during the year of adequate rainfall, whereas fertilizer P increased yields during both years. Fertilizer N increased and fertilizer P decreased the N concentrations in millet stover. Fertilizer P increased the P concentrations in all upper plant parts. The average total millet DM of 2.75 Mg ha-1 was partitioned into grain (18%); animal feed consisting of chaff, immature panicles, upper stover and tillers (41%); and middle and lower stover components for soil conservation (41%). Partitioning was not affected by fertilizer addition. Of the total N (33.4 kg ha-1) and P (5.2 kg ha-1) uptake, 32 and 40% were contained in grain, 41 and 40% in animal feed, and 27 and 20% in components for soil conservation. Results of our study show the importance of N and especially P in increasing grain and forage yield and quality, and that stover can be managed more effectively to raise both crops and livestock in a more sustainable manner.

AB The ecological, economical and social conditions are during the second half of this century subject to fundamental changes. It is becoming increasingly evident that our human household must adapt to environmental constraints. Ecology and economics need to be integrated, a process now widely dealt with by scientists in many countries and in international fora. Suggestions for new approaches and methods emerge. Sustainable Development and Ecological Economics are a few examples.
   Central is the supply and flow of energy and matter and the emission of waste products. Also dogmas, criteria and values are questioned with a subsequent need for readjustments in science.  These developments have a direct impact on forest research, especially for Forest Operations and Techniques, as these operations are fundamental for sound and healthy forestry. Forest research can contribute to promote sustainability in the utilization of natural resources and to the creation and acceptance of new concepts and ideas for an integrated human household. Some suggestions are presented in the paper with emphasis on energy analysis as a tool for a more realistic and adequate view on current and future problems, than the presently used scales - time and money - offer.

AB The aim of the paper is to assess the nature and suitability of the natural resource base of a fragile environment for sustainable economic development. The situation is further complicated by the fact that groundwater conditions in the study area, the southeastern desert of Egypt, have been radically altered since the construction of the Aswan High Dam. Results show that soil conditions in the area will support both vegetation and crops over short periods of time, although further work is needed on long-term sustainability. There are three main sources of water in the area: surface water from Lake Nasser; shallow groundwater, associated with Lake Nasser; and ancient groundwater at depth in the Nubian sandstone. It is the former two which offer the most realistic development options. Vegetation resources offer opportunities for grazing, charcoal production and medicinal uses. The perceptions and attitudes of the local people of the area, as well as their livelihood patterns, make up a major element of the proposed development plan of the area.

AB Triple cereal cropping is an important grain production pattern which has been adopted on a vast area of paddy fields in Southern China. A long-term triple cereal cropping (barely With double-cropped rice) experiment has been conducted for 18 years (1974-1991) in paddy fields on the southern coastal plain of Zhejiang. The results showed that long-term triple cereal cropping has a high and stable grain yield level if certain improved crop varieties are used. Furthermore, the use of organic manure to reduce yield fluctuations and promote N-use efficiency was evaluated.

AB In this article, an overview of the status of coastal zone management (CZM) in South Africa is presented. Firstly, it provides background to the development of various initiatives to promote sustainable use of coastal resources within the context of sociopolitical changes in South Africa Thereafter, it examines the progress made with respect to key attributes underpinning most CZM programs. Finally, it identifies obstacles to achieving effective CZM in South Africa and makes recommendations to address these shortcomings. The review reveals that whilst considerable progress has been made in certain areas of program development, such as resource conservation and pollution control, there are several gaps and inadequacies within existing efforts. These include the absence of a clear policy to guide efforts, lack of coordination amongst government departments involved in CZM, as well as inadequacies in our legal and administrative system. The promulgation of a Coastal Zone Management Act and the establishment of a Coastal Unit charged with the coordination and review of all activities impinging on coastal resources are amongst the recommendations made.

AB In the last two decades, attention has been focused on cost effective fuel saving, first under the pressure of depleting fuel resources and later under the pressure of sustainable environment. In this paper, emerging methods of energy analysis which happen to take a lead are critically reviewed. Advantages and limitations are highlighted. The methods considered are second law accounting and costing, thermoeconomic optimization, pinch technology, and expert systems.

DE NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS; ECONOMIC VALUATION; SUSTAINABILITY
AB Recent studies of non-timber products from tropical rain forests have emphasized the economic value of these products and the sustainability of present harvests. Many of these studies rely upon a set of untested assumptions about the effects of harvesting upon the forest and the economic value of non-timber forest products in both the marketplace and in the daily life of rural people. These assumptions were formulated as a series of hypotheses during the workshop held in the Regional Community Forestry Training Center, Kesetsart University, Bangkok, in May 1992. The six hypotheses developed by workshop participants will be used to guide future research. As the hypotheses are tested, the data will be used to create a more realistic assessment of the sustainability and economic value of extraction of non-timber products from tropical forests.

AB By drawing on quantitative studies in social anthropology, zoology, ethnobotany, and economics we present a method for conducting an economic valuation of non-timber forest products. A review of 24 studies suggests that the median value for non-timber forest products is about $50/ha/year. We discuss problems with past studies and suggest ways to get better estimates of output quantities, marginal costs, and prices.

DE NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS; TROPICAL FORESTS; INDIA; ECONOMIC VALUATION
AB Non-timber forest products (NTFP) such as fuelwood, fodder, fruit, medicinal plants, and small timber are important to the rural poor in India. The traditional usufruct rights that the poor enjoyed have been gradually eroded by state control. This process has accelerated with increases in the prices of timber and industrial wood products. Non-timber forest products collected by the poor do not enter the system of national accounts, which results in the undervaluation of the forest wealth of the country. According to some estimates, the total demand for these products outstrips the sustainable yield of the forests in India. To ensure the best use of the forests, it is necessary for rural communities to share the responsibility of forest management with the forest departments. A proposed joint forestry project in South India is discussed as a case study of this innovative approach to forest management. Data on the existing patterns of NTFP extraction are presented to gain a better understanding of the role that these products play in the life of the rural poor. Policies from the case study are discussed in the concluding section.

AB Mudumalai is biologically rich with a wealth of plant and animal life. Increasing human numbers and current patterns of non-timber forest product, fodder and fuelwood extraction threaten the integrity of the ecosystem. Change in management of the protected areas that include the Mudumalai region is needed. In particular, policies relating to grazing and basic energy requirements need to be reexamined. At the same time, mechanisms must be developed to increase rural incomes using means other than exploitation of natural resources.

   VALUATION
ID CONSERVATION
AB Lowland and mid-elevational rain forests of Sri Lanka harbor a relict, endemic-rich flora which is also rich in timber and non-timber forest resources. These forests supply nearly half of the total wood requirements of the country and are dwindling rapidly; management of the forests to conserve the biological richness and maintain environmental services is therefore a difficult proposition. This predicament is further compounded by the dependency of rural people on a range of non-timber forest resources for their subsistence and income. A forestry master plan recently prepared for Sri Lanka has not given adequate recognition to the important role played by non-timber forest resources in rural livelihood. This oversight is primarily due to the lack of quantitative information to justify the role of non-timber forest resources in forestry sector development. Forestry policies that ignore these resources often anger local people, leading the villagers to vent their disapproval through destructive actions such as burning timber plantations. Long-term interdisciplinary research in ecology, reproductive and soil biology, ethnobiology, silviculture, rural sociology and resource economics in progress at Sinharaja attempts to address these questions of sustainable development of forest resources in an integrated mode. While research oriented toward conservation investigates both short- and long-term ecosystem dynamics in natural and modified forest stands, utilization-oriented research probes the impact of increased human disturbance, particularly the impact of rural communities on dwindling forest resources, as well as the effect of forest conservation on rural livelihood. These studies continue to seek alternative methods of forest management which are socially acceptable, economically viable, and ecologically sustainable for multiple uses. These methods will assist in the refinement of current forest policies, forestry planning, and the implementation of new policies and plans in Sri Lanka.

AB After four decades of planned economic development, large numbers of people in the Third World still lack the basic means of subsistence. Broadly speaking, the academic debate on Poverty has revolved around the type of development: free-market, planned socialist, or environmentally sustainable. It may be argued, however, that the principal problem lies in the very process of development, and that modern poverty is a form of development-induced scarcity. If this is true, our view of poverty must be radically altered to include its epistemology-that is, the intellect of ''how we know poverty.'' This position is clarified with an example from agricultural modernization, using a story about the Green Revolution and its epistemic transformation from seeds of plenty to seeds of scarcity.

AB This article begins with a brief review of the socioeconomic situation, energy resources, and energy consumptions in Turkey. The estimates for the sustainability years of fossil fuels and the potential of renewable energies are given. Hydropower, biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, wave, sea currents, and salt gradient are, in order of priority, listed among the renewable energy resources of the country. The importance of energy conservation is discussed in conjunction with the research results produced for the conditions of the country. For the reference year 1989, potentials for energy savings are estimated in the residental, industrial, transport, and power sectors. The validity of the findings is discussed. Air pollution levels due to fossil-fuel consumption are pointed out. In this context, the role of renewables is indicated. The economics of solar and biogas heating systems are reviewed. The article concludes with a discussion of research gaps in national energy planning. Exploitation and management of indigenous fossil fuels, efficient utilization of energy, application of renewable energy systems, and implementation of environmental regulations are listed among the main topics.

TI CHANGING BEHAVIOR AND MAKING IT STICK - THE CONCEPTUALIZATION AND

AB A sustainable planet is not possible without patterns of conserving behavior. The resource-costly life-styles that are characteristic of the current scene present a historic challenge. Never before have so many behaviors needed to change in so short a time. More challenging is that they must stay changed. For many reasons the techniques commonly used to promote conservation behavior are more reliable at modulating short-term behavior than at achieving durable change. The perceived urgency of environmental problems tends to make immediate behavior change the major focus. But of equal importance is the stability of behavior once changed. Thus one goal of conservation behavior research is to discover techniques that change individual behavior while minimizing or eliminating the need for repeated intervention. This article categorizes behavior change techniques first by their informational or motivational nature and second by the source of the change: derived from others or gained by direct personal involvement.  Evaluating selected techniques using five proposed dimensions suggests why durable behavior change has been so hard to achieve.  Research implications are discussed.

AB This article reviews the application of environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures and practices to three watershed modification projects situated in western Canada. These ventures were justified for accelerating regional economic development, and cover the period during which public concerns for protecting the environment rapidly made their way into the national political agenda. An historical account and analysis of the situation, therefore, seems desirable in order to understand the development of EIA processes, practices, and methodologies since the start of construction of the first project in 1961. This stud concludes that there has been good progress in predicting and evaluating environmental and related social impacts of watershed modification proposals. However, a number of obstacles need to be overcome before EIA can firmly establish itself as an effective planning tool. These difficulties include jurisdictional confusions and conflicts, division of authority and responsibility in designing and implementing appropriate mitigative and monitoring measures, lack of tested EIA methodologies, and limited availability of qualified human resources. A number of conclusions and suggestions are offered so that future watershed modification proposals may be planned and implemented in a more environmentally sustainable fashion. These include: (1) EIA processes must be completed before irrevocable decisions are made. (2) Any major intrusion into a watershed is likely to impact on some major components of the ecosystem(s). (3) Mitigation costs must form part of the benefit-cost analysis of any project proposal. (4) Interjurisdictional cooperation is imperative where watersheds cross political boundaries. (5) The EIA process is a public process, hence public concerns must be dealt with fairly. (6) The role of science in the EIA process must be at arms length from project proponents and regulators, and allowed to function in the interest of the protection of the environment and public health and safety.

LA English
DT Article
AB As global competition intensified and the rate of technological innovation and diffusion accelerated over the 1970s and 1980s, the sustainability of comparative advantage based solely on the existence of location-specific raw materials or cheap labour began to erode and innovation emerged as the key to competitiveness. For those few Third World countries that successfully passed through the window of opportunity for effective catch-up strategies that opened in the 1970s, a base was laid for innovation in products, processes or organizational technologies. The 'other two-thirds', however, were singularly unprepared to meet the challenges of a changing technological and competitive environment.  In large part this resulted from the contradictions generated by the mass production, import reproduction model to which they had remained wedded for several decades. During the 1980s, a number of changes took place, in the strategies of multinational corporations with respect to the internationalization of R&D and the role of overseas subsidiaries more generally, and in government policies with respect to the role of innovation in international competitiveness. A slow process of technological accumulation in both public and private sector enterprises and universities in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean also got underway. These changes provide the foundation upon which well crafted policies to promote networks for innovation can be developed.  In Latin America a number of such networks are already in place, and the article discusses the new role that both states and international donors are playing in stimulating and supporting them. A brief look at how such approaches might be adapted and generalized to Africa is also offered.

AB There is a wide variety of wetland environments in West Africa. They include various kinds of floodplains (for example those of the Senegal, Niger and Logone-Chari system), larger inland deltas and lacustrine wetlands (notably Lake Chad and the Niger Inland Delta in Mali), and coastal and delta environments (for example the deltas of the Senegal, Niger and Volta Rivers, the Basse Casamance or the Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania). Most of them support substantial communities of people, who depend on their natural resources and the ecology and hydrological patterns that maintain them. Indigenous systems of water resource management include agriculture (including flood cropping, notably of rice, flood recession cropping and various kinds of irrigation at various scales), fishing and pastoralism. In the Sahel in particular, wetlands provide a vital element in the resources available to people not only within but well beyond their immediate boundaries. Many of these wetlands also support internationally important populations of wild species, those in the Sahel, for example, providing important links in the Palaearctic-African bird migration flyway. Water resource development projects can have serious implications for the ecology and economy of wetlands in West Africa, and great care is needed to ensure that development projects do not cause real economic costs that outweigh potential economic benefits.

AB The evolution of geomorphology and in particular, fluvial geomorphology, is at a crossroads. Currently, the discipline is dismally organized, without focus or direction, and is practised by individualists who rarely collaborate in numbers significant enough to generate major research initiatives. If the discipline is to mature and to prosper, we must make some very difficult decisions that will require major changes in our ways of thinking and operating. Either the field stays in its current operational mode and becomes a backwater science, or it moves forward and adopts the ways of the more competitive sectors of the earth and biosciences.
   For the discipline to evolve, fluvial geomorphologists must first organize an association within North America or at the international level. The 3rd International Geomorphology Conference may be a start, but within that organization we must develop our own divisional and/or regional organizations. Within the Quaternary geology/geomorphology divisions of the Geological Society of America (GSA), Association of American Geographers (AAG), American Geophysical Union (AGU) and British Geomorphology Research Group (BGRG) the voice of fluvial geomorphology is lost in a sea of diverse and competitive interests, though there is reason for hope resulting from some recent initiatives.  In Canada, we have no national geomorphology organization per se; our closest organization is Canqua (Canadian Quaternary Association). Next, fluvial researchers must collaborate, by whatever means, to develop ''scientific critical mass'' in order to generate ideas and long-range goals of modest and major scientific importance. These projects will help secure major research funding without which, research opportunities will diminish and initiating major new research will become nearly impossible. Currently, we are being surpassed by the glaciologists, remote sensors, ecologists, oceanographers, climatologists-atmospheric researchers and some Quaternary scientists, because they are organized and successfully promote and sell a variety of global change research and other large-scale projects for major funding. Moreover, I see no end to their current success and future prospects as research councils and the public perceives continued deterioration of climate and ecosystems. Next, senior fluvial researchers must work more closely with junior researchers to instill collaborative attitudes, generate group synergism and to provide the inspiration to help ''kick start'' their careers so they can quickly reach critical momentum. Finally, we must embrace the model of success used by our colleagues in associated, more successful parts of the sciences. An issue we must debate now is whether our only hope is to climb onto the global change and sustainable development bandwagons or to evolve our own mega-projects and scientific agendas.
   Governments are financially constrained and future lean and competitive times are a certainty. The good old days are over; we are at a historical break point. University and government budget cuts are eliminating ever increasing numbers of geomorphology faculty and research positions. The discipline must take action or suffer the consequences. If we do nothing, the decision-making powers may reclassify the field as scientifically irrelevant.
   Our current situation will require more than repackaging of existing concepts, suggesting ''band-aid'' paradigms, and proposing ''quick-fix'' gimmicks. We must make some fundamental changes in the way we think and operate in order to develop a survival plan before it is too late. We must get together and talk about what kind of future we want and how to achieve it before geomorphology falls into a state of irreversible decay.
   This article is not about how wonderful the future will be. Its aim is to awaken fluvial geomorphologists from complacency so that they can take action and prepare for tough competitive times ahead. In the following paragraphs I outline some of my deep concerns about the future of our field and suggest some survival remedies.

AB The following paper examines economic aspects of tropical deforestation in South East Asia, focusing mainly on the role of tropical timber production. Current evidence suggests that the levels of deforestation in the region may not be optimal but 'excessive' from an economic point of view. Important values are lost, some perhaps irreversibly, when closed forests are 'opened up', degraded or cleared but there is insufficient accounting for these foregone benefits in land use decisions. The problem is exacerbated by policy distortions that effectively subsidize activities that lead to deforestation. Although forest clearing for agriculture is the main source of tropical deforestation in the region, timber production also has a direct impact through the removal of trees and damage to the remaining forest area, as well as an indirect impact through opening up and improving access to the forests for land-clearing activities. Pricing, investment and institutional policies for forestry actually work to create the conditions for short-term harvesting by private concessionaires and, in some instances, even subsidize private harvesting at inefficient levels. The under-pricing of stumpage values also means that the wrong signals over resource scarcity are given as old growth forests are depleted. The result is that forest-based industrialization becomes out of synche with long term economic development and deforestation patterns. A major thinking of forestry and agricultural policies in the region is required if South East Asian countries are to manage the 'natural capital' inherent in their tropical forests in an efficient and sustainable manner.

AB Ideally, social forestry programmes and philosophies are intended to involve local people in the management and distribution of resources. In practice, the structures of forestry programmes are influenced by political, economic and cultural factors at national and local levels. When social forestry programmes entail the reallocation of access to forest resources on state lands, power relations are particularly influential. As the case of the Java Social Forestry Program illustrates, powerful social forces that have shaped historically the national forest management agency and the social structures of forest-based villages have distorted social forestry ideals. When their traditional management tools are unable to curb deforestation and the social processes causing deforestation, forestry agencies may be persuaded to implement social forestry policies. Changes in forestry programmes and the orientation of social forestry are inevitably subject to local negotiation and renegotiation. The outcomes of negotiation, however, are dependent on the structures of power relations both before and after implementation of new policies.

AB The recovery of the world economy since the fifties and corresponding economic development in Malaysia has put extreme pressure on the natural forest and land resource and outstripped Sarawak's capacities to maintain sustainability. Sarawak reacted in the early nineties by developing an integrated approach to improvements in forestry research and forestry practice towards designing and implementing sustainable management and conservation of the forest resource. Obstacles are formidable, but, if and when they are overcome, Sarawak will have regained its position as one of the major trail-blazers in rain forest management and will have changed its forest industry from a sunset to sunrise industry.

DE CONFLICT RESOLUTION; NATURAL RESOURCES; BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT; COMMON
   RESOURCE PROPERTY DISPUTES
AB It is clear that for decades the traditional, confrontational method of dealing with conflicts in interests over natural resources does not resolve problems. Most methods rely on one party or another fulfilling undertakings which can easily be broken without any framework of checks and balances which ensure consistency and homeostasis.
   At least two difficulties exist to providing a better basis for resolving conflict; some jurisprudence framework derived from natural sciences and socioeconomics concerning common resource property, and a clearer understanding of the definition of biodiversity. The absence of a decision-making environmental framework for resolving conflicts between environmental 'stakeholders', benefitting all parties, means that any conservation or sustainable use of natural resources will always be corrupted and fail. Moreover the way in which biodiversity is defined changes planning priorities.
   This chapter offers an insight into both the problems and possible solutions of biodiversity management, or conservation, and common resource property disputes.

AB The control of nematode parasites of livestock is presently based entirely on anthelmintic treatment and grazing management. On their own, these methods are not sustainable because parasites invariably develop resistance to anthelmintics and because of increasing public concern about chemical residues in livestock products and the environment. Although alternative, non-chemotherapeutic control strategies, such as vaccines and genetic selection for resistance are the focus of considerable research activity worldwide, biological control of nematode parasites has been virtually ignored. The little work that has been done is restricted largely to western Europe and involves virtually just one fungal species, namely Arthrobotrys oligospora. More recent studies indicate other known nematophagous fungal species are more efficient predators of infective larvae in sheep faeces than A. oligospora, and others have a greater capacity to survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants. These findings plus the relatively sparse numbers of microbial competitors in the fresh faecal environment, compared with the plant rhizosphere where biological control of plant parasites is proving a particularly intractable problem, engenders optimism that the biological control of animal parasitic nematodes may become a practical reality. Such control will never be a substitute for chemotherapy, where the primary purpose is worm removal from the host, but should be incorporated together with other options into integrated pest management systems to provide sustainable nematode control of livestock into the twenty-first century.

TI SHORT-TERM EXCESS WATER IMPACT ON CORN YIELD AND NITROGEN RECOVERY
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB Optimum N management for soils which can have short-term, early-season periods of excessive soil water requires farmers to balance economic and environmental concerns. The objectives of this study were to evaluate corn (Zea mays L.) yield and N fertilizer recovery following 0, 4, or 6 in. of excess soil water. Field studies were conducted from 1985 to 1988 on Cisne silt loam (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Mollic Albaqualf), Drummer silty clay loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Haplaquoll), and Plainfield sand (mixed, mesic Typic Udipsamment) at three Illinois locations. Water stress was imposed by applying 0, 4, or 6 in. of water to soils at field capacity (0.33 bar). Fertilizer rates ranged from 0 to 200 lb N/acre with an additional 50 lb N/acre being applied to half the plot following the water stress treatments. Isotopic N-15 was used for the 150 lb N/acre treatment. Relative yield on Drummer decreased approximately 1% for each day soil water tension was below 0.33 bar. On Cisne, three stress days decreased yields less than 1%, but 7 d increased the loss to about 5%. Regression equations showed that even with 200 lb N/acre, 17 in. of water during May and June resulted in yields that were only 18% of those produced with 5 in. on a Plainfield sand. Fertilizer recovery averaged 88, 61, and 61% for Cisne; 83, 50, and 44% for Drummer; and 25, 8, and 13% for Plainfield soils with 0, 4, and 6 in. of excess,water. Denitrification was the primary loss mechanism for the Cisne and Drummer soils, while for the Plainfield sand, it was leaching. Equations developed from this study will result in more economical and environmentally sustainable N management decisions.

AB Faced with deplorable ecological and economic conditions in the Acacia caven dominated 'Espinales' of the Mediterranean-climate zone of central Chile, we have undertaken a long-term project aimed at combining sustainable resource development of the region with ecological rehabilitation of Espinal ecosystems and landscapes. The central hypothesis in this project is that the introduction of compatible and appropriate legume/N2-fixing microsymbiont 'couples' can (1) optimize the amount of atmospheric nitrogen fixed in a degraded arid or semiarid land ecosystem, (2) promote the development of associated plants, and (3) improve soils and enhance possibilities for the spontaneous or assisted return of native plants and animals. A schematic model is presented of ecosystem degradation in the Chilean Espinales together with three alternative responses to it (restoration, rehabilitation and reallocation). The roles of 'artificial negative selection' and 'positive selection' in these processes are discussed. Finally, we compare the landscape of a typical farming village in south-central Chile as seen today, and as it could become when bio- and agro-ecological diversity are recognized as the best guarantors of ecosystem stability, resilience, and long-term productivity.

AB Biodiversity refers to the variety and variability among living organisms and the ecological complexes in which they occur. The importance of biodiversity has been conceptually well recognized in plantation forestry. Even if stress of biodiversity varies according to the forest plantation use, cautious adjustments of standard planning and cultivation techniques oriented to biodiversity can generally give significant benefits, not only in terms of plantation sustainability and stability, but also in terms of landscape enhancement and maintenance of ecotope productivity. In this perspective, basic and operational aspects of introducing biodiversity ideas into forest plantation planning, establishment and management are discussed, underlying that afforestation may represent a useful means of enhancing biodiversity within the northern Mediterranean landscapes, both on chorological and topologic scales.

AB Koprulu Kanyon National Park is one of the largest National Parks in Turkey. Besides Olympos and Termessos National Park which are not documented at all with a distinct scientific resolution, the reference area is the only park in the East Mediterranean. Through the activities of the UNESCO concept for biosphere reserves it might be possible to match the world interest with local peoples needs. The Koprulu Kanyon National Park comprises the whole range of vegetational zones from thermo-Mediterranean to alpine environments; it also includes a well balanced proportion of natural and manmade ecosystem fragments with transient gradients, i.e. a variety of agro-silvo-pastoral subsystems. The paper discusses options for development of the area focussing on different scales, interests and addresses. Worldwide interest is to be expected for the idea of making Koprulu Kanyon National Park part of a biosphere reserve network along a transect from the Mediterranean to Inner Anatolia which necessarily must have impact on the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme, and on the International Sustainable Biosphere Initiative, as it would be difficult to find better reference areas than here. Furthermore local and regional development concepts are discussed which include a local horticulture industry, a regional botanic garden, medicinal plants production and a regional research centre. All these options are intended to give prospects for those people living in the National Park and those living in the developed world heavily depending on the bioresources of the lesser developed world though this relation is only occasionally realised as such.

LA English
DT Article
AB In view of the alarming threats to our planet Earth and its natural and cultural diversity, the IUCN World Conservation Organization must broaden the scale of its efforts from the species and ecosystem level to the landscape level. For this purpose new, more comprehensive strategies and powerfuls tools, based on holistic landscape planning and dynamic conservation management, are urgently needed. The Mediterranean Basin, presently undergoing an alarming process of biological, cultural and scenic degradation can serve as a good example for these needs. Here, as elsewhere, almost all conservation efforts have been devoted to the protection of restricted areas such as nature reserves or parks without much regard for the fate of the open landscape as a whole and the need for the conservation and restoration of its great natural and cultural assets. In order to gain greater public awareness and apprehension of these threats, to change the attitudes of politicians and decision-makers, and to provide practical guidance for holistic, sustainable and multibeneficial land use planning and management, a new tool of 'Red Books for Threatened Landscapes' is offered. These should present in clear non-technical terms, with ample maps and illustrations, recent, adverse biological, ecological, cultural and socio-economic changes in highly valuable and not yet irreversibly despoiled landscapes and their future threats, and suggest alternative, sustainable land use strategies with sounder conservation and restoration options. The Western Crete study, is the first Mediterranean Red Book case study, carried out by a multinational and multidisciplinary team. It will serve as an important example for a Red Book blueprint, to be prepared by the IALE-IUCN-CESP Working Group on Red Books for Threatened Landscapes.

TI CONSERVATION AND USE OF THE MAI PO MARSHES, HONG-KONG
SO NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The Mai Po marshes in Hong Kong are a remnant of a wetland system that has changed substantially in area and natural character as a result of human activity; most of this activity has occurred in the last three decades. Prior to the 1920s much of the Mai Po area consisted of extensive mangroves, marshes, tidal flats, and wetlands that had not been directly affected by agriculture or other human activity. Between the 1920s and the 1960s much of the area was converted to gei wais - areas of intertidal marshland enclosed by an earthen dike fitted with a sluice gate to allow for alternating entry and drainage of tidal waters and the exploitation of shrimp and other fish. The gei wais included uneven patches and fringes of wetland favorable to varied bird and other life, including important migratory species. Since the 1960s the gei wais have steadily been converted to sites for rice production, new housing, aquaculture, and other uses associated with the rapid growth of Hong Kong. The World Wild Fund for Nature, Hong Kong, is leading the attempt to conserve the gei wais and their important ecological functions through purchase and continued operation of gei wais, environmental eduction activities, and other programs. The Mai Po area and may of the gei wais are designated as a conservation reserve (''site of special scientific interest''), but the pressures on the wetlands continue, especially with accelerating industrialization and urbanization in adjoining mainland China. Such modernization pressures are underway in many parts of Asia and require more vigorous and comprehensive conservation and sustainable development efforts. In the case of the Mai Po for example, the creation of a biosphere reserve would likely be beneficial, especially if it were more strongly supported by the Hong Kong and Chinese governments.

AB One of the methods for measuring the efficiency of N utilization by plants is the index of physiological efficiency of absorbed N (PEN) which for cereals is defined as the ratio of grain produced to the total N absorbed by the above-ground plant parts (grain and straw) at maturity. This index indicates how this absorbed N is used by the plant to produce grain. The objective of this work was to study the genotypic variability of PEN in oats (Avena sativa L.) and to what extent grain yield is related to PEN. Seven selected oat genotypes were studied under greenhouse conditions with 5 levels of added N including control (no additional N). At maturity the grain and straw were harvested separately and analyzed for total N. The results show that there was a highly significant variation among genotypes in both yield per pot and PEN. Grain yield was positively and significantly related to PEN (r = 0.95xx). The total N absorbed by plants was much less correlated with grain yield than PEN. The results suggest that PEN may be used in a plant breeding program to detect the potentially high yielding oat genotypes and to evaluate those capable of exploiting N input most efficiently.

AB The high clay content and saline-sodic characteristics of bentonite mine spoils result in an environment that is not conducive to sustainable plant growth. Use of wood residue amendments have enabled revegetation of these materials; however, sodic conditions persist or worsen, threatening the long-term sustainability of these revegetated lands. Gypsum, 56 Mg/ha, was surface applied to these revegetated ecosystems to evaluate its effectiveness in ameliorating the spoil sodicity under a natural precipitation environment. The gypsum treatment significantly reduced the exchangeable Na and the exchangeable Na percentage of the 60-cm spoil profile 3 yr after treatment. The gypsum amendment also significantly increased the spoil-water storage in the 60-cm spoil profile. Gypsum treatment resulted in a significant increase in the spoil electrical conductivity; however, this increase did not detrimentally affect the vegetation. Surface-applied gypsum amendment effectively ameliorated the revegetated bentonite mine spoil sodicity under natural rainfall conditions in a semiarid environment.

TI SUSTAINABILITY OF POTABLE WATER SERVICES IN THE PHILIPPINES
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID SAMPLE SELECTION
AB Financial sustainability of rural water systems in the Philippines is evaluated based on a comparison of willingness to pay for improved water and the costs of service delivery. Willingness to pay estimates indicate that user fees are unlikely to be sufficient to cover the full cost of service and subsidies are necessary, at least for a major portion of capital costs, or the Water systems will become unsustainable because of insufficient resources. Sustainability is more probable when care is exercised in selecting villages for improved water services. Economies of scale lead to lower unit costs in larger villages. Willingness to pay is greater for household connections than for public faucets. Willingness to pay increases with income and wealth, family size, education, and dissatisfaction with traditional water sources.

TI SURVEY RESULTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL-ISSUES AND WEED SCIENCE RESEARCH
   PRIORITIES WITHIN THE CORN-BELT
SO WEED TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A survey determined the views of individuals in seven groups comprising the weed science community in the com belt (primarily in Illinois) for importance of 8 environmental and 14 crop production issues and 16 weed species in setting weed science research priorities for the next 3 to 5 yr. The survey also considered if funding of research to solve these environmental and production issues should be from the private or public sector. Velvetleaf, foxtail species, and common lambsquarters were considered the top three weed species by all respondents, and each of these weeds was among the five most important weeds within each of the seven survey groups. Improving ground and surface water quality were the foremost environmental issues for all respondents, but soybean growers listed herbicide carryover as their top environmental concern. Reducing herbicide residues in food and developing sustainable practices were given low preference by all groups. Sustainable growers rated reducing herbicide carryover and minimizing applicator exposure as their lowest priorities. Among all respondents, the top three production issues were improved weed control in conservation tillage, more economical weed control, and improved integrated control strategies. Studying the biology/life cycles of weeds was the third highest production priority of University and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) weed scientists, but was the last choice when averaged over the aggregate survey group. Developing strategies for resistant weeds and herbicide-resistant crops were chemical dealers top two priorities. Industry representatives gave the former subject their highest rating and the latter their lowest rating. Crop consultants seemed to want decision aids, as they chose assessing weed loss/thresholds and developing weed control/economic models among their top three production issues. Both com and soybean growers desired more economical weed control as a first choice, while sustainable growers wanted improved cultural control strategies. Com and soybean growers ranked developing new herbicides among their top three choices, but this issue was the lowest choice of the sustainable growers. University, USDA, and industrial weed scientists suggested that their own organizations conduct the research on their highest priorities issues.

AB The technology demanded by Latin American agriculture and the institutions involved in research and technology transfer are changing. New types of technology are needed to achieve a more sustainable and equitable pattern of development. Traditional research and extension institutions are poorly equipped to meet these challenges. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) can contribute in this regard, but they must improve their technical capacity and expand their coverage, without adversely affecting their positive characteristics, such as flexibility, social consciousness, and a concern for farmer participation. One partial solution is to promote coordination among NGOs and between NGOs and research institutions.

AB This paper examines recent policy changes in Myanmar (formerly Burma), analyzing the reasons for the decision to move from a state-led, socialist planning system to a more market-oriented system, and attempting to evaluate both the direction and sustainability of these economic reforms. On the basis of this survey of recent economic development, the paper seeks to evaluate the argument that economic reform is a hostage to political reform. The discussion of the relationship between economic change and political reform has suffered from drastic oversimplification, and rests on misleading assumptions about causal relationships between economic and political factors. The paper argues that a less superficial account must embrace an understanding of the historical roots of the Burmese political economy; the history and nature of the Burmese state; and the characteristics of Burmese military and political elites. We conclude that it is more illuminating to focus on the historical interaction of economic and political factors so as to construct a convincing ''political economy'' of Myanmar, than to argue for the current significance of political conditionality.

TI OF WARPS AND WOOFS - THE TAPESTRY OF MEDICAL-EDUCATION
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB The author likens some major aspects of academic medical centers to tightly and carefully woven tapestries. The metaphor is intended to highlight the complexity of medical centers and to help those who are working to promote meaningful and sustainable innovations in medical education. Underlying the presentation is the premise that there already exist several ''good ideas'' to improve medical education, and that deeper understanding of the barriers to change can promote adoption of these ideas and others. Three tapestries are presented. Each has a vertical ''warp'' representing one dimension of an academic medical center, and each has a horizontal ''woof'' representing an interrelated dimension. (In one tapestry, for example, departmental resources constitute the warp and the faculty functions of teaching, research, and service constitute the woof.) In each tapestry, the warp is presently the dominant feature. In each, strengthening or empowering the woof is seen as a step that would facilitate change. Because educational change is a difficult and inevitably slow process, those who work for change are counseled to be patient and have realistic expectations.

TI TRADE AND AGRICULTURAL-DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1980S AND THE CHALLENGES FOR
   THE 1990S - ASIA
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Asian developing countries have had varying experiences in trade and agricultural development in the 1980s, attributable in part to their differing stages of economic development and structural characteristics. Other important influences relate to the external economic environment and the policy choices made by their governments not only during the period but also in the preceding decade.
   The achievements of Asian developing countries under the adverse external conditions of the 1980s are discussed in terms of their macroeconomic and agricultural growth, the commodity structure of agricultural growth, their food production and trade, the expansion and diversification of their agricultural exports, and the policy and nonpolicy factors affecting them. Special attention is given to the role of policy reforms implemented in China and the South Asian countries, following similar policy developments in Northeast and Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, toward greater openness in their trade regime and increased private-sector participation in the economy. These reforms have contributed to the observed acceleration in GDP, agricultural, and export growth in the 1980s. However, macroeconomic imbalances have emerged that threaten the sustainability of economic liberalization in those countries.
   The major challenges for the 1990s also differ among the Asian developing countries- In the industrially advanced Northeast economies of Taiwan and South Korea, the primary need is to ease the transition of the remaining rural population as farm incomes continue to fall and workers move to industrial and service activities. This challenge has to be addressed in the context of growing external pressure to further open their domestic market for agricultural imports. Among the Southeast and South Asian countries, there is a need to reduce the existing policy biases against agriculture, particularly against export crop production. Moreover, China and the South Asian countries face the additional challenges of continuing to deregulate their trade regime and internal markets, and of promoting macroeconomic stability.
   Despite the external trend recently toward regionalism, Asian developing countries generally seem committed to an open trading system, on which in fact their past impressive economic performance has been predicated. An important challenge for them in the 1990s is to play an active role in arresting and reversing any protectionist tendencies arising from the formation of regional trading blocs and to support multilateral initiatives such as the Uruguay Round that promote global trade liberalization.

TI IRRIGATION REQUIREMENT OF TRANSPLANTED MONSOON RICE IN BANGLADESH
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The main rice crop of Bangladesh is grown in the monsoon season as a transplanted rainfed crop referred to as T. Aman. Yields are often low because of late-season water stress associated with rainfall variability and late planting. To realise the yield potential of modern varieties, water control, including supplemental irrigation, needs to be improved.  Using a daily water-balance simulation technique on a cropping system of rainfed pre-monsoon rice (Aus) followed by irrigated T. Aman, this study estimates for representative stations in 24 districts the probable planting dates and supplemental irrigation required to avoid significant water deficit during the reproductive phase of the T. Aman crop. The results are presented as isolines on a country map, and it is concluded that supplemental irrigation is required throughout the country for optimal performance. The probable irrigation requirement during the reproductive period increases from 0 mm in the Northeast to 225 mm in the Northwest, neglecting seepage and distribution losses. Some implications for a small-scale water harvesting irrigation method are discussed. Thus, neglecting distribution and application losses, a 2 m deep ditch of an area equal to 5% of the rice area is required to satisfy an intermediate, probable reproductive field irrigation requirement of 100 mm for infinitly large areas. The pond/land area ratio increases to 15% for smaller areas for a pyramidal-shaped pond because of side slope requirements for pond stability. Economic sustainability requires that the area ratio should be less than 9%, limiting the irrigation requirement to less than 180 mm and the pond depth to more than 1.1 m. In the Western part, the method is therefore likely to be uneconomical for shallow ponds on small areas of non-clay soil unless additional benefits are derived from the pond.

AB Objectives: To establish unlinked, anonymous sentinel surveillance for HIV-1 among pregnant women attending an antenatal clinic, to determine age-specific seroprevalences, to monitor trends and to compare seroprevalence with that detected by a population serosurvey. To establish the sustainability and costs of surveillance.
   Design: Sentinel surveillance for HIV through serial collection of unlinked, anonymous seroprevalence data from antenatal care; comparison of sentinel data with those from a population serosurvey; financial and general audit of the sentinel surveillance. Setting. A community antenatal clinic in a large urban centre, Mwanza Municipality, Tanzania, eastern Africa, between October 1988 and September 1991.
   Patients: Pregnant women attending for antenatal care.
   Main outcome measure: Age-specific HIV-1 seroprevalences, trends over time, difference from age-specific population seroprevalences, sustainability and costs.
   Results: Overall HIV-1 seroprevalence was 11.5% (95% confidence interval, 10.5-12.4); differences in age-specific prevalences were not significant. There was no clear evidence of change in seroprevalence over the study period in any age group, although there was some indication of a rise in some age groups in 1988-1989. Sentinel surveillance among pregnant women may have significantly underestimated population HIV-1 seroprevalence for women under the age of 35 years. HIV-1 surveillance proved feasible and sustainable. Additional recurrent costs were US$1.7 per specimen for unlinked anonymous testing and US$0.57 per woman for syphilis screening.
   Conclusions: HIV-1 seroprevalence did not change significantly over 3 years, probably implying a substantial incidence of HIV-1 infection. In this setting seroprevalence in pregnant women may have underestimated population seroprevalence in women aged under 35 years. With modest inputs and good organization unlinked anonymous HIV-1 sentinel surveillance of pregnant women can be introduced and sustained in an African setting. This may usefully be carried out in conjunction with syphilis screening.

AB The exploitation of whales has spread over the centuries from coastal to international waters, and from pole to pole. Despite the successive depletion of one species and stock after another, not until the 20th century were attempts instituted to regulate the industry and the catches at an international level.
   Agreements among the whaling companies competing in the Antarctic in the 1930s were closely followed by intergovernmental agreements, culminating in the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which established the International Whaling Commission. In 1975 the commission adopted its ''new management procedure'' for commercial whaling, based on the concept of maximum sustainable yield. A separate but related management procedure for subsistence whaling operations was subsequently developed, largely because of the problems of the Alaskan bowhead hunt. This gave greater weight to the perceived dependence of the native communities on the hunt than to the status of the whale stock.
   The tensions between the objectives of the conservation of the whale resources and the orderly development of the whaling industry continue today. Commercial whaling is for the moment prohibited while a comprehensive assessment of stock status and trends is undertaken, together with the development of a revised management procedure. The impact of recent legislative thinking in the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, coastal state sovereignty, and the developing trend towards the precautionary principle of management has caused profound changes in the interpretation and application of the 1946 convention and the consequent management policies by which it is implemented.

TI REGIONALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL WHALE MANAGEMENT - THE CASE OF THE
   NORTH-ATLANTIC-MARINE-MAMMALS-COMMISSION
SO ARCTIC
LA English
DT Article
DE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; WHALES; REGIONALIZATION; NAMMCO; IWC
AB This article reviews the evolution of the North Atlantic Marine Mammals Commission (NAMMCO) and considers its relations with the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and other international institutions concerned with marine resource management. Starting out in 1988 with a conference to address their common concerns, the four parties of the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Norway in 1990 set up a North Atlantic Committee for Coordination of Marine Mammals Research (NAC), thereby institutionalizing the information function crucial to management. The regulation function was attended to when NAMMCO was established with a scientific committee and a council in 1992. With a management committee and the scientific committee being operative in 1993, the regime appears to have been steadily evolving towards a prominent role in North Atlantic marine mammals management. The preservationist inclination of most IWC members is identified as a major driving force, but also important are the development of a multispecies perspective in fisheries science and the coastal states' fear of creeping jurisdiction on the part of an international organization. Problems of compatibility with the IWC are found to be minor at this stage, while NAMMCO rests firmly on the legal bases provided by the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention and the Agenda 21 adopted by UNCED in 1992. The real threats to marine mammals are impacts from pollution, seismic survey shooting, and nuclear test explosions, rather than harvest. A relevant future policy area for the IWC is therefore the task of informing its member governments of the effects of environmental degradation on whales, while the management issues could be shifted to appropriate regional organizations that can manage whales on a sustainable basis in relation to their role in the ecosystem.

   INTERNATIONAL-WHALING-COMMISSION
AB Policy debates in the International Whaling Commission (IWC) about aboriginal subsistence whaling focus on the changing significance of whaling in the mixed economies of contemporary Inuit communities. In Greenland, Inuit hunters have taken whales for over 4000 years as part of a multispecies pattern of marine harvesting. However. ecological dynamics, Euroamerican exploitation of the North Atlantic bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), Danish colonial policies, and growing linkages to the world economy have drastically altered whaling practices. Instead of using the umiaq and hand-thrown harpoons, Greenlandic hunters today use harpoon cannons mounted on fishing vessels and fiberglass skiffs with powerful outboard motors. Products from minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) provide both food for local consumption and limited amounts of cash, obtained through the sale of whale products for food to others. Greenlanders view this practice as a form of sustainable development, where local renewable resources are used to support livelihoods that would otherwise be dependent upon imported goods. Export of whale products from Greenland is prohibited by law. However, limited trade in whale products within the country is consistent with longstanding Inuit practices of distribution and exchange. Nevertheless, within the IWC critics argue that even limited commoditization of whale products could lead to overexploitation should hunters seek to pursue profit-maximization strategies. Debates continue about the appropriateness of cash and commoditization in subsistence whaling and about the ability of indigenous management regimes to ensure the protection of whale stocks. This case study describes contemporary whaling in Qeqertarsuaq Municipality in West Greenland, demonstrating that despite significant changes, whaling is an integral part of Greenland's mixed economy and a vital component of Greenlandic Inuit cultural identity. The social organization of whaling continues to be kinship-based, and Greenlandic foods, including whale products, are prominent in local diets and in cultural celebrations. The research reveals that Greenlanders participate in whaling not to maximize profits but in order to sustain cultural traditions and to reduce dependency on tenuous links to the world economy.

   CROP INTERACTIONS
AB The issue of insect conservation in pest management has many conflicting aspects. For instance, it is desirable to conserve a pest residue in order to maintain natural enemy population and it is imperative to conserve natural enemies. However, conservation of pest species is not relevant if the pest species is an exotic invader and a candidate for eradication, mainly because eradication, if successful, achieves only regional extinction. Conservation of native pests depends, to a large extent, on whether the species is a direct pest of a high value crop or an indirect pest with an acceptable economic injury level. In this paper, integrated pest management is defined in terms of sustainable agriculture and the conservation of biodiversity, and give five premises that stress the level of disturbance of agricultural communities and the dynamics of pest status for arthropod species in the community. The possible impacts of the main integrated pest management tactics on arthropod conservation are tabulated and the results reached stress that diversification of agricultural systems through maximum use of native plants should benefit both integrated pest management and regional arthropod conservation,

AB Manufacturing strategy is increasingly recognized by academics as essential to achieving sustainable competitive advantage.  It is important to distinguish clearly between internal competences and external measures of competitiveness; ensuring a proper link between the two is a critical factor for success.  This article suggests that: competences don't have to hurt each other; performance relative to the competition is what counts; each product has to meet some minimum requirements to have a chance of selling; and these requirements are continually becoming tougher.  The article sketches a scenario where even superior manufacturing may no longer be a source of competitive advantage, but simply a ticket to the ball game.

AB This paper describes a decision support system that forest managers can use to help evaluate short-term, site-specific silvicultural operating plans in terms of their potential impact on long-term, forest-level strategic objectives. The system is based upon strategic and tactical forest-level silvicultural planning models that are linked with each other and with a geographical information system. Managers can first use the strategic mathematical programming model to develop broad silvicultural strategies based on aggregate timber strata. These strategies help them to subjectively delineate specific candidate sites that might be treated during the first 10 years of a much longer planning horizon using a geographical information system and to describe potential silvicultural prescriptions for each candidate site. The tactical model identifies an annual silvicultural schedule for these candidate sites in the first 10 years, and a harvesting and regeneration schedule by 10-year periods for aggregate timber strata for the remainder of the planning horizon, that will maximize the sustainable yield of one or more timber species in the whole forest, given the candidate sites and treatments specified by the managers. The system is demonstrated on a 90 000 - ha area in northeastern Ontario.

AB Due to the enormous Increase of chemical production during the last decades mankind and environment are threaten by a large number of global or regional problems, e.g. groundwater pollution, destruction of the ozone layer and others. Within the framework of sustainable development, an ecologically based management of substances is necessary to reduce the risks proceeding from the use of an increasing quantity of chemical substances and increasing flows of products. This management will be fostered by a ''cradle-to-grave'' responsibility of producers and manufacturers for their products. The chemical industry should accept this challenge by offering integrated technical solutions instead of a mere production of chemicals. As to the legislative instruments for substance chain management instead should take place integreated measurements (prohibition of the use of dangerous substances, charges, forces ... ) of ''end of pipe'' regulations to enforce the recycling of products on the one hand and the closing of open chains for dangerous substances on the other hand.

TI RECOVERY AFTER DISASTER - ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, MITIGATION
   AND EQUITY
SO DISASTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper reviews key findings and raises issues that are not fully addressed by the predominant disaster recovery literature. Achievement of equity, mitigation and sustainable development, particularly through local participation in redevelopment planning and institutional cooperation, is the central issue of the review. Previous research and past assumptions about the process by which communities rebuild after a disaster are reviewed. A conceptual model for understanding local disaster recovery efforts is then presented. The conceptual and practical significance of this model is then demonstrated by presenting case studies of local recovery experiences. Finally, conclusions on the current understanding of disaster redevelopment planning, as well as implications for public policy and future research are offered.

TI AN ACACIA-BASED DESIGN FOR SUSTAINABLE LIVESTOCK CARRYING-CAPACITY ON
   IRRIGATED FARMLANDS IN SEMIARID AFRICA
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGHLANDS; ALBIDA
AB Multiple land-use designs are becoming increasingly necessary in semi-arid Africa as growing populations focus numerous production systems onto spatially limited arable lands. Engineering distinct land uses into a single area ideally requires that land-use components complement each other, and operate in predictable magnitudes. Quantitative evaluations of components to be included in multiple land-use designs are necessary to determine both how components would 'fit' together, and how these would serve populations participating in distinct production systems.
   With data gathered in Somalia, this study considers a design in which fodder-producing trees and irrigated agriculture could be integrated. Following a discussion of the benefits of such an integration, this analysis focuses on a quantitative examination of potential livestock carrying capacity from Acacia albida trees in an irrigated area. Comparisons are made with observed livestock numbers in order to determine if such a design could accommodate the seasonal influx of nomadic herds. The land-use elements that comprise carrying capacity are themselves examined to see which elements might be managed to offset or take advantage of those which are not easily managed.

TI THE SILVER JUBILEE OF MAB AND ITS REVIVAL
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The Biosphere Conference was organized by UNESCO and took place in September 1968, which was the first time that the word Biosphere became part of common, non-scientific language, and was the first intergovernmental conference on environmental problems. It sought to combine, effectively, conservation and the wise use of natural resources - thus advocating for the first time publicly the concept of 'sustainable development'.
   That pioneering Conference also gave birth to the intergovernmental programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB). After thorough preparations, this innovative and ambitious programme was progressively developed and the present paper describes briefly its evolution and main achievements, stressing both the merits and the pitfalls of an intergovernmental approach. It also recalls the times of uncertainty for MAB, due mainly to its very broad scope in a period of shrinking means and support, while stressing the value of this unique research venture as a preadapted response to the challenges of UNCED and Agenda 21.
   In its later part, the paper indicates the reasons why, on the occasion of its 25th birthday, MAB is likely to take a new departure, along the lines set out by its Coordinating Council in January 1993. It outlines the future areas of concentration, centred on an expanded and strengthened network of Biosphere Reserves, while focusing on the study and protection of biodiversity as well as on networks of comparative studies on sustainable land-use and encouraging all the time regional cooperative approaches.

AB Today's polarization of society 'for' or 'against' big hydroprojects relates to environmental costs, which are borne particularly by vulnerable ethnic minorities and the poor; such costs include species extinctions and tropical deforestation. This counter-productive polarization can be reconciled by transparency and mutuality of planning, by pluralism involving the local populace and especially all affected people, and by engendering national consensus on the best project that is available and practicable.
   Detailed criteria for consensus are discussed, and include promotion of energy efficiency and conservation, ranking of alternatives to the next hydroproject, and environmental ranking of potential sites. Environmentally well-designed hydroprojects can be preferable to alternatives (e.g. coal or nuclear), and most environmental costs can be prevented, thus making hydroprojects renewable and sustainable.

TI A STRATEGY FOR CONSERVING THE BIODIVERSITY OF THE UTTARA-KANNADA
   DISTRICT IN SOUTH-INDIA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Taking the various values ascribed to biodiversity as its point of departure rather many years ago, the present study aims at deriving a conservation strategy for Uttara Kannada. This hilly district, with the highest proportion of its area under forests in South India, is divided into five ecological zones:  coastal, northern evergreen, southern evergreen, moist deciduous, and dry deciduous. The heavily-populated coastal zone includes mangrove forests and estuarine wetlands. The evergreen forests are particularly rich in the diversity of plant species which they support - including wild relatives of a number of cultivated plants. They also serve a vital function in watershed conservation. The moist deciduous forests are rich in bird species; both moist and dry deciduous forests include a number of freshwater ponds and lakes that support a high diversity of aquatic birds.
   Reviewing the overall distribution of biodiversity, we identify specific localities - including estuaries, evergreen forests, and moist deciduous forests - which should be set aside as Nature reserves. These larger reserves must be complemented by a network of traditionally-protected sacred groves and sacred trees that are distributed throughout the district and that protect today, for instance, the finest surviving stand of dipterocarp trees.
   We also spell out the necessary policy-changes in overall development strategy that should stem the ongoing decimation of biodiversity. These include (1) revitalizing community-based systems of sustainable management of village forests and protection of sacred groves and trees; (2) reorienting the usage-pattern of reserve forests from production of a limited variety of timber and softwood species for industrial consumers, to production of a larger diversity of non-wood forest produce of commercial value to support the rural economy; (3) utilizing marginal lands under private ownership for generating industrial wood supplies; and (4) provision of incentives for in situ maintenance of land-races of cultivated plants - especially evergreen, fruit-yielding trees - by the local people.
   It is proposed that this broad framework be now taken to the local communities, and that an action-plan be developed on the basis of inputs provided - and initiatives taken - by them.

TI EFFECT OF SALINE IRRIGATION ON EARLY GROWTH OF EUCALYPTUS-GOMPHOCEPHALA
   AND ACACIA-SALIGNA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB An investigation is in progress in Formentera, Balearic Islands, to see whether satisfactory growth-rates can be achieved for trees of certain species - using small quantities of highly saline irrigation water, but relying on winter rainfall alone for leaching, and at the same time avoiding detrimental long-term environmental effects. Climate and soils in Formentera are similar to those of many semi-arid portions of the Mediterranean region. Two species, Eucalyptus gomphocephala and Acacia saligna, were tested with four irrigation treatments: no water, best available water (less than 1dS/m), and waters of 5 and 10 dS/m. At Site 1, sea-salt water was mixed with BAW to achieve the desired conductivities, and at Site 2, highly saline ground-water was used for mixing. Sodium absorption ratios (SARs) were 84.8 for 5dS/m mixes and 152.1 for 10dS/m mixes at Site 1, and 13.06 for 5dS/m and 23.2 for 10dS/m at Site 2.
   Trees were raised from seed in a local nursery, and were planted out in a grid pattern at 1.5 x 2 m spacings. Water requirement was calculated from a balance between pan-evaporation and tensiometer readings. Soil samples were taken at the beginning and end of each irrigation season. Trees were watered by hand-held hose-pipe for two seasons. Irrigation was then withdrawn from half of the sample trees. The remaining half were watered for two further seasons. Thus it was possible to compare the performances of trees receiving two years and four years of irrigation. In the first two years the three irrigated classes did significantly better than the trees which had received no water, but there was no significant difference between the classes due to salinity. At four years of age, the trees receiving continuing irrigation had grown more than those which received only two years of irrigation, although the latter continued to grow at a slower rate. However, where soils were extremely shallow (Site 2), withdrawal of irrigation affected survival rates, especially among the eucalypt.
   The Acacia survived better than the Eucalyptus, even on extremely shallow soils. At the end of the second season it was clear that the establishment and vigorous early growth of the trees had been successfully achieved. At the end of the fourth year, it was also clear that trees would continue to grow without continuing irrigation - with the proviso that, on extremely shallow soils (20 cm or less), the Acacia survived significantly better than the Eucalyptus.
   Analyses show that the winter rain appears to be effectively leaching the soil. Exchangeable sodium percentages (ESPs) rise during the irrigation season and fall during the winter. All ESPs have fallen off considerably when irrigation has been withdrawn. It appears that satisfactory growth can be achieved, and environmental protection established, with these small quantities of water at a purely temporary environmental cost (the short-lived increase in soil salinity). So far, the experiment demonstrates a low cost and effective technique for rapid tree establishment with low-quality water. Monitoring continues of soil nutrients, organic matter, litter, and soil fauna, to determine the sustainability of benefits.

AB The concept of 'sustainable development' as used by the Brundtland Commission was meant to separate environmental policy from distributional conflicts. Increases in income sometimes are beneficial for the environment (for instance, they allow the use of domestic cooking fuels which in some ways are less damaging to the environment), but higher incomes have meant higher emissions of greenhouse gases, and higher rates of genetic erosion. In the aftermath of the Rio conference of June 1992, this article analyses some unavoidable links between distributional conflicts and environmental policy.
   Often, environmental movements have tried to keep environmental resources and services outside the mark-et, but there are now attempts to establish property lights on, and to give money values to environmental resources and services, such as agricultural genetic resources and the CO2 absorption facility provided by the oceans and new vegetation. European 'green' proposals to impose an 'eco-tax', and proposals from India to create a world market for CO2 emission permits are considered. The issue raised by the growing Third World agroecology movement, of payment of 'farmers' rights' for in situ agricultural biodiversity is discussed. The article includes a short discussion of the North American free trade agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico and the USA, in so far as it involves so-called 'ecological dumping', i.e. trading at values which do not include environmental costs. In the last sections, the article asks how prices in ecologically-extended markets would be formed, bow much such prices will depend on distribution, and how much (or how little) such payments would change distribution of income. Environmental movements of the Poor are faced with the dilemma of keeping environmental resources and services out of the market, or else asking for property rights to be placed on them.

AB The aim of this paper is to point out the logic of the links between shelter, women and the environment in order to understand this important dimension of the crisis in human settlements, particularly in the provision of human shelters. It also discusses the relationship of this crisis to processes of development which are both unsustainable and detrimental to the well-being and socio-economic situation of people in general, and women and children in particular. This paper then attempts to evaluate the effect of development strategies that aim to alleviate the problem and examines some successful initiatives which have promoted both sustainable development and the involvement of women in sustainable human shelter activities. It finally argues that solutions to the problem of human shelter will be ineffective without consideration of women's needs, concerns and contributions in this important aspect of sustainable development.

AB Muscle activity patterns in some complex human jaw muscles appear to be task sensitive. However, it is presently uncertain how changes in motor task affect motor unit (MU) behaviour in the human temporalis muscle. In this study, activity was recorded from 40 MUs in the anterior region of the muscle. The lowest sustainable firing frequency (LSFF) was reached by slow increases and decreases in firing rate, then firing was maintained at the lowest possible rate without significant pauses. An array of consecutive interspike intervals (ISI) were sampled digitally and used to measure the LSFF for each task associated with the MU. In a controlled paradigm, MU reflex inhibition was measured during the performance of different tasks. Single electrical pulses of non-noxious intensity were delivered to the gingiva near the maxillary canine tooth. During continuous MU firing at a controlled firing frequency of 10 Hz, series of pulses were delivered with increasing delays, after preselected spikes. The MUs fired continuously during the performance of 1-4 postural and tooth-contact tasks. There were significant differences in LSFFs between tasks in those MUs associated with multiple tasks. In the reflex study, all MUs were inhibited, but the magnitude of the inhibition was highly task dependent. Thus, both LSFF and reflex inhibition of temporalis MUs appear to vary with the motor task and are sensitive to the position of the jaw and the direction and location of tooth contact along the tooth row. This behaviour most likely reflects task-related changes in output from orofacial and muscle afferents.
