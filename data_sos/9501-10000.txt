AB An expeditious hydrodechlorination of chlorobenzenes is observed over 0.5% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst by conducting the reaction under microwave irradiation conditions. Even though the loss of active metal surface area is substantial and identical in both microwave and conventional heating reactions, the higher rate and sustainability of the microwave reaction may be due to the selective and rapid absorption of microwaves by the polar chlorinated substrates that facilitates their relatively easy removal from the catalyst surface. It is also speculated that the rate of desorption of the products ( especially the poisonous HCl) is more critical in sustaining the catalyst activity. The experiments also reveal a significant reduction in power consumption under the microwave reaction than the reaction conducted using conventional heating.

AB A traditional approach used to evaluate clean-up technologies, in which only plant discharges are considered, is contrasted with a sustainability assessment. The sustainability of any technology can be assessed from three complementary points of view: economic, environmental and social. As such, this paper presents a comprehensive scheme that can be applied to any process, product or technology. In addition, the use of chemical engineering tools such as process design, process modelling and simulation represent a baseline for the sustainability assessment of technologies, as presented in a case study. The optimal granular activated carbon adsorption process design is used as a model system to demonstrate the advantages of sustainability approaches over traditional approaches. A mathematical model that describes the performance of the process at various design options was developed. This model includes cost equations that were used to estimate the total cost of each alternative under different plant designs and two waste scenarios ( a benzene and a 1,2-dichloroethane discharge). Life Cycle Assessment tools were applied to generate an inventory of emissions and the impact assessment measured as Photochemical Ozone Creation (POC) and Global Warming Potential (GWP). The model examined trade-offs between pollutants discharged into the atmosphere and pollution associated with the adoption and operation of the technology. One of the main results from the technology assessment is that the environmental impact, measured in terms of GWP proved to be higher for the technology operation than for the untreated waste streams themselves, and therefore suggested that the streams should not be treated. However, the social impact evaluation ( measured as risk assessment) conducted as part of this work proved that it was morally and legally mandatory to treat them due to the adverse effects on human health that they may represent. As such, a triple bottom line sustainability assessment was demonstrated to be one of the most important frameworks for decision making. The evaluation scheme presented in this work can also be applied to other areas such as the identification of the most sustainable process design and different green chemistry route alternatives.

AB We report on a consultation with a panel of senior technical managers within the European process industries. The outcome of the consultation is that, with known and foreseeable technology, the European industry could remain profitable, and reduce pollution by over 20% within 10 years. This paper reports the tools and technologies that are perceived to be important in achieving low pollution levels economically. Alongside established tools such as process simulation, the study gives priority to less established tools including Computer-Aided Molecular Design (CAMD) and process synthesis. The study places a high priority on a range of established and emerging technologies. These include highly selective catalysts, fuel cells, process intensification, supercritical separation and reaction, solar cells, bulk chemicals from renewables, novel chemicals, design for recycle and processes that are economic on smaller scales.

TI Environmental assessment of chemicals: methods and application to a case
   study of organic solvents
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPOSURE
AB Suitable environmental assessment tools are needed for the development of sustainable chemical products and processes. In this paper, three methods for the environmental assessment of chemicals with different focus, fields of application, and data requirements are presented. The first method aims to identify potential environmental, health and safety hazards in the early phases of chemical process design. The second approach is to calculate screening indicators for unwanted environmental exposure to chemicals in terms of persistence and spatial range. The third approach is to perform a full life-cycle assessment. The differences between the methods are discussed, first, on a theoretical basis and then within a case study of 13 solvents. The results of all three methods indicate that the use of chlorinated solvents should be avoided, while solvents such as methanol, isopropanol, toluene and xylene are less problematic. Moreover, there are results that are unique to each method: in addition to the chlorinated solvents, nitrobenzene has a potential for long-lasting and widespread exposure; concerning environmental, health and safety aspects, care should be taken with respect to formaldehyde, benzene, and acetic acid; according to the life-cycle assessment, energy use makes up for a large fraction of the impact for solvents such as aniline. In the case study, the three methods provide consistent results both in the overall environmental assessment of the chemicals and with regard to single aspects such as degradability or toxicity. Since not all aspects are considered in all methods, the methods also provide complementary results.

SO GREEN CHEMISTRY

ID FLY-ASH; WASTE; IMPACT
AB Accelerated carbonation has been used for the treatment of contaminated soils and hazardous wastes, giving reaction products that can cause rapid hardening and the production of granulated or monolithic materials. This technology provides a route to sustainable waste management and it generates a viable remedy to the problems of a decreasing number of landfill sites in the UK, global warming ( due to greenhouse gas emissions) and the depletion of natural aggregate resources, such as sand and gravel. The application of accelerated carbonation ( termed Accelerated Carbonation Technology or ACT) to sequester CO2 in fresh ashes from municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator/combined heat and power plants is presented. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the influence of fundamental parameters affecting the diffusivity and reactivity of CO2 ( i.e. particle size, the reaction time and the water content) on the extent and quality of carbonation. In addition, the major physical and chemical changes in air pollution control (APC) residues and bottom ashes (BA) after carbonation are evaluated, as are the optimum reaction conditions, and the physical and chemical changes induced by accelerated carbonation are presented and discussed.

TI Sustainable Chemistry in Dessau - a workshop report
SO GREEN CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB How can 150 experts from 14 countries be tempted into the small town of Dessau? The Federal Environmental Agency (UBA), in cooperation with the OECD, the Federal Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (BAuA) and the German Federal Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), invited delegates to Saxony-Anhalt to discuss an unwieldy but nevertheless widely discussed issue-Sustainable Chemistry. Under the title "Sustainable Chemistry-Integrated Management of Chemicals, Products and Processes", a workshop was held from 27-29th January 2004, which provided scientists and experts from university, industry, environmental NGOs and authorities with a forum to discuss and reflect steps to put sustainable chemistry in more concrete terms. As part of the global programme of the OECD on sustainable chemistry, this workshop should focus on specific elements of sustainable chemistry, criteria and indicators, methods for evaluation and instruments for implementation. The workshop was not held in Dessau by accident. Andreas Troge, President of the UBA, said "The workshop will make a contribution to an economy that is competitive, dynamic, and based on knowledge. It is important to sustain the efficiency of chemical production as well as to safeguard the natural means of livelihood for future generations. Dessau is not only the future location of the UBA, it is also situated near a region which is a symbol for the transformation from a dirty to a resource-saving chemical production". Ulrich Schlottmann from the hosting Ministry ( BMU) brought the title of the workshop into an international context. He recalled the World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, aimed at minimization of significant negative impacts of chemicals on human health and environment by 2020. Laurence Musset from the OECD Environment Directorate stated, "Sustainable chemistry will raise the overall level of environmental protection and job and consumer safety" and highlighted the role of OECD as an engine for international chemical safety.

ID WATER-RESOURCES
AB Safe-yield concepts historically focused attention on the economic and legal aspects of ground water development. Sustainability concerns have brought environmental aspects more to the forefront and have resulted in a more integrated outlook. Water resources sustainability is not a purely scientific concept, but rather a perspective that can frame scientific analysis. The evolving concept of sustainability presents a challenge to hydrologists to translate complex, and sometimes vague, socioeconomic and political questions into technical questions that can be quantified systematically. Hydrologists can contribute to sustainable water resources management by presenting the longer-term implications of ground water development as an integral part of their analyses.

TI Defective mucosal T cell death is sustainably reverted by infliximab in

AB Background and aims: To verify whether targeting defective mucosal T cell death underlies the sustained therapeutic benefit of infliximab in Crohn's disease, we explored its in vivo proapoptotic effect after 10 weeks of treatment, and its in vitro killing activity on lamina propria T cells ( LPT) and peripheral blood T cells ( PBT), both isolated from Crohn's disease patients.
   Methods: Endoscopic intestinal biopsies were collected from 10 Crohn's disease patients ( six steroid refractory and four fistulising) before and after three consecutive infusions of infliximab, administered at week 0, 2, and 6 in a single intravenous dose ( 5 mg/ kg), and from 10 subjects who proved to have functional diarrhoea. Apoptosis was determined in vivo by TUNEL assay, and in vitro by fluorescein isothiocyanate- annexin V/ propidium iodide staining on LPT and PBT from Crohn's disease patients cultured with infliximab. The effect of the broad caspase inhibitor Z- VAD- FMK and the neutralising anti-Fas antibody ZB4 was tested in vitro on LPT and PBT treated with infliximab. Caspase- 3 activity was determined by immunoblotting.
   Results: In Crohn's disease patients, infliximab treatment induced a sustained LPT apoptosis, still evident four weeks after the last infusion. In vitro infliximab induced death of LPT from Crohn's disease patients occurred via apoptosis rather than necrosis. LPT showed a higher susceptibility to infliximab induced apoptosis than PBT in Crohn's disease patients. The signalling pathway underlying the restoration of infliximab induced LPT apoptosis occurred via the caspase pathway but not Fas- Fas ligand interaction in Crohn's disease.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that apoptosis is the major mechanism by which infliximab exerts its killing activity on LPT in Crohn's disease. The sustained LPT proapoptotic action of infliximab, which extends far beyond its circulating half life, may be responsible for the sustained remission induced in Crohn's disease patients by infliximab retreatment.

   delivery in Bangladesh: implications for NGOs

AB The main goal of the health reform programme recently initiated in Bangladesh is to reduce costs and improve cost efficiency of the service delivery systems, and thereby ensure the sustainable provision of essential health and family planning services. With significant dependency on external funding, attainment of this objective is more critical for non-government organization (NGO) programmes. The paper analyzes costs of the NGO service delivery systems for maternal and child health and family planning, and identifies areas for increasing efficiency, especially through reducing labour costs and increasing service outputs.
   The operations research on cost analyses was conducted within the health and family planning programmes of a leading NGO, using the 'ingredients approach'. The findings demonstrated a significantly high proportion of personnel costs in field (outreach) service delivery systems, ranging between 70-85%. More than two-thirds of the working time of providers was spent on support activities, personal preoccupations and idle time. Simulations of various cost reduction options showed that considerable efficiency gains were possible through the combined effects of lowering personnel costs for field activities, increasing service outputs at the clinics, and ensuring more efficient use of providers' time. However, these factors, neither separately nor in combination, resulted in any substantive decrease for certain clinic services (e.g. antenatal care), implying the need to subsidize these services. The findings of the operations research indicated that cost analyses could be an effective decision-making tool for NGOs in developing cost-efficient service delivery strategies.

AB This paper outlines the practical steps involved in setting up and running multi-professional, in-depth case reviews of 'near miss' obstetrical complications. It draws on lessons learned in 12 referral hospitals in Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Morocco. A range of feasibility indicators are presented which measured the implementation and frequency of audit activities, the quality of participation, adherence to the planned protocol for the near-miss audits, the quality of audit discussions and the sustainability of the project. Although the principles of the audit approach were well accepted and implemented everywhere, near-miss audits appeared most successful in first referral level hospitals. Contextual factors that determine the successful implementation of near-miss audit include staff finding adequate time for audit activities, financial incentives to groups rather than individuals, involvement of senior staff and hospital managers, the ease of communication in smaller units, the employment of social workers for the incorporation of women's views at audits, and the strength of external support provided by the research team. The poor quality of information recorded in case notes was recognized everywhere as a deficiency, but did not present a major obstacle to effective case reviews. Ownership and leadership within the hospital, more easily achieved in the first-level referral hospitals, were probably the most important determinants of successful implementation. Sustainability requires a commitment to audit from policy makers and managers at higher levels of the health system and some devolution of resources for implementing recommendations.

TI Atom economy and yield of synthesis sequences
SO HELVETICA CHIMICA ACTA
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANIC-SYNTHESIS; CHEMISTRY; GREEN; METRICS; SEARCH
AB Atom economy (AE) or atom utilization was one of the first defining terms in the sustainable chemistry movement. In contrast to the often-cited twelve (qualitative) principles of green chemistry, AE represents a metric for quantification purposes. The theoretical efficiency of a reaction expressed by its stoichiometric equation can be determined by AE = Product [g/mol]/(Substrate 1+ Substrate 2 +...) [g/mol] and compared with synthetic alternatives. Of course, the atom economy will be of limited use, if starting materials differ much in complexity, i.e., in the degree of refinement. In these cases, their syntheses have to be taken in consideration, too. But, the further the retrospect goes and the more preceding synthesis steps ramify, the more complex the calculation gets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a stepwise approach that is enabled by a simple modification of the above formula (P = product; S = substrate; Syn. = synthesis): AE = P [g/mol]/((S1/AE(Syn. of S1)) + (S2/AE(Syn. of S2))+...) [g/mol]. To illustrate this equation, which is derived mathematically, the convergent multistep synthesis of the natural product trans-chrysanthemic acid is subjected to a stepwise method of calculation. The equation can be understood as a general expression for related ratios, i.e., there are corresponding modified equations for yield, selectivity, etc. In terms of the yield, it is no longer necessary to decide between the chains of the convergent synthesis, when possibly forced to ignore significant parts of the sequence. For demonstration purposes, the yield of the convergent synthesis of the natural product peridinin has been determined with a correspondingly modified equation.

AB Objectives Predictors of the efficacy of highly active antiretroviraltherapy (HAART) have been investigated in several studies. To increase current knowledge, the study aimed to acquire comprehensive data over an extended observation time, to obtain information on possible performance differences among individual drugs, and to identify factors with influence on the initial response to a HAART regimen and the sustainability of the response.
   Methods The data were obtained from a prospective, single University Medical School HIV cohort. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment parameters for 475 patients were collected over 4.5 years. HAART efficacy was determined by analysis of variance and multivariate survival analysis.
   Results The overall initial complete response (CR) (< 500 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL) was 76.3%. Use of indinavir [odds ratio (OR) = 2.747, P = 0.0009] and the number of new nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (OR = 1.862, P = 0.0017) were positively associated with CR, while initial peripheral blood HIV RNA concentration (OR = 0.383, P < 0.0001), use of saquinavir hard gel capsules (OR = 0.531, P = 0.0302), the number of successive HAART regimens (OR = 0.631, P < 0.0001), and the number of previously used NRTIs (OR = 0.728, P = 0.0081) were negatively associated with CR. Sustainability of CR was positively correlated with use of indinavir [hazard ratio of relapse (HR) = 0.255, P < 0.0001] and haemoglobin levels (HR = 0.873, P = 0.0124), but negatively correlated with initial HIV RNA concentration (HR = 1.273, P = 0.0003) and the number of previously used NRTIs (HR = 1.587, P < 0.0001). A higher number of consecutive HAART regimens was associated with a markedly reduced CR, but with only a slightly higher risk of relapse.
   Conclusions The initial response to HAART, as well as long-term efficacy, depends strongly on a few fundamental parameters that can easily be assessed in a clinical setting. There is a need for effective suppression of HIV replication over decades, and these factors should be considered early in treatment planning to identify patients with an unfavourable profile of risk factors for treatment failure.

AB Since the late 1980s, mutually reinforcing trends in economic growth, public policy, and community activism have fostered a wave of residential mortgage lending to 'underserved markets' in US cities. Yet many of the changes in housing finance that supported sustainable home ownership also lured a new generation of subprime and predatory credit institutions specialising in high-cost, high-risk lending. For many urban and minority neighbourhoods, the old problems of exclusionary redlining are now accompanied by new dilemmas of exploitive greenlining. This paper analyses the market penetration of subprime lending institutions and the subsequent concentration of mortgage 'pre-foreclosures' in low- and moderate-income, African American neighbourhoods. Focusing on Newark, NJ, and its surrounding suburbs, Gary King's ecological inference technique and a series of logistic regression models are used to assess the role of borrower characteristics, institutional divisions, and neighbourhood context in the process of mortgage market segmentation. The evidence corroborates theories emphasising the dynamics of capital investment, financial services restructuring, and the economic incentives for racial-geographic targeting, and not the presumed credit deficiencies of urban and minority home owners. Unfortunately, the tidy empirical analysis offered here is overshadowed by the enormous societal experiment now underway across the US, as a wave of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures undermines the belated minority home ownership gains achieved during the unprecedented boom of the 1990s.

ID CAPABILITIES; MANAGEMENT
AB Global sourcing strategy has been one of the most hotly debated management trends in the last 20 years. In its early years, global sourcing was examined mostly from "in-house" development and procurement perspectives; and in the last several years, research focus has shifted to "outsourcing" activities. Along with this shift from internal to external focus on global sourcing, many researchers and business practitioners have applied a core competency argument to justify increased levels of outsourcing activities on a global basis. Although the beneficial aspects of outsourcing are assumed in most cases, no consensus exists in reality as to the effect of outsourcing. Furthermore, the increased instability of the exchange rate environment in the last several years has also led to increased difficulties in managing globally scattered operations that were once fashionable in the 1980s-90s under the rubric of global strategy. In this article, the authors explore potential limitations and negative consequences of outsourcing strategy on a global scale. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article offers a political explanation for the diffusion and sustainability of team-based work systems by examining the differential outcomes of team structures for 1200 workers, supervisors, and middle managers in a large unionized telecommunications company. Regression analyses show that participation in self-managed teams is associated with significantly higher levels of perceived discretion, employment security, and satisfaction for workers and the opposite for supervisors. Middle managers who initiate team innovations report higher employment security but otherwise are not significantly different from their counterparts who are not involved in innovations. By contrast, there are no significant outcomes for employees associated with their participation in off-line problem-solving teams.

TI Blair's project in retrospect
SO INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
AB New Labour came into being as an attempt to frame a successor project to Thatcherism, but in practice it has proved to be a continuation of it. Blair's project was to achieve hegemony for Labour by blending free market policies with a concern for social cohesion. He accepted the new economic settlement that Thatcher had established, but believed it could be made more sustainable if it was tempered with a concern for social justice. Within the Labour Party his project was set in terms of modernizing social democracy, but in the country as a whole it was perceived as a variation on One Nation Toryism-a strand in the British political tradition which the Conservatives had seemingly forgotten. In fact, Blair's domestic agenda has had more in common with Thatcher's than with either social democracy or One Nation Toryism. There were significant constitutional reforms in the first term, but privatization and the injection of market mechanisms into hitherto autonomous institutions has remained the central thrust of policy.
   Blair has been committed to modernizing Britain, but his conception of modernization was a variation on Thatcher's, In one centrally important area, Blair diverges from Thatcher: he believes an essential component of Britain's modernization was an improved relationship with the EU, culminating in British entry into the euro. Yet his uncompromising support for the US over Iraq has left Britain as deeply alienated from France and Germany as it had ever been in Thatcher's time. Britain may still some day join the euro, but it will not be Tony Blair who takes us in.
   Blair's strategy was to attain hegemony for New Labour by appropriating the Thatcherite inheritance. In domestic terms, this strategy has been a success, but it relies on continuing Conservative weakness and an economic and international environment congenial to neo-liberal policies. At present both of these conditions appear to be changing to Blair's disadvantage. The Conservative Party seems to be shaping a post-Thatcherite agenda. At the same time, the US is leading a movement away from neo-liberal orthodoxies towards protectionism and deficit financing and faces an intractable guerrilla war in Iraq. In these circumstances, the neo-Thatcherite strategy that sustained Blair in power could prove to be his undoing.

AB Aim: To follow-up, one year later, a double-blind, randomised study, which investigated the effect of regular brushing with dentifrices on the oral health of an economically disadvantaged rural population in Andhra Pradesh, India who were primarily users of traditional materials. Subjects: 150 of the original study population. Method: Examination to determine whether the improvements in oral health status and oral health behaviour (use of toothbrush and dentifrice), being unsupported, had been sustained since completion of the original study. Results: Data analysis showed sustained, statistically significant improvements in gingival health as measured by gingival bleeding and plaque indices (GBI and PI) comparing users and non-users of toothbrushes and dentifrice in the original study (PI: p = 0.04; GBI: p = 0.03) and sustained use of toothbrushes and dentifrice by 60 % of the subjects at follow-up one year later. Conclusions: This study shows a beneficial effect on oral hygiene indices following the introduction of toothbrushes and dentifrices to a community using traditional oral hygiene materials and sustainability of use of these materials with motivation and support. It may therefore be concluded that it is feasible to achieve significant use of conventional toothbrushes and toothpastes, with consequent major and sustained improvements in plaque control and gingival health in a disadvantaged population hitherto often considered as not amenable to conventional oral hygiene for cultural or economic reasons.

ID GIS; DIFFUSION
AB The current procedures for land administration in Ghana are outdated, time-consuming and inefficient. The land sector agencies have not fully embraced the information and computer technologies that are now available for storing, manipulating and displaying information about land and properties. After introducing the policy context and problems relating to land administration, the focus of this paper is on the articulation of a strategic framework for the research and development tasks required to implement geographical information systems (GIS) in the Lands Commission Secretariat (LCS) in Accra, the agency with primary responsibility for the administration of public lands. We identify the key requirements for GIS adoption and report the findings of an applied research project undertaken to introduce GIS in the ICS. In addition, a series of wider recommendations for GIS sustainability in the broader context of the land sector in Ghana are presented.

TI Building developmental local government to fight poverty - Institutional
   change in the city of Johannesburg
SO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
AB The increasing significance of cities in the global system and the urbanisation of poverty underpin the call to reassess the role of local government in fostering redistributive justice. The paper shows how in post-colonial contexts the institutional frameworks of city government are poorly adopted to roll out effective programmes that will improve the lives of the urban poor. Using Johannesburg's process of institutional reform, known locally as iGoli 2002, the paper reflects on the city's efforts to mainstream a developmental agenda. An overview of poverty profiles in Johannesburg provides the platform for assessing the developmental challenges facing iGoli 2002's architects. Johannesburg's efforts to achieve financial sustainability, reconfigure the institutional arrangements of service delivery, establish a better organisational interface between political and administrative functions, rework the political lines of accountability and run on integrated participatory process ere identified as useful (if not wholly successful) measures necessary to address the fundamental problem of designing a developmental local state.

TI Iron contents of Malawian foods when prepared in iron cooking pots
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR VITAMIN AND NUTRITION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID BIOAVAILABILITY; UTENSILS; COOKWARE; ANEMIA
AB The aim of this study was to determine the iron content of Malawian foods prepared in iron pots and to examine the effects of continuous cooking time and added oil on the iron content of the food prepared. Foods prepared, which included a staple (Nsima), relish vegetables, and beans, had an increased iron content when prepared in an iron compared to a glass pot. For these three foods, iron content per gram increased by 3.15 mug, 35.8 mug, and 147.32 mug, respectively. Continuous use of the iron pot for cooking could have a positive effect on the amount of iron added to the food, as the three foods' iron content increased by a further 2.9 mug iron/g, 7.6 mug iron/g and 20.1 mug iron/g, respectively. This effect needs more study. Food pH was significantly negatively correlated with food iron content. The use of oil reduced the amount of iron added to stir-fried vegetables by 52.37 mug/g and increased iron added to Nsima (1.2 mug/g). Malawian foods increased their iron content when cooked in iron pots. This method of food preparation potentially provides a low-cost sustainable means of improving the iron intakes of families and communities where this traditional method of food preparation is acceptable.

AB The security of energy supply and sustainable and safe energy production are two main research topics of the Institute for Energy of the Joint Research Center. To lower the risks, for people and the environment, involved in fuel production and petroleum refining, studies and tests are carried out at the Institute on the degradation of low-alloy ferritic steel under petrorefinery service simulated conditions. In this frame, and for industrial purposes, a reliable assessment of damage level by means of non-destructive techniques is a key factor. This paper presents the results of magnetic measurements, in particular the Barkhausen method, on ferritic steels previously exposed to service simulated conditions, and in air. The results show a good potential for this magnetic method to detect changes due to the exposure of the steels to the different environments and, in particular, the degree of damage due to hydrogen attack. A correlation between the results of magnetic and hardness measurements is currently under investigation, but not yet presented in this outline.

AB This presentation attempts to illustrate the links between chemistry, the environment, multiphase reaction engineering, pollution prevention and sustainable development. The choice of process chemistry impacts not only the atom efficiency but also the degree of environmental damage caused by the manufacture of the choisen product. The execution of this chemistry requires multi-phase reaction engineering and, depending on the contacting scheme used, leads to different degrees of product yield, energy efficiency and formation of unwanted products. As a consequence, the number and type of separation units used and the recycling burden created is a function of the reactor choice and operating conditions. Clearly, understanding the principles of multiphase reaction engineering and their application are very important for proper execution of truly environmentally benign processes.
   Advances in understanding the phase contacting and mixing in reactors with moving and stagnant catalysts, and proper use of appropriate CFD codes are reviewed. Two powerful techniques for evaluation of holdup distribution (Computer Tomography - CT) and assessment of velocity profiles and mixing (Computer Aided Radioactive Particle Tracking - CARPT) are introduced. The data gathered is used for validation of CFD multiphase codes and for the establishment of appropriate engineering models for a variety of multiphase reactors such as risers, bubble columns, stirred tanks, etc.

TI A program to help in designing courses to integrate green engineering
   subjects
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The need to introduce green engineering concepts to undergraduate students has become recognized to be increasingly important by industry and the general populace. Green engineering can be considered as the way engineering should be done, in that it results in products and processes that have a reduced risk of harm to both the environment and to humans. The use of green engineering practices is a method to reach sustainable development. In many engineering disciplines, aspects of environmental engineering are only taught in an optional senior year course. By placing this subject at the end of their university preparation, this tends to leave an impression with students that environmental concepts are added on after the engineering work is completed Since one of the precepts of green engineering is that it should be conducted at all levels of engineering practice and design, we believe that it should be taught at all levels. Instead of having only an optional course in environmental or green engineering, we believe that it is more appropriate to integrate green engineering concepts in a range of courses within an engineering discipline. In 1998 the US Environmental Protection Agency initiated a program in green engineering to develop a text book on green engineering, to disseminate these materials and assist university faculties in using these materials through national and regional workshops. This program has developed teaching aides that include: presentation graphics, lecture notes, example problems, homework problems, case studies and experiments. These tools have been tailored to fit specific engineering classes, such as freshmen and sophomore engineering, mass and energy balances, separations, reaction engineering, process design. Using green engineering principles at the start of the design process can lead to processes and products of a sustainable future.

AB There is a national crisis in engineering and a compelling need to reconsider and rejuvenate engineering education. Shortcomings in engineering education have been identified by the National Academy of Engineering, the National Research Council and the National Science Foundation, among others, and are marked by an extremely narrow approach to education, inadequate preparation of engineers to function in multidisciplinary contexts, and practices that are exclusionary to women and under-represented minorities. These symptoms of a less than optimal education system underscore the pressing need for the realignment of engineering education. The Picker Engineering Program at Smith College is at the forefront of change in engineering education, as the first institution to establish an engineering program at a women's college, the first institution to establish a faculty position with a dual appointment in engineering and education and the first institution with an engineering faculty that is more than 5001, women. The Picker Engineering Program promotes engineering as a liberal art and as a profession in service to humanity. We believe that both these tenets are vital not only to the success of the program but also to the engineering profession and the comprehensive education of our youth. Smith College hopes to take this transformation of engineering education outside its walls and develop strategies and innovative pedagogy (K-16) to address the severe lack of quantitative literacy across society and to inspire a new generation of liberally educated engineers. Founded in 1999, the Picker Engineering Program has stepped to the forefront of engineering education-attracting national attention from the academic and professional circles, and support from a number of companies including Ford Motor Company, Bechtel, Hewlett-Packard, the GE Fund, and Boeing. The Picker Engineering Program supports research and activities that: develop an exciting, learner-centered engineering curriculum that engages and challenges students; develop an integrated curriculum that fosters a mastery of engineering fundamentals within the context of the liberal arts; encourage socially responsible and sustainability-centered thinking; develop socially and personally relevant curricula to attract and retain women and under-represented minorities; and encourage and develop the language of technology and quantitative literacy among non-engineering majors.

AB This study focused on establishing trends in the period 1988-2001 in PM2.5, PM10 and ozone concentrations in Santiago, Chile, and linking those to population exposure. There is strong seasonality in the concentration levels, driven by prevailing meteorological conditions, with the concentration of particulates peaking at the beginning of winter, whereas the ozone concentration is highest during the summer. The levels of PM2.5 and PM10 have substantially decreased since the late 1980s and so has the population exposure. Nevertheless, the majority of the population is still exposed to annual average levels that are above standard values. The situation with ozone exposure is different; no substantial decrease can be observed in the data. If anything certain parts of Santiago, notably the south-east, have shown increased levels of ozone. Overall population exposure indicates that the average person was more at risk of ozone in the year 2000 than they were in 1993.

AB The flexible mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, the clean development mechanism (CDM), should fulfil a twin objective: cost-effective greenhouse gas mitigation and enhancement of sustainable development in developing countries. As most host CDM countries have not established the proper institutional capacity to approve CDM projects and, at the same time, are prerogative to define sustainable development criteria for CDM projects, there is a clear need for a single set of guidelines or one evaluation system that accounts both climate and sustainable development considerations in the approval process of CDM projects. This paper proposes a set of sustainability criteria and indicators for CDM projects screening, reflecting the environmental, social, economic and technological dimension of sustainable development. Sufficient attention has been paid to determine globally relevant criteria and indicators. Priority has been given to energy sector CDM projects.

AB The study reported in this paper was undertaken during 2001 and early 2002 to assess the status of environmental education and awareness of undergraduate Students at Ankara University, Turkey. The main objectives of the Study were to determine the depth of students' knowledge and awareness of environmental issues and problems and their attitude to the environment, and to make recommendations based on the findings.
   It is generally assumed that in Turkey, university students mainly come from a particular socio-economic sector of society. And, therefore, that there is a certain homogeneity of environmental awareness and attitudes among most Students at all Turkish universities. To test the veracity or otherwise of this widely held assumption, data on Students' socio-economic backgrounds were also analysed.
   The study comprised face-to-face interviews of a random sample of 651 Students in the final year of their educational programmes during which a detailed questionnaire was completed for each. The chi-squared test was used to evaluate collected data. The respondents cattle from 14 faculties of the university. The Study was designed to assess the general characteristics, environmental knowledge, and behavioural pattern of the sample.
   Results of the study validate the above assumption and reveal, among others, that: (a) in general, Ankara University Students are reasonably aware of environmental issues and problems; (b) majority of those Studying environmental subjects are from the social sciences; and (c) compared to the rest, students in the health sciences are significantly unaware Of issues such as those of sustainable development, organic farming and solid waste pollution.

AB Sustainability continues to be a serious concern for Primary Health Care (PHC) interventions targeting the death of millions of children in developing countries each year. Our work with over 30 Non-Govemmental Organizations (NGOs) implementing USAID's Child Survival and Health Grants Program (CSHGP)-funded projects revealed the need for a study to develop a framework for sustainability assessment in these projects. We surveyed NGO informants and project managers through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. This paper summarizes our study findings.
   The NGOs share key values about sustainability, but are skeptical about approaches perceived as disconnected from field reality. In their experience, sustainable achievements occur through the interaction of capable local stakeholders and communities. This depends strongly on enabling conditions, which NGO projects should advance. Sustainability assessment is multidimensional, value-based and embeds health within a larger sustainable development perspective. It reduces, but does not eliminate, the unpredictability of long-term outcomes. It should start with the consideration of the 'local systems' which need to develop a common purpose.
   Our ability to address the complexity inherent to sustainability thinking rests with the validity of the models used to design interventions. A participant, qualitative research approach helped us make sense of sustainability in NGO field practice. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB An estimated 10.8 million children under 5 continue to die each year in developing countries from causes easily treatable or preventable. Non governmental organizations (NGOs) are frontline implementers of low-cost and effective child health interventions, but their progress toward sustainable child health gains is a challenge to evaluate. This paper presents the Child Survival Sustainability Assessment (CSSA) methodology-a framework and process-to map progress towards sustainable child health from the community level and upward. The CSSA was developed with NGOs through a participatory process of research and dialogue.
   Commitment to sustainability requires a systematic and systemic consideration of human, social and organizational processes beyond a purely biomedical perspective. The CSSA is organized around three interrelated dimensions of evaluation: (1) health and health services; (2) capacity and viability of local organizations; (3) capacity of the community in its social ecological context. The CSSA uses a participatory, action-planning process, engaging a 'local system' of stakeholders in the contextual definition of objectives and indicators. Improved conditions measured in the three dimensions correspond to progress toward a sustainable health situation for the population. This framework opens new opportunities for evaluation and research design and places sustainability at the center of primary health care programming. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

ID TUBERCULOSIS; 1990S
AB Most of the WHO's vertical programs, because they were ill-conceived, ill-designed, and defectively implemented, have fallen far short of expectations. These limitations have been doggedly ignored by the WHO, although the authorities in India have now realized that such vertical programs are expensive and not sustainable. Launching of Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) appears to mark a desperate effort to revive their performance. It represents yet another deviation from the mandate given to the WHO. In 1983, the then director general warned against motivational manipulation of people to sell health ideas, but the WHO has now brazenly come forward to look for help from the private sector. COMBI uses the jargon and language of the market place to "market" health programs; it calls this "cause-related marketing." The WHO has been most ahistorical in conceptualizing COMBI, as it has not teamed from the failure of UNICEF's earlier venture to market child survival by employing experts in social marketing to bring about "community mobilization." The WHO should have reviewed the large body of literature on work in the health social sciences, health education, and the many programs based on the concept of "information, education, and communication." The pointed neglect of such key issues raises serious moral, ethical, and human rights questions. The COMBI approach amounts to be a breach of trust-a threat to human dignity.

AB Current concerns over escalating health care costs and the sustainability of the Canadian health care system are based on analytical concepts and models that have their own limitations and deficiencies. Measuring health care costs across subsectors over the long-term period, the authors argue that Canada's health care costs, especially those under the direct control of provincial governments, are relatively stable. Using appropriate measures of sustainability, there is no indication that Canada's public health care expenditure is unsustainable. Nor is there any indication that Canada's public health care expenditures are out of line with those of its main trading competitors, including the United States.

AB Insulation of buildings in order to save heating energy is an important technology for enabling sustainable development. This paper summarises the results of a comparative LCA study according to ISO 14040 standard series of HT stone wool, flax representing crop grown products and paper wool representing recycled products applied for roof insulation. As the three materials have vastly different lifecycles, yet fulfil the same function cycles, the methodology used should be of general interest. Part 1 consists of the project background, goal and scope definition, a detailed life cycle inventory analysis with sensitivity analysis, impact assessment and interpretation. The actual comparison of the results from the life cycle assessments of the three products, in which an attempt is made to answer the question of whether the biological products flax and paper wool are more environmentally preferable than the mineral product stone wool representing more traditional insulation materials, is discussed in Part 2.

AB Background, Goal and Scope. The research presented here represents one part of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) efforts to identify and improve the life cycle impact profile of pharmaceutical products. The main goal of this work was to identify and analyze the cradle-to-gate environmental impacts in the synthesis of a typical Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API). A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment of a commercial pharmaceutical product is presented as a case study.
   Methods. Life cycle inventory data were obtained using a modular gate-to-gate methodology developed in partnership with North Carolina State University (NCSU) while the impact assessment was performed utilizing GSK's sustainability metrics methodology.
   Results and Discussion. Major contributors to the environmental footprint of a typical pharmaceutical product were identified. The results of this study indicate that solvent use accounts for a majority of the potential cradle-to-gate impacts associated with the manufacture of the commercial pharmaceutical product under study. If spent solvent is incinerated instead of recovered the life-cycle profile and impacts are considerably increased.
   Conclusions. This case study provided GSK with key insights into the life-cycle impacts of pharmaceutical products. It also helped to establish a well-documented approach to using life cycle within GSK and fostered the development of a practical methodology that is applicable to strategic decision making, internal business processes and other processes and tools.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE design for disassembly; ecodesign; electrical appliances; product life;
   recycling; waste input-output analysis
AB Goal, Scope and Background. In 2001, a new law on the recycling of end-of-life electric home appliances (EL-EHA) was put into effect in Japan; it was the first legislation of its sort in the world, and deserves to be called the 'Japan model.' This article is concerned with the LCA of alternative life-cycle strategies for EL-EHA, which consist of recycling as prescribed by the law, 'ecodesign' strategies such as the implementation of design for disassembly (DfD) and the extension of product life (EPL), with and without ex-post functional upgradability, and the once-dominant treatment methods such as landfilling and simple shredding.
   Methods. We use the waste input-output (WIO) analysis, a new method of hybrid LCA that was developed by the authors [I]. The WIO extends the conventional input-output analysis to explicitly take into account the interdependence between the flow of goods and the flow of waste in the whole economy, and. hence provides an optimal platform for LCA involving waste treatment and recycling. Furthermore, the WIO enables us to evaluate not only environmental impacts, but also economic: impacts such as sectoral output and employment. Our analysis is based on the WIO table for 1995 and detailed process data. on recycling.
   Results and Discussion. Recycling was found to outperform the 'traditional' treatment method strategy with regard to the reduction of CO2 emission, landfill consumption, and the demand for abiotic resources. Thanks to efficient utilization of the existing retail network system, it was also found to be more efficient economically. Additional implementation of DfD and the associated increase in the quality of recovered materials (plastics) were found to augment the positive environmental impacts of recycling. The EPL without upgrading resulted in a significant reduction in the environmental impacts, but also in the level of employment. On the other hand, the EPL with upgrading was found to outperform the recycling strategy in terms of environmental impacts without having significant negative economic impacts.
   Conclusion and Recommendation. Recycling of EL-EHA, as prescribed by the Japanese law on the recycling of EL-EHA, was found to be effective in reducing CO, emission, depletion of abiotic resources, generation of waste, and landfill consumption, provided the rate of retrieval remains at a high level. Our results also indicate the possible effectiveness of ecodesign strategy toward the realization of a sustainable economy.

ID EMISSIONS
AB Goal, Scope and Background. Agricultural production includes not only crop production, but also food processing, transport, distribution, preparation, and disposal. The effects of all these must be considered and controlled if the food chain is to be made sustainable. The goal of this case study was to identify and review the significant areas of potential environmental impacts across the whole life cycle of cane sugar on the island of Mauritius.
   Methods. The functional unit was one tonne of exported raw sugar from the island. The life cycle investigated includes the stage of cane cultivation and harvest, cane burning, transport, fertilizer and herbicide manufacture, cane sugar manufacture and electricity generation from bagasse. Data was gathered from companies, factories, sugar statistics, databases and literature. Energy depletion, climate change, acidification, oxidant formation, nutrification, aquatic ecotoxicity and human toxicity were assessed.
   Results and Discussion. The inventory of the current sugar production system revealed that the production of one tonne of sugar requires, on average, a land area of 0.12 ha, the application of 0.84 kg of herbicides and 16.5 kg of N-fertilizer, use of 553 tons of water and 170 tonne-km of transport services. The total energy consumption is about 14235 MJ per tonne of sugar, of which fossil fuel consumption accounts for 1995 MJ and the rest is from renewable bagasse. 160 kg of CO2 per tonne of sugar is released from fossil fuel energy use and the net avoided emissions of CO2 on the island due to the use of bagasse as an energy source is 932,000 tonnes. 1.7 kg TSP, 1.21 kg SO2,1.26 kg NO, and 1.26 kg CO are emitted to the air per tonne of sugar produced. 1.7 kg N, 0.002 kg herbicide, 19.1 kg COD, 13.1 kg TSS and 0.37 kg PO43- are emitted to water per tonne of sugar produced. Cane cultivation and harvest accounts for the largest environmental impact (44%) followed by fertilizer and herbicide manufacture (22%), sugar processing and electricity generation (20%), transportation (13%) and cane burning (1%). Nutrification is the main impact followed by acidification and energy depletion.
   Conclusions. There are a number of options for improvement of the environmental performance of the cane-sugar production chain. Cane cultivation, and fertilizer and herbicide manufacture, were hotspots for most of the impact categories investigated. Better irrigation systems, precision farming, optimal use of herbicides, centralisation of sugar factories, implementation of co-generation projects and pollution control during manufacturing and bagasse burning are measures that would considerably decrease resource use and environmental impacts.
   Recommendation and Outlook. LCA was shown to be a valuable tool to assess the environmental impacts throughout the food production chain and to evaluate government policies on agricultural production systems.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. Waste associated with the manufacture, use, and disposal of electronic products, or e-waste, is a growing threat to the environment. IT procurement professionals can have a positive affect against that threat through careful consideration of the environmental awareness of their vendors.
   Method. Consideration of three case studies from the City of Seattle illustrates the challenges in gathering information from vendors on their environmentally sustainable practices; the reasons that this information is important; and possible solutions.
   Conclusions and Recommendations. We owe it to ourselves, our planet and our progeny to encourage sustainable practices in electronics manufacturing, use and recycling. This paper suggests some beginning steps that purchasers of electronics can take toward that end.

DE ecolabel; environmental declarations; environmental labels
AB The goal of the different national and supranational ecolabelling programs is to encourage consumers to choose products which are the least damaging to the environment. It is clear that the involvement of product and service users is essential to the establishment of sustainable consumption patterns. For this reason, ecolabelling must necessarily limit any risks of uncertainty. To this end, labels must take into account all the impacts of a product's life cycle and use a reliable and verifiable evaluation method.
   In general, the organizations in charge of ecolabelling programs claim that a multi-criteria approach is used to define the exact labelling criteria appropriate for the product categories in question. These organizations generally maintain that their approach is based on the completion of exhaustive and complete life cycle analyses, which take into account all of the impacts caused by a product throughout its life cycle. And yet, the real situation is often far less clear-cut, and these simplified approaches, which tend to reconcile economic realism and methodological coherence, constitute the usual procedure for criteria definition.
   Thus, the procedures involved in criteria development often rely on a 'semi-qualitative' approach to the life cycle which uses both qualitative and quantitative data in order to identify the product's significant stages on the environment.
   Presently, the ecolabel is a 'non-verifiable expert property' for the consumer. The ecolabel's lack of objectivity in its criteria and its lack of transparency, resulting from non standardized methods whose accuracy cannot be measured, can only damage this sustainable development tool's credibility. In effect, the primary hindrance to ecolabel development lies precisely within this difficulty of finding a compromise between economic feasibility and the scientific and methodological rigor which are indispensable to the label's credibility and veracity.

DE appropriateness; data integration; inventory; network
AB Reliability of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) results depends on the availability and quality of Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data. In order to provide high-quality LCI data for background systems in LCA and to make it applicable to a wider range of fields, harmonization strategies for already existing datasets and databases are required. In view of the high significance of LCI data as a basis of major fields of action within a sustainability strategy, the German Helmholtz Association (HGF), under the leadership of the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) has taken up this issue in its research programme. In 2002, the FZK conducted a preliminary study on 'Quality Assurance and User-oriented Supply of a Life Cycle Inventory Data' funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Within the framework of this study, a long-term concept for improving the scientific fundamentals and practical use of LCI data was developed in association with external experts. The focus is on establishing a permanent German 'Network on Life Cycle Inventory Data' which will serve as the German information and cooperation platform for all scientific and non-scientific actors in the field of life cycle analysis. This network will integrate expertise on LCA in Germany, harmonise methodology and data, and use the comprehensive expert panel as an efficient basis for further scientific development and practical use of LCA. At the same time, this network will serve as a platform for cooperation on an international level. Current developments address methodological definitions for the initial information infrastructure. As a novel element, user needs are differentiated in parallel according to the broad application fields of LCI-data from product declaration to process design. Case studies will be used to define tailored interfaces for the database, since different data quality levels will be encountered.

AB Goal, Scope and Background. Green Productivity (GP) is a new paradigm in sustainable manufacturing where resource conservation and waste minimization constitute the strategy in simultaneously enhancing environmental performance and productivity. This productivity approach to the sustainability of industries requires the adoption of clean production technology and the development of appropriate indicators and instruments to measure environmental performance in a continuous improvement strategy that focuses on the manufacturing stage of the product life cycle. The analysis may be expanded to include the entire life cycle with increasing details on impacts, improvement strategies and indicators.
   Methods. The study proposes a methodology for GP assessment that integrates the essential components of life cycle assessment (LCA) and multicriteria decision analysis specifically the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). LCA provides a systematic and holistic perspective for GP analysis that spans inventory, impact and improvement assessment. The AHP is utilized as a decision framework and valuation tool for impact and improvement assessment to come up with priority weights. Indicators are derived and measured from a streamlined LCA focused on a number of parameters within the gate-to-gate analysis to demonstrate the GP concept in relation to resource utilization and waste minimization. An input-output approach using a suitable material balance in a scenario analysis provides the basis of GP performance measurement.
   Results and Conclusion. The diagnostic model is applied on a semiconductor assembly/packaging operation. From the streamlined life cycle inventory, impact factors were derived for water resource depletion (WRD), energy resource depletion (ERD), human toxicity-air (HTA), human toxicity-land (HTL), human toxicity-water (HTW), aquatic ecotoxicity (ETA) and terrestrial ecotoxicity (ETT). Valuation of impact factors using the AHP showed the high significance of ETT, HTL, WRD and ERD. This especially reflects the impact of the industry on the solid waste problem as a result of emissions to land associated with human toxicity and ecotoxicity effects and the intensive use of water and energy resources. Using scenario analysis, the effect of implementing a process-based improvement technique on a product-specific operation was determined and the highest values in GP are for energy utilization, water utilization and terrestrial ecotoxicity.
   Recommendation and Perspective. Expert system technology was explored in developing a diagnostic prototype that emulates how human experts diagnose green productivity of manufacturing processes. The aim was to investigate how such a diagnosis could be performed in an intelligent fashion that it is also easily accessible as a decision support for industries. The expert system model will provide flexibility in testing the relationships of environmental performance and productivity parameters as well as in preserving and disseminating valuable human expertise in GP program implementation. This is a continuing research effort that is building the knowledge base for GP assessment. It will include case studies over a wider range or level of detail regarding the impacts and improvement techniques and the other stages of the product life cycle.

   eco-load total standardization; Thailand
AB Goal, Scope and Background. The Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) system has been installed at the biggest lignite-fired power generation plant in Thailand to reduce the large amount of SO, emission. In order to understand the costs and benefits, both in ecological and economic terms, the lignite-fired plant was studied both before and after the installation of the FGD system. The focus of this study is to consider not only the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) outcome but also the Life Cycle Costing (LCC) factors. The results can provide valuable information when selecting appropriate technologies to minimize the negative impact that lignite-fired power plants have on the environment.
   Methods. The Life Cycle Assessment - Numerical Eco-load Total Standardization (LCA-NETS) system was used to evaluate the impact on the environment of both the lignite-fired plant and the FGD system. Life Cycle Costing (LCC) was used to provide a comparison between alternative before and after installation of FGD. LCC, a powerful analytical tool, examines the total cost, in net present value terms, of a FGD system over its entire service lifetime.
   Results and Discussion. The results of the study are shown in the eco-load values over the entire life cycle of the lignite-fired plant. Comparative models of the power plant, before and after the installation of the FGD system, are evaluated using the LCA-NETS system. The results indicate that the installation of the FGD system can reduce the acidification problem associated with lignite-fired plants by approximately 97%. The LCC estimation shows the major costs of the FGD system: capital investment, operating and maintenance, and miscellaneous costs. The LCC provides the decision-making information when considering the cost of the FGD system in terms of protecting the environment.
   Conclusion and Outlook. LCA is an important decision-making tool for environmental policies, especially with regard to the selection of pollution control equipment for lignite-fired plants. Green coal technologies and strategies to reduce the negative impact on the environment are essential to produce more environmentally-friendly power plants with a sustainable future.

ID FOREST-FIRE MODEL; EPIDEMIC; FOOT
AB Using cellular automata model, we simulate the British Government Policy (BGP) in the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in Great Britain. When clinical symptoms of the disease appeared in a farm, there is mandatory slaughter (culling) of all livestock in an infected premise (IP). Those farms in the neighboring of an IP (contiguous premise, CP), are also culled, aka nearest neighbor interaction. Farms where the disease may be prevalent from animal, human, vehicle or airborne transmission (dangerous contact, DC), are additionally culled, aka next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and lightning factor. The resulting mathematical model possesses a phase transition, whereupon if the physical disease transmission kernel exceeds a critical value, catastrophic loss of animals ensues. The nonlocal disease transport probability can be as low as 0.01% per day and the disease can still be in the high mortality phase. We show that the fundamental equation for sustainable disease transport is the criticality equation for neutron fission cascade. Finally, we calculate that the percentage of culled animals that are actually healthy is approximate to30%.

AB Volvo's car assembly plant in Ghent, Belgium, is currently experiencing turbulent times. The plant is implementing the biggest expansion in its history, with plans to almost double its production capacity in 2004. Moreover, Ford is increasingly consolidating its position as the new owner of Volvo. Both developments are challenging the distinctive model of teamwork that Volvo-Ghent has established over the last decade. This paper assesses the challenges presented by these two developments and the possible outcomes in terms of teamwork at Volvo-Ghent. This assessment relies on a combination of theories of team structure and team processes.

AB Innovation and problem solving processes take place more and more beyond the boundaries of the enterprise. Therefore, new methods and tools are necessary to foster multiple stakeholder relationships and manage distributed knowledge creation. This paper addresses some of the key considerations for collaboration and innovation, compares different possible approaches to support them and derives an integral internet-based platform on which a method and different communication tools are combined to a distributed cognitive system. Sustainable solutions require procedures that combine the effectiveness of a team with the creative power and the expertise of a community. BrainSpace fills this gap, and allows innovation to proceed in a complex environment by striking a balance between order and creative chaos.

AB Technology is a key driver for innovation and sustainable business growth. Whilst industrial interest in the area is growing, from an academic perspective the conceptual basis of the subject of technology management is fragmented and poorly defined. This paper describes a framework that has been developed to support practical and theoretical understanding of the management of technological innovation. At the heart of the framework are two sets of business processes that are important for effective technology management, including the three 'core' processes of strategy, innovation and operations, together with a set of five supporting technology management processes: identification, selection, acquisition, exploitation and protection. The framework supports the integration of these processes by focusing on the 'pull' and 'push' knowledge flows that need to occur between the commercial and technological functions within the firm.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB International partnerships have become increasingly necessary to achieve scientific breakthroughs. They have been used in the human genome project, space exploration, the development of fusion energy as a source of power, and most recently to identify the SARS virus. In these projects, partners contribute funds, equipment and staff in the pursuit of a common goal. But in recent years the sustainability of funding for some of these projects has become an issue of concern. Two examples include the termination of the Super Conducting Super Collider in 1993 and the withdrawal of the USA from the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in 1998. Both suggest the need for better management of the funding process. This paper explores the management of this funding process, supported by a case study, and concludes with several lessons that should prove useful to those who manage these projects.

ID SUSTAINED COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; FIRM; VIEW
AB This paper draws upon four perspectives (resource-based view of the firm, knowledge management view of the firm, organisational learning and human resources management) to develop a framework for analysing the building of a firm's sustained competitive advantage. Research on the resource-based view of the firm has explored the features of firm's strategic resources. It suggests that resources that are rare, valuable, scarce, non imitable and non substitutable provide a source of sustainable competitive advantage. According to the knowledge-based view of the firm, organisational knowledge is an intangible resource that meets the above stated conditions. However these views of the firm have not explained how these strategic resources are created. Thus, in order to develop a holistic model that pushes forward this issue, serious attention must be focused now on the literature on human resource management and organisational learning.

AB Petroleum fuels, which are not sustainable and which contribute substantially to greenhouse gas emissions, power nearly all light-duty vehicles. We review the North American literature on alternative fuels such as natural gas, ethanol from corn and biomass, and hydrogen and electricity from renewable resources, as well as propulsion systems including internal combustion engines, electric motors, and fuel cells. Vehicle characteristics including emissions, safety and consumer attributes such as range and power are examined. Results for greenhouse gas emissions and energy use for the well-to-wheel (fuel production and vehicle operation) aspects of the life cycles of the fuel/vehicle combinations are evaluated. While fuel cells and batteries might some day be attractive, in the near term they cannot replace the internal combustion engine. We focus on ethanol and explore its potential to replace nearly all gasoline used in the United States and Canada. We conclude that ethanol produced from biomass is an attractive near/midterm fuel among those that are sustainable.

AB With support from the US National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, a global benchmarking study of the status of Environmentally Benign Manufacturing (EBM) has recently been completed. The study [1], completed under the aegis of the World Technology Evaluation Center at Loyola College in Maryland, gathered information on research and development around the world aimed at developing alternative methods for materials processing with the purpose of minimizing toxic material generation and optimizing products and by-products for sustainability and reuse characteristics. The study reviewed the current status of EBM research, development, and applications in the United States, Japan, and Europe with a view towards evaluating the competitive status of US efforts. Information was acquired from the technical literature as well as through visits to industry, national laboratories, universities, etc. One area of focus within the study was the automotive industry. This paper summarizes many of the key findings from the global benchmarking study that relate to the automotive industry and identifies areas that require attention for the future.

AB This paper examines what can be known about transport technology and travel volumes out to the year 2050, mainly in the industrialised countries. Analysis of the past 50 years in transport shows that adoption of radically new technology has been comparatively slow. Travel volumes and vehicle fleets have risen roughly in step with national income. The next half-century, however, will likely see major changes in transport technology and fuels, in response to perceived constraints like oil depletion and global warming. The inevitable uncertainty in long-term forecasting will be exacerbated by these constraints. A break in the travel/ income relationship, as has already happened with the energy/income relationship, is also probable. Responding to an uncertain future will prove difficult if change is left largely to market forces. Instead, a larger role for government can both reduce uncertainty and provide us with a more sustainable transport system.

AB Six understory species from five pine flatwood sites and six understory species from five hardwood hammock sites were harvested for biomass analyses to compare potential flammability between two ecosystems in the south-eastern coastal plain of the United States. Plant components were separated into live and dead foliage, accumulated litter on and under the plant, and small and large stems. Foliar biomass was further analysed for moisture content, volatile solid content, and energy content. Statistical analyses revealed differences among species and between ecosystems. Serenoa repens plants present a wildfire hazard because they contain greater biomass than other species studied. Ilex glabra and Lyonia ferruginea are also hazardous to wildland-urban interface (WUI) structures because they have greater foliar energy content than other species studied. Callicarpa americana plants present the least wildfire hazard to WUI structures. We conclude that differences in flammability among species exist, but the causes of flammability are different among species. In addition, species in the same genus do not always have the same flammability. Based on measured characteristics, understory plants in pine flatwoods have greater ignitability, sustainability and combustibility than understory plants in hardwood hammocks. However, the measurements for consumability were similar between ecosystems.

ID EXTRACTABLE P; PHOSPHORUS; AVAILABILITY
AB Quantification of the balance between P input and offtake (P balance), and the consequent effect on soil-test P, is essential for management of sustainable soil and fertiliser nutrient supply. Results of measurements on 31 cut swards showed that change in P balance over 4 years was significantly affected by both P treatment and soil series. The more negative P balances were in high-P soils, and in soils of non-limestone parent material compared with limestone parent material. Initial mean Morgan P of 4.3 and 12.6 mg/l, in low and high index groups (0 to 6.0 and >= 6.1 mg/l) decreased to 1.7 and 4.4 mg/l after 4 years with no P treatment, in response to annual changes of ca. 25 to 35 kg/ha in P balance. Decreases were progressively smaller with increased P input, and smaller in non-limestone than limestone soils. The ratio of negative P balance to change in Morgan P varied from 20:1 to 70:1 depending on soil P index and parent material. Five sites gave a response to P in the final year following annual P inputs of 20 and 40 kg/ha, although Morgan P was <= 3.0 mg/l at 12 sites in the preceding autumn and 3.1 to 6.0 at nine sites. The results showed that both P balance and soil series should be taken into account in efficient fertiliser management, and that data from cut swards can be extrapolated to grazed swards when adjusted for P offtake. However, the results did not support the assumption that inputs balance offtakes in direct proportion.

TI Recycling steelmill byproducts - some practical developments and
   outstanding issues
SO IRONMAKING & STEELMAKING
LA English
DT Article
AB Significant quantities of byproducts are generated during the production of iron and steel. Slag is usually the largest in terms of volume but a range of particulate materials are recovered from the pollution control systems. Some steelmill byproducts have been recycled or recovered for many years but changes in the technologies employed, material specifications and environmental legislation means that new issues must be addressed. Examples of practical methods for handling steelmill byproducts for internal recycling or external applications are reviewed. Impurities in the inputs to the steelmaking process mean that it is impossible to recycle all the byproducts generated. However, by careful management it is possible to convert these byproducts into forms that can be utilised in other industries. The challenge to the industry and the legislators is to establish conditions that promote development work that will continue to identify methods of treating or utilising steelmaking byproducts-and thus to continue to enhance the sustainability of the industry.

TI Construction products for a sustainable society
SO IRONMAKING & STEELMAKING
LA English
DT Article
AB It is well known that steel is the backbone of our built environment. Steel based buildings can be refurbished, steel components can be reused, and at the end of its life steel can be completely recycled back to new metal with no loss of properties. In fact it is part of a system with a number of options to recirculate products and provide innovative solutions. In a changing market where clients increasingly value the whole life cost of their investments over the initial capital cost there is a new opportunity for steel-based construction. The underlying benefits of steel in sustainable construction are described, employing examples ranging from steel in structural frames through the increased use of off-site manufacturing to a demonstration of what is possible if existing technologies are combined to produce buildings that are quick to build, are adaptable in use, are energy efficient, are comfortable to live in and are constructed with reusability and recyclability in mind. In conclusion, a number of observations are made on the practical things that steel can contribute to increasing the quality and sustainability of our built environment.

AB Suppression of CO, and waste such as slags discharged from iron- and steelmaking processes are some of the typical biggest issues for the protection of global environment and sustainable growth of steelmaking industry. Utilization of active phytoplankton growth will be one of the best options to stabilize and suppress carbon dioxide at high-efficiency.
   Inorganic minerals such as C, O, N, Si, P and le are necessary for phyloplankton multiplication, It is crucial for supply of nutrition into seawater effectively for phytoplankton multiplication to understand the dissolution behavior of some elements from steelmaking slags into seawater. Firstly, the morphology of the precipitated phases in steelmaking slags during cooling period was investigated in the present work. Secondary, the dissolution behavior of some elements from steelmaking slags and pure substances such as 4CaO . P2O5 (8.5 mass% P), 3CaO . P2O5 (10.0 mass% P) and 2CaO . SiO2-3CaO . P2O5 (2.8 mass% P) solid solution phase into artificial seawater has also been studied. Thirdly, the dissolution mechanism of elements from steelmaking slags was discussed by using stability diagrams of Si, P and Fe in seawater.

AB Successful and sustainable implementation of Stamp Charging Technology in Tata Steel has given it an edge over conventional Top Charging Technology in terms of production of superior quality of Blast Furnace grade coke from a wide range of coal base, even permitting use of inferior coals. But, the stability of stamped coal cake and the additional thermal energy necessary to drive the extra quantity of water (3-4%), added intentionally to the coal blend to impart requisite coal cake strength, have always been the two haunting issues associated with this technology. This paper describes the role of coal tar pitch, used as a binder to the coal blend that not only imparts required strength and stability to the coal cake even at lower moisture level and thereby, reducing energy consumption, but also improves the rheological properties of coal blend that contributes to the quality of coke produced from inferior coals. This paper also describes the laboratory scale experimentation and its results followed by commercial plant-scale trials that confirmed the R & D findings on the use of coal tar pitch.

AB In a blast furnace carburisation of iron is one of the most important reactions and must be better understood if the blast furnace is to be made more sustainable. Identifying the key mechanisms governing the rate of carburisation of liquid iron is complicated by the intricate nature of the carbonaceous materials used. In this study two cokes prepared from coals of similar rank, ash yield and carbon crystallite structural parameters were investigated. It is found that the apparent carbon dissolution rate in molten iron at 1823 K for the two cokes differed by over an order of magnitude. Coke 1, K=14.7X10(-3)s(-1), carburised molten iron much faster than Coke 2, K= 1.1 X10(-3) s(-1) and the difference is attributed to differences in the composition of their mineral matter.

AB We measured the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios for muscles of the upland buzzards (Buteo hemilasius) and their potential food sources, plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae), Qinghai voles (Lasiopodomys fuscus), plateau zokors (Myospalax fontanierii), and several passerine bird species at the alpine meadow in Maduo county, Guoluo prefecture of Qinghai province, People's Republic of China, to provide diet information of upland buzzards, highlighting different diet composition of upland buzzards exposed to different locations. The results demonstrated that stable carbon isotope ratios of upland buzzards, passerine birds, plateau pikas, plateau zokors, and Qinghai voles were -24.42 +/- 0.25parts per thousand, -22.89 +/- 1.48parts per thousand, -25.30 +/- 1.47parts per thousand, -25.78 +/- 0.22parts per thousand, and -25.41 +/- 0.01parts per thousand, respectively, and stable nitrogen isotope ratios were 7.89 +/- 0.38parts per thousand, 8.37 +/- 2.05parts per thousand, 5.83 +/- 1.10parts per thousand, 5.23 +/- 0.34parts per thousand, and 8.86 +/- 0.06parts per thousand, respectively. Fractionation of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios between upland buzzards and their food were 1.03parts per thousand and 2.11parts per thousand, respectively. Based on mass balance principle of stable isotopes and the Euclidean distance mixing model, upland buzzards depended mainly on plateau pikas as food (74.56%). Plateau zokors, Qinghai voles, and passerine birds only contributed a small proportion (25.44%) to diets of upland buzzards. The results were closely accordant with analyses of stomach contents and food pellets, which firmly supported the feasibility of using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios to investigate diet information of upland buzzards. Another study based on stable carbon isotopes showed that upland buzzards living in the Haibei prefecture (another prefecture located in the southeast Qinghai province) mainly preyed on passerine birds (64.96% or more) as food supply. We were alarmed by the preliminary results that widespread poisoning activities of small mammals could reshape the food composition of upland buzzards, influencing the stability and sustainability of the alpine meadow. Bio-control on rodent pests should be carried out rather than the chemical measures.

TI Crossroads of herpetological diversity: survey work for an integrated
   conservation of amphibians and reptiles in northern Madagascar
SO ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Amphibians; Biogeography; Conservation; Ecology; Northern Madagascar;
   Reptiles; Survey
AB Results of herpetological inventories carried out in the northern portion of Madagascar are outlined, with the aim of depicting the faunai composition of some sites between the forests of the Marojejy-njanaharibe-Sud massifs and the Masoala Peninsula, and the NW (Nosy Be, Sahamalaza Peninsula). Biogeographical affinities of this region were discussed on the basis of original and bibliographical information. In particular, the NE is peculiar in terms of biogeographic characterisation, taking into account the relationships with the eastern rainforest belt, and the distinction with the Sambirano forests. Moreover, for some groups (such as cophyline microhylids, chameleons and skinks) this area proves to be a diversity centre. The main conservation issues are presented, stressing the increase of the existing network of protected areas and the relationships between biodiversity patterns and the needs of local populations in terms of sustainable development.

SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS

DE future generations; ideals; justice; sustainable development
ID ETHICS
AB This paper argues, mainly on the basis of Rawls's savings principle, Wissenburg's restraint principle, Passmore's chains of love, and De-Shalit's transgenerational communities, for a double interpretation of sustainable development as a principle of intergenerational justice and a future-oriented green ideal. This double interpretation (1) embraces the restraint principle and the argument that no individual can claim an unconditional right to destroy environmental goods as a baseline that could justify directive strategies for government intervention in non-sustainable lifestyles, and (2) suggests that people's concerns about the deterioration of nature and the environment articulate future-oriented narratives of self-identity that could fuel non-directive strategies to develop further responsibilities towards nearby future generations. Sustainable development, thus, provides sound arguments to restrict people's freedom to follow their own lifestyles, when these lifestyles transgressed the baseline of the restraint principle. However, the individual freedom of choice should not be restricted for any further environmental considerations. Non-directive strategies are thus to stimulate the development of such further responsibilities towards nearby future generations.

   farming; organic livestock production
ID BIODIVERSITY; WELFARE; AGRICULTURE; CONCEPTION; ORIGINS
AB This article explores what an ethic for organic animal husbandry might look like, departing from the assumption that organic farming is substantially based in ecocentric ethics. We argue that farm animals are necessary functional partners in sustainable agroecosystems. This opens up additional ways to argue for their moral standing. We suggest an ethical contract to be used as a complementary to the ecocentric framework. We expound the content of the contract and end by suggesting how to apply this contract in practice. The contract enjoins us to share the wealth created in the agroecosystem (by our joint contributions) by enjoining us to care for the welfare and needs of the individual animal, and to protect them from exploitation (just as human co-workers should not be exploited). The contract makes promoting good animal welfare a necessary condition for benefiting farm animals. Animals for their part are guaranteed coverage under the contract so long as they continue to contribute to the system with products and services.

AB This paper addresses the issue of operationalizing, or quantifying, sustainable development as a practical guideline for day-to-day environmental policy-making. It criticizes attempts at quantifying some environmental utilization space and argues that the uncertainty of scientific knowledge about the unintended environmental repercussions of consumptive choices casts serious doubt about attempts to justify government intervention in non-sustainable lifestyles.

The increases in yield of rice and wheat and the total nitrogen content in shoot and grain was also perceptible by the application of green manuring. The results highlight the importance of green manuring in rice-wheat cropping systems under tropical sandy-clay-loam soil conditions of India.

AB Aims: To assist in the development of safe piggery effluent re-use guidelines by determining the level of selected pathogens and indicator organisms in the effluent ponds of 13 south-east Queensland piggeries.
   Methods and Results: The numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and rotavirus were determined in 29 samples derived from the 13 piggeries. The study demonstrated that the 13 final effluent ponds contained an average of 1.2 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU) 100 ml(-1) of thermotolerant coliforms and 1.03 x 10(5) CFU 100 ml(-1) of E. coli. The Campylobacter level varied from none detectable (two of 13 piggeries) to a maximum of 930 most probable number (MPN) 100 ml(-1) (two of 13 piggeries). Salmonella was detected in the final ponds of only four of the 13 piggeries and then only at a low level (highest level being 51 MPN 100 ml(-1)). No rotavirus and no Erysip. rhusiopathiae were detected. The average log(10) reductions across the ponding systems to the final irrigation pond were 1.77 for thermotolerant coliforms, 1.71 for E. coli and 1.04 for Campylobacter.
   Conclusions: This study has provided a baseline knowledge on the levels of indicator organisms and selected pathogens in piggery effluent.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The knowledge gained in this study will assist in the development of guidelines to ensure the safe and sustainable re-use of piggery effluent.

AB Benthic macroalgal communities constitute one of the ecological quality elements needed to implement the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), the legislation targetted at sustainable management of the European aquatic environment. As the Directive foresees the establishment of Ecological Status Class boundaries and Reference Conditions in coastal waters, a study was conducted on the Attica coast of Greece to identify the best method to use macroalgal community data for evaluating ecological quality and at the same time keep the program within a low budget. Six seasonal quantitative and qualitative samples were taken from the upper infralittoral macroalgal communities on the Attica coast of Greece on six occasions between summer 1998 and spring 2002; these sites, which reflect a gradient of anthropogenic perturbation, were used on each occasion. A list of 60 macroalgal taxa was prepared, the cover value of each taxon was measured and the structure of the vegetation was described. The use of four different indices (Shannon-Weaver index, Pielou evenness, Multi-Dimensional Scaling plot of Bray-Curtis similarity, Ecological Evaluation index-EEI) were compared. The multidimensional scaling of Bray-Curtis similarity and the EEI were better at indicating the perturbation pattern of the study area. However, only the EEI succeeded in distinguishing four quality classes ('low' to 'high'). By using EEI, a spatial scale-weighted evaluation of ecological quality was also performed.

AB Organic wheat production has increased in Sweden, and there is a need to describe the quality of the final product. To optimize utilization of alternatively grown wheat for human consumption, it is necessary to understand the effects of crop and processing variation on the sensory qualities of the final product. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of farming systems, milling technique, and variation in formulation on the sensory attributes of whole wheat pan bread. Six samples of wheat (Triticum aestivum, variety Kosack) from field trials, three grown in conventional farming systems and three in organic farming systems (biodynamic and ecological), were roller- and stone-milled, respectively. Breads were baked according to an experimental design in which two levels of flour and two levels of kneading were also included. Sensory analysis, achieved through a descriptive profiling test, was conducted with eight trained assessors using 19 sensory attributes for 48 different bread types in two replicates. Image analysis was used to establish the slice area of the breads. Milling technique had a greater impact on the sensory qualities of bread and on the slice area than did farming system and baking technique. Conventional wheat had lower protein and ash contents, but higher volume weight than did the organic wheat. Damaged starch, extensographic values (R-m, E) and farinographic values for water absorption, dough development time and dough stability were higher for roller-milled samples than for the stone-milled. Whole meal breads of roller-milled wheat were dominated by sweetness, juiciness and compactness attributes, whereas those from stone-milled wheat were characterized by saltiness, deformity and roasted cereal attributes. The six wheat samples revealed that variation in breads' sensory qualities was larger for the three organic samples than for the three conventional samples. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The environmental impact of land-use can be expressed in terms of a change in biodiversity of flora. We present two models that characterize the negative effects of land-use: a model on the basis of species richness; a model on the basis of the rarity of ecosystems and their vascular plants. Each of those models may serve in the EIA (environmental impact assessment) of the urban and rural planning of expanding cities, industrial areas, road infrastructure, etc. Moreover, these models might be applied by Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) practitioners to incorporate the aspect of land-use in the environmental assessment of a specific product design. The results of both models have been applied in practice. Maps of The Netherlands are provided for both models. The map based on the rarity of ecosystems differentiates the best of what experts (biologists and ecologists) define as botanical quality of nature; the methodology is operational in The Netherlands and might be applied to other countries as well, however, detailed botanical information is required. The map based on species richness has a weaker compliance with the botanical quality of nature, however, the model can more easily be applied to a wider area of the world, since indicative data about species richness is available on a global scale. The so called 'eco-costs of land conversion' is proposed as a single indicator, being the marginal costs of prevention (or compensation) of the negative environmental effects on biodiversity caused by change of land-use. These 'eco-costs of land conversion' for the botanical aspects are part of the much broader model of the eco-costs/value ratio, which has recently been published in this journal [Vogtlander et al., Journal of Cleaner Production 2002; 10:57-671].

TI Life cycle iNdeX (LInX): a new indexing procedure for process and

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an important technique in the successful implementation of a process or product development in the context of environmental sustainability. Attempts have been made to incorporate LCA in public and corporate processes and product related decision-making. The European Union's eco-labeling schemes and the United Kingdom's Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive have tried to integrate life cycle thinking with policy making. However, these efforts still have not made LCA an integral part of process and product selection and design. The absence of an easy to use tool for rapid reconnaissance is a basic limitation of the LCA application.
   A new life cycle indexing system - LInX - is proposed, which will facilitate the LCA application in process and product evaluation and decision-making. The LInX is comprised of four important sub-indices or attributes - environment, health and safety (EHS), cost, technical feasibility, and socio-political factors. Further, each attribute contains a number of basic parameters, e.g. EHS consists of 11 parameters. Quantification of each basic parameter is performed for the complete life cycle of a proposed process or product. An analytical hierarchy process is used to compute the weights for each basic parameter and sub-indices. A composite process is used to determine the final overall index. This paper explains the methodology for computation of the new indexing system and demonstrates it with an application. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Sustainable Process Index is an ecological evaluation system specialty developed for the requirements of process engineering. It allows reliable as well as convenient and quick valuation of processes on the base of data available to a process engineer even in the early stages of planning.
   The paper will discuss the application of this index in practical examples of interest to many process engineers. Energy systems are of great importance for almost any process, as they cause a considerable part of investment, as well as operating costs. From the ecological point of view, they may be even more influential as they cause direct emissions (e.g. SO2, NOx) as well as contributions to global ecological problems, most prominently global warming. The right decision about energy systems within a process therefore is of considerable importance for any process engineer.
   A comparison of different energy systems with the SPI will reveal the most important ecological features of energy systems using different conversion technologies as well as different raw materials and energy sources. The various pressures exerted by these systems on the environment will be discussed. However, the most important information derived from a valuation with the SPI is the relative size of these pressures. This bases the decision about the right energy system on an equal footing for all technological contenders. It allows also the setting of engineering and optimisation priorities.

AB The USAID Environmental Pollution Prevention Project (EP3) established pollution prevention (P2) programs in nine countries in Latin America, Asia, and North Africa. EP3 provided technical assistance, training and policy development to build sustainable pollution prevention programs for the transfer of industrial P2 know-how, equipment and environmental management expertise. Among the most important lessons learned during EP3 were: (1) working with groups of plants, small and large, instead of one plant at a time led to higher rates of P2 adoption and implementation; (2) providing comprehensive solutions that included no-cost/low cost process efficiency measures, P2 and pollution control equipment/new technology, environmental management systerns/ISO 14000 certification, and access to finance institutions met industry's needs better than providing assistance in only one limited area; and (3) integrating technical assistance with policy initiatives and training improved the chances of long-term sustainability. Although, the programme was successful in creating a cadre of pollution prevention professionals and working with a number of plants, it failed to extend its message throughout the industrial sector with its retail approach and failed to develop close ties with governments and NGOs.

AB The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) is currently financing 11 Cleaner Production Centers (CPCs) in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Center design has evolved over time shifting the focus from traditional cleaner production centers (CPCs) focusing on awareness raising, training, information and "good housekeeping" measures towards centers with a stronger focus on transfer of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs) combined with financial services such as those offered by international environmental treaties. A concentration on good housekeeping measures in particular has proven to be commercially non-viable, meeting only partially the needs of enterprises and generating impacts with limited dissemination potential. The more successful centers are business oriented ones working best as independent entities directed by national and international stakeholders. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Project Demonstrations In Small Industries for Reducing waste (DESIRE) was implemented between 1993 and 1995 to foster the uptake of waste minimization among small scale industries in India. The project adopted the PRISMA project design and included: waste minimization assessments in 12 demonstration companies (from three industry sectors); development of a waste minimization assessment methodology customized to the needs and opportunities of small scale industries; assessment of company level constraints and enabling measures; formulation of policy recommendations; and dissemination activities.
   The follow-up assessment confirmed in all five demonstration companies that still operate under comparable conditions at the start of the DESIRE project, the continued utilization of the capacity built in the DESIRE project. There is also compelling evidence that some companies that participated in follow-up dissemination activities were able to implement waste minimization without an expensive external waste minimization assessment. The policy impact of the DESIRE project is mixed. The project results did however inspire change and catalyze new initiatives and follow-up waste minimization and cleaner production projects.

   Egypt; national; industrial process; barriers
AB Cleaner production is essentially aimed at increasing production efficiency, while at the same time eliminating or minimizing wastes and emissions at their source, rather than treating them after they have been generated. The concept is especially important to developing countries, where energy natural resources are scarce, and the pace of environmental degradation is continuously increasing. This paper is the outcome of an activity launched by the Egyptian Pollution Abatement Project (EPAP) presenting an outline of a proposed strategy to encourage the uptake and implementation of cleaner production in Egypt. The paper presents the importance of cleaner production to Egypt, and examines the steps taken in that direction. The paper also addresses the motivation for considering cleaner production in Egypt, and the challenges faced in that regard. The steps the industry has to take to achieving cleaner production goals are proposed, as well as the different policy instruments that the Egyptian government should implement to encourage cleaner production implementation.

AB This paper is built on a summary of the findings of a research report, entitled 'European Common Agricultural Policy: An analysis of the main factors affecting its future environmental policy', which aimed to identify and examine the main factors that could influence the development of the environmental policy of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the future.
   After the analysis of different factors that were recognised as being possible influences (e.g. GMOs, Montreal Protocol, Kyoto Protocol etc.) three main factors were identified that could influence policy development; these were:
   the World Trade Organisation and the on-going negotiations concerning the Agreement on Agriculture, and
   the expansion/enlargement of the European Union,
   the greening of the agricultural agenda, including concepts such as rural development and the increasing interest in organic farming.
   The conclusion reached by the research was that the World Trade Organisation has the potential to cause the biggest influence on the future environmental policy of the CAP. The issue of the enlargement of the European Union was seen as the chance for development of the industry in both the current members and the candidate countries. It was also found that the greening debate will continue to develop and influence policy in the future in combination with the other factors. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper analyses farmers' networking strategies for sustainable agricultural development. The focus is on internal barriers of farmers' networks with respect to the management of the group and collective learning processes. These aspects determine to an extent the success or failure of collective strategies. Based upon case study material we will draw lessons and present ideas on how management and learning can be enhanced. We argue that in collective strategies the focus should not only be on the goal of the group, but that attention to the process of cooperation such as safeguarding coherence, monitoring and evaluation of goals and views, shared responsibility and balanced leadership is a prerequisite for effective collective action.

AB The risk assessment for new technologies, like the use of GMO in the agricultural production, becomes enormously complex. It cannot be limited to purely natural-scientific analysis. Socio-economic factors need to be considered as well. The active promotion of GMO-free areas is discussed as a means for an alternative path of development. Economically less favoured and at the same time ecologically sensitive areas are suitable for the territorial application of this concept. The state of discussion on the influences of the agricultural use of GMO on the regional development of less favoured and ecologically sensitive regions is presented. The social acceptance of GMO-free areas was tested in a survey, which was conducted in 1999 in Austria. The results suggest that the idea is worth being pursued. A case study for local application is presented: GMO-free areas as part of a biosphere park stimulate economically sustainable endogenous development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nutrient and pesticide pollution accompanying the intensive agriculture activities of the last fifty years has significantly impacted the Baltic Sea ecosystem in northern Europe. This research focused on identifying and describing the factors that may be promoting or inhibiting the implementation of environmental approaches that could reduce the negative impact of agriculture practices on the Baltic Sea. It is a case study of the ecological modernization of the agriculture industry in Skime, of southern Sweden, an area well known for its large scale and intensive agriculture practices. Studying the environmental contingent factors (eco-factors) has given some insight into why and how the implementation of certain environmental approaches may or may not be further adopted within the agriculture industry. This research has identified several important aspects that may positively encourage the further integration of environmental approaches within the agriculture industry: financial security, expanding knowledge, and local planning.

DE resource efficiency; waste minimisation; food industry
AB Waste minimisation can be as successful in the food and drink industry as in other industries often seen as more polluting. L I. I in was realised in annual savings by 13 companies in the East Anglian Waste Minimisation in the Food and Drink Industry Project, which exceeded the Project investment of pound412,000 plus the pound335,000 invested by companies in cleaner technologies. The 13 food and drink companies annually reduced: raw materials use and solid waste production by 1400 tonnes; CO2-emissions by 670 tonnes; and water use by 70,000 m(3).
   Significant amounts of food grade material are rejected from the production line for their unsatisfactory quality. This can be for visual, physical, microbiological or compositional (chemical or biochemical) reasons. The reduction in the use of raw materials carried the greatest potential for financial savings. This reduction at source approach exceeded the corresponding savings in landfill costs by more than two orders of magnitude. This reinforces the importance for companies to identify opportunities for source reduction rather than end-of-pipe solutions and the relatively low cost of disposal for the food and drink industry.
   Minimising the packaging of food products presents an opportunity as well as considerable challenges to the food and drink industry as the main concern in the supply-chain is for food safety. Initiatives to reduce electricity and water consumption and to improve effluent quality did not individually carry the same potential for costs savings as the other areas. Consequently, these potential savings were given a lower priority within the companies. However, many electricity, water and effluent initiatives were implemented by fairly simple means and led to substantial savings.
   Changes in technology brought significant savings in manpower, as well as for materials and utilities. These savings are controversial in sustainability terms and attention has to be focused on ensuring that increased efficiency creates alternative work for people, as well as for equipment. Procedural changes often focused on auditing, material handling and staff training, and with low associated capital cost, these proved to be keys to success.
   The results from the Project have shown that there is a great potential for more sustainable production and consumption systems simply through improving dialogue between producers, retailers and consumers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The textile industry led the world into the industrial revolution and is leading the movement towards global manufacturing. During the period of 1980-1995, the textile industry in the United States was flourishing. It was during these times, that increased regulatory pressures initiated aquatic toxicity testing of wastewater discharges from publicly owned treatment works. Resolution of problems identified by these tests required the development of new toxicity assessment tools, and the use of systems thinking and community/industry/regulator dialogues. The case for the beneficial use of these tools is presented as an example of how to increase productivity through greener (environmentally conservative) production induced by cooperative stakeholder actions.

AB A basis for understanding the approaches to sustainable development can be established by translating sustainable development into small steps relevant to the actual conditions of the companies. These steps are the application of cleaner production methods, followed by an integrated management system and optimising the supply chain relations and consequently the products. This procedure forms an effective way to start to understand sustainable development and to develop sustainable strategies in companies.
   Cleaner production is an effective approach to analyse the productive processes. It aids to reducing use of chemicals and generation of waste and emissions. At the same time it helps to sensitise workforce and management for environmental problems caused by the enterprise including health and safety. Especially in small companies this means at the same time immediate and visible improvement in the situation of occupational health, quality and environmental performance.
   In this document, the authors present and analyse two case studies that demonstrate that real experiences in improving environmental and economic performance by improving processes and procedures occurred and motivate the company's leadership, suppliers and employees to continue to make additional improvements. The range of focus is expanded step by step to include suppliers, customers, the products and the societal role of the company. Continuous learning and improvement resulted from this process.

DE mining; minerals; industry; sustainable development; indicators
AB The mining and minerals industry faces some of the most difficult sustainability challenges of any industrial sector. To secure its continued `social licence' to operate, the industry must respond to these challenges by engaging its rhany different stakeholders and addressing their sustainability concerns. The industry must also be able to measure and assess its sustainability performance and to demonstrate continuous improvements over long term. The mining and minerals sector has already started responding to some of the sustainability challenges, as demonstrated by the Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development (MMSD) project. Following the findings of MMSD, this paper aims to contribute to these activities at the sectoral level through a development of a framework for sustainability indicators as a tool for performance assessment and improvements. The indicators have been developed specifically for metallic, construction and industrial minerals, but may also be suitable for some energy minerals, particularly coal. The framework comprises economic, environmental, social and integrated indicators, which can be used both internally, for identification of `hot spots' and externally, for sustainability reporting and stakeholder engagement. In an attempt to help standardise corporate reports and enable cross-comparisons, the framework is compatible with the general indicators proposed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI); however, a number of sector-specific indicators have also been developed to reflect the characteristics of the industry.

ID SERVICES; ENERGY
AB Industrial economics ingest materials, energy and information to produce goods and services and excrete wastes and emissions. Wastes can be minimized and the relative amounts of resources, which go into goods and services, as opposed to waste, are essential to clean production and to the sustainability of the production system. A regression model based on empirical data is presented that provides a partition coefficient expressing the ratio of energy (or material) resources invested in goods to energy going to waste. Partition coefficients are developed for five countries and are shown to be related to GDP, energy and material consumption and energy and waste intensities. Higher partition coefficients mean higher productivity and lower energy, waste and material intensities. In addition, energy use/capita and pollution/capita is lower. The price of energy to the industrial sector is related to the partition coefficient. The policy implications are that partitioning of resources to goods should be maximized and waste minimized for economic as well as environmental reasons. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Industrial ecology is sometimes referred to as the science of sustainability, but unlike mature sciences, it has yet to establish reliable modes of inquiry or a uniform framework for dialogue-partly because sustainability is difficult to characterize, and partly because industry-environment interactions are difficult to model quantitatively. A number of sustainability metrics have recently been proposed that partially address the quantification problem, but inevitably oversimplify the problem of sustainability characterization. This paper proposes an overarching taxonomy for classifying the quantitative criteria of sustainability as financial. thermodynamic, environmental, ecological, socio-political or aggregated. Several examples are presented. Pollution potential, which is an environmental metric related to the ideal thermodynamic work (of mixing) per mole required to remove pollutants from the environment, is discussed in particular. However, because no single metric can capture sustainability per se, industrial ecology may be limited to elucidating the trade-offs that exist between different types of complementary (rather than substitutable) criteria. The life cycle of polyurethane foam insulation in freezer applications is presented as a quantitative example of how different environmental criteria can lead to different design recommendations. Lastly, the framework proposed herein suggests a research agenda for industrial ecology, especially regarding the linkages between different measures of sustainability and cross-comparison of the investigative methods found in different sciences related to sustainability.

AB For the economic and ecological assessment of investments in inter-firm energy supply concepts, a five-step methodology based on a simultaneous investment and long-term production model using a mixed-integer optimisation approach has been developed. This model has been complemented by a process simulation software to determine the necessary data and by a life cycle engineering software to calculate the resulting ecological effects. The methodology is applied to analyse the technical, economic and ecological implications resulting from an investment in an inter-firm energy supply concept. Computational results reveal that the installation of a combined cycle power plant to meet the specific energy demand of the inter-firm network is a promising option to contribute to sustainable development.

ID SFA
AB Local authorities are important actors in the transition towards sustainable development. They can play important roles for the promotion of industrial ecology systems oriented management of resources and pollutants on the local and regional level. In this context, the method of substance flow analysis (SFA) has been argued to be supportive to municipal environmental management, although, performing an SFA is often time consuming and demands great deal of work. It may be a task hard to fulfil on a regular basis for many local authorities. A crucial issue is, then, to what extent it is possible to learn from other SFA studies? Aiming to contribute to this understanding, this paper analyses comparative results of SFA case studies of the cadmium metabolism in three structurally different municipalities in Sweden. The analyses illustrate that in addition to specific knowledge gained from a single case study, there is also general knowledge that may constitute important information for environmental decision-making in other local authorities.

AB Eco-industrial developments with a special focus o n material cycles are usually concentrated on the level of the industrial estate/industrial park. However, the results of completed and ongoing research projects in Germany's Rhine-Neckar region indicate that larger reigional areas may be more suitable for closing material loops and creating sustainable industrial ecosystems. Nonetheless, this larger size also presents new challenges for industrial ecosystem development, such as establishing the necessary trust and coordination among actors, homogenizing and collecting data to enable comparisons within and between firms, and minimizing the transaction costs involved in searching for appropriate partners. Practical solutions and IT-tools suggested as a means of supporting eco-industrial development that emphasizes positive synergy effects for industrial actors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

ID ECOLOGY; MANAGEMENT
AB This paper reviews the factors influencing the development and sustained operation of regional industrial symbiosis (IS) networks and discusses the roles a coordination body can play to alter these factors so as to catalyse the development and functioning of such networks. These are analysed within the context of experiences gained in the early stages of three regional IS programmes under development in the UK, and of the recently launched national IS programme (NISP) that they are part of. It is stated that the policy framework in the UK has elements supportive of such networks to evolve, and the regional public bodies are favouring their development. Based on differences among studied cases, it is argued that the nature of companies' operations and industrial history in the regions, the extent of peer pressure, the positioning of the coordinating body in the region, and its approach to awareness raising and recruitment have major influence on the progress of the programmes. Finally, the paper emphasises the importance of aligning the characteristics of emerging operations with the longer-term sustainability requirements. If accepted, this challenge assigns additional responsibilities to the coordinating parties. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Eco-industrial parks (ElPs) provide a basis for applying the concept of industrial ecology. In Australia, eco-industrial parks are new and are being considered by state governments as a way of achieving more sustainable industrial development. However, for many firms, local government and communities, industrial ecology is a concept that is misunderstood and treated with suspicion. This paper uses research undertaken to investigate the application of industrial ecology to ensure more sustainable industry development in the State of Queensland, Australia, to develop a set of principles and planning guidelines for use by governments to facilitate the development of eco-industrial parks. Synergy Park, 22 km west of Brisbane, is Australia's first planned eco-industrial park to be built. The planning and development of this eco-industrial park was a significant challenge to the developer and public agencies concerned with this project. The case study presented in this document provides useful lessons and advice for planners and developers involved with the planning and development of eco-industrial parks. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Applying ecosystem concepts to the planning of industrial areas: a case
   study of Singapore's Jurong Island
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
LA English
DT Article
DE eco-induStrial park; industrial ecology; landscape ecology;
   sustainability; nurtured landscape
AB The application of ecological concepts to the industrial setting has been touched upon by literature across several disciplines. Two emerging ecological planning approaches, landscape ecology and industrial ecology, are applied here to look at alternative ways of planning industrial parks. As an emerging field, landscape ecology provides different viewpoints from the traditional approach of natural conservation, which mainly focuses on the protection of nature. The approach of landscape ecology regards the environment as a land mosaic, a mixture of natural and urban environment, which concerns a manageable human-scale environment across one or two human generations. Industrial ecology, on the other hand, goes beyond the traditional "end of pipe" idea of pollution control and learns from the ecosystem concept. The current paper is an attempt to reconcile these two fields as an integrated approach to the planning of industrial areas. Using a case study of Singapore's Jurong Island industrial park. two fundamental issues behind the idea of landscape ecology and industrial ecology are raised. If raw materials, energy and by-products are more easily replaced or reused by technology and management, then research on industrial ecology and related knowledge will be crucial for developing natural resource substitution by innovative technology and new ways of environmental management. Where it is difficult to substitute natural resources, the skills of planning and managing natural resources will take priority over other strategies. In this situation, the knowledge of landscape ecology needs to be applied to the prediction, design and evaluation of ecologically optimum resource uses, patterns and processes in the mixture of natural, urban and industrial environment. A new concept, "nurtured landscape", is proposed for mediating between the natural ecosystem and the urban/ industrial environment. The nurtured landscape provides a basis for the development of new ecological technology using landscape to ameliorate the polluting effects of the urban/industrial neighbourhood. The planning of Singapore's Jurong Island industrial park provides a test of applying the principles of landscape ecology and industrial ecology to the possible transformation of an industrial area.

AB Industrial ecology is an emerging concept for the establishment of ecologically sustainable industrial development of industrial zones and estates in China. Optimizing materials and energy flows among facilities within specific regions or industrial ecosystems is a basic industrial ecology strategy. As such, life cycle analysis and management and green supply chain management are related approaches. The Guitang Group, a Chinese sugar complex, has developed an embryonic eco-industrial development by applying an integrated approach to green supply chain management. This paper describes the Guitang Group and its evolving integrated green supply chain management model. After summarizing experiences of the application of the Group's model, the paper analyzes challenges and then introduces possible solutions. Some conclusions are developed on the basis of this analysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the current situation in the adaptation and adoption of industrial ecology in Asian Developing Countries (ADCs). The objective of this paper is to consider the possibilities to develop an eco-industrial development (EID) strategy for these developing countries. We review the regional indigenous resources of ADCs and use the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) grouping to classify the preconditions of industrial ecology in ADCs. The authors of this paper argue that unlike the usual way of applying industrial ecology as a technical tool or a practical instrument, ADCs need to adopt industrial ecology as a strategic vision and as a strategic approach to plan the economic, social and ecological development of their national economies. In this way, it can be possible for the ADCs to avoid the same problems that occurred when the developed countries experienced industrialization and rapid economic growth, and move toward more sustainable development.

AB The study seeks to demonstrate the potential role that industrial ecology could play towards energy poverty reduction and environmental conservation in Kenya through sustainable charcoal production and consumption. This is achieved through an exploration of the application of the life cycle management (LCM) concept that identifies various opportunities for technological intervention for energy and environmental conservation and reduction of material and energy losses. It also identifies opportunities for income generation at various stages of the product's life cycle; an aspect critical in poverty reduction in developing countries. The study finds that applying LCM in the charcoal trade in Kenya can deliver social, economic and environmental benefits to developing country communities and should, therefore, be promoted. However, appropriate legal, policy and institutional frameworks must exist in these countries for this to occur. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Within industrial ecology. the life cycle or chain of activities forms an important basis for analysing and reducing environmental impacts. This has led to the development of integrated chain management. A comprehensive analysis must take the actors and their interaction in chain management into account. By assessing integrated and supply chain management, this paper is designed to contribute to future development of industrial ecology, in that it addresses the importance of actors along the chain as well as their interaction. Five case studies from the textile industry are used to illustrate the differences between the objectives of the single actors in the chain and the overall chain. This illustrates that co-operation is the only way for companies to improve the competitiveness of the chain while reducing environmental burdens. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   economics; central planning
ID ECOLOGY
AB Despite the fact that all successful, documented cases of industrial symbiosis to this day have been self-organizing, some authors and development officials have suggested that increased public planning might deliver better results in this respect than spontaneously evolved market coordination. This paper takes an historical approach to suggest that comprehensive planning is unlikely to live up to the expectations of its proponents. The essay is structured as follows. The first section provides short case studies of industrial symbiosis in highly different economic and institutional settings, the essentially free-market regime of Victorian England and communist Hungary (1948-1989). The available evidence suggests that market coordination proved much more favorable to the emergence of industrial symbiosis, despite the elaboration of a comprehensive policy to that effect in Hungary. Insights derived from the so-called "Austrian" critique of central planning are then used to explain this paradox. The analysis presented suggests that the Hungarian planners' failure was not so much the result of the bad implementation of sound policies, but the logical outcome of a top-down approach's shortcomings. Policy implications for the public planning of industrial symbiosis in a mixed economy are then derived and the case for self-organization is found more compelling. The creation of more innovative institutions that will force firms to "internalize their externalities"' while leaving them the necessary freedom to innovate is viewed as an urgently needed and promising path towards increased, sustainable reuse of industrial by-products.

AB Natural ecosystems and human societies built upon them have evolved in many diverse ways. Human systems have been more materials and energy efficient in earlier periods than they are now. What can we learn from natural ecosystems that can help us to improve upon the materials and energy efficiency of our societies and thus help us to make real progress in the direction of sustainable societies? The author explores many diverse facets of our current processes and proposes ways for societal learning from nature and for applying these lessons to improve the quality of life for humans and for the ecosystem upon which we are all dependent.

ID MODELS; PREDICTION
AB The determination of indicators for monitoring the natural environment to ensure the ecological sustainability of areas under stress is problematic and prone to bias. Further, because of limitations in the resources available for data collection, such indicators should be selected carefully and their number confined to the minimum required to effectively monitor the system under study. Statistical techniques have traditionally been used to help select indicators, but often data lack the requirements of valid statistical analyses: minimal noise, variables linearly separable, variables able to be assigned numerical values, and high dimensionality. In this study, an alternate robust technique, artificial neural networks, is used to examine ecosystem data in multidimensional space and to select the minimum number of measured indicators that have the greatest weight in maintaining a sustainable ecosystem. The case study involves selecting indicators for ensuring the completion of ecologically sustainable army training conducted in a mixed grass prairie ecosystem. A neural network model was created that reduced the number of required measured indicators from 62 to 12, while minimizing researcher bias.

AB Disastrous flooding and inundation events have drawn much attention in regional sustainable development due to extensive life loss and property damage they have caused. To support river basin management practice, it is necessary to simulate flood inundation such that associated risks can be integrated into decision-making processes. Flood inundation is generally simulated by the 2-dimensional Saint Venant equations (2D SVEs). in which inertia terms are neglected in most cases, particularly in large floodplains. In this study, a diffusive wave model discretized by an implicit numerical scheme of the irregular triangle finite difference method (TFDM) was developed to examine the effect of arbitrary inner and outer boundaries within a floodplain. A case study has been conducted in the Fuefuki River basin in central Japan. Comparisons with simulation using complete 2D SVE's are made in this study. Results indicate that both the diffusive wave model and its TFDM numerical scheme are effective and accurate in the simulation of flood inundation.

ID IONIZING-RADIATION
AB There is now a general consensus of opinion that an explicit approach is necessary to demonstrate radiation protection of the environment, and that this approach needs to be developed in a systematic way. The framework that is emerging links ethical and moral issues (anthropocentric, biocentric, and ecocentric) to broad-based principles and objectives of environmental protection (sustainable development, maintaining biological diversity, and habitat protection) and then links these, in turn, to the needs of current environmental management practices, such as environmental exploitation, pollution control, and nature conservation. The relevance of this to radiation is that its effects (such as causing early mortality, morbidity, reduced reproductive success, as well as resulting in observable (scorable) cytogenetic damage) are those that may have a bearing on these same environmental management practices. The devise that would appear to be most useful to bridge the gap between our disparate data on radiation effects and the needs of environmental management, is that of adding to the concept of Reference Man in the shape of a small set of Reference Animals and Plants. This approach has now been adopted by the ICRP, adding new dynamics-the motive forces, both moral and physical-to the subject. The way is now clear for rapid progress to be made on a number of fronts. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Experience after the Chernobyl accident has shown that restoration strategies need to consider a wide range of different issues to ensure the long-term sustainability of large and varied contaminated areas. Thus, the criteria by which we evaluate countermeasures need to be extended from simple cost-benefit effectiveness and radiological protection standards to a more integrated, holistic approach, including social and ethical aspects. Within the STRATEGY project, the applicability of many countermeasures is being critically assessed using a wide range of criteria. Attention is being given to issues such as practicability, feasibility, capacity and environmental side-effects, as well as social factors such as public perceptions of risk, communication of information and the need for dialogue and consultation with affected communities, and ethical aspects such as informed consent and the fair distribution of costs and doses. Although such socio-ethical factors are now the subject of a substantial field of research, there has been little attempt to integrate them in a practical context for decision makers. Within this paper, we specifically consider the ethical aspects of restoration strategies and suggest practical means by which these can be, taken into account in the decision making process, introducing a value matrix. The paper covers two critical areas: evaluation of individual countermeasures, and use of the matrix to ensure transparent and systematic consideration of values in selection of a restoration strategy.

AB The monitoring of mountain environment gives necessary information for its control and effective management in view of its sustainable development. A system of complex monitoring of environment has been established, including physical, chemical, meteorological, hydrological, biological and sociological factors. Methods and observations have been developed and applied. Using a geographical information system, a database was created for Rila Mountain and a modern computer network connected to internet was established. As a direct consequence of the French-Bulgarian project OM2 (carried out in the period 19931998) a Basic Environmental Observatory (on the peak Moussala, 2925 m) was constructed and put in operation in attempt to control the large scale and long-term transportation of atmospheric pollutants.

AB Stringent standards for nitrogen discharge necessitate the implementation of new systems for the sustainable removal of ammonium from wastewater. One of such systems is based on the process of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox), which is a new powerful tool especially for strong nitrogenous wastewaters. In this study, the Anammox process performance was tested with synthetic wastewater in a completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The reactor was operated for 511 days and fed with increasing amounts of ammonium and nitrite. In this period, an increase of ammonium and nitrite utilization rates were observed as a result of the increase of nitrogen loads in the influent. After 272 days, about 60% of the biomass was removed from the reactor and the system was restarted. Throughout 511 days 90% of the ammonium and more than 99% of the nitrite were converted mainly to dinitrogen (N-2) and nitrate. The microbial community in the reactor was characterized with Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH). The study showed that the population in the reactor was dominated by the deep-branching planctomycete Candidatus "Brocadia anammoxidans" strain Dokhaven 2.

AB Miyun Reservoir is the most important water source to Beijing City. Land-use of the basin plays a great role in the protection of water resources. Hence a sustainable land-use planning is required to optimize land-use structure and protect water resources in the basin. Based on the complete land-use system analysis in Miyun, a grey multi-objective programming to basin land-use(GMOPBLU) model was developed and applied to land-use planning. Two alternatives were produced and analyzed by means of interactive adjustment and scenario analysis. The results showed the GMOPBLU model is a valuable approach for basin land-use planning.

AB Ecological footprint has been given much attention and widely praised as an effective heuristic and pedagogic device for presenting current total human resource use in a way that communicates easily to almost everyone since 1996 when Wackernagel and Rees proposed it as a sustainable development indicator. Ecological footprint has been improving on its calculation and still can be a benchmark to measure sustainable development although there are still ongoing debates about specific methods for calculating the ecological footprint. This paper calculates the ecological footprint of Shandong Province, China with the methodology developed by Wackernagel and analyzes the current situation of sustainable development in Shandong.

AB Ecological construction and restoration for sustainable development are now a driving paradigm. It is increasingly recognized that ecological principles, especially landscape ecology theory, are not only necessary but also essential to maintain the long-term sustainability worldwide. Key landscape ecology principles-element, structure and process, dynamics, heterogeneity, hierarchies, connectivity, place and time were reviewed, and use Beijing area as a case study to illustrate how these principles might be applied to ecological construction and restoration, to eventually achieve sustainability. An example to more effectively incorporate the ecological principles in sustainable planning in China was presented.

ID GROWTH
AB Limited water resources, increasing demand, low use efficiency, and serious pollution result in severe water resource difficult in China. The evaluation of addressing water problems and the search for effective countermeasures that ensure sustainable water use are key to China's sustainable development. The "compound water security" consists of food security, life, security, environmental security, and economic security. By establishing a conceptual model, the water security of China has been simulated in-terms of four scenarios called BAU(the business-as-usual scenario), TEC(the technology and economics scenario), IVL(the institution, values, and lifestyles scenario) and TSD(toward sustainable development) in this paper. The results indicated that water crises, especially water shortages, are being experienced now and will continue to do so for a relatively long time in China and that it is possible to reach a basic balance between supply and demand of water and grain under the TSD developing pattern by a series of approaches including technological innovation, policy adjustments, and behaviour inducement.

AB To exploit peashrub resources in Ordos as fodders, it is very crucial to realize industrial production of cheap cellulase of high activity by optimizing culture technology, especially culture substrate. In this study, a new prescription experiment based on uniform design ideal was invented and successfully applied in the solid fermentation of Trichoderma koningii F244, which was performed with two different temperature degrees. The activities of FPA, cotton lyase, CMCase and P-glucosidase were assayed and then mathematical models of enzymatic activities, which were figured out by Unconstraint Mathematical Programming, were developed by Multivariate Regression Program of SPSS10.0. Enzymatic activities of optimized substrate prescriptions corresponding to mathematical models were forecasted to determine an ideal substrate prescription. It is revealed that in solid fermentation, Tween80 has negative effect on cellulase production. Furthermore, the ideal prescription for cellulase complex production by Trichoderma koningii F244 was straw powder 16.9%, wheat bran 26.5%, (NH4)(2)SO4 9.5% and water 47.1%, whose corresponding cellulase activity was expected to be at the same high level with that of Trichoderma reesei Q9414 on its own recommended substrate. Especially, goats mainly fed on peashrub tissues mixed with cellulase complex of this prescription and culture technology, got an incremental ratio of 0.3 kg/d, which brought a very promising feeding prospect for local peashrub resource. By populization of this cellulase complex, it can integrate living standard, economic construction of local residents into vegetational restoration tightly and thus this paper will be very meaningful to be use for reference for western China like Ordos to realize its sustainable development of economy, society and environment.

TI Rice residue-management options and effects on soil properties and crop
   productivity
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Rice residue; burning; incorporation; retention; soil properties; crop
   productivity
AB Rice residues are important natural resources, and recycling of these residues improves the soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Management of rice straw is a major challenge as it is considered to be a poor feed for the animals due to high silica content. This paper reviews the potential of rice residues and its management options, residue effects on soil properties and crop productivity. On the basis of reported research results by different researchers, an analysis has been made. A rice-wheat sequence that yields 7 t ha(-1) of rice and 4 t ha(-1) of wheat removes more than N 300, P 30 and K 300 kg ha(-1) from the soil; the residues of rice and wheat amount to as much as 7-10 t ha(-1) yr(-1). South Asian farmers need to manage 5-7 t ha(-1) of rice residues and overcome the problems for planting wheat. Management options are: burning, incorporation, surface retention and mulching, and baling and removing the straw. Despite some advantages like killing of deleterious pests and clearing the piles before wheat planting, burning results huge losses of N (up to 80%), P (25%), K (21%) and S (4-60%), air pollution (@ CO2 13 t ha(-1)) depriving soils of organic matter (SOM). This loss of SOM is one of the recognized threats to sustainability. Incorporation leads to build up of SOM, soil N, P and K. The major disadvantage of incorporation is the immobilization of inorganic N. However, N at 15-20 kg ha(-1) as starter dose with straw incorporation increases yield of wheat and rice compared to burning. Surface retention of residues increases soil NO3- by 46%, N uptake by 29%, and yield by 37% compared to burning. Residue management practices affect soil physical properties viz. soil moisture, temperature, aggregate formation, bulk density and hydraulic conductivity. Soil temperature is influenced through the change in radiant energy balance and insulation. Rice crop residues are highly siliceous, and have the potential of transforming electrochemical properties of acidic soils that reduces P fixation; improving base retention and increasing the soil pH. Rice straw incorporation coupled with organic manure increases grain yield of wheat and improves soil physical condition. Residue incorporation results more microbial activity than residue removal or burning. Thus, if residues are managed properly, then it can warrant the improvements in soil properties and the sustainability in crop productivity.

   lessons and challenges
AB This paper reviews the period between 1992 and 2000 when the National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) intervened in the agricultural development of Nigeria. During the period of operation, remarkable progress was noticed in the performance of agricultural sector. More lands were opened up and cultivated within a short time compared to what used to happen in the past. However, weaknesses that require special attention for better performance of agriculture and their sustainability were identified and highlighted. These include the area of fund release to agricultural programme, inputs sourcing and purchase, machinery acquisition and repairs, training of programme staff and programme publicity. The review exposed areas of challenges for the future of agriculture in Nigeria as the consolidation of fragmented farmers' holdings into contiguous farm lands and organizing farmers into co-operative group to enhance credit sourcing and farmer training respectively. Other areas include the reactivation of the Nigeria produce marketing board as a way of standardizing the agricultural produce for better foreign exchange earnings of the country and improving the standard of living of the farmers.

DE Extension systems; Africa; agricultural growth; information and
   communication; non-governmental organizations
AB This paper presents the trend of agricultural extension systems used in the Nigerian agriculture. The pluralistic nature of these systems is partly due to the donor induced and the peculiar socio-cultural milieu of the operators of these systems. The potentials of a new era of support for national extension programs, a number of serious issues within the domain of extension practice program remain to be addressed. While often masked under the new titles and phrases of the current development discourse, the challenges faced today reflect many of the perennial problems that have plagued development efforts. These include, the challenges of: becoming truly responsive to local conditions and concerns; facilitating constructive inter-organizational collaboration; fostering greater local self-reliance through individual capacity-building and local institutional development; addressing financial insecurity and low educational levels of extension staff; and the specific interests of engaging indigenous knowledge, farmer inventiveness and farmer-to-farmer communication. The extension systems considered are: Ministry Based Agricultural Extension, Farm Settlement Scheme, National Accelerated Food Production Programme (NAFPP), Operation Feed The Nation (OFN), River Basin Development Authority (RBDA), Green Revolution (GR), The Pilot Agricultural Development Project (PADP), Agricultural Development Projects (ADPS), Unified Agricultural Extension System (UAES), Women - In - Agriculture (WIA), National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA), Nationally Coordinated Research Programme (NCRP), Farming System Research And Extension (FSRE), Training and Visit System(T&V), Research - Extension - Farmer - Input Linkage System (REFILS), Non -Governmental Organizations (NGO), Information and Communication Support For Agricultural Growth In Nigeria (ICS- Nigeria), Farmer Field Schools (FFS). The paper concludes with pragmatic steps of evolving a sustainable extension system.

DE Livestock; yield; crops; animals; technology; health; location
AB A study was conducted on the status of livestock and fisheries technologies in research and extension systems in Nigeria. Five states (Borno, Sokoto, Plateau, Kaduna and Oyo) were studied for livestock and Niger state for fisheries, using structured questionnaire to obtain information from farmers, Research Institutes (RIs), Universities and Agricultural Development Projects (ADPs). Results of the study indicated that awareness of disseminated livestock production technologies ranged from 5.4-70.9%, and the adoption from 1.4-60.1%. In fisheries awareness and adoption levels of 5.0-72% and 2.5-50.0% were recorded respectively. The ADPs were farmers' most important sources of information on production recommendations, while radio and VEAs were the most important channels of communication to livestock farmers (24.5%) and fisherfolks (97.5%), respectively. Method demonstration was the most popular approach for technology dissemination that most farmers were familiar with (33.7% of livestock farmers and 87.5% fisherfolks), and was equally rated as the most effective. Whereas the major constraints to adoption by farmers included high cost of inputs, in-sufficient awareness, and inadequate interactions with village extension agents, the major problems of RIs and ADPs were poor funding and poor staffing situation, reflecting in low mobility of field staff, poor job motivation and illequipped technology demonstration centers. Improved funding of research and extension agencies, promotion of low-cost and sustainable technologies, and paying more attention to the promotion of non-crop technologies by the ADPs are some of the recommendations made to address the problems of livestock and fisheries extension.

DE Poverty; rural livelihoods; natural resources; development pathways;
   less-favored areas; semi-arid tropics
AB There is a continuing debate on the relationship between poverty and the environment. Although many agree on the impacts on poverty of degraded environments, there is less agreement on how this occurs and whether poverty could indeed worsen environmental degradation. Meanwhile, despite continued efforts to enhance agricultural productivity and the increased momentum towards globalization, along with increasing scarcity of land and water resources, poverty and resource degradation have increased in some marginalized areas, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. A number of studies in recent times have postulated a self-reinforcing downward spiral between poverty, population pressure and natural resource degradation. These interlinkages seem to be valid for certain less-favored areas, especially arid and semi-arid regions, where biophysical and socioeconomic constraints limit investment opportunities. With emphasis on the semi-arid rainfed areas of the tropics, this study clarifies the debate on the livelihood-environment linkages in light of the existing theories and empirical evidence; synthesizes major lessons and policy implications; and advances a more holistic conceptual framework for understanding farmer decision behavior, investment strategies and the conditions that may lead to a more sustainable pathway or a downward spiral.

DE Forest; environment; harvest; treatments
AB This study examined the trends in revenue system collections and forestry development in Ondo State of Nigeria with a view to determining the annual rate of changes between 1991 and 2000 and their impacts on sustainable forest management. The study made use of secondary and time series data on forest fees, expenditure and allocation. Data were analyzed using the descriptive and inferential statistics. There exists a strong positive correlation (r = 0.91) between the projected and actual revenue for ten years under investigation. The amount released for forest development between 1991 and 2000 was deficient. The 25% Forestry Trust Fund in seven years (1994-2000) to be allocated to Forestry Department was not met. This had a negative impact on renewal programme of the state. It is recommended that the strategies for improved fiscal policies to sustainable forestry development should encompass technical/economic, institutional and political constituents. There is the need for a change in planning style. Emphasis must shift from timber production to non-wood products.

ID DIETARY DIVERSITY; CHRONIC DISEASE; MORTALITY
AB Until recently, the criteria for healthy nutrition were couched principally in terms of a combination of some form of Recommended Dietary Intakes (RDIs) for energy (calories/kilojoules) and for nutrients recognized as essential, along with Dietary Guidelines (since the late 1970s in various countries). In Cyprus, in 1995, WHO and FAO advocated FBDGs (Food-Based Dietary Guidelines); these allow for food cultural differences, population genetic differences, and the broad non-nutrition roles of food (such as social discourse); and, especially, the physicochemical properties and phytochemicals which confer human biological advantages. Measures of the total cuisine (for example, of the traditionality of the Greek diet) and its transportability to other localities (such as Food Habits in Later Life and SENECA studies) in relation to health also indicate that the contribution of diet to health is more than the sum of its chemical components. Food diversity or variety (including food processing variations) is also a predictor of health outcomes and of food security. It is also relevant that for each 1% increase in dietary diversity there is a 1% increase in per capita food consumption for poor and middle-income countries. Food variety also reflects biodiversity and environmental security. In the future, it can be expected that the environmental costs of food production will need to be taken into account in the formulation of nutrition requirements and related policy and in food choice.

DE Amazon; Brazil; international forestry; sustainability
AB Criteria and indicators (C&I) for sustainable forest management are important tools to,improve the quality of forest management. In most cases they have been developed by experts, but the participation of stakeholders is essential if the C&I are to be locally relevant and practicable. We asked four stakeholder groups to apply a set of C&I to a forest management unit in the eastern Amazon basin. The study confirmed the importance of involving stakeholders and demonstrated that effective efforts begin with well-defined and clearly understandable C&I. Stakeholders were better able to apply and adapt measurable verifiers than the more abstract indicators and criteria. Intensive communication about personal experiences and subjective interpretations is necessary to prevent misunderstandings and misinterpretations, Our study also confirmed the general practical applicability of C&I and revealed their potential as instruments of communication and learning.

AB Covariations of growth, age and size at maturity, and adult natural mortality rates are described for 22 Great Lakes stocks and 28 inland lake populations of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). An understanding of these covariations could be used to modify the expectations of sustainable yields. Age at maturity was inversely related to pre-reproductive growth rates (omega = L-infinity k). Size at age 1 was significantly correlated with pre-reproductive growth rates, indicating that omega is a realistic index of early growth. Age, but not length at maturity was inversely correlated with pre- reproductive growth rates. Asymptotic sizes (L-infinity) were not correlated with age at maturity, however the time required to achieve asymptotic size was positively correlated with age at maturity. Pre-reproductive growth rates and asymptotic sizes were larger for Great Lakes whitefish than for inland lake whitefish. Great Lakes stocks matured at a younger age apparently due to higher pre- reproductive growth rates. Natural mortality rates were inversely related to age at maturity. These intraspecific covariations of growth and maturity are consistent with life history theory developed from interspecific analyses. Life history theory derived from interspecific analyses can, therefore, be applied to intraspecific variations in life history traits.

AB Water shortage as well as water control problems including urban flood and drought have led to developing technologies for rainwater utilization in order to provide a sustainable water supply for non-potable use in urban area and to buffer extreme runoff situations in the watercourses. However, little information is available on the water qualities and runoff properties of collected rainwater for efficient design and maintenance strategies of rainwater utilization systems. In this study, the characteristics of rainwater were examined in terms of pollutant concentrations and outflow rate. Samples of runoff rainwater from various catchment surfaces were analyzed for physico-chemical and microbial determinants including heavy metals, nutrients, pH, turbidity, conductivity, and microorganisms. The results show that the first flush of rainwater contains substantial amount of contaminants that potentially pollute the whole rainwater. Surface treatment of roof catchment area using TiO2 photocatalyst allowed a better runoff property of rainwater because of its improved hydrophilicity and photo-assisted reactivity. Further research is required on photocatalytic activity of TiO2 coated surface and its long-term stability for efficient application in rainwater utilization.

AB Fuzzy cognitive maps are used as an automated decision aid to better assess how change in one component of a system affects the other components of the same system. To illustrate the advantage of this method, a conceptual model of an eco-industrial park is presented and the fuzzy cognitive mapping approach is used to analyze the impacts of this model. The model of the eco-industrial park is a collection of industries and companies that agree to co-exist for the put-pose of maintaining a sustainable economic posture in the use of natural resources and in the minimization of wastes. Industries such as a steam co-generation plant. an asphalt refinery, a salt cavern, a fish farm. and various feedlots are contained in this conceptual model. The impact assessment presented involves a total of 18 various kinds of interdependencies between and among these various industries. Impacts such as pollution, waste disposal, employment, transportation, available land, school facilities, population Growth, and other economic issues are all considered in the assessment of the impacts the eco-industrial park will have on the local community and the economy of a region that straddles northeastern Alberta and northwestern Saskatchewan, Canada. The fuzzy cognitive mapping approach is used to analyze the intricacies of these relationships and how they are likely to affect each other.

TI Considering a theory of cultural trauma and loss
SO JOURNAL OF LOSS & TRAUMA
LA English
DT Article
ID POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; US
AB The authors propose a model of cultural trauma and revitalization. The theory suggests a framework for understanding disruptions that an "original" culture might suffer at the imposition of an "arriving" culture resulting in vulnerabilities of individuals, families/small groups, communities, and the larger societies. The cultural clash model posits that original cultures have identifiable and sustainable economic, social, political, and spiritual systems in the pre-contact era. Exposure to an arriving culture can radically alter the character and sustainability of the original culture. Emergence from the challenge can lead to cultural dissolution, but there can also be revitalization and reorganization. This can occur if the injured culture lays claim to economic and social resources, preferably with the support and encouragement of the hegemonic culture. The end result can be a form of bicultural or multicultural adaptation by the members of the original culture. Suggestions for testing the model of cultural trauma are offered by using culturally relevant variables in path analysis or structural equation modeling. The article closes with a discussion of issues related to individual, small group, community, and societal interventions following cultural loss and trauma.

AB Opportunity exploitation is a necessary step in creating a successful business in the entrepreneurial process, Yet there has been little conceptual and empirical development of this issue in the literature. This study examines the decisions of entrepreneurs to begin exploiting business opportunities from a resource-based view. Our analysis of a sample of entrepreneurs whose businesses are located in incubators suggests that entrepreneurs are more likely to exploit opportunities when they perceive more knowledge of customer demand for the new product, more fully developed necessary technologies, greater managerial capability, and greater stakeholder support. Moreover the findings of this study shed a light on a less emphasized aspect of the resource-based view: the new product's anticipated lead time acts as an enhancing moderator in entrepreneurs exploitation decision policies. Implications for future research on opportunity exploitation are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study tests the view that competitive advantage lies in organizational processes and capabilities to secure patents. Since, by definition, patents are valuable and rare, here we test the extent to which patent citations and claims capture, respectively, inimitability and non-substitutability. Focusing on 85 publicly traded pharmaceutical firms (SIC 2834), we find that once the effects of firm size, past performance, and investment in innovation are held constant, inimitability, is significantly related to firm profitability and new product introductions. Non-substitutability is significantly related to new product introductions only. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID EARTH NUTATION INFLUENCE; TEMPERATURE
AB The fluctuations of the biomasses in the Barents Sea have been poorly understood and caused problems in biomass management. Better long-term forecasting is thus crucial for an economical and sustainable utilization of the biomass.
   The present paper presents a wavelet analysis of the Kola temperature series and the biomass time series of Barents Sea Shrimp (Pandalus borealis), Barents Sea capelin (Mallotus villosus), Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea harengus), Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua), and Northeast Arctic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). The wavelet shows a close relation between the 18.6-year lunar nodal tide and dominant temperature cycles in the Kola temperature series. It also shows that all biomass time series are correlated to dominant cycles of 18.6/3 = 6.2, 18.6 and 3*18.6 = 55.8 years in the Kola section. This indicates that fluctuations of the temperature and the biomass in the Barents Sea are a deterministic process caused by the lunar nodal cycle.
   The close relation to the stationary 18.6-year lunar tide opens new possibilities for better forecasting and long-term management. The deterministic relation between biomass growth and the Kola cycles opens a possibility of more optimal management in short-term periods of 6 years, medium-term management of 18 years and long-term management of 55-75 years. The stationary biomass cycles can be represented by a simple phase-clock which indicates the current state of the biomass. This method represents a new possibility of long-term biomass forecasting.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Many thousands of years after its development, unburnt earth block masonry continues to offer an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective alternative to other conventional wall building materials, such as concrete blocks and clay fired bricks, in both developing and developed countries. However, earth is a brittle building material with low tensile strength, and as a consequence tensile cracks in response to external actions or restrained shrinkage are often observed. Ductility and tensile strength may be improved by adding binders or natural fibers to the soil mixture. In this technical note, initial findings of an ongoing study of the tensile characteristics of compacted earth blocks reinforced with natural fibers is reported. The pre- and postcracking characteristics of compacted earth blocks in direct tension were determined using a test procedure developed for this work.

AB Sustainable forest management requires information on a number of soil properties. Therefore fast methods of soil analysis are needed. The objective of this study was to test the ability of near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to predict the total and exchangeable Na, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe and Al, the cation exchange capacity (CEC), the base saturation (BS) and the total contents of Zn, Cu, Cd and Ph in geologically heterogeneous forest soils. The samples (n = 100) were collected from five sites covered by beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest stands and from four depths. The soils were analysed for total contents of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Al, Zn, Cu, Cd and Ph after pressure digestion in HNO(3) and for contents of exchangeable Na, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe and Al in NH(4)Cl. The spectra were recorded between 400 and 2500 run at 2 nm intervals. Principal components analysis revealed significant spectral differences among the samples from different sites. The global NIR models predicted well the mean values of the total contents of all cations, Zn, Pb, the exchangeable K, Mg, Fe and BS in upper (0-10 cm) and lower (10-20 cm) layers of the studied soils: the correlation coefficients (r(2)) of the linear regression (measured against predicted values) varied between 0.90 and 1.00 and the regression coefficients (a) ranged from 0.94 to 1.07. The contents of Cu, CEC and the exchangeable Na, Ca and Al were predicted satisfactorily (r(2)=0.874.98, a=0.86-1.14). The global models overestimated the values of total Ca and exchangeable Ca, Mn and Fe in the lower parts of their ranges resulting in biased estimations of the means at some of the considered sites. Splitting the sample population into spectrally similar groups enabled the development of local calibrations, which improved the prediction accuracy (lower standard errors of prediction) for most of the analysed constituents and removed the bias in the estimations of exchangeable of total Ca and Ca, Mn and Fe. The obtained results indicated the usefulness of NIR spectroscopy for determination of a number of soil constituents in geologically heterogeneous forest soils.

TI Effect of mycorrhizal inoculation on nutrient acquisition, gas exchange,

AB Plant developments in Mediterranean ecosystems are affected by a characteristic multiple stress situation, which mainly derives from water-deficit in these areas. Drought stress conditions restrict nutrient and water acquisition capability of plants thus affecting the sustainability of such ecosystems. Because mycorrhizal fungi are known to enhance the ability of plants to establish and cope with stress situations (nutrient deficiency, drought, etc.), the use of these fungi as plant inoculants, is currently being investigated to help plants to thrive in degraded arid/semi and Mediterranean areas. To assess the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on nutrient acquisition by plant under drought stress, this study used a biochemical marker, i.e., the nitrate reductase (NR) activity, both in roots and shoots, because this is the first enzyme involved in nitrogen (N) assimilation by plants. Measurement of the "intrinsic water use efficiency" was used to evaluate the effect of AM fungi on some physiological activities related to water relation in plants under drought stress. Three experimental variables were tested including: (i) the use of two Mediterranean-autochthonous shrub host species to the target ecosystem, i.e., Olea europaea subsp. sylvestris and Retama sphaerocarpa L.; (ii) mycorrhizal inoculation with AM fungi either autochthonous or alochthonous from the target area; and (iii) an imposed drought stress to nursery-produced plants. Plant growth, nutrient acquisition, NR activity, both in shoot and root, photosynthesis rate (A) and stomatal conductance (g(s)), were measured before transplanting to the target sites. AM inoculation improved plant growth, NR activity (only autochthonous fungi), nutrient acquisition and the "intrinsic water use efficiency" (A/g(s)) in drought stressed O. europaea plants, while in stressed R. sphaerocarpa plants AM inoculation benefited only NR activity (with alochthonous fungi) and N acquisition. The advantages of mycorrhizal inoculation to help plant development under Mediterranean climate conditions were therefore demonstrated. The differential plant species responses are discussed in terms of mycorrhizal dependency/functional compatibility criteria.

TI Application of organic and inorganic fertilizer for sustainable maize
   and cowpea yields in Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
LA English
DT Article
ID NITROGEN; MANURE; SOIL
AB A pot experiment evaluating the influence of five rates each of compost, inorganic fertilizer (MFert), and combination of both fertilizers (OBF) on maize (Zea mays L.), performance was conducted in the greenhouse using three cropping cycle. This was followed by a field trial lasting four cropping seasons at Ilora in the derived savanna and at Ibadan in the forest zones of Nigeria. Maize followed by cowpea was used as test crops on the field. Application of the fertilizers led to increases in maize and cowpea grain yields and improved the nutrient element concentrations in maize leaf tissue. Agronomic effectiveness of compost and OBF on maize relative to MFert was 88 and 118%, at Ilora and 81 and 97% at Ibadan. There was an increase of 56 and 89% Relative Agronomic Effectiveness (RAE), for compost and OBF over MFert in the residual study on cowpea. Also, the soil macro and micro nutrient status was highly improved in comparison with the MFert at postharvest period. The optimum rates of the organic fertilizers for sustainable maize and cowpea yield were between 5 and 10 t ha(-1). The agronomic effectiveness of the residual organic fertilizers was higher than that of MFert. Optimum rate of OBF was 5 t ha(-1). Application of compost significantly increased total microbial biomass in the soil. Also, compost and OBF application led to a fairly high population of Azotobacter (N-fixing bacteria) and thus its biomass. The MFert, however caused a sharp reduction in microbial biomass in the soil. The organic fertilizer improved aggregate stability index and permeability of the soil. On the whole, the positive effects obtained from OBF and compost in this study favor the recycling of farm wastes for sustainable crop production.

   MANAGEMENT
AB Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is currently being evaluated as a raw material for producing fuel, chemicals, and electricity, Switchgrass biomass is bound by the growing environment that includes fertility. More information is needed on sustainable switchgrass production as influenced by nitrogen fertility and harvest management. Field experiments were initiated at Chickasha and Perkins, OK in 1996 and 1998, respectively to evaluate switchgrass response to applied nitrogen (N) at rates of 0, 112, 224, 448, and 896 kg ha(-1). In addition, harvest frequency and time of N application were evaluated. Yield maximums and the greatest N, potassium (K), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) uptake values were achieved with 448 kg N ha(-1) applied all in April and harvested three times. In fact, harvest frequency was the most important factor affecting yields over the course of these studies with average dry matter yields of 16.3, 14.7, and 12.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for three, two, and one harvest yr(-1), respectively. No significant change in soil organic carbon was detected over time. Although dry matter yields were found to decline with time, total N uptake did not. Forage N concentration was found to be greater in later years, thus increasing production costs. While yields were highest (18.0 Mg ha(-1)) with 448 kg N ha(-1) applied all in April and three harvests, applying 0 N and harvesting three times produced almost as much total biomass (16.9 Mg ha(-1)). This limited response to N is possibly explained by the evolution of switchgrass under low N conditions. Increasing forage concentrations of K, magnesium (Mg), P. and S were noted with increasing yields, indicating a potential for response to these nutrients.

AB Iron (Fe) toxicity is a widespread nutrient disorder of wetland rice grown on acid sulfate soils, Ultisols, and sandy soils with a low cation exchange capacity, moderate to high acidity, and active Fe (easily reducible Fe) and low to moderately high in organic matter. Iron toxicity reduces rice yields by 12-100%, depending on the Fe tolerance of the genotype, intensity of Fe toxicity stress, and soil fertility status. Iron toxicity can be reduced by using Fe-tolerant rice genotypes and through soil, water, and nutrient management practices. This article critically assesses the recent literature on Fe toxicity, with emphasis on the role of other plant nutrients, in the occurrence of and tolerance to Fe toxicity in lowland rice and puts this information in perspective for future research needs. The article emphasizes the need for research to provide knowledge that would be used for increasing rice production on Fe-toxic wetlands on a sustainable basis by integration of genetic tolerance to Fe toxicity with soil, water, and nutrient management.

AB A pot experiment was conducted to determine the effects of manuring with three types of plant residues (roots, shoots and roots plus shoots) of dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata Pets.) on growth of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) grown on saline and non-saline soils. The objectives of this experiment were (1) to determine the effects of adding different plant residues of dhaincha on dry matter yield and nitrogen (N) uptake of sorghum; (2) to estimate the percentages and amounts of N derived from various N sources; (3) to estimate N recoveries from sesbania residues; (4) to make comparison between the direct and indirect N-15 tracer techniques for estimating sorghum N uptake from sesbania residues; and (5) to test feasibility of using the non-isotopic technique (N-difference) for estimating N derived from plant residues. For measuring N uptake from various sources, two isotopic dilution techniques were utilized by adding to these soils either N-15-labelled inorganic N fertilizer (indirect method) or N-15-labelled sesbania leaves (direct method). For the indirect method, both soils manured with each type of sesbania residue, received four split applications of N-15-labelled ammonium sulfate. Results indicated that each type of sesbania residue, applied as green manure, resulted in significant increases in both dry matter yield and N uptake of sorghum as compared with the unmanured control. In addition, sesbania residues decreased the harmful effect of salinity on plant growth. Percentages of N derived from residues (%Ndfr) in sorghum grown in non-saline soil ranged between 3.9 and 33%, whereas in saline soil the observed values ranged between 4.9 and 19.8%. The N recoveries in sorghum grown in non-saline soil were 61, 45 and 37% of the total amount contained in sesbania root, shoot and root plus shoot, whereas the values in sorghum grown in saline soils were 48, 14.8 and 15.7%, respectively. The beneficial effects of sesbania residues are attributed not only to the additional N availability to the plants, but also to its effects on the enhancement of soil N uptake. Percentages and amounts of Ndfr calculated using the indirect method were not significantly different from those obtained by the direct method indicating that the indirect method used herein is feasible and simple for measuring N release from organic residues. The findings suggest that the use of Sesbania aculeata residues, particularly the shoots, as green manure, can provide a substantial portion of total N in sorghum. Moreover, the use of sesbania green manure in saline soils, as a bio-reclaiming material, can be a promising approach for enhancing plant growth on a sustainable basis.

ID SEAT-BELT USE
AB North Carolina was the first United States jurisdiction to implement a statewide program (called Click It or Ticket) coupling concentrated enforcement with massive publicity to increase seat belt use. After a successful pilot program in three very different North Carolina communities, the statewide program was launched in October 1993, and has been most active and productive as well as imitated by many other states over the past decade. This paper explores the combination of ingredients that have been employed and sustained over that period of time. These include: (a) a basic coalition of critical public-private agencies (central to the planning, execution, and publicity of the many Click It or Ticket programs); (b) critical top-down commitments (starting with the governor); (c) pervasive and innovative media events/ press releases/ PSAs/ web site information; (d) vigorous and well-publicized law enforcement; (e) feedback on results with solid, updated data; (f) related statewide and local programs/activities; and last but not least (g) continuous funding.

AB Introduction: To be consistently profitable, a construction company must complete projects in scope, on schedule, and on budget. At the same time, the nature of the often high-risk work performed by construction companies can result in high accident rates. Clients and other stakeholders are placing increasing pressure on companies to decrease those accident rates. Clients routinely demand copies of safety plans and evidence of past results at the "pre-qualification" or "request for proposal" stages of the procurement process. Are high accident rates and the associated costs just a part of business? Findings: Companies that deliver on scope, schedule, and budget have a competitive advantage. Is it possible for projects with low accident rates to use it as a competitive advantage? Is the value added by safety just a temporary or parity issue, or does a successful safety program offer significant advantage to the company and the client? Impact on Industry: This article concludes that in the case of a high-risk industry, such as the construction industry, an organization with a successful safety program can promote safety performance as a sustainable competitive advantage. It is a choice the company can make. (C) 2004 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS; IMPACT FACTOR
AB There are four main parties involved in publishing scholarly scientific journals: scholars, who produce the work and are its ultimate consumers; editors, who manage the publication process; publishers, who publish the work; and subscribers; largely institutions, who purchase the work. Because of conflicting agendas, natural tensions exist among these four parties. At the same time, some recent and ongoing trends have exacerbated these tensions: the rate at which new information is being produced, the growth of electronic communication, and the strained budgets of many institutions. This article summarizes these aspects of the scholarly communication environment, assesses some of the reasons for the current situation, and provides a commentary on what the future might bring. The current situation in scholarly scientific journal publications cannot be sustained; therefore, it is necessary for all the parties to collaborate in creating an environment of mutual respect, sharing ownership of the problems, and encouraging efforts to move toward a sustainable system.

AB This study examined the impact of a school-based preventive intervention on cannabis use in adolescence, using a cluster-randomized trial of a multilevel intervention aimed at improving social relationships within schools by promoting change in school environment. Four waves of data were collected at baseline (1997, Year 8: mean age 13 years) and six, 18, and 30 months later (1999, Year 10: mean age 16 years). Self-reported substance use, school engagement, and sociodemographic data were collected using computer-administered questionnaires. Some 2,678 (74%) Year 8 students participated (wave 1) with minimal attrition (10% by wave 4). Adjusting for baseline use, weak evidence existed for an intervention effect on the prevalence of any use at Year 10 (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54, 1.05) and incident weekly use (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.39, 1.33). These effects were reduced after adjusting for confounders. Moderate evidence suggested an interaction effect between intervention group and tobacco use (p = 0.04), suggesting the intervention was more effective for non-smokers at baseline (Adj. OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26, 0.98). This study indicates that a multilevel school-based program may provide an innovative direction for sustainable school interventions with the potential to reduce substance use.

AB The mesozonal environment for mineralisation (similar to10 +/- 5 km depth) occurs towards the base of the seismogenic zone in the upper continental crust which, in areas of strong fluid release, acts as a stressed elastic lid containing overpressured hydrothermal fluids derived from metamorphic dehydration at depth. Au-quartz lodes in this environment are hosted by fault-fracture meshes comprising dilatant extensional and extensional-shear fractures interlinked by low-displacement faults. They form in a range of tectonic regimes but are most extensively developed in compressional/transpressional settings. A brittle failure mode plot contrasting compressional and extensional stress regimes demonstrates that: (i) high fluid overpressures are easier to sustain in compressional regimes that also allow the highest amplitude fluid-pressure cycling; (ii) dilatant mesh structures serve as high-permeability conduits only under high fluid-pressure and low differential stress in the absence of through-going cohesionless faults that are well-oriented for reactivation; and, (iii) the critical interdependence of differential stress and sustainable overpressure ensures that changes in stress state are accompanied by fluid redistribution. The specialised circumstances allowing high-flux flow of overpressured fluids are generally short-lived and are terminated by the formation of through-going, favourably oriented faults.

ID EASTERN CORN BELT
AB Perennial hay crops on a large scale and as a major source of income are new to northern Idaho farmers. These crops can make an important contribution to erosion control and sustainability in this region that has soil erosion rates amongst the highest in the country. This study evaluated the current situation and future perceptions about hay production and marketing using a farm survey. Results indicated that growers in northern Idaho were optimistic about hay production, particularly timothy, by committing to a possible future increase in production. The Current level of hay production, presence of a hay compressor nearby, priority of hay production, and contract availability are important factors influencing future hay production. More commitment needs to be made by producers who are willing to grow good-quality hay. Growers need to consider production timelines, targeting markets, and quality specifications before making Such a commitment. (c) 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum graminicola remains the most important foliar disease of sorghum in West and Central Africa. This paper describes the advances made in sorghum anthracnose research that has led to a better understanding of pathogenic and genotypic diversity, epidemiology and important disease management strategies. We further highlight how understanding pathogen diversity interplays with the major sustainable anthracnose management strategies such as the use of host plant resistance and crop residue management within the region.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE

DT Article
DE Borana rangelands; community management; privatizations; rangeland
   resources; southern Ethiopia
AB The Borana rangelands occur in a semi-arid area in southern Ethiopia, characterized by extensive livestock production. The area is a valuable source of livestock that generates income and livelihoods for large numbers of rural dwellers, and export earnings for Ethiopia's fragile economy. Despite the region's high ecological potential vis-a-vis livestock production, the area is still in a crisis today with limited success of development interventions, due to increasing pressure oil the range lands-appropriation of land by private individuals, with aggravated impacts of droughts, emerging conflicts and destitution. These trends are hypothetically attributed to various factors, including climatic, demographic and market forces. The paper utilizes data from forty pastoral communities in the area to identify the causes of these trends and potential consequences on rural livelihoods. The study infers that the Borana pastoral system is in transition, with evidence of departure from traditional pastoralism to a semi-sedentary system with increasing reliance oil crops and private grazing. The semi-arid nature of the area-aggregate mean rainfall between 300 mm and 900 mm per annum-creates a concern about the capacity of the area to support a fully privatized system on a Sustainable basis.

The grain yield/plant was found to be associated positively and significantly at both phenotypic and genotypic levels with biological. yield, number of total and productive tillers/plant, 100-grain weight and panicle length in F, while in F, with biological yield, number of total spikelets/panicle and number of total and productive tillers/ plant. The perusal of data inferred that certain traits were intercorrelated among themselves, viz., biological yield with number of total and productive tillers/plant; L/B ratio with 100-grain weight and kernel length. Moderate to high estimates of narrow sense heritability and genetic advance were observed for plant height, days to 50% flowering and 100-grain weight which indicated actions of additive genes in their inheritance. The results were discussed in the sense that strategically planned selection for reduced crop growth period, need-based elongating canopy architecture and bold grained single plant ideotype would be the positive motivations and that application of this novel strategy Would lead to increased biological yield vis-a-vis enhanced and sustainable grain yield productivity of both irrigated and low input target rice ecosystems.

TI Growing and selling pasture-finished beef: Results of a nationwide
   survey
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper reports the results of a broad survey of 149 producers, who identify their product as "pasture-finished" beef. Returns are from 46 different US states and Canada. Survey responses provide information on farm background characteristics, production systems, and marketing. Results show consensus on many points, and diversity on many others. The structure of the pasture-finished beef enterprise is built on direct marketing, niche marketing, Source identification, value added, and rising consumer consciousness of health, environmental, and social benefits.
   There is a need for more attention to the role of animal husbandry in sustainable agriculture. Recent years have seen renewed interest in grazing systems, and a growth in market demand for pasture-finished beef. This is can be seen in popular press and consumer trends.
   The industrial food system does not take good advantage of the natural characteristics of cattle. In traditional farming systems, cattle perform the useful work of harvesting and concentrating nutrients from outlying pasturelands and transporting them to the human homestead or household. Cattle grazing can be accomplished with minimal material and management inputs. (c) 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Integrating fertilizer nitrogen (FN) with legume green manure (GM) could lead to sustainable and environmentally sound agricultural systems in subtropical-semiarid soils low in organic matter. A six-year replicated field experiment was conducted on a semiarid irrigated Tolewal sandy loam soil (Typic Ustochrepts) in northwest India. The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the direct and residual effects and cost effectiveness of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) grown as a GM-crop in situ for 45-50 days during either the hot-dry period (May-June) prior to transplanting of rice (Oryza sativa L.) or the rnild-rainy season (September-October) prior to seeding of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) in rice-rapeseed double cropping annual rotations. Rice grain yields with incorporation of 20 t GM ha(-1) (GM(20)) ranged from 3.93 to 5.28 t ha(-1), which were 48 to 78% greater than the no-N control. Rice yield with 60 kg FN ha(-1) (FN60) and GM(20) was more than double the control yield and 24% greater than the otherwise optimum rate of 120 kg FN ha(-1). Incorporation of 20 t GM ha(-1) to rapeseed produced 28 to 50% greater yields than the control. Combined application of GM(20) with 100 kg FN ha(-1) (recommended N rate in this region) further improved the yield potential of rapeseed by 16%. While FN had no residual effects, residual GM produced 9 and 35% greater yields of a succeeding crop due to the supply of N equivalent to 17 and 44 kg FN ha(-1) in rice-applied and rapeseed-applied GM, respectively. Nitrogen utilization by the rice-rapeseed system was greater for GM(20) than FN, as indicated by greater apparent N recovery by crops of 67% versus 51%. These results suggest that (a) green manuring in rice-rapeseed production systems is cost effective, and (b) under constrained water resources, GM produced during the mild-rainy season and applied to rapeseed is more beneficial than rice-applied GM.

   AGRICULTURE; CONTRASTS; NGOS; AID
AB The promotion of technologies seen to be aiding in the attainment of agricultural sustainability has been Popular amongst Northern-based development donors for many years. One of these, botanical insecticides (e.g., those based on neem, Pyrethrum and tobacco) have been a particular favorite as they are equated with being 'natural' and hence less damaging to human health and the environment. This paper describes the outcome of interactions between one non-government organisation (NGO), the Diocesan Development Services (DDS), based in Kogi State, Nigeria, and a major development donor based in Europe that led to the establishment of a programme designed to promote the Virtues of a tobacco-based insecticide to small-scale farmers. The Tobacco Insecticide Programme (TIP) began in the late 1980s and ended in 200 1, absorbing significant quantities of resource in the process. TIP began with exploratory investigations of efficacy on the DDS seed multiplication farm followed by stages of researcher-managed and farmer-managed on-farm trials. A survey in 2002 assessed adoption of the technology by farmers. While yield benefits from using the insecticide were nearly always positive and statistically significant relative to an untreated control, they were not as good as commercial insecticides. However, adoption of the tobacco insecticide by local farmers was poor. The paper discusses the reasons for poor adoption, including relative benefits in gross margin, and uses the TIP example to explore the differing power relationships that exist between donors, their field partners and farmers.

AB The 2001 Agricultural, Food and Public Policy Preference Survey consists of a typology of farms and issues relating to sustainable agriculture. The typology provides an opportunity to investigate the often anecdotally alluded to relationship between farm size, particularly small farms, and sustainable agriculture. This paper utilizes the typology to examine seven classes of farm size and finds a positive and statistically significant relationship between small farms and sustainable agriculture. The interaction term of farm size and tenure suggests that nonagricultural incentives may be adversely impacting the sustainable agriculture decisions of farmers.

AB The farming activities of women in six rural communities of three local government council areas were investigated. These included land preparation, planting, crop management practises, harvesting, processing and marketing. The results revealed that health problems experienced by women included muscular fatigues, fever, dermatitis, migraines, respiratory diseases, impaired vision and hearing as a result of exposure to extreme temperature, use of chemicals, fertilizers, dusts and insect bites. It is advocated that agricultural policies in developing countries should focus on health hazards of rural women so that ergonomic measures could be taken if crop production through female participation is to be enhanced.

   sustainable yield index
AB Several long-term fertilizer experiments conducted in different agro-ecological regions of India involving intensive cropping systems such as rice-wheat (Barrackpore), fingermillet-maize (Coimbatore and Bangalore) and soybean-wheat (Ranch] and Jabalpur) over the years (1972-2000) have demonstrated wide variations in crop productivity. Application of fertilizers over the years had showed significant impact on the Status of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil fertility, which in turn influence sustainability of cropping system. Sustainable Yield Index (SYI) was therefore, used asan approach to evaluate the Minimum yield likely to be achieved in relation to changes in SOC and available N, P and K status of soil. Results showed that the SOC had significant effect on SY1 in Inceptisols of Coimbatore (fingermillet-maize) and Jabalpur (soybean-wheat), and Alfisols of Ranchi (soybean-wheat) and Bangalore (fingermillet-maize). However, available soil N status did not much influence the SY1 except in Inceptisols of Barrackpore under rice-wheat system. Phosphorus fertilization was important for all crops (fingermillet and maize at Coimbatore in particular) at all centers except in Alfisol of Bangalore. Soil available K status had, however, signified its role for maintaining SYI of different cropping system in Coimbatore, Jabalpur and Bangalore. The SYI was the lowest (0. 17 and 0. 14 for rice and wheat, respectively) when no manure and fertilizer was added in Inceptisols of Barrackpore. While Alfisols both at Ranchi and Bangalore airnlessly gave very low SY1 ranging from 0 to 0.07 with N alone due to adverse effect of N fertilization alone compared to higher values (SYI 0.35 to 0.62) for NPK + FYM/lime treatment. The R values between SY1 and SOC for soybean, wheat, fingermillet and maize at Ranchi, Jabalpur, Coimbatore and Bangalore, were approaching unity (ranging from 0.72** to 0.91**) indicating higher dependence of SYI oil SOC. On the contrary, rice and wheat at Barrackpore showed relatively high R-2 (0.93** and 0.94") between SYI and only soil available N status. Similarly, the values of R2 between SY1 and available soil P status were higher (0.81**-0.99**) for all the crops except fingermillet and maize at Bangalore (0.51* and 0.52*) whereas finger millet and maize in Kandiustalfs of Bangalore showed maximum R-2 value (0.97** and 0.98**) between SYI and available K followed by soybean (0.92**) and wheat (0.89**) in Chromustert of Jabalpur. Thus, the study highlighted that SOC followed by soil available P strongly influenced the SYI in majority of cropping systems/soil types. However, available N in rice-wheat in Inceptisols of Barrackpore is an important soil fertility parameter and that of available K in fingermillet-maize cropping system in Alfisols of Bangalore. The SYI with 100% N and NP were considerably lower (SYI 0.0-0.20) than SYI of 0.31-0.53 with 100% recommended NPK because of imbalanced and inadequate nutrition. Maximum SY1 0.37-0.62 achieved for 100% NPK+ FYM treatment in almost all the locations indicating the beneficial effect of integrated use of nutrients on sustaining higher crop productivity by correcting marginal deficiencies of secondary and micronutrients.

   PERFORMANCE; ROTATIONS
AB The economic performance of rotations with reduced summerfallow frequency, legume crop alternatives, and manure applications was evaluated using data from a rotation experiment established in 1992 oil Brown Chernozemic soil at Bow Island, Alberta (Alberta Crop Diversification Center South). Net returns and variability were calculated for each of the six rotations under test and for different fertilizer treatments, including manure (a total of 20 rotation and fertilizer treatment combinations). A farm-level economic risk model was formulated to Simulate optimal rotation selection under uncertainty and risk aversion. The six rotations Included continuous wheat (W), fallow-wheat (FW), fallow-wheat-wheat (FWW), flax-wheat-fallow (FxWF), legume-wheat (LW), and grass (G). The wheat and flax phases of the fertilized rotations were fertilizcd with 0, 20 or 40 kg N ha(-1) (0, 17.9 or 35.7 lbs N ac(-1)) and with 0 or 8.6 kg P ha(-1) (7.7 lbs P ac(-1)). The W and FW rotations also had a manure treatment. Of the traditional cropping systems, the FWW and FW rotations (with applications of 40 kg ha(-1) N: 8.6 kg ha(-1) P (35.7 lbs ac(-1) N: 7.7 lbs ac(-1) P) and 20 kg ha(-1) N: 8.6 kg ha(-1) P (17.8 lbs ac(-1) N: 7.7 lbs ac(-1) P), respectively), exhibited the highest returns and the FW(20,8.6) rotation experienced less variability. The simulation revealed that increases in net returns Could be attained through the introduction of a LW rotation because of its ability to fix N and thus reduce the input costs. Risk averse producers would be expected to plant a combination of LW(0,0) and FW(40,8.6). W and FW rotations with manure treatments were not as profitable as those with chemical fertilizer treatments.

DE organic agriculture; agroecology; ecological economics; sustainability
   indicators
AB Although sustainability goals have been gradually incorporated into the agricultural education institutions, the analysis of different agricultural systems viability is still being carried out based on cost-benefits analysis. As this analysis does not incorporate ecological, social and cultural variables, it has important limitations to compare the sustainability of these agricultural systems. To show these weak points, one organic and two conventional farms from La Plata, Argentina, were compared by means of the neo-classical analysis. From an agro-ecological point of view, ecological, productive and social aspects were also analyzed by means of a set of sustainability indicators. Cost-benefits analysis showed that the organic farm had a higher profitability only when the prices of organic products reached 340% relative to conventional ones. Agroecological analysis showed that the organic system fulfilled sustainability objectives more efficiently than conventional ones, but at the same time, that these aspects are impossible to be quantified by means of cost-benefits analysis.
   Therefore, to advance towards sustainability achievement, a new holistic evaluation approach should be incorporated in agricultural education institutions.

ID CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM
AB While the application of precision agriculture technology to tactical, or within cropping season, decisions Such as variable rate nutrient application may be an initial focus for producers, other decisions can be considered. Precision agriculture, as an information system, can provide data to help make spatially dependent strategic, or multiple cropping season, decisions. This research evaluates the economic benefit of filter strips on a diversified crop farm including corn and double cropped wheat with soybean. Economic analysis includes break-even computations permitting development of a decision-making criteria for the selection of these strips using historical yield monitor data. Results suggest that there is potential for this geographic information assisted process of filter strip delineation to increase overall net returns for producers with economically superior results to either a more naive approach of enrolling all eligible land in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) or not participating in CRP. Furthermore, results suggest that information from precision agriculture, when Coupled with appropriate economic analytical tools, can increase enrollment in CRP and enhance sustainability through increased profits and the environmental benefits from engaging in the CRP.

AB Agroforestry combines agriculture and forestry technologies to create more integrated, diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems. This study was conducted in Gazipur district (former greater Dhaka district) of Bangladesh and focused on the species composition of homegardens, species richness, species density, relative prevalence, species diversity index, purpose of growing trees and number of trees in homestead. The study covered 90 households from three upazillas (administrative entities, subdistricts), 30 from each upazilla. Farm categories were sampled with reference to landless, marginal, small, medium and large size. The information was collected by using a structured questionnaire, formal and informal interviews and field observations. Some information was also gathered by group discussion with the farmers. The information was analyzed by using descriptive statistics and mathematical analysis. The average size of the homestead in the study area was 0.083 ha which increased with the increase of farm size. The homestead area occupied by trees and shrubs in landless and marginal farm categories were smaller than that in the larger farm category. A total of 43 plant species (28 were horticultural plants and 15 were timber and fuelwood plants) were identified and recorded from the 90 households surveyed. Among the horticultural plants, the most prevalent species was jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus, relative prevalence, RP = 26.3), followed by mango (Mangifera indica, RP = 22.5), mahagoni (Swietenia mahagoni, RP = 10.3), coconut (Cocos nucifera, RP = 9.9), teak (Tectona grandis, RP = 9.7), guava (Psidium guajava, RP = 8.2) and litchi (Litchi chenensis, RP = 5.7), while low prevalence species were minjiri (Cassia siamea, RP = 0.03), gora neem (Melia azadirach, RP = 0.18), tamarind (Tamarindus indica, RP = 0.19) and shimul (Bombox ceiba, RP = 0.21). Among the different farm categories, the highest number/type of species (17) regardless of forest or horticultural species was found in the large farm category whereas the lowest number/type of species (7) was found in the landless farm category. The number of trees per 100 m(2) homesteads decreased gradually from landless farms (3.5 trees/100 m(2)) to large farms (1.85 trees/100 m(2)). Least number of trees was found in the group of above 25 years of age. However, the larger farm categories had more old trees ( > 25 years) than the smaller farm categories. Most of the farmers prefer fruit trees over fuel/ timber species and species diversity was higher for fruit trees (7.3) than for timber trees (4.8). Jackfruit was identified as an important cash generating crop in the study area. In the future, the homegarden will be a viable alternative to mono-cropped field agriculture.

AB Adoption of appropriate agricultural technologies is a necessary requirement for Sustainable agricultural development. This study was conducted to investigate the adoption of Kalima, a new introduced dry bean variety (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), by smallholder farmers in target rural areas in Malawi and to identify the factors that most strongly influenced farmers' willingness to adopt the variety. The main findings of this study were that Kalima was only grown by farmers who had received seed through seed multiplication groups and was not grown by farmers outside of those groups due to unavailability of seed. Farmers' gender, literacy level, and level of education influenced their willingness to adopt Kalima, as did farmers' perceptions of specific bean characteristics Such as yield, pest tolerance, pest susceptibility, bean color and cooking time. For adoption to be sustainable, information about a technology should be judicious in order for farmers to form appropriate perceptions. To increase rates of adoption, the information should be delivered in a method suitable for farmers with a low literacy level.

ID DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; INEFFICIENCIES
AB The purpose of this paper is to analyze the efficiency of input use in tobacco production in Turkey with respect to sustainability. In the construction of cross sectional data, the provinces in the Aegean, Northwestern, Eastern-Southeastern Anatolian and Black Sea regions were considered. Face to face interviews were carried Out with 300 farmers from the provinces which together produce at least 75% of regional tobacco Output. Efficiency measures of tobacco farms in each region were calculated by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Efficiency measures obtained from constant return to scale DEA were then decomposed into pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. Total tobacco production (in kg) was used as the Output indicator, and land (ha), labor (hours), tractor use (hours), nitrogen (kg), phosphorus (kg) and pesticide (kg) were considered as the main inputs. Econometric models were developed in order to determine the factors that affect the efficiency of regional tobacco production. The average technical efficiency score for all regions was found to be 0.456, implying that the same level of production per plots can be obtained even if the inputs used for tobacco producttion are decreased by 54.4%. Although none of the regions is completely efficient in tobacco production. the Eastern-Southeastern Region, which obtained the highest pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency scores, turned out to be relatively more successful in input use. Considering all regions together, the inefficiency did not seem to result from non-optimal production, but instead from the failure to produce a given level of output with the minimum amount Of inputs possible. The results also indicated a strong positive relationship between the efficiency of input use and the sustainability of agriculture.

DE greenhouse; soilless culture; hydroponic; protected agriculture;
   cucumber; economic feasibility
AB Methyl bromide contributes to the destruction of the Earth's protective ozone layer in the atmosphere, so it makes sense to move production of some high value crops out of the soil altogether. The use of hydroponic technology or soilless culture can be a viable alternative to methyl bromide soil fumigation for greenhouse vegetable production. In Turkey, vegetable production in greenhouses is generally conventional. Soilless vegetable production in greenhouses is a new approach in sustainable agriculture in Turkey. For example, soilless production of cucumbers can provide an alternative, but little is known about the economics of this type of enterprise. Therefore, there is a need to do an economic study and cost and return analysis at local level and under grower conditions. This study aims at evaluating the economic feasibility of growing greenhouse cucumber with soilless culture system. According to results of this study, net return obtained from greenhouse cucumbers was determined to be $1.81 /m(2) and $0.07/kg.

DE sustainability; rice-based production system; farmers' reactions
AB A study on farmers' reactions to an on-farm trial of modified rice-based production system was conducted to determine its sustainability based on economic viability, technical feasibility, food security and yield stability, ecological soundness, socio-cultural acceptability and adaptability. This is in recognition of the farmers' experience, keen sense of observation and intimate knowledge of local conditions. Results of the study revealed that rice + fish + vegetable crops production system is economically viable, technically feasible, could improve food security and yield stability, ecologically sound/friendly, socio-culturally acceptable and adaptable. It also showed its great potential to help alleviate flooding- and salinity-associated problems through increased cropping intensity, productivity, yield and income, reduced risk of crop and financial failure, greater employment opportunities and reduced cost of production.

This paper centres on the use and non-use of poultry manure as a land improvement technique for sustainable food production. This is achieved by comparing the economic benefits accruable to users and non-users of poultry manure among maize farmers in two agroccological zones (Guinea Savannah and Rain Forest) in Southwestern Nigeria.
   Data were collected using a structured questionnaire on a sample of 250 randomly selected maize farmers in each of the agroecological zones. Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and partial budget approach of costs and returns analysis.
   Results showed that farmers in the two ecological zones are smallholders, with land area grown to maize varying between 0.01 and 3.00 hectares. Users of poultry manure are mainly integrated poultry-maize farm operators who applied poultry manure only on small portions (23% and 27%, respectively, in the Guinea savannah and rain forest zones) of the total cropped area of their farmlands. Respondents were fairly literate with a mean age of 43 years for the study area. Poultry manure material constituted about 91% (90% in the savannah and 91% in the forest zone) of the total variable cost of inputs in the study area. This is attributed to the bulkiness of manure and the distance travelled for its collection. Yield levels (kg/ha) and mean net income earnings (N/ha) per annum were significantly higher for users of poultry manure. Users recorded 1.35 times and 1.45 times, respectively, of non-users' earnings in the savannah and forest zones. Major constraints to poultry manure use include: odor, transportation, insufficient quantity (scarcity), wetness, bulkiness and not readily accessible (hence its search is time consuming), in descending order of importance. While odor and transportation were identified as common problems among poultry manure users in the guinea savannah and rain forest zones, bulkiness was an additional constraint for non-user respondents in both zones.
   These imply that use of poultry manure results in higher yield levels per unit of land, and is more profitable than its non-use. Poultry manure therefore constitutes an important land improvement technique capable of enhancing farm production and income levels as results generally show that higher profitability is associated with use of poultry manure, and this has implications for increased poultry production. Thus, farmers and farm operators in the study area should be encouraged to keep more birds as integrated enterprises to provide, apart from table eggs and chickens, sufficient quantity of poultry manure for soil quality improvement and for enhanced crop productivity. Technologies aimed at packaging poultry manure in such a way as to remove the associated social constraints to its use by farmers also need be put in place.

AB The results of studies of the profitability of alternative cropping systems (Organic, Reduced Input, Ridge Till, and No-Till) relative to that of conventional systems are compared and analyzed across time, location, study type, and crop type. The information collected allowed 673 separate production cost and profitability comparisons to be made; this included 206 direct comparisons of Organic to Conventional, 195 comparisons of Reduced Input to Conventional, 74 comparisons of Ridge Till to Conventional, and 198 comparisons of No-Till to Conventional. Study type (farm vs. research experiment station) plays a major role in the economic comparison of all alternative cropping systems. Time period also seemed to play a role, as Reduced Input and Organic production systems compare less favorably with their Conventional counterparts in recent (1986-1999) studies relative to studies conducted prior to 1985. The largest determinant was found to be the crop type, as some crops, such as eggplant, seemed to do well only with Conventional production while others, such as citrus fruits, did much better organically.

AB The impressive growth rates in rice and wheat yields achieved in Asia during the 1960s and 1970s were not maintained in the 1980s and 1990s. Cereal yields are still increasing, but the rates of increase have slowed and many farmers are applying larger amounts of purchased inputs to maintain and extend earlier gains in productivity. The declining growth rates are caused largely by declining soil fertility, insufficient use of phosphorus fertilizer, waterlogging, salinization, and groundwater depletion. This paper describes how subsidy programs implemented to motivate adoption of Green Revolution technologies have contributed, over time, to the inappropriate use of inputs and the resource degradation that may be causing the declining rates of growth in crop yields. Alternative policies that encourage farmers to consider the true costs of scarce resources and the long-term impacts of their decisions may be helpful in restoring positive rates of growth in crop yields. Those policies are described within the context of a dynamic, farm-level crop production model in which economic incentives influence farm-level input use, and decisions made in one year may have long-term impacts on land and water resources.

AB This paper brings together several case Studies in which different methodological approaches and techniques mobilizing single or composite indicators were applied to assess agricultural Sustainability at four hierarchical levels, including the land management system, the cropping system, the farming system, and the agricultural sector system. The first case study (Iran) focuses on the land management system at the level of individual soil units, using statistical quality control charting to assess the soil fertility status and its effect on agricultural sustainability. Statistical limits are adequate to monitor the behavior of a data popula- tion over time, but Must be replaced by acceptance/sufficiency standards for sustainability assessment. A relevant limitation of control charting is that large data sets are needed to allow for random sample data selection from the whole population and check for normal distribution of the data. The second case (Kenya) concentrates on the cropping system at parcel level, using yield gap analysis to evaluate sustainable crop productivity. Although yield gap analysis does not indicate by itself what yield level is sustainable, it points at levels of crop productivity higher than farmers' yields, which could be achievable with additional inputs and improved management practices. If the farmer can raise the yield to a higher level, his/her farming activity will become more profitable and, therefore, economically more sustainable. The third study (Iran) refers to the farming system at the production unit level, using the energy balance analysis to compare the sustainability of traditional and modern agricultural systems. Energy balance analysis has the advantage of expressing all input and Output parameters in the same unit. The approach allows us to establish input/output ratios and compare different farming systems in quantitative terms for assessing their sustainability, but it must be combined with complementary techniques to cover the many facets of the sustainability concept. The last case study (Venezuela) addresses the agricultural sector as a whole, using an aggregated index to monitor the sustainability of the farming activity at regional/national level. Component indicators must be chosen according to data availability, data sensitivity to temporal changes, and the capacity of the data to describe quantitatively the behavior of the agricultural activity. The index needs refinement by integrating additional indicators and by allocating differential weights to the indicators to properly reflect their relevance and dynamics. In general, Much effort is still needed to integrate the scale-specific methodological approaches in one coherent framework allowing to navigate through the hierarchical levels of the agricultural macro-system and to take into account the many requirements involved in a holistic model of sustainability.

ID FARMING SYSTEMS; INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; POLICY
AB Expanding urban-industrialization in southern Ontario is out-competing agriculture for use of some of Canada's best farmland. On the remaining farmland, there has been a trend to consolidate into fewer and larger enterprises, to specialize production lines, to mechanize and automate, to increase usage of imported synthetic inputs, all at the expense of environmental protection, and natural resource stewardship. Sustainability of the agri-food system, including the dimension of rural farm community viability, should be questioned as a consequence. Widespread adoption of organic farming systems would do much to mitigate the stewardship and sustainability problems, but too many impediments exist to prevent this. Adoption of reduced-input farming techniques would offer a partial or second-best solution to sustainability problems. It is argued that additional measures in the form of public intervention should be employed. Public policies aimed at inducing farmers to expend more conservation effort on behalf of the environment and sustainable agri-food systems could encompass farmer education and extension assistance, financial assistance, cross-compliance measures, and compulsion backed by litigation and penalties. Such policies would best be targeted, especially when scarce public funds are earmarked for subsidizing farmers' conservation efforts, rather than universally applied. Targeting criteria should be not only high potential for achieving environmental protection and agri-food sustainability, but also positive net social welfare outcomes. To ensure efficient use of scarce public funds, those farm sites conferring highest positive net social welfare should be ranked first for targeting.

TI Success factors in the long-term sustainability of a telediabetes
   programme
SO JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE
LA English
DT Article
AB We studied a telediabetes programme that had been in operation for 10 years, to identify the factors in its sustainability. We reviewed archive documents, conducted interviews with programme administrators and primary care providers, observed diabetes consultations and surveyed patient satisfaction. Three success factors were identified: the administration took a long-term view of the value of the telemedicine service; telediabetes enabled structured use of staff time and facilities; and service delivery followed national diabetes standards and a well defined cycle of care within a long-term quality improvement programme. However, the present study did not address the three other key theoretical dimensions of systems design beyond sustainability: size, scalability and scope.

DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT 4th International Conference on Successes and Failures in Telehealth
CY JUL 22-23, 2004
CL Brisbane, AUSTRALIA
AB We have surveyed the current state of telehealth in New Zealand. The survey found 22 telehealth projects active in 2003, compared with 12 identified in a previous survey in 2000. Many projects were small, localized and led by enthusiasts. Sustainability was a problem and many projects had failed to enter routine operation. Teleradiology and telepsychiatry services focused on acute hospitals were the most frequent clinical applications. The majority of projects (9 of the 22) were on the North Island, concentrated around Auckland. Telehealth appears to have special potential for rural communities and for the remote treatment (telecare) of chronic disease. However, the provision of telehealth in New Zealand is patchy and meets the same barriers to success as have been identified elsewhere, which make it difficult to move telehealth into routine operation. The obstacles constitute not so much a failure of individual projects as a lack of a driving force to take advantage of the opportunities. It is to be hoped that a suggested strategic framework can help to harness the opportunities.

TI Radio local area networks (R-LANs) - An enabler of the European
   broadband perspective
SO JOURNAL OF THE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK
LA English
DT Article
AB Radio local area networks (R-LANs, WLANs or Wi-Fi) provide a fast-developing and promising means for effective broadband solutions, especially within the context of the current European initiatives for the promotion of innovative electronic communications infrastructures and services in a knowledge-based economy. These networks, using inexpensive and easy-to-use customer equipment and often employing 'free' unlicensed radio spectrum, can open the door to wireless broadband Internet access for the mass market (business and residential), and will be complementary to other existing means. The particular role of R-LANs as an enabler of the broadband options in the European Union is investigated. Furthermore, an overview of the main technical features of the underlying technologies is given, along with an evaluation of some major issues related to the effective use of the radio spectrum, especially for the successful penetration of new services. In addition various perspectives of market development are investigated, which could be essential for the future of the European (and of the global) telecommunications industry sector, in particular to draw the full benefits of digital technologies and the Internet in terms of sustainable growth, increased productivity and competitiveness, creation of business and social progress.

ID STRAIN INSERTION MATERIAL
AB A polymer lithium-ion battery, formed by a Li4/3Ti5/3O4- LiFePO4 electrode combination and a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF)-based gel electrolyte, is presented and discussed. The electrochemical characterization demonstrates that this battery is capable of delivering appreciable capacity values at rates ranging from C/32 (160 mAh g(-1)) to 0.75C (130 mAh g(-1)), this being accompanied by a remarkable cycle life. In addition, because the two electrodes are based on common and nontoxic materials and operate within the stability window of the electrolyte, the battery is expected to be safe, inexpensive, and compatible with the environment. All these properties make the battery of prospective interest for application in the hybrid and electric vehicle field. (C) 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

AB An intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) module was developed using electrochemically active cells composed of (La, Sr)(Ga, Mg, Co)O-3 electrolyte, Ni-(Ce, Sm)O-2 anode, and (Sm, Sr)CoO3 cathode. Seal-less planar type stack design was employed. The first generation module successfully provided the output power of 1 kW with thermal self-sustainability below 800degreesC. Maximum electrical efficiency obtained with this module was 43%[LHV] together with the corresponding fuel utilization of 78%. Dynamic performance tests demonstrated the capability of output power alteration from 0.6 to 1 kW while maintaining a high electrical conversion efficiency. Further testing and modification of the module for methane fuel utilization are in progress. (C) 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

TI Creating a framework for research on systemic technology innovations

AB This article examines why cognitively oriented technology innovations, designed to foster deep thinking and learning, have not become widespread in K-12 schools. We argue a key reason is that most design-based research does not explicitly address systemic issues of usability, scalability and sustainability. This limitation must be overcome if research is to create usable knowledge that addresses the challenges confronting technology innovations when implemented in real-world school contexts. This is especially important in an era when political forces push schools away from the cognitively rich, inquiry-oriented approaches espoused by the Learning Sciences. We suggest expanding our conception of design-based research to include research on innovations in the context of systemic reform as a potential solution to the problem. To that end, we introduce research questions and issues arising from our own experiences with a technology-rich innovation in the context of a systemic reform initiative as a starting point in the creation of an expanded design-based research agenda. These questions and issues have important implications for both the continued viability of research on technologies for learning and on the future of technology use in schools that stems from such research.

TI The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act of 2002: A paradigm
   shift in mineral policy in South Africa
SO JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Inauguration of the new political dispensation in South Africa in 1994 initiated a dynamic shift in the ownership, management and development of the country's affluent mineral heritage. The process of substituting the old South African regime with a new equitable system started soon after the 1994 election of the African National Congress (ANC) to parliament. The Congress's Freedom Charter revealed the intent of the new dispensation when it called for radical transformation of mineral development. However, since then there have been important changes affecting the rules of mineral development. These are:
   A drastic change in politics ushered in by negotiation, a spirit of reconciliation and a desire to settle disputes peacefully
   The globalization of the South African mining industry in tandem with the opening of domestic mineral resources to foreign capitalists and
   The introduction of sustainable development as a holistic approach to mineral development in order to replace traditional narrow-minded environmental management.
   Each of these significantly shaped the new mineral investment environment of South Africa. This paper represents a summary of the historical developments leading to the current Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act No. 28 of 2002, its regulations, the much publicised Broad-Based Socio-Economic Empowerment Charter, its associated Scorecard, and the Draft Royalty Bill.

AB In many organisations, conservation of specialised expertise is picked out as a central theme only after experienced members have already left. The paper presents the SELaKT method, a method for Sustainable Expert Localisation and Knowledge Transfer based on social network analysis (SNA). It has been developed during a project co-operation between the Department of Information Science at the Institute for Media and Communication Studies, Free University Berlin, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Systems and Design Technology IPK, Berlin. The SELaKT method uses recent insights into network analysis and pragmatically adapts SNA to suit organisational practice. Thus it provides a strategic tool to localise experts, to identify knowledge communities and to analyse the structure of knowledge flows within and between organisations. The SELaKT method shows its advances and increasing relevance for practical use by integration of specific organisational conditions and requirements into the process of analysis.

TI Demand-based planning of rural water systems in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE
LA English
DT Article
ID LOCATION; FACILITIES; AREAS
AB In the past decade, international donors and governments have generally required water supply systems to be financially self-sufficient, with stakeholder participation in their planning and operation to ensure sustainability. Efforts are being made to shift planning from a process that tends to be dominated by governments to one with more involvement of water users. This paper integrates two tools for strengthening demand-based planning. On one hand, contingent valuation (CV) surveys can be used to determine the preferences of households for improved water facilities and the amounts they are willing to pay for them, and on the other, mathematical models built around CV survey results can be used to identify and screen alternatives to meet the objectives of improved water supply. This paper reports a CV study conducted in Rwanda in 2000 and shows how the findings can be embedded in optimization models that can be used by stakeholders for addressing the key planning questions. The models are applied to a test case in Rwanda; the approach, however, is general and is expected to have wide application.

TI Possible effects of elk harvest on fall distribution of grizzly bears in

ID MOVEMENTS; BROWN
AB The tradition of early elk (Cervus elaphus) hunting seasons adjacent to Yellowstone National Park (YNP), USA, provides grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) with ungulate remains left by hunters. We investigated the fall (Aug-Oct) distribution of grizzly bears relative to the boundaries of YNP and the opening of September elk hunting seasons. Based on results from exact tests of conditional independence, we estimated the odds of radiomarked bears being outside YNP during the elk hunt versus before the hunt. Along the northern boundary, bears were 2.40 times more likely to be outside YNP during the hunt in good whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) seed-crop years and 2.72 times more likely in poor seed-crop years. The level of confidence associated with I-sided confidence intervals with a lower endpoint of 1 was approximately 94% in good seed-crop years and 61% in poor years. Along the southern boundary of YNP, radiomarked bears were 2.32 times more likely to be outside the park during the hunt in good whitebark pine seed-crop years and 4.35 times more likely in poor seed-crop years. The level of confidence associated with I-sided confidence intervals with a lower endpoint of I was approximately 93% in both cases. Increased seasonal bear densities and human presence in early hunt units increases potential for conflicts between bears and hunters. Numbers of reported hunting-related grizzly bear mortalities have increased in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) during the last decade, and nearly half of this increase is due to bear deaths occurring in early hunt units during September. Human-caused grizzly bear mortality thresholds established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) have not been exceeded in recent years. This is because agency actions have reduced other sources of human-caused mortalities, and because population parameters that mortality thresholds are based on have increased. Agencies must continue to monitor and manage hunter-caused grizzly bear mortality at sustainable levels to ensure the long-term health of the GYE population.

AB To enhance the photostability of wood against ultraviolet (UV) light, a UV absorbent, 2,2',4'-trihydroxy-4-[2-hydroxy-3-(3-trimethoxysilylpropoxy) propoxy]benzophenone (BP), was applied to the reaction system for preparing SiO2 wood-inorganic composites by sol-gel reaction. The BP-SiO2 wood-inorganic composites obtained were examined for photostability by scanning electron microscope observations, color changes, and diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform analyses. The results clearly indicated that compared with SiO2 composites, BP-SiO2 composites improved the photostability of wood. In addition, BP was stable against UV light without degradation so that the BP-SiO2 composite should provide sustainable and high photostability of treated wood.

AB The unsophisticated bartering systems of the past have been replaced with money anti highly complex business systems. This has also required the need for management systems to direct and steer these complex business systems through commercial space seeking profitable anti sustainable lineages. However, not all lineages will continue to be survival worthy, imposing pressures on businesses to seek out alternative pathways. Unfortunately, the management structures of these businesses fail to manage the complexity of the evolving operational substrate. These structures are hierarchically based and use metrics that cannot be adequately disposed through the structure that created them, resulting in the inability to effectively direct and steer the business. This paper looks at the evolution of these structures and the primary role of information and regulation to sustain value propositions in modern day commercially oriented enterprises.

AB Earthworms Allolobophora chlorotica and Aporrectodea longa were inoculated into Calvert landfill site in spring 1992, in conjunction with the planting of two tree species Alnus glutinosa and Acer pseudoplatanus. Monitoring has taken place over a period of 11 years. Sampling in 2003 revealed that earthworm distribution no longer equated to the inoculation treatments; the worms had spread extensively. The presence of A. glutinosa had a significant effect(p < 0(.)01) on earthworm number (mean density 198 m(-2)) and biomass (34 g m(-2)) compared to plots where A. pseudoplatanus had been planted and subsequently died (mean density 118 m(-2); biomass 21 g m(-2)). Results suggest that tree presence may be critical to earthworm community development.
   In 2002, the spread of A. chlorotica from the original points of inoculation had reached. 60 m with the highest recorded population density at 108 m(-2) with a mass of 18(.)6 g m(-2). A. longa was recorded at a distance of 132 m from the nearest point of inoculation with the highest recorded population density at 70 m(-2) with a mass of 49(.)3 g m(-2), 10 m from the original inoculation grid. Other species recorded (and % of total) were Aporrectodea rosea (0(.)9) Lumbricus castaneus (7(.)4), Eiseniella tetraedra (21(.)5) and Lumbricus rubellus (4(.)5). The two inoculated species, A. chlorotica (40(.)4) and A. longa (25(.)3), accounted for two thirds of the earthworms found on site. The highest earthworm community density was, 213 m(-2) with a mass of 73(.)9 g m(-2) at 10 m from original point of inoculation.
   In 1999, treatments of surface organic matter (OM), in the form of composted green waste, and rotavation were applied to non-replicated plots of 50 m(2) with the effects on earthworm distribution and abundance recorded in 2002. Addition of OM alone led to an increase in number and mass (331 m(-2); 95 g m(-2)) compared to the control (233 m(-2); 51 g m(-2)), while rotavation alone (111 m(-2); 36 g m(-2)) had a detrimental effect over the given time period.
   This long-term monitoring programme has demonstrated the development of sustainable earthworm communities on a landfill site. Natural nutrient accumulation and addition of OM on or into the soil-forming material appeared to assist this process. This work may help to inform post-capping treatment at similar landfill sites.

AB Integrated watershed management (IWM) is vital in achieving agricultural sustainability in terms of both production and environmental protection. A decision support system (DSS) is useful in generating alternative decision scenarios for management of natural resources, facilitating the implementation of IWM concepts in an interactive and holistic way. The decision to implement an appropriate land use coupled with suitable soil and water conservation techniques not only enhances watershed health but also prevents sediment losses. Besides reducing basin fertility, such losses decrease the storage capacity of downstream reservoirs through silt deposition, which can, in turn, give rise to low biomass production and poorer flood control. In order to facilitate IWM an effort was made to develop, in the Visual Basic programming language, a soil and water conservation DSS which considered both structural and cropping practices for arresting sediment loss. Input parameters to the DSS for a given tract of land included: mean slope; sediment loss; soil type; and land capability class (LCC). Outputs included decision criteria to choose among alternative structural measures and suggested cropping systems to serve as biological measures to reduce soil loss and conserve water. Structural watershed management measures included a variety of soil and water conservation structures widely adopted by farming communities throughout the world. The DSS is capable of providing sediment control solutions not only for small watersheds but also for larger drainage basins, by dividing the basin into smaller watersheds. The DSS was validated for a watershed on the Caribbean island of St Lucia and used to suggest measures for a 10degrees slope under specific soil type, sediment loss and LCC conditions. The measures proposed included bench terraces, graded contour bunds, conservation ditches, concrete chute spillways, diversion dams and conservation cropping systems. The measures actually adopted on-site were conservation ditches, graded contour bunds and conservation cropping systems, a close parallel to the DSS's proposed measures. On slopes ranging from 5-55degrees, implementation of the suggested control measures resulted in a 34-37 per cent reduction in soil loss on the watershed. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Traditional agricultural mosaic landscapes are likely to undergo dramatic changes through either intensification or abandonment of land use. Both developmental trends may negatively affect the vascular plant species richness of such landscapes. Therefore, sustainable land-use systems need to be developed to maintain and re-establish species richness at various spatial scales. To evaluate the sustainability of specific land-use systems, we need approaches for the effective assessment of the present species richness and models that can predict the effects on species richness as realistically as possible. In this context, we present a methodology to estimate and predict vascular plant species richness at the local and the regional scale. In our approach, the major determinants of vascular plant species richness within the study area are taken into consideration: These are according to Duelli's mosaic concept the number of habitat types and of habitat patches within area units. Furthermore, it is based on the relative frequencies of species within habitat types. Our approach comprises six steps: (i) the determination of present habitat patterns within an observation area, (ii) the creation of a land-use scenario with simulated habitat patterns, (iii) the determination of species frequencies within habitat types of this area, (iv) a grouping of habitat-specific species, (v) the estimation of the probabilities for all species (or habitat specialists) to occur, either in stepwise, exponentially enlarged landscape tracts (local scale), or in the entire observation area (regional scale), and (vi) the validation of the estimated species numbers. The approach will be exemplified using data from the municipal district of Erda, Lahn-Dill Highlands, Germany. The current species numbers to be expected on the basis of probability calculations were compared with those recorded on the basis of extensive field work. This comparison shows that, on the basis of our simple calculations, the current local plant species richness can be predicted well, with a slight underestimation.

AB 1. A monitoring network for UK terrestrial mammals, the Tracking Mammals Partnership, is currently being set up to provide a coordinated programme to collect surveillance and monitoring data.
   2. Monitoring UK mammals is important for a number of reasons including: setting conservation priorities; measuring the effects of conservation management; managing populations of problem species and the sustainable use of game species; assessing the effects of agriculture and other human activities; providing evidence for the need for policy change; and because of obligations under intergovernmental treaties and national legislation.
   3. The bird world, largely but not solely through the work carried out by the British Trust for Ornithology, has provided a useful model for mammal surveillance and some important lessons in setting up and running a UK wide multispecies monitoring programme.
   4. Lessons include the importance: of annual monitoring; of long-term data sets of population indices rather than absolute population sizes; and of the use of volunteers in data collection.
   5. Two scoping studies have been carried out to assess the feasibility and costs of setting up a mammal surveillance and monitoring network and the survey methods that could be used for different species.
   6. The Tracking Mammals Partnership, comprising 23 organizations, has the remit of implementing the recommendations of the scoping studies. There are a number of programmes operating within the Partnership including the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme, the National Bat Monitoring Programme and the Breeding Bird Survey Mammal Monitoring. There are also a number of pilot schemes being tested.
   7. Reports on the population trend data collected should enable more informed policy and management decisions concerning UK mammal species.

AB The influence of fresh water flowing into estuaries on biological processes.. such as recruitment of juvenile fish, is poorly understood, but important if freshwater resources are to be, managed sustainably. Typically.. lagged correlations between freshwater flows and fisheries production (i.e. catch) are used to support speculation that flows affect the survival of fish (and thus year-class strength) during their first year of life. The present study compares the relative strength of year classes in an estuarine fish population with two indices of fresh water flowing into the estuary, river flow and coastal rainfall. Year-class strength was estimated from a subset of the age structure of commercially caught adult barramundi (Lates calcar fer). which were sampled at seafood processors for three consecutive years. Strong and coherent fluctuations in year-class strength were observed. Positive correlations were found between the abundance of year classes (accounting for age) and quantity of fresh water flowing into the estuary during spring and summer, when barramundi spawn and young-of-the-year recruit to nursery habitats. Regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between year-class strength and environmental variables. A possible, but unproven, causal mechanism for the relationship is that the quantity of fresh water flowing into the estuary during spring and summer influences the survival of early life-history stages of barramundi (i.e. juvenile recruitment) by altering accessibility, productivity and or carrying capacity of nursery habitats.

AB Fishing disturbances that remove epifauna and other elements of benthic habitat structure have a secondary impact on the survival of juvenile Pecten novaezelandiae, the native New Zealand scallop. We investigated habitat structure and scallop predation rates in 4 soft-sediment habitats naturally utilised by P. novaezelandiae over multiple spatial scales. We found that habitats exposed to fishing disturbance had significantly fewer elements of benthic structure and that predation rates were significantly (up to 44 %) higher compared to unfished habitats. Habitat complexity primarily differed at the spatial scale of site, which corresponds to the scale of fishing disturbance. Scallop predation was negatively correlated with the number of habitat elements such as sponges, horse mussels and ascidians in the immediate area, and positively correlated with predator density. Another factor that affected juvenile scallop survival was ambient scallop density, with higher predation rates at the site where scallop numbers had been artificially enhanced. Although size-specific predation could not be formally tested in this study, it appeared that the predation rate was higher for larger scallops (mean size of 23 cm) compared to smaller scallops (mean size of 16 cm) in at least one of the sites but this requires further investigation. The results suggest that simplification of benthic systems by bottom-towed fishing activity degrades habitats and subsequently increases the vulnerability of juvenile scallops to predation. This may have important consequences for the sustainability of wild and enhanced scallop populations.

AB To test the assumption that there is no spatial structure in small-scale recruitment variability of rocky shore mussels, we examined spatial dependence in the distribution of density of recruits (late plantigrades: 0.5 to 3.5 mm; larger recruits: 3.5 to 10 mm) and adults of the brown mussel Perna Perna within local scales (30 lags ranging between 0.35 and 10.5 m) in mid- and upper mussel beds. Spatial heterogeneity was estimated by analyzing scaling properties of semivariograms using a fractal approach. Relationships between density of mussel recruits and adults and biomass of the red alga Gelidium pristoides at the different scales were examined by cross-sernivariograms. We found that the distribution of adults showed spatial dependence at all transects, often with higher spatial heterogeneity (higher fractal dimension, D) at smaller scales (1st scaling region). The distribution of larger recruits exhibited spatial dependence at all transects, revealing a spatial structure, which was related to that of adults. In contrast, the distribution of late plantigrades showed mainly spatial independence (random pattern; 1.97 < D less than or equal to 2). Densities of both size classes of recruits were positively related to those of adults at all transects and scales, but the relationship was stronger for larger recruits than late plantigrades, explaining why there was clearer spatial structure of larger recruits. The relationship with algae was mainly negative for larger recruits, while it tended to be positive at many scales for late plantigrades. Thus, both adult mussels and G. pristoides are suitable habitats for plantigrades, while mussels are the main habitat for larger recruits. This may mean that recruits on algae either die or migrate to mussel clumps at a certain size. This study highlights the importance of recruit size when analyzing recruitment patchiness of mussels, and has implications for sustainable management of P. perna.

TI Seed supply for coastal brackishwater shrimp farming: environmental
   impacts and sustainability
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA English

ID AQUACULTURE
AB Globally, shrimp farming has been a significant agro-based economic activity since the early 1970s. Because it offered a huge immediate economic return, shrimp farming showed a booming expansion and soon became a multimillion dollar industry. However, it has been under extreme criticism because of its devastating ecological and socio-economic impacts. Because seed is the primary input, the impact from farming has started from the source of seed supply, so that not only are natural stocks of shrimp seeds now overexploited worldwide but seed collection activities also significantly reduce stocks of other living resources. Although hatcheries were developed as potential alternative and have replaced the natural seed source to a great extent, large-scale hatchery productions provide a potential source of coastal pollution. However, this area is still poorly studied. The present paper provides a review of the environmental impacts of the wild shrimp seed fishery as well as the possibility of environmental degradation from artificial shrimp seed production in hatcheries.

AB We consider the problem of distributing the liquidation value of a bankrupt firm among its creditors. Herrero and Villar [TOP 10 (2002) 261; Mathematical Social Sciences 42 (2001) 307] show that (i) the constrained equal awards rule is the only rule satisfying sustainability and composition down, and that (ii) it is the only rule satisfying exemption, composition down, and bilateral consistency. This note has three results. First, we give a direct and elementary proof of (i). Second, we connect (i) and (ii) by means of the Elevator Lemma, which is introduced by Thomson [Mimeo, University of Rochester, 2000]. Third, by exploiting the Elevator Lemma, we show that the constrained equal awards rule is the only rule satisfying exemption, composition down, and converse consistency. Thus, (ii) can be obtained as a corollary of our new characterization of the rule. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Theory and clinical practice suggest that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) decision-making processes may differ from those used in conventional medicine. If so, understanding the differences could improve patient-provider communication around treatment options. Objectives. To examine patient-oriented decision-making processes relative to CAM use. Population. Adults with chronic rheumatological disorders who utilize allopathic medicine only, CAM only, or both. Method An exploratory, cross-sectional naturalistic design with thematic and content analyses. Results. Three distinct decision paths were developed, differing substantially on the importance of provider trust, disease severity/prognosis, willingness to experiment, intuitive/spiritual factors, and outcomes evidence. Conclusions. These divergent decision paths indicate the possibility of "alternative patients," not just "alternative therapies. " Since informed decisions, tailored to the patient, would likely lead to sustainable improvements in health care outcomes, the findings may facilitate providers' capacity to. effectively advise patients about treatment alternatives and CAM use.

AB Ordered mesoporous silicas offer unprecedented opportunities not only in the preparation and clarification of the mode of action of well-defined, single-site catalytically active centres on high-area solid surfaces, they also afford means of designing and producing new, high-performance heterogeneous catalysts, some of which are already of considerable commercial significance. The large, adjustable pores of these ordered silicas, with their high surface density of pendant silanol groups, readily pen-nit bulky organometallic precursors to be uniformly anchored on their inner walls and, by subsequent gentle thermolysis, to be converted to well-defined active sites, the process of conversion as well as the ensuing catalysis being followed by in situ X-ray absorption and FTIR spectroscopy thereby elucidating the precise mechanism of the catalysis. A particular example is the Ti-IV-centred epoxidation of olefins, a process that is already of significance in sustainable development, since the unsaturated components (e.g. fatty acid esters) of sunflower and soya bean oils (and other plant sources) may be converted industrially to useful products (by HO-Ti-(OSidrop)(3) active centres).
   Bulky mixed-metal carbonylate precursors (typified by [RU10Pt2C2(CO)(28)](2-)) may also be readily converted to nanoparticle (1 to 1.5 nm dia.) catalysts at the interior surfaces of mesoporous silicas. These exhibit exceptionally high activities and selectivities in low-temperature hydrogenations, many of which may be carried out under solvent-free conditions. A potentially important conversion of muconic acid (derived from plant sources) into adipic acid can be effected on Ru10Pt2 nanoparticle hydrogenation catalysts.
   The adjustable curvatures and diameters of mesoporous silica permit asymmetric organometallic catalysts to be anchored in a spatially constrained manner, thereby leading to enhanced performance enantioselective catalysts, again of potential commercial significance.
   In view of some of the practical disadvantages (e.g. stability, cost, decomposition products and other factors {see Kleitz et al, Micropor. Mesopor. Mat., 44 (2001) 95}) of organic-template-derived mesoporous silicas, there is merit in using (for potential industrial applications), less well-ordered mesoporous silicas, also of sharply defined pore diameters, for enantioselective hydrogenations.
   Specialized techniques of high-resolution electron microscopy (e.g. scanning transmission electron tomography and high-angle annular dark field imaging) as well as in situ XAFS studies conducted in parallel with XRD measurements are required fully to characterize most of our catalysts.

AB One of the advantages of using natural fibers in composites is that they are biodegradable and renewable. Many applications for composites, however, require high performance and durability. While our attention is being drawn to renewable, biodegradable and sustainable resources for materials, we are faced with the concern about durability. For the most part, we have designed and used natural fiber-based composites accepting performance limitations such as dimensional instability, ultraviolet and biological degradation, and thermal instability. However, with a better understanding the relationship between chemistry, properties, and performance of natural fibers, we can produce a new generation of value added composites that will be performance driven and durable.
   Properties such as dimensional instability, flammability, biodegradability, and degradation caused by acids, bases, and ultraviolet radiation are all a result of chemical degradation reactions (hydrolysis, oxidation, dehydration, and reduction) which can be prevented or, at least slowed down if the cell wall chemistry is altered. This approach is based on the premise that the properties of any resource are a result of the chemistry of the components of that resource. In the case of natural fibers, cell wall polymers, extractives, and inorganics are the components that, if modified, would change the properties of the resource. Based on performance requirements, chemical modifications can be carried out to change the chemistry of the resource that will result in a change in performance.
   Many chemicals have been used to chemically modify natural fibers to improve performance including anhydrides, acid chlorides, ketene carboxylic acids, isocyanates, aldehydes, beta-propiolactone, acrylonitrile, and epoxides [16-19,28]. After reaction, the natural fibers are made into a composite and the composite has greatly improved dimensional stability and biological resistance. Chemistries can also be selected to improve thermal resistance and resistance to UV radiation.

AB Systemic administration of therapeutic proteins has value in treating a wide variety of disorders, including erythropoietin (Epo)-responsive anemias. Recombinant proteins, however, are costly and require repeated injections, while gene delivery approaches have suffered from inefficiency and difficulties with regulation. The skin effectively delivers polypeptides to the circulation, and improved approaches would support sustainable, topically regulated protein expression after a single vector injection. Toward this goal, we generated lentivectors in which both gene delivery and persistence in skin are regulated by administration of distinct steroid ligands. Following a single injection of regulated lentivector into human skin regenerated on immunodeficient mice, topical glucocorticoid ligands regulated Epo levels and hematocrit over time. Abrogation of gene delivery was achieved by both glucocorticoid cessation and proviral excision via a 4-hydroxytamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase. These findings establish an approach to durable, topically controlled systemic delivery of therapeutic proteins from human skin tissue.

AB Depletion in the forest area threatens the sustainability of agricultural production systems and en-dangers the economy of the country. Every year extensive areas of arable agricultural and forestlands are degraded and turned into wastelands over time, due to natural causes or human interventions. Depletion in forest cover, therefore, has an important impact oil socio-economic development and ecological balance. High population growth rate in Pakistan is one of the main causes for rapid deterioration of the physical environment and natural resource base. In view of this, it was felt necessary to carryout landuse studies focusing oil mapping the past and present conditions and the extent of forests and rangelands using satellite remote sensing (SRS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies. The SRS and GIS technologies provide a possible means of monitoring and mapping the changes occurring in natural resources and the environment on a continuous basis. The riverine forests of Sindh mostly growing along the river Indus in the flood plains are spread over an area of 241,000 ha but are disappearing very rapidly. Construction of dams/barrages on the upper reaches of the river Indus for hydroelectric power and irrigation works have significantly reduced the discharge of fresh water into the lower Indus basin and as a result 100,000 acres of forests have disappeared. Furthermore, heavy floods that occurred in 1978, 1988, 1992 and 1997, altered the course of the River Indus in many places, especially in the lower reaches, this has also damaged the riverine forests of Sindh. An integrated approach involving analysis of SRS data from 1977 to 1998 and GIS technique have been used to evaluate the geographic extent and distribution of the riverine forests of Sindh and to monitor temporal changes in the forest cover between 1977 and 1990; 1990 and 1998; and 1977 and 1998. The integrated landuse forest cover maps have shown not only the temporal changes that occur in the riverine forest but also in the river Indus course between 22 years period. (C) 2003 COSPAR.

AB Biological rhythms are pervasive. All eukaryotes and at least one group of prokaryotes, the cyanobacteria, exhibit biological rhythms. Further, all levels of biological integration, such as ecosystem, population, group, individual, organ-system, organ, tissue, cell and subcellular structure show rhythms with diverse frequencies. Chronobiology (chronos - time; bios - life; logos-science) is the branch of science that deals with the study of biological rhythms and their mechanisms. It is multidisciplinary in nature and burrows techniques from many other disciplines. Circadian rhythms, popularly called biological clocks, are the most-studied mechanisms. They exhibit three important properties: 1) persist (or free-run) with a tau (tau) very close to 24 h in the absence of environmental time cues like day and night cycle; 2) entrain to 24-h cycles of environmental zeitgeber, most commonly the light/dark transition at dawn and dusk; and 3) possess temperature compensated free-running periods over a wide range of environmental temperatures, but within the physiological range. The basic circadian system consists of at least three interconnected components: 1) input pathways (photoreceptors, thermoreceptors etc.); 2) pacemaker (clock, such as SCN); and 3) effector pathways (overt rhythms). Molecular bases of cyanobacterial and eukaryotic circadian clocks have been partly understood with respect to their period length, sustainability, and relationship with light. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these clocks seem to have extraordinary degree of evolutionary conservation and appear to be a universal feature of the clocks in models as divergent as algae, fungi, fruit flies, mice and humans. This article outlines the concepts and current developments in the field of chronobiology with a reference to research on circadian rhythms. It also discusses the implications of circadian rhythms in the optimization of treatments in the clinics and in the management of problems in shift workers.

AB The temporal and spatial characteristics of meteorological drought are investigated to provide a framework for sustainable water resources management in the region of Thessaly, Greece. Thessaly is the most intensely cultivated and productive agricultural plain region in Greece. Thessaly's total area is about 13 700 km(2) and it is surrounded by mountains and traversed by Pinios River. Using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as an indicator of drought severity, the characteristics of droughts are examined. Thessaly was divided into 212 grid-cells of 8 x 8 km and monthly precipitation data for the period 1960-1993 from 50 meteorological stations were used for global interpolation of precipitation using spatial co-ordinates and elevation data. Drought severity was assessed from the estimated gridded SPI values at multiple time scales. Firstly, the temporal and spatial characteristics of droughts were analyzed and then, Drought Severity - Areal extent - Frequency (SAF) annual and monthly curves were developed. The analysis indicated that moderate and severe droughts are common in Thessaly region. Using the SAF curves, the return period of selected severe drought events was assessed.

AB In a context of limited resources and continuous increase of healthcare expenditures, policy makers need to carefully evaluate the economic impact of their decisions. In the last decade economists have been particularly productive in offering to the decision makers a set of tools able to compare costs and benefits of each single medical procedure. The underlying assumption is that it is not acceptable the investment of considerable amounts of resources in medical procedures able to guarantee only limited improvements in health outcomes.
   In this particular type of context, an open issue is represented by the delicate topic of the provision of prolonged life sustaining treatments (PLST) to patients in vegetative state. The author, sustains that the provision of this type of treatments can be justified under a mere economic perspective. The traditional economic evaluations focus their attention only to the concept of incremental absorption of resources failing to capture other relevant dimensions: total costs and budget impact. The overall cost related to PLST due to the relative low unit cost and the low prevalence of patients in need of these treatments, represents a negligible part of the total health care budget. Hence, the emphasis on costs, in this circumstance, is misleading, especially considering that the current health care systems in the developed countries are characterized by wastes and inefficiencies that unduly increase costs. In addition, PLST provide a high return in terms of new knowledge, giving valuable insight on the clinical management of other severe health conditions. Long term therapies can also be considered a highly effective learning environment for health professionals. Finally, prolonged life therapies and treatments can also be considered an environment for experimenting "creative" solutions and approaches.

AB As the chemical industry commits itself to sustainable development, the importance of identifying alternative methods for wastewater treatment becomes more apparent. The removal or breakdown of organic compounds from wastewater is an important and integral part of any industrial chemical process. Described here is the electrochemical treatment (or pretreatment before biological treatment) of industrial wastewater (BASF wastewater) containing ter-butanol, a difficult biodegradable compound. Experiments were first carried out using model wastewater systems followed by industrial wastewater samples provided by a BASF Polymer Dispersion production plant in Ludwigshafen. The main results can be summarised in the following points:
   a) Investigation of synthetic (or model) wastewater The electrochemical oxidation of ter-butanol at boron doped diamond (BDD) electrode is mass transport controlled. It can be achieved with a 100% current efficiency (in the absence of mass transport limitations). Other organics compounds present in the synthetic wastewater (e.g., acetone, methylacrylate, n-butanol) behave in a similar way. The current efficiency depends only on the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and it is independent of the nature of organic components present in wastewater.
   b) Investigation of a BASF production plant wastewater sample Acetone and n-butanol are initially oxidised much faster than ter-butanol. However when they reach the ter-butanol concentration, all three components (acetone, n-butanol, ter-butanol) decay simultaneously with the same rate. It was found that by operating at the limiting current throughout the treatment process (monitoring the current density according to eq. (6)), the specific energy consumption for the electrochemical treatment can be strongly decreased to approximately 22 kWh/kg COD.

AB Within the context of sustainable technology, catalysis is a means to more efficient processes ( lower energy demands, highly selective, waste-free), thereby providing a better use of raw materials. Industry relies heavily on heterogeneous catalysis to perform chemical transformations, but the development of these systems can be slowed down by the difficulty in understanding them, since they are often ill-defined and may contain several types of active sites (which can also be detrimental to selectivity). More recently, homogeneous catalysis has emerged, and it is probably because of a molecular understanding of chemical phenomena with well-defined systems that new processes have been rapidly set up. Our approach, called Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC), has been to bring these two fields together: the result is a molecular approach to the design of heterogeneous catalysts. Within this short review, our strategy is delineated and the case of olefin metathesis is used to exemplify this approach. The design, the preparation and characterisation of a well-defined rhenacarbene are described. Based on a combined use of mass balance analysis, IR spectroscopy, advanced NMR techniques and EXAFS, it has been shown that [Re(=CHtBu)(equivalent toCtBu)(CH(2)tBu)(2)] reacts with a partially dehydroxylated silica at 700degreesC to give a single surface complex: <LF>syn-[(equivalent toSiO)Re(=CHtBu)(equivalent toCtBu)(CH(2)tBu)(equivalent toSiOSiequivalent to)] (1). This surface complex 1 catalyses olefin metathesis at low temperatures and without co-catalyst. The structure and the activity of this type of catalyst are discussed and compared with other existing homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis systems.

AB Nest Success is the most important demographic variable influencing rates of population change of Eastern Wild Turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris [L.] Vieillot) in the Northeast. Most studies of nest success and survival of turkeys have occurred in forested or agricultural areas and may not be representative of turkey Populations occupying suburban environments.
   Development associated with suburbanization has led to habitat degradation, and it is becoming increasingly important to understand how these land use changes affect the sustainability of Wild Turkey populations. Our objectives were to quantify Survival and reproduction of Eastern Wild Turkeys in the suburbanized region of southeastern Connecticut, and to compare these results to studies in forested and agricultural regions of the northeastern United States. Nest success (35%) and mortality during the reproductive period (46%) were at the low and high extremes, respectively, of ranges previously reported in the Northeast. High rates of predation on females and nests resulted in rates of nest success that were lower than rates reported for most neighboring states. Turkey nests in suburban environments may be at increased risk of predation because habitat fragmentation may lead to high densities of nest predators and increased detection of nests.

TI Coastal management policy: observations from an Indian case
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID TOURISM; GOA
AB This paper comments on the policy in India that relates to the management of resources on the coast. Almost all problems that are encountered in coastal policy fall into three major domains of coastal policy problems: (i) those that relate to resource use conflicts, (ii) those that relate to resource depletion and (iii) those that relate to pollution or resource degradation. Policies for developments that relate to the coast have to be sensitive to these three problems. Using this as an analytical lens, this paper examines Indian policy in relation to the developments in Goa, a coastal state of India, which is famous internationally for its coastal tourism. The paper argues that the absence of an integrated holistic approach to policy-making and a failure to link the process of policy-making with the substance of policy results in outcomes that are inferior viewed within a sustainability framework. This paper takes the view that in development that is closely connected with or has implications for ecosystems, and involves a resource that has multiple uses and users, as most coastal activities do, the effectiveness of policy might benefit from the notion that different kinds of coastal problems require different kinds of policy regimes.

TI Extensive open ocean aquaculture development within wind farms in
   Germany: the prospect of offshore co-management and legal constraints
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In the offshore region of Germany, human activity is increasing in type and intensity. Larger portions of the sea are sectioned off, dedicated for specific, often exclusive uses that cause rising conflicts between interests groups. One solution calls for stakeholder integration and the multifunctional use of space. This article focuses on two examples, offshore wind farms and open ocean aquaculture. It analyses their potential synergies within a co-management approach. It can be shown, that an integrated co-management strategy for offshore regions requires very different sets of rights and duties, as well as holding different types of conflicts, constrains and alliances, some of which are illustrated for the presented case study. The article closes with the conclusion that an integrated regulative framework is the most important basic precondition for a multifunctional utilisation of offshore areas and its sustainable development.

AB Overexploitation and habitat degradation threaten small-scale, artisanal fisheries around the world. Management of these fisheries is often inadequate or absent, partly because they are data poor. We here present the development of management options for such a fishery, using collaborative input from a variety of interested groups. Qualitative and semi-quantitative assessments of seahorse populations in central Philippines suggest that they are overfished. Management objectives focus on rebuilding seahorse stocks, maintaining income for fishers and ensuring long-term persistence of seahorse populations. We developed a list of 11 management options at a workshop of fisheries experts from a variety of backgrounds. We then undertook an iterative process of consultation involving fishers, traders, consumers, conservationists, aquarists, national and international policy groups. The creation of no-take Marine Protected Areas and minimum size limits for seahorses were strongly supported by all groups, emerging as the preferred options. Tenure over marine estate was strongly supported but may prove difficult to implement in the Philippines. Sex-selective fishing (leaving pregnant males) had moderate support across all groups but may be relatively easy to introduce because of fisher acceptance. In collaboration with international efforts to ensure sustainable trade in seahorses we recommend that a minimum size limit of 10 cm height and more no-take Marine Protected Areas be implemented as soon as possible to help restore this seahorse fishery in the Philippines.

TI Strategic planning for a wetlands conservation greenway along the west
   coast of Taiwan
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE coastal wetlands; conservation greenway; Taiwan
AB Most of the wetlands in Taiwan have been filled, over-exploited, or polluted, and this has injured coastal ecosystems and damaged local public welfare. As a result of global trading and Taiwan's recent membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), capital investments in local traditional agriculture and aquaculture will further decline and cause greater recession in rural areas. To help address this growing problem, a strategic plan designed to conserve, restore, and properly utilize the wetlands of Taiwan is proposed. The primary goal is to establish a "wetlands conservation greenway", which combines wetland areas that currently merit designation as protected areas with adjacent areas that are subject to wise utilization (sustainable use) or that need to be rehabilitated. This plan will create a large corridor along the north-south axis of the west coast of Taiwan, which will connect the various types of wetlands to form a conservation greenway. The conservation greenway will help maintain or reestablish the continuity and integrity of diverse wetland areas and promote the development of general guidelines for the national management and regulation of wetlands. Within the greenway, three different types of wetland management areas are recognized: protected areas, ecological parks (for sustainable use), and restoration areas. Each type of wetland management area will have a distinct management approach based on its contribution to wetlands conservation goals. Other important elements of this strategy include: (1) a philosophy for managing coastal wetlands, (2) a delineation of the proposed greenway, its distinct areas, and approaches proposed for their respective management, (3) an implementation framework and action plans, and (4) an example of conservation proposal for a section of the coastal wetlands conservation greenway in Changhua County in west-central Taiwan.

TI An indicator set to measure the progress in the implementation of
   integrated coastal zone management in Europe
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID FRAMEWORK
AB A new model indicator set to measure the progress in the implementation of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is described. The methodology that has been used recognises that the ICZM management cycle can be broken down into a series of discrete ranked actions. These actions show what is needed, using a straightforward, step-wise methodology, to pass from a situation where no ICZM is being used to one where it is being fully implemented, by being grouped into a series of five discrete ordered and continuous phases. The actions, 26 in total, are not completely exhaustive but are comprehensive enough to allow progress in ICZM to be measured. A comparative analysis can then be conducted by an assessment using semi-quantitative criteria.
   Set alongside indicators of sustainable development or state of the coast, this indicator set will also be a test of the hypothesis underpinning the EU ICZM Recommendation-that ICZM is a prerequisite for a more sustainable coast. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Legal tools for preserving France's natural heritage through integrated
   coastal zone management
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The coastal zone is an area of conflicting processes, reflecting its position at the interface between the terrestrial and marine environments. Thus, this area needs further study as its importance in our biosphere calls for rapid enforcement of a coordinated conservation policy for the implementation of effective protection. This paper assembles the elements of current politics that are involved with the preservation of our natural heritage in view of an integrated management of the coasts of mainland France. Current legislation applicable to the coastal zone natural heritage exists on three levels: international, European Community and French. An in-depth analysis of the different institutions involved in gathering knowledge and managing the coastal zone is presented. Equally important to the enforcing of laws concerning natural heritage preservation is the defining of protected zones under various conditions such as where sector perimeters meet or overlap. Similarly, numerous organizations and institutions involved with the natural coastal zone environment exist; in many cases, lack of experience hinders integrated and concerted management efforts. The notions of sustainable development and integrated management of the coastal zones propose alternatives to current legislation, using a global and integrated approach to coastal problem areas. Numerous laws may be applied to the coastal zone, but laws elaborated specifically for this area remain rare. Despite being a complex combination of numerous international, community and national directives, natural heritage protection is more known for its weaknesses than its strengths. The French State is still too centralized and does not seem to have adequately adapted its services to the process of decentralization. This last factor is one of the last hurdles left in the effective protection of the marine and coastal environment. The interaction of multiple intervention levels requires a clarification of the network of current expertise, leading to an eventual harmonization and institutional coordination that would take into account everyone who is linked to this coastal zone. A reform of the status of the "Conservatory of the Coastal Areas and Lakeshore" (Conservatoire des Espaces Littoraux et des Rivages Lacustres, CELRL) has been recently proposed (law no. 2002-276 of the 27 February 2002). It aims to increase the responsibility of this organism and lighten the burden on the public domain in its role as a key player in the protection of the natural coastal heritage. The objectives of this article on the French metropolitan coastline are four-fold: to present the principal legal laws and statutes concerning their conservation, to highlight the difficulties connected to the application of these laws, to analyze the diffuse administrative responsibility and the increasing efforts to encourage or enforce the preservation of certain particularly important sectors, and to evaluate the legal tools available for preserving the natural heritage via Integrated Coastal Zone Management.

TI Coastal water quality assessment in the Yucatan Peninsula: management
   implications
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID BAY; EUTROPHICATION
AB The coastal zone of Yucatan Peninsula has been recognized as the most important environment to the economic development of this region. Different projects have been conducted in this area, including harbors, tourist, commercial, and aquaculture infrastructure, among others. However, there is no information available on what are "normal" concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients (DIN) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) for these regions. In order to establish the base-lines of selected water quality parameters four coastal areas of the north of Yucatan Peninsula (SE, Mexico) a monitoring program has been conducted since 1999 in four localities of the north of Yucatan which show differences on the kind and intensity of anthropogenic impacts. The results show that Dzilam is the site with the best water quality conditions and a conservation program must be implemented, while Sisal and Progreso are the ports with the worst water quality and where different strategies must be implemented, such as water management of the shrimp farm effluents through constructed wetlands in Sisal, or water waste treatment and facilitation of water circulation in the Progreso port. Other results from phytoplankton community and submerged aquatic vegetation indicate that these components must be incorporated into water quality programs in order to effectively identify the problems and monitor the success of management strategies. These results can be used to understand the linkages between stressors from the activities and attributes of the water quality. A joint state-federal and academic effort to improve the conditions and increase the sustainability of the coastal zone is favored. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological sub-regions are a way of viewing coastal zone (CZ) regions that have been developed to enhance the capability of NGOs, governmental organizations, and academics to assess conditions and trends of the major ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf), mainly as a management tool for defining priority actions towards sustainable development. Major "geographical regions" at scale-1-level (1:40) are: (a) the warm-temperate Gulf, (b) the tropical Gulf, and (c) the Caribbean coast of Mexico related to the Gulf. At scale-3-level (1:5 million) in region "A," six distinct environmental sub-regions are defined: Western Florida Estuarine Area, Eastern Gulf Neritic, Mississippi Estuarine Area, Texas Estuarine Area, Laguna Madre Estuarine Area, and Western Gulf Neritic. In regions "B" and "C", 13 distinct environmental sub-regions are defined: Southeast Floridian Neritic, Florida Keys, Florida Bay, Shark River Estuarine Area, Dry Tortugas/Florida Keys Reef Tract, Southwest Floridian Neritic, Veracruzan Neritic, Tabascan Neritic, Campeche Yucatanean Inner Neritic, Campeche Yucatanean Outer Neritic, Contoyan Neritic, Cancunean Neritic, and SianKa'anean Neritic. From a "hydrological units" focus, five main sub-regions are defined: (a) The western Florida rivers and ground-water discharge system, (b) The Mississippi River basin and delta, (c) The Texas estuaries and Laguna Madre US-Mexico integrated by the Rio Bravo delta, (d) The Usumacinta/Grijalva River basin and delta, and (e) The Rio Hondo-Chetumal Bay in the Caribbean coast of Mexico. Each "geographical/hydrological" sub-region can be viewed as a discrete system which results from the interaction of geologic, geomorphologic, oceanographic, climatic, freshwater drainage, physical, chemical, coastal vegetation, wildlife, estuary-shelf interactions, and human factors. The ecosystem approach adopted as a management tool for environmental sub-regions is predicated on: (a) accepting that interactions between the environment (atmosphere, water, land, biota) and human activities (social, cultural, economics) are inseparable, (b) realizing that humans are the major driving forces behind most ecological change, (c) recognizing environmental thresholds and their importance and linkages to human activities, (d) incorporating the needs of current and future generations, and e) implementing a long-term perspective that is anticipatory, preventative, and sustainable. We suggest for each sub-region to develop key agenda-topics to strengthen ICM and answer questions on, e.g., (a) controls of primary production and water fertility in the coastal zone, (b) energetic pulsing as the basis for sustainable management, (c) vulnerability of the coastal zone to global climatic change, (d) coastal wetlands restoration, and (e) environmental sustainability and the economic development of the coastal zone.

TI Alternatives of reforesting oil shale opencasts in Estonia
SO OIL SHALE
LA English
DT Article
ID ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION; VEGETATION SUCCESSION
AB In Estonia, reforestation has been considered to be the most sustainable way of restoring the productivity of land damaged by oil shale mining. As distinct different results, three alternative ways of reforestation alternatives give different reforesting oil shale opencasts are compared: natural succession, and planting seedlings of either Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) or black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.)). For evaluation of these alternatives the emergy concept developed by Howard T. Odum was applied. This allowed estimating the environmental work and economic inputs required,for developing total aboveground plant biomass and stocks of commercial wood in 30 year-old forest stands. The cost of total biomass production was lowest in natural stands. Highest public benefit per dollar cost and per dollar value came from naturally recovered stands. Thus, unassisted natural succession causes the lightest load on the environment.

AB To achieve sharing and reuse for sustainable development, documents are semantically interrelated by ontologies, specified formally using the specification language CASL. The specification of properties for relations in the system's ontology is used to check invariant properties during change management. Documents are structured for fine-grained management of variants for essentially the "same" concept in various representations. This technology is self-applied to the "literate" development of consistent (interrelated packages of) documented ontologies.

AB This paper considers two of the key challenges facing a mature UK subject gateway (SOSIG): the sustainability of a labour-intensive service and innovation and evaluation needed to keep pace with user needs. SOSIG's history and changing contexts are sketched and issues of changing Internet search technologies, trends in user behaviour, and changes in higher education teaching or learning are analysed. Reflects on the "Google challenge" and the need to take a more strategic approach to engaging with the user community, given emerging audiences and technologies. Concludes with how SOSIG will be shaped for the future through collaboration, service design and user engagement.

TI A sociocultural analysis of organisational learning
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The concept of organisational learning has been widely debated and frequently contested by educationalists, but the specific processes and actions which constitute this form of learning have received relatively little research attention. This paper reports a three-year empirical investigation into organisational learning in a large industrial complex, with the aim of clarifying the practices of organisational learning and interpreting them within sociocultural learning theory. A sociocultural model is proposed which identifies dialogue as the fundamental process by which organisations learn, and relational practices as the social structure which embeds the dialogue and makes it sustainable in a potentially conflictual environment. Three relational practices are analysed in detail: opening space for the creation of shared meaning, reconstituting power relationships and providing cultural tools to mediate learning. A pedagogy of organisational learning is defined in terms of participation in these practices, either as the carrier of a practice or as the facilitator of participation by others. The theoretical requirement that adult learning must be autonomous is reconciled with the concept of collective learning in pursuit of organisational goals by rejecting the notion of an individually-contained self in favour of a relational concept of the self, in which autonomy is achieved by building relationships with others.

   Finland began work on its network of Natura sites in 1995, immediately after the country joined the EU. "We have a long tradition in nature conservation, and the Natura programme is basically a cross-section of what was already in place", says Heikki Korpelainen of the Ministry of the Environment. "The exemplary way in which Finland has established its Natura network also shows that we have acted to promote the interests of sustainable forestry", he continues. Finland's Natura sites cover a total area of almost five million hectares.

TI Implementing and using quality measures for children's health care:
   Perspectives on the state of the practice
SO PEDIATRICS

DT Article
DE child health care quality; quality measurement; quality improvement
AB Objective. The objective of this study was to identify issues, obstacles, and priorities related to implementing and using child health care quality measures from the perspectives of 4 groups: 1) funders of quality-measurement development and implementation; 2) developers of quality measures; 3) users of quality measures ( including Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, employer coalitions, and consumer groups); and 4) health plans and providers ( in their role as both subjects and users of quality measures).
   Methods. A series of semistructured interviews was conducted with -40 opinion leaders drawn from these 4 groups. The interviews were conducted by telephone between September and December of 2001. Major topic areas covered in the interviews were similar across the groups. Topic areas included 1) strategic vision and/or objectives for funding, developing, or using quality measures for children's health care; 2) a brief summary of the specific quality measures funded, developed, or used; 3) issues and challenges facing funders and developers of measures; 4) major successes achieved; 5) obstacles to implementation and use of measures; and 6) priority needs for future funding.
   Results. Leaders from all 4 groups acknowledge the importance of developing a robust set of quality measures that can serve multiple objectives and multiple audiences. Standardization of measures is viewed as a critical feature related to all objectives. An assessment of specific quality measures funded, developed, or used by strategic objective shows a high correlation between the uses intended by funders and developers and the actual applications of the various users. The most commonly cited measures across all groups are the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey and Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, followed by the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative and special topic studies to support quality-improvement applications ( eg, asthma, diabetes, etc).
   The major issues and challenges cited in common among funders and developers are 1) the lack of trained capacity in the field to conduct needed research and development, and 2) the difficulty in generating sustained interest and support among funders because of the complexity of quality-measurement issues, competing funding priorities in the face of limited funds available to allocate, and the lack of clear and compelling evidence that quality measurement and improvement actually result in better outcomes for children.
   The 3 most common successes cited across all 4 groups are 1) the growing consensus and collaboration among diverse stakeholder groups involved in measurement development and implementation; 2) the increasing collection and use of specific measures; and 3) early documentation of tangible results in terms of improved quality of care. Specific measurement tools cited as successes by funders and developers include the Medicaid Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey, the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative, and Rand QA Tools.
   The most important obstacle reported across all groups is the lack of a strong and compelling "business case" that clearly demonstrates the benefits of quality measurement relative to the costs of implementation. Strongly related to this barrier is the cost of implementing and using measures without a sustainable source of financing as well as the absence of strong public awareness and political support for children's health care quality measurement. Another major barrier cited is the lack of coordination among funders, which prevents the field from developing a unified approach to addressing the numerous technical, political, and administrative issues also cited at length by the leaders interviewed.
   The 5 top needs for future funding identified across all 4 groups follow directly from the major obstacles that they reported: 1) develop the business case for children's health care quality measurement and improvement based on rigorous cost-benefit analysis and documentation of quantifiable successes; 2) develop new measures to fill the gaps in critical areas ( including adolescent health care, behavioral health, and chronic conditions) that can be applied at the hospital and ambulatory care provider levels; 3) invest in building needed research capacity, a trained pool of users of quality measures, and the capacity among providers to understand and use quality-improvement methods and tools; 4) invest in developing an information infrastructure that will support the efficient collection and use of measures for multiple purposes, including clinical practice, quality measurement, and quality improvement; and 5) develop increased public awareness and support for quality measurement based on improved strategies for communicating with consumers, purchasers, providers, and policy makers.
   Conclusions. Several implications are suggested by these perspectives for the future direction of quality measurement in children's health care. First, to meet the funding needs identified, many funders must improve coordination to reduce the noise and fragmentation generated by numerous competing or redundant activities. Improved coordination among funders will help assure maximum impact and the efficient use of scarce resources. Second, the importance attached to standardization of measures by both users and developers may conflict at times with the need for innovation and flexibility. Child health quality leaders will need to manage this tension between standardization and innovation to maintain an appropriate balance between the benefits of both. Finally, many of the obstacles identified are not unique to children's health care. Child health quality leaders will need to determine to what extent their efforts to overcome these obstacles can be successfully undertaken independently as opposed to in concert with groups concerned about other populations and sectors in the health care system.

AB This paper offers a critical analysis of X-engineering - an approach to management, Accepted November which it is claimed refines and extends business process reengineering (BPR) to offer sustainable 2002 benefits to business and to the various communities, which constitute modern business organizations. Noting that academic critiques of guru theorising in general and academic critiques of BPR in particular have done little to exercise the minds of practitioners, the Paper offers two critical accounts of X-engineering. The first follows a familiar concern with the production of X-engineering as it seeks to debunk the ideas and concepts, which constitute this body of knowledge. The second offers an alternative account of guru theorising. which focuses upon the nature of managerial work and on the consumption of management knowledge as it attempts to develop a line of critique, which can reflect and yet intrude upon the complexities of managerial work. Building upon this analysis of the consumption of guru theorising, the paper seeks to provide counter-arguments and analysis for the constituencies, which can be expected to bear the brunt of X-engineering.

AB Plants cultivated on acid soils that contain toxic levels of Al3+ usually produce low yields. A multi-factorial treatment of gypsum (G), boron (B), and limestone (Lm) was applied to such soil in order to determine the biochemical basis of the best management plan for ameliorating the soil acidity for sustainable growth of alfalfa. The alfalfa shoots were subjected to analysis for hexose, protein, nucleotide, and chlorophyll (Chl) contents, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) activity, and the RNA synthetic activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Hexose and protein contents of control alfalfa without B and G, but with Lm (672 g m(-2)) amendment were 0.87 and 38.30 g, respectively, per kg shoot. Increasing the G doses at fixed moderate doses of 0.15 and 0.30 g m(-2) B decreased the FBPase activity by similar to53 and similar to31 %, respectively. However, increasing the B doses at higher fixed G (1 kg m(-2) = G(1.0)) increased the FBPase activity by similar to91 % thus indicating that G(1) optimized the saccharide metabolism by neutralizing the soil acidity. In the absence of B, increasing the G doses also maximized the hexose and Chl contents, but minimized the nucleotide amount. In the absence of G, increasing the B doses maximized the RNA synthetic activity of GDH, but lowered the hexose and Chl contents as well as the FBPase activity without affecting the protein contents, thereby permitting the selection of B (0.45 g m(-2)) with Lm as the best amendment for the sustainable growth of alfalfa. Treatment with 0.45 g B and 0.5 kg G (= G(0.5)) induced the strongest B-Ca antagonism by maximizing the hexose and Chl contents but severely suppressing the FBPase activity and the RNA synthetic activity of GDH. Therefore, the coordinate optimization of saccharide metabolism through the G-dependent neutralization of soil acidity, and of RNA metabolism through the B-dependent detoxification of Al3+ are the biochemical options for the mitigation of the adverse effects of soil acidity for the optimization of sustainable alfalfa production.

AB Irrigation with saline water could provide an interesting opportunity to meet increasing food demands without competing with other pressing needs for fresh water such as domestic and industrial water use in water scarce regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, saline groundwater could be a plentiful and under-utilised resource; however, there is a lack of data to confirm this assumption. Saline water is deliberately and successfully used for irrigation of field and garden crops in several countries. The water saving characteristics and the distribution patterns of water in the soil under drip irrigation make this water application technique suitable for use in combination with saline water. Low-cost drip irrigation has already been successfully implemented in sub-Saharan Africa. It is suggested that low-cost drip irrigation with saline groundwater for the cultivation of horticultural crops can be a feasible option under conditions of water shortage, and has the potential to contribute to improved and sustainable crop production for smallholder farmers.

AB The study was carried out at three sites in Communal Lands of Zimbabwe namely, Mudzi (Natural Region V), Gutu (Natural Region IV) and Chivi (Natural Region V). These areas have marginal rainfall in terms of quantities (below 500mm per year) and distribution with a normal rainfall year coming once in every five years. Four tillage treatments were experimented on in the three sites. These were tied ridges, infiltration pits, fanya juus and the conventional ploughing on the flat. The tillage treatments were paired at farm level for easy management considering that farmers were participating in the research trials. The conventional tillage technique was used as control.
   The objective of the study was to evaluate and recommend rainwater harvesting techniques that ensure effective capture and utilization of rainfall for sustainable crop production. This was achieved through monitoring residual moisture, after every rainfall shower, in the different tillage treatments. Monitoring of residual moisture was done, up to a depth of 30cm, using a theta-probe. Yields of maize from the different tillage treatments were determined. Farmers also carried out their own evaluation of the treatments at mid-season and at the end of the season. In addition the researchers tested dissemination techniques that ensured maximum adoption of rainwater harvesting techniques.
   Tied ridges were ranked best by both the stakeholders' evaluation and the theta (theta)-probe in retaining moisture compared to all the other treatments in the season under consideration. The farmers who practiced tied ridges realized yields of about 3t/ha compared to conventional tillage treatments whose yields were about 1.5t/ha. Yields were statistically significantly different for the different treatments.
   The recommendation was for the farmers to adopt the tied ridges in areas that receive marginal rainfall and experience mid-season droughts. Lead farmers should educate others on the advantages of the tillage treatments. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Smallholder irrigation globally can be recognised as a crucial common property resource for the sustenance of rural livelihoods in semi-arid regions. This is particularly true for Zimbabwe where 70% of the population is situated in rural areas characterised by low and unpredictable rainfall patterns. This paper looks at the performance of smallholder irrigation schemes based on a technical evaluation of field water management and crop performance. Field water management was assessed by looking at the application efficiency (E-a), tail water ratio (TWR), deep percolation ratio (DPR), requirement efficiency (E-r) and distribution uniformity (DU). Crop performance and productivity was evaluated by looking at weekly crop heights and the overall crop yield. The study was conducted on two irrigation schemes in Zimbabwe's dry region V in Manicaland province. The two schemes (Chakohwa and Gudyanga irrigation schemes) are surface schemes using the border irrigation gmethod. E-a of less than 30% was common at Chakohwa whilst that at Gudyanga ranged above 50% with the remainder being lost as deep percolation in most cases. The irrigation borders were dyked at the end resulting in ponding and excess water application at the ends. Generally farmers at Chakohwa irrigation scheme have an unpredictable irrigation rotation thus influencing them to hoard water (E-r = 100%) whenever their turn came. The high rotation frequency (7 days), low infiltration rates and short borders (80m) at Gudyanga irrigation scheme saw the farmers under applying in some cases (E-r < 100%). Over application was only done by those farmers with a poor suction head and poorly levelled borders. There were no significant differences between the yields obtained across the schemes though within Chakohwa, yields were generally high for farmers near the water source compared to those at the tail end.

AB Iron Duke Pyrite Mine lies in the Mazowe Valley of northern Zimbabwe. Several urban areas and commercial farmers are major water users in the catchment. Accordingly, managing the impact of mining operations on water quality in the Mazowe Valley must be a major priority for sustainable development in this area.
   The mine disposes of its waste water via evaporation ponds. Some of the water in the ponds evaporates and some is lost through seepage to groundwater. Results of a water budget analysis of the ponds showed that 160.5m(3) per day of acidic effluent with a pH of 2 and elevated levels of iron and sulphate was being lost through seepage.
   As the wastewater evaporates, the secondary minerals melanterite and hexahydrite precipitate. The solid material in the pond was found to contain 20% iron and 14% sulphate, which is far more than was found dissolved within the pond water. Despite this, the pond water is undersaturated with respect to both iron and sulphate. Acid generation tests on the solid material in the pond indicate a minimum of 540,000 mol and a maximum of 1,610,309 mol of acid are generated. The variation can be related to exposure to oxygen: material near the edges of the pond is more exposed to oxygen and has already reacted further than material from the centre of the pond; accordingly less acid can be generated. The acidity generated by the pond is due to the unreacted pyrite that is found in fine particles suspended in mine waters.
   Based on these results, between 20 and 60metric tonnes of lime are required for complete neutralisation of the sediments in the pond. Although the ponds were decommissioned after the conclusion of this study, it is necessary to prevent formation of further acid mine drainage from existing sediments in the evaporation pond. This could be done by the use of reactive covers, whose compositions affect the chemistry of infiltrating water. A good reactive cover could be constructed from lime, overlain by topsoil rich in organic material. This should be followed by revegetation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DRAINAGE
AB The Mazowe Valley contains several of Zimbabwe's largest current mining operations, is densely populated and is also a major agricultural area. The urban areas of Bindura, Goromonzi, Shamva, Marondera, Murehwa and Mutoko all draw water from within the Mazowe Valley. Irrigation of commercial crops is also a major water user. Accordingly, managing the impact of mining operations on water quality in the Mazowe Valley must be a major priority for sustainable development in this area. Madziwa Mine, 150km north-east of Harare, is a case in point. Mining took place between 1966 and 2001. The main sulphides were chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite and pyrite. Waste from the mine's plant has been disposed of via a tailings dam, the focus of this study.
   Surface water samples were collected at 12 sites around the slimes dam and groundwater samples were collected from six boreholes. The samples were analysed for dissolved metals using atomic absorption spectrometry and for anions using gravimetry and titration.
   The surface water chemical analyses showed that acidic effluent with high concentrations of iron, nickel and sulphate emanates from the tailinas dam. Concentrations of metals are lower after the water has passed through natural wetlands. Chemical analysis of groundwater showed similarly high levels of acidity, sulphate and metal. These findings show that acid mine drainage is seeping from the tailings dam.
   Efforts are being made to reduce the effects of the acid mine drainage. For surface seepage from the dumps these efforts include diverting acidic effluent from the dump into natural wetlands that neutralise the acidity. To reduce drainage into the groundwater efforts are being made to plant trees with high evaporation rates to minimise the amount of water that can cause acid mine drainage. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As a result of the rapid rate of urbanisation throughout Africa, many African cities face mounting challenges of providing their increasing populations with adequate and sustainable water services. Water demand management (WDM) offers a sustainable solution to water woes experienced in most cities in the southern Africa region. The region is characterised by frequent droughts, floods and erratic, unevenly distributed rainfall. Meanwhile nearly half of the southern Africa's 200 million inhabitants do not have access to safe water and sanitation. This paper makes an assessment of the status of WDM in eight cities in the region based on published data and reports. It provides a basis of benchmarking the progress and success in WDM programmes by using selected key performance indicators. Gross unaccounted-for-water (UAW) is used as a crude measure of WDM good practice. From the eight selected case studies. Windhoek, Bulawayo and Hermanus have achieved considerable success in water use efficiency, implementing WDM programmes and recording UAW values of less than 20%, whilst Johannesburg; Maputo; Maseru; Lusaka and Mutare cannot account for about 40-60% of the water introduced into the distribution system. WDM projects require some key performance indicators which need to be recorded systematically by water supply agencies to enable a consistent monitoring and evaluation of programme. Finally for WDM to succeed, a new breed of professionals with multi-disciplinary skills is required as well as training of operatives, i.e. technicians, plumbers and meter readers.

AB Water quality is an urgent problem in the Lake Chivero catchment, Zimbabwe, whilst water scarcity will be a problem soon. This study focused on assessing the potential impacts of the application of cleaner production principles in urban water supply and sanitation in the context of sustainable management of water resources. The cleaner production principles are explained together with how they can be applied to urban water management. Data from City of Harare and previous studies were collected and analysed. The study focused mainly on water, nitrogen and phosphorus. About 304,000m(3)/d of wastewater, containing 30,000kg/d TN and 3600kg/d TP are currently produced and treated at five sewage treatment works in Harare. Water conservation, treatment and reuse strategies were developed for different land uses starting from water-saving devices, regulation, leak detection and repair, to wastewater treatment and reuse. This study showed that the application of the cleaner production principles would reduce total wastewater production from 487,000m(3)/d to 379,000m(3)/d (a 27% reduction) based on year 2015 projections. A very large investment in treatment infrastructure can be postponed for about 10 years. In terms of amounts treated and discharged at central level this translates to reductions of 47% on flows, 34% on TN, and 44% on TP. River discharges can be eliminated. It was concluded that a cleaner production approach could substantially reduce current water pollution and long-term scarcity problems in Harare. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The recovery of costs in water utilities is a key element in sustainability of both the provider and of the water resource itself. This paper examines the role played by consumer awareness in their willingness to pay for water supply in two cities in Zambia. Research conducted in Kitwe and Lusaka reveals that level of awareness, willingness to pay and cost recovery all vary directly. Whereas awareness may increase consumers' willingness to pay, therefore assisting service provider's cost recovery, the research presented here also reveals that factors such as ability to pay, affordability of bills, quality of water and of the service provided, as well as good business-consumer relations are important factors affecting a utility's ability to recover its costs. If water utilities are to attain sustainability over the long-term, they will have to embark on and maintain consumer awareness programmes, raise the quality of service (e.g., through improved operation and maintenance), and develop and apply the right water tariff.

AB This paper investigates water availability and use in the Komati catchment. The Komati catchment is shared by Swaziland and South Africa and forms part of the Incomati basin, with Mozambique as the third riparian country. In 2002 the three countries reached agreement about how the scarce water should be allocated, based on the principle of equitable and sustainable utilization, as stipulated by the SADC Protocol. The Komati catchment has five main water uses: afforestation, irrigation, the environment, urban/industrial/mining (UIM), and interbasin water transfers (for industrial use). In addition, South Africa and Swaziland have committed themselves to satisfy a certain cross border flow to downstream Mozambique.
   Frequently, debate has arisen between users and riparian countries on the direction that water resources development has taken in the catchment. Downstream farmers have often complained about interbasin transfers taking place in the upstream portions of the catchment. There has also been animosity about effecting environmental flow releases.
   A relatively simple, spreadsheet-based water resources model (Waflex) was developed to analyse water availability and use under current and future scenarios. The results were then compared to results obtained from another model that was used in a joint study by Mozambique, South Africa and Swaziland. The Waflex model showed a high degree of consistency with the one used for comparison, especially in terms of trends. It was found that the recent completion of two new dams has improved water supply to irrigation in the two countries. Future water demands will result in appreciable shortages for irrigation and domestic use. The agreed maximum development levels will soon outstrip the ability of the catchment's supply.
   The paper shows that a combination of measures will be required to ensure equitable and sustainable water utilisation in the Komati catchment. These will have to be agreed by the riparian countries. Moreover, over the course of negotiations, important roles will have to be played by catchment management agencies and river boards in Swaziland and South Africa, as well as by the Tripartite Permanent Technical Committee of the three riparian countries.

AB This paper reviews available literature concerning water resources use in the Okavango River Basin (ORB). It describes a number of common arguments regarding possibilities for the emergence of violent conflict in and among Basin states, particularly those states party to the Okavango River Basin Commission (Okacom)-Angola, Botswana and Namibia. The paper presents data concerning present and future water demands and examines a number of formal, institutional steps taken by global and regional actors to facilitate sustainable development, natural resources management and peaceful cooperation in the Basin. Contrary to trends in much of the literature, the paper suggests that there is great scope for enhanced inter-state cooperation in the Basin. It argues that to achieve sustainable utilisation of water resources and avoid violent conflict in the ORB, an integrated management plan for the entire basin needs to be developed. In addition, each basin member-state should observe international and regional conventions and treaties governing the use of water resources when designing national water development projects that require the use of water from the ORB.

AB Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are now known to play important roles in human health. In particular, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5Delta(5,8,11,14,17); n-3: EPA) is implicated as a protective agent in a range of pathologies such as cardiovascular disease and Metabolic Syndrome (Syndrome X). Eicosapentaenoic acid is currently sourced from fish oils, the presence of this fatty acid being due to the dietary piscine consumption of EPA-synthesising micro-algae. The biosynthetic pathway of EPA has been elucidated, and contains several alternative metabolic routes. Progress in using "reverse engineering" to transgenically mobilize the trait(s) for EPA are considered. In particular, the prospect of producing this important polyunsaturated fatty acid in transgenic oilseeds is highlighted, as is the urgent need for a sustainable replacement for diminishing fish stocks.

AB Conversion of native savanna in Brazil, the Cerrado, to agri- and silvicultural land use causes changes in metal storages of the ecosystems. To evaluate the sustainability of land use these changes have to be known. Therefore, we examined the Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, and Zn storages in above- and belowground biomass, the organic layer, and the top 2 m of the mineral soil ( Anionic Acrustoxes) of three replicate plots in each of six native and land-use systems. The systems were native Cerrado, Pinus caribaea Morelet plantations, productive and degraded Brachiaria decumbens Stapf pastures, and conventional and no-tillage soybean cultivation. The total metal storage varied little among the studied systems except for Ca, K, and Mg. All land-use systems had larger Ca storages (cropping systems 202 - 205 g m(-2), productive pasture: 112, degraded pasture: 84, Pinus: 81) than the Cerrado (62 g m(-2)). The K storage was smaller in the pastures (17 - 18 g m(-2)) than in Cerrado and Pinus stands ( 22 - 24) and largest in the cropping systems (26). The Mg storages were largest in the cropping systems ( 65 - 69) and productive pasture (59 g m(-2)); those in the Pinus stands (52), the degraded pasture ( 51), and the Cerrado ( 53) were similar. For most metals, the aboveground biomass contained up to 1% of the total storage including the top 2 m of the soil (< 5% if the lower ecosystem boundary was set at 0.3 m soil depth). However, the aboveground biomass stored up to 12% of Ca, K, and Mg down to 2 m soil depth (41% if the lower ecosystem boundary was set at 0.3 m soil depth). In the Pinus stands, the storage of most metals was larger in the below-than in the aboveground biomass; for the other systems the reverse was true. Metal storages in soil were little affected by land use except that liming resulted in increased Ca and Mg storages in the topsoil. The comparison between known inputs of Ca, K, and Mg and mean annual change rates of their storages revealed that there were considerable base metal losses by leaching, grazing, and removal with the harvest. After 12 - 20 years, the land-use impact on metal storages is restricted to Ca, Mg, and K. Generally, all land-use systems tend to be richer in these nutrients except for the significant depletion in K of the pastures.

AB A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of growing salt tolerant plants to improve the physical characteristics of a saline-sodic soil. Kallar grass [Leptochloa fusca ( L.) Kunth], a species tolerant to salinity, sodicity and alkalinity, was irrigated for five years with poor quality ground water (EC = 0.14 S m(-1), SAR(adj) = 19.3, RSC = 9.7 meq L-1). The soil physical properties of plant available water, saturated hydraulic conductivity, structural stability, bulk density and porosity were determined at the end of each year. The growth of kallar grass for three years significantly improved the physical properties of the soil and these were maintained with further growth of grass up to five years. Kallar grass significantly increased plant available water with time (r= 0.97**). The available water was highly correlated ( r= 0.92**) with increases in soil organic matter content, porosity ( r= 0.99**) and other physical properties. Soil hydraulic conductivity increased substantially with time from 0.035 to 55.6 mm d(-1) in the topsoil (0 - 20 cm) in five years and was significantly correlated with porosity, water retention, structural stability and organic matter content of soil. The soil structural stability index improved significantly from 32 to 151 with kallar grass and showed greater increases in the surface soil than at depth. The cropping of kallar grass resulted in a linear increase of soil organic matter content ( r= 0.92**) which improved porosity and other soil physical properties (r less than or equal to 0.82*). This study confirmed that kallar grass is effective for rehabilitation and restoration of soil fertility in saline-sodic areas on a sustainable basis.

AB Recurrent anthropogenic and natural perturbations, resource limitations and heterogeneous environments contribute to the maintenance of a remarkable biodiversity in Mediterranean plant communities. Yet, the essential mechanisms of community assembly in these systems remain largely unexplored. In the current paper we investigate the coexistence of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) and Holm oak (Quercus ilex L.), two of the most widely distributed species in the Iberian Peninsula, in relation to gradients in water availability and disturbance. A spatial model of landscape forest dynamics was implemented, calibrated with experimental data, with stands at-ranged on a heterogeneous lattice and coupled by dispersal. It was found that pine population persistence in the landscape can be explained independently by a competition-colonization tradeoff (in mesic homogeneous environments) and by a tradeoff between shade and drought tolerance (in heterogeneous low disturbed environments). Both mechanisms reinforce mutually to maintain a shifting mosaic of both taxa, along disturbance and aridity gradients. This view is consistent with palynological, historical and forest inventory records. In turn, equilibrium theories of vegetation dynamics (phytosociological), that neglect the role of heterogeneity and disturbances may be inadequate for Mediterranean forests, and have been shown to result in mismanagement practices. We claim that biologically informed models of forest dynamics are desperately needed as diagnosis tools for sustainable forest management.

AB Tomato powdery mildew (Oidium lycopersicum) is a recently reported plant disease which has a world-wide spread. The establishment of resistant cultivars appears to be a sustainable way to control the disease and to decrease the requirement for artificial anti-fungal treatments.
   In this paper, we present the results of a research aimed at the identification of PCR-based markers Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA, (RAPD) and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism, (AFLP) linked to the ol-2 gene that confers resistance to powdery mildew. To this purpose. bulked segregant analysis was applied to an F-2 population segregating for the ol-2 gene and derived from the pair-cross between a powdery mildew resistant line of Lycopersicon esculentum var. cerasiforme and the susceptible cultivar Super Marmande. A single RAPD marker, 1500 bp in size and designated as OPU3(1500), was detected in the susceptible bulk. The OPU3(1500) was converted to a CAPS marker and the estimation of the distance between the markers and the ol-2 gene was performed by linkage analysis in the F2 population. An associated AFLP marker was identified by the evaluation of 26 primer combinations On the parents and bulk samples.
   Both the reliable localisation of the CAPS marker on the tomato map and the availability of two AFLPs could be used effectively for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of ol-2 in breeding programmes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Governance and sustainability: an investigation of the role of policy
   mediators in the European Union policy process
SO POLICY AND POLITICS
LA English
DT Article
DE governance; sustainability; integration; mediation
AB This article argues that changing governance modes in the European Union (EU), including territorial multi-level governance and the dispersion of decision-making authority in policy networks, along with the separation of functions at all governance levels, is often characterised by fragmentation in the policy process. This causes difficulties for policy makers in identifying and avoiding unintended ex post policy outcomes, including 'trade-offs' between economic, social and environmental objectives that, in the context of sustainability, are sub-optimal. A case study of the implementation of the EU Ozone Depleting Substances Regulation in the UK tests this hypothesis. It is then suggested that policy mediators have an important role to play in facilitating the effective coordination of policy formulation and implementation in a manner commensurate with broad sustainable development objectives.

AB This study analyzes the initial implementation of the Sustainable Slopes Program a voluntary environmental initiative established by the U.S. National Ski Areas Association in partnership with federal and state government agencies. Our findings indicate that participation of western ski areas in the Sustainable Slopes Program is related to institutional pressures in the form of enhanced federal oversight and higher state environmental demands exerted by state agencies, local environmental groups and public opinion. The analysis also suggests that, despite these institutional pressures, participant ski areas appear to be correlated with lower third-party environmental performance ratings. This behavior seems to reflect the lack of specific institutional mechanisms to prevent opportunism in the current design of the Sustainable Slopes Program. That is, the program does not involve specific environmental standards, lacks third-party oversight, and does not have sanctions for poor performance.

DE Caspian Sea; Iran; development; land degradation model (LDM); technology
AB One of the critical aspects which has been emphasized at UNCED conference is utilization of coastal areas and its issues. Considering the afore-mentioned critical problems, the coasts of the Caspian Sea are of particular importance. The Caspian Sea is located between five countries: Iran, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Russia and Kazakhstan. The area, with high and specific ecological capabilities, is very suitable to urban development. There is no doubt that development and industrialization might provide socio-economic welfare to the area-dependent inhabitants, but socio-environmental issues could be generated by improper application of technology and industry. As hurried development, without carrying-out environmental impact assessment in watersheds of the Caspian Sea, might impose adverse effects on the environmental quality of the water body, the present study intends to execute Land Degradation Model (LDM) and determination of ecological susceptibility of terrestrial ecosystems using the Object-Oriented Method in sub-watersheds of the water body.
   Since long-term environmental issues could not immediately be solved by technological approaches, understanding the relationship between development and environmental protection and consideration of environmental impact assessment (EIA) as an important planning tool in planning process, are being focused in order to achieve sustainable development.

AB Gradual narrowing of the gap between consumer and investment demand was one of major achievements of 2003, supporting the long-term sustainability of Czech economic growth. In the first half of 2004, industry and construction witnessed strong growth, retail trade showing a considerable slowdown. Growth in industry has continued to be more rapid in the sector of foreign controlled companies. After a slight weakening of deflation tendencies in the third quarter of 2003, last quarter of 2003 and first half of 2004 confirmed a resurgence of inflation. Growth of industrial prices was more rapid than the growth of consumer ones, predominantly due to increasing world prices of oil and metals. The labour market and public finance continue to be the main macroeconomic problems of the Czech Republic. The improvement may come only after adoption of fundamental reforms in both these areas.

AB Sustainable biotechnological production of polyhydroxyalkanoates from renewable resources is an alternative to chemical polyster production from mineral oils. The polymers produced are biodegradable, and due to their characteristics can be used for the production of packaging materials. Many different prokaryotic microorganisms are known to accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoates intercellularly under growth limiting conditions; some of them are able to produce copolyesters from precursors added to the production medium. Production normally is done in a fed-batch process, but PHA production kinetics suggest that continuous production in a chemostat might be favorable. After biomass separation the polyester is extracted from the biomass and refined.

DE environmental education; environmental awareness; solid waste management
AB This case study is a presentation of systematic development of an awareness and communication multimedia package in solid waste management that was produced for Egyptian technical secondary schools. Representative teachers were very much involved in the design and pretesting of the technical content of the package. They even suggested and influenced the format of the produced materials. The awareness and education materials, to be included in the package, were classified into four main sections:
   (a) Environmental concepts: basic definitions, environmental spheres, identification of the environmental systems,
   (b) Environmental issues: international, national, and local,
   (c) Solid waste management: sources of waste, life cycle analysis, recycling, technological aspects, environmental auditing, legislation for solid waste management, and
   (d) Case studies: including specific success stories on solid waste management in various parts of Egypt.
   The threading skeleton of this package was a set of 25 extra-curricula activities. These were specially designed to help clarify the environmental concepts, convey the messages for the environmental protection, and identify the required attitudes to help sustainable development. The multimedia package is composed of an activity book equipped by concept papers and fact sheets, a set of transparencies for overhead projector (or power point illustrations), a video film that stresses the economic and environmental benefits of recycling, and a compact disc that contains all the components of the package. It is interesting to note that while developing this package with the technical help of the Academy of Educational Development, the basic criteria for excellence in environmental education and communication were fully observed. The feedback from the pilot schools was collected to monitor the implementation and impact of this package. The package was adopted by the Ministry of Education and was distributed to technical secondary schools in Egypt.

AB This paper proposes a symposium on overpopulation, sustainable development, and security. These issues are usually treated separately by politicians and the public, but addressing them intelligently requires seeing the interconnections. Many scientists warn that growing human numbers and consumption are undermining the carrying capacity of the Earth. Unfortunately, their advice has not been heeded as it is perceived as being contrary to some prevailing economic and social interests. This symposium would draw together some of the leading minds on the population/ resource issue for the purpose of initiating a process to bridge the gap between scientific concerns and public policy.

   North West England
AB This paper reports an audit of Mental Health Trusts in North West England. The aim of the study was to investigate recruitment of community psychiatric nurses (CPNs), and to explore the experiences of the professionals trying to recruit nursing staff.
   A telephone survey was carried out in Autumn 2003 of five Mental Health (MH) Trusts in North West England. Telephone interviews with Human Resources staff and senior managers were set up although some conversations took place by E-mail. Content analysis of the notes of the telephone and e-mail conversations was carried out. It was hard to establish a true picture of nurse vacancies initially because it was difficult to find the appropriate person to speak to. It became apparent that recruitment and vacancies were recorded in terms of a person or post rather than hours. Managers admitted than posts were often filled with part-time staff. Using nursing hours as a measure of staffing levels rather than counting individuals gives a more accurate picture of staffing levels but such data was not available. In addition, it was reported that a post unfilled for more than three months stops being counted as a vacancy. It was reported that the amount being spent on temporary or "bank" nurses has increased sharply in the past five years, which strongly suggests that there are not currently enough permanent nurses in post. In addition, an increase in international recruitment was reported and managers reported that recruitment to CPN posts was often at the expense of inpatient units. This study confirms the perception amongst Mental Health Trust Managers of a shortage of Psychiatric Nurses. The paper describes the difficulties in obtaining accurate vacancy data, and the perceived difficulties in recruitment of nursing staff. We suggest that current arrangements of care for people with mental health problems delivered by CPNs may not be sustainable.

AB Information about land cover and land use is a very important component of the planning process as it can contribute to the debate on the current arrangements and patterns and the need to modify land use as part of a regional plan, a resource development or management project, an environmental planning exercise, or as a baseline study of a region. Planners may seek to suggest modifications to land-use patterns to achieve some social or economic outcomes, or as part of an environmental conservation or sustainability project, or to avoid some predicted future unwanted consequences. Access to accurate land-use maps can assist planners and the enterprise of planning. It is in this context that remote sensing is able to contribute. The purpose of this monograph is to present an overview and critique of the growing field of remote sensing as it applies to the mapping and monitoring of land-cover and land-use at a range of spatial and temporal scales. The ability of remote sensing to contribute to the mandate of planners and managers has changed significantly over the last decade. Satellite data are now available that can be used to map and monitor change from continental to local scales and over daily to weekly temporal scales. With the recent launch of satellites capable of collecting data that is comparable to aerial platforms, there is an enhanced capability of identifying change at small spatial scales. Similarly, advances in image processing, database management and spatial analysis tools have enhanced our ability to analyse these data for depicting land-cover and land-use change. Here, remote sensing technologies are described along with methods of analysing remote sensing data for detecting change at local, regional and continental scales. It is this diverse range of scales of observation and analysis that are now key to mapping and monitoring both anthropogenic and natural, and dramatic and incremental change. These aspects are demonstrated using case studies with different objectives and applied at different scales.

AB Both oxidative damage and inflammation are elevated in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, but their pathogenic significance remains unclear. The reduced AD risk associated with high intake of both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antioxidants; suggests causal roles, but clinical trials in AD patients have yielded only limited or negative results. To test the potential efficacy and mechanisms of candidate approaches, we have explored conventional and unconventional MAIDS, antioxidants, and combined NSAID/antioxidants in cell culture and animal models for AD (including aging APPsw transgenic mice and soluble A beta rodent infusion models). The conventional NSAID ibuprofen has the strongest epidemiological support. At sustainable doses designed to mimic protective consumption in the epidemiology, ibuprofen reduces amyloid accumulation but suppresses a surprisingly limited subset of inflammatory markers in APPsw transgenic mice. Both A beta production (APP, beta- and gamma-secretases) and post-production pathways (those affecting A beta aggregation or clearance: e.g., IL-1 or alpha 1ACT) are potentially involved in ibuprofen and other NSAID anti-AD activities. The post-production pathways are predictably shared with other seemingly protective NSAIDs, including naproxen that do not lower A beta 42 in vitro. Using clinically feasible dosing, brain levels of NSAIDs appear too low to implicate a number of pharmacological dose targets that have been demonstrated in vitro. Ibuprofen did not suppress microglial markers related to phagocytosis. The putative anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acid DHA had a profound impact on pathogenesis but did not lower inflammation, while vitamin E was surprisingly ineffective in reducing oxidative damage or amyloid in the aged APPsw mouse. In contrast, the unconventional NSAID/antioxidant curcumin was effective, lowering oxidative damage, cognitive deficits, synaptic marker loss, and amyloid deposition. Curcumin proved to be immunomodulatory, simultaneously inhibiting cytokine and microglial activation indices related to neurotoxicity, but increasing an index of phagocytosis. Curcumin directly targeted A beta and was also effective in other models, warranting further preclinical and clinical exploration.

AB This paper presents the methodology and the main results of a study that has as its principal aim, the experimental identification the application and the quantification of the sustainable indicator 'Percentage of the population exposed to acoustic pollution levels' in the 'Hospital' area of Turin. The investigation of this indicator was prompted by the province of Turin's previous categorisation as 'Lead City' in the project 'Towards a support description at local the level-European Community Indicators'. Alongside, the process of experimenting, applying and quantifying the sustainable indicator-and as a logical fit with what was foreseen by the Italian normative regulation on protection against environmental acoustic pollution-the study supplies the base elements to analyse the environmental acoustic climate conditions in an important area of the city and defines the interaction tools that are the environmental indicators for the town council's future Acoustic Restoration Plan (PRA).

AB The STRATEGY project (sustainable restoration and long-term management of contaminated rural, urban and industrial ecosystems; www.strategy-ec.org.uk) addressed the need for a holistic decision framework for the selection of optimal remediation strategies for long-term sustainable management of contaminated areas in Western Europe. The project considered both technical and social aspects of implementing restoration strategies for urban and rural environments. The importance of considering socially relevant objectives in addition to the dose reduction was emphasised. A critical evaluation was carried out on 101 selected countermeasures, (including rural waste disposal options), a model was developed to aid optimising countermeasure strategies and a method of carrying out participatory decision-making suggested. The outputs of the project are described and critically evaluated.

AB Nuclear and radiological emergencies may easily become severe international emergencies requiring substantial resources in several or many states for an adequate response, which in some cases may require resources exceeding national capabilities. Through the development of a consistent, coherent and sustainable joint programme for improved and more efficient international responses to nuclear and radiological emergencies, it is believed that we could achieve a better and more cost-effective response capability for nuclear and radiological emergencies. This requires, however, that we be willing and able to establish mechanisms of assistance where information and resources are globally shared and that standardised/harmonised procedures be developed and implemented. If we are willing to make this investment, we believe that, in the long term, there will be a significant benefit for all of us.

AB It is recognised that states, through the development of a consistent, coherent and sustainable joint programme for improved and more efficient international responses to nuclear and radiological emergencies, could achieve a better and more cost-effective response capability. Enhanced efforts by IAEA member states and the IAEA secretariat to improve the implementation of the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance in Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency have been initiated, establishing a national competent authority coordination group (NCACG) and a long-term action plan for the work.

TI A planning support system for rangeland allocation in Iran with case
   study of chadegan sub-region
SO RANGELAND JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE land evaluation; decision making; participatory planning
AB Overgrazing and untimely grazing are common on rangelands in Iran often because of land tenure ambiguities. For the same reason a considerable portion of the rangelands has been converted into farmland for rainfed cereal production. As a result, these rangelands are experiencing land degradation under the increasing pressure to support a growing population of people and livestock. Land tenure reform is perceived as one approach to improving the use and condition of Iranian rangelands. Changes in land tenure involve very complex decision-making that should lead to sustainable use of the land and contribute to the sustainable livelihood of present and future generations. This paper describes a planning support system developed for rangeland allocation in Iran to support the tenure-reform process. The system is composed of three modules: land evaluation module, district planning module and local planning module.
   The land evaluation module works in a GIS environment and uses the FAO methodology for land evaluation, with emphasis on biophysical characteristics of the land-use system. Socioeconomic factors in terms of the effect of human intervention on the current status of the land have also been taken into account. The district planning module comprises three sub-modules: planning sub-module, grazing sub-module, and a multi-criteria evaluation (NICE) sub-module. The planning sub-module is an optimisation model that examines the degree of realisation of various objectives of stakeholders and generates alternative solutions. For each alternative, the grazing capacity of the land is assessed (grazing sub-module). The MCE sub-module ranks the alternative solutions, taking into account their advantages and disadvantages. The outcome is a pattern of land use consistent with existing government policies and satisfying the needs and desires of the local population. The local planning module also comprises three sub-modules: land allocation sub-module, economically viable grazing enterprise sub-module, and a land improvement planning sub-module. The land allocation sub-module transforms the district land-use pattern into a local land-use plan. The economically viable grazing enterprise sub-module determines the appropriate size of the land holding for each household on each land-mapping unit. Finally, the land improvement planning sub-module provides information on the status and impact of the land improvement program.
   This planning support system has been applied to the Chadegan sub-region in Iran to illustrate its potential as a decision-making tool. Three scenarios were defined at district level, in addition to the status quo: maximum benefit for farm households; minimum government subsidies; and maximum land cover, emphasizing environmental goals. Results suggest that maximum land cover is the preferred scenario with the highest income and carrying capacity, and lowest level of subsidisation. However, since it eliminates wheat production, this scenario it culturally less attractive.

AB This article reports on factors that influence the sustainability of secondary transition innovations in local schools. We used a two-stage research process, which combined broad survey methods and an embedded case study design, to investigate the sustainability of a specific school-to-community transition model for youth with disabilities. We found that sustainability of comprehensive secondary transition innovations is increased when local programs (a) have the support of at least one key administrator, (b) produce positive student outcomes that are valued by school and community stakeholders, and (c) create a clear and unique role for their services that meets identified needs within the district. Program staff and administrators can increase the likelihood of these events occurring and of local programs being sustained. Implications for developing secondary transition innovations to support greater integration and sustainability in local schools are discussed.

TI Energy input-output analysis in Turkish agriculture
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
DE energy; input-output; energy ratio; agriculture; Turkey
AB The objective of this study is to determine the energy use in the Turkish agricultural sector for the period of 1975-2000. In the study, the inputs in the calculation of energy use in agriculture include both human and animal labor, machinery, electricity, diesel oil, fertilizers, seeds, and 36 agricultural commodities were included in the output total. Energy values were calculated by multiplying the amounts of inputs and outputs by their energy equivalents with the use of related conversion factors. The output-input ratio is determined by dividing the output value by the input value. The results indicated that total energy input increased from 17.4 GJ/ha in 1975 to 47.4 GJ/ha in the year 2000. Similarly, total output energy rose from 38.8 to 55.8 GJ/ha in the same period. As a consequence, the output input ratio was estimated to be 2.23 in 1975 and 1.18 in 2000. This result shows that there was a decrease in the output-input energy ratio. It indicates that the use of inputs in Turkish agricultural production was not accompanied by the same result in the final product. This can lead to problems associated with these inputs, such as global warming, nutrient loading and pesticide pollution. Therefore, there is a need to pursue a new policy to force producers to undertake energy efficient practices to establish sustainable production systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the development of university spinout companies (USOs). Employing a case-based research method, our study found that there are two important elements in their development. First, USOs go through a number of distinct phases of activity in their development. Each venture must pass through the previous phase in order to progress to the next one but each phase involves an iterative, non-linear process of development in which there may be a need to revisit some of the earlier decisions and activities. Second, at the interstices between the different phases of development we found that ventures face "critical junctures" in terms of the resources and capabilities they need to acquire to progress to the next phase. The different phases are critical as these ventures cannot develop into the next phase without overcoming each of the junctures. We identify four different critical junctures that spinout companies need to overcome if they are to succeed: opportunity recognition, entrepreneurial commitment, credibility and sustainability.

AB Energy has a major economical and political role as an important resource traded worldwide. Energy consumption in the developed countries has been more or less stabilized whereas in developing countries like India it is increasing at a high rate. The Government is looking forward to Biomethanation Technology (BT) as a secondary source of energy by utilizing industrial, agricultural and municipal wastes. A large amount of money is being invested in this direction with various projects under implementation and many to follow them. Hence the long-term sustainability of the technology needs to be judged. In this paper the prevailing situation is analyzed in keeping with the prospects and problems associated with BT in India. The paper discusses the technical feasibility, operational stability and commercial viability of BT in India. Various potential merits of BT like reduction in land requirement for disposal, preservation of environmental quality, etc. are also reviewed. A comparative study of researches related to the performance of various anaerobic digesters in different developed countries has been carried out wherein various fractions of municipal solid waste (MSW) have been utilized. To understand the technical feasibility in the Indian context, a comparison is made between the characteristics of Indian waste and the wastes under study. Further problems of the operational stability and commercial viability of BT in India have also been discussed. Against this background, developmental plans covering issues in the formulation of national policy, improvements in collection and transportation systems, marketing strategy, funds allocation, etc. have been outlined to establish BT in India. With the growing energy crisis supplemented by environmental concerns, BT can serve as a potential waste-to-energy generation alternative. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In an attempt to construct a new agenda for waste management, this paper explores the complex relationship between definitions of waste and their subsequent impact on its ownership and management. A range of internationally accepted definitions for waste are analysed and it is concluded that they are inadequate in scope in an attempt to describe waste. The philosophical ramifications inherent in such definitions mean that they are not capable of constructing a system that by its very nature results in a sustainable waste management system. This paper explores the concept of waste and a new waste taxonomy is proposed, based on the reason for waste creation, this has profound implications for ownership which in itself often dictates which waste management options are preferentially adopted by a given community. The role of legislation in producing monitoring systems for the transfer of ownership as well as abandonment of ownership is analysed. The new agenda for waste management focuses upon the development of more appropriate, sustainable definitions so that what is now commonly perceived as being waste will in fact be increasingly seen as resource-rich, 'non-waste'. To avoid obstacles to resource conservation due to materials being considered waste, a definition for non-waste is introduced. Finally, a new definition for waste management is proposed, one that has profound implications for the introduction of a more sustainable waste practice. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SOIL STRENGTH; COMPACTION; DENSITY; LOAM
AB Shear soil strength is an important dynamic property of the soil, as well as the state of soil consistence concerning the structure behavior of agricultural soils, which are mostly being ignored in research into the influence of use and management. This fact has been contributing to the perennial problem of fallacious strategies, causing degradation of the physical and mechanical soil properties. This study aimed at an evaluation of the shear soil strength of a dystrophic Red Latosol submitted to conventional tillage, direct seeding, and Cerrado, as control treatment, with different water contents: 0.05; 0.16, 0.18, and 0.38 kg kg(-1). Results allowed the conclusion that the shear strength of the soil, appraised at a depth of 0-0.05 m of a dystrophic Red Latosol, was affected by water content increases, use and management type. In general, the adjusted equations according to the Coulomb model evidenced greater shear strength in the Cerrado, followed by conventional tillage, and direct seeding. The lowest shear strength of the studied soil, corroborated by the smallest internal friction angle (tg phi) and larger apparent cohesion (c), specifically for the water content 0.16 and 0.27 kg kg(-1) (contemplating, therefore, the friable range of the soil), pointed to direct seeding as the management with the greatest possibilities of preserving the structural sustainability of the soil studied. The prediction of shear tension proved to be sensitive to the effects of soil water variations and the use type. This enables significant contributions, particularly to studies on the structural sustainability of agricultural soils, which are usually impaired by inadequate traffic and tillage operations.

AB The use of storm water presents a wide range of benefits to achieve a sustainable management of the resource. The accumulation of water during sporadic rain events in zones with and climates for its subsequent recovery and utilization is not usual in Latin America. lit other regions with similar climatic conditions, for example Australia and the Southwest of the United States, the storm water runoff of urban areas is frequently recovered for use. Nevertheless, storm water is considered a possible contamination source for subterranean and superficial water bodies. Depending on the urbanization of the area, the surface water runoff presents site specific characteristics. Nevertheless, the major contaminant in the runoff consists in particulate material. Giving a well sufficient retention time, 80-85% of the particulate material will be able to settle. Giving the hydraulic characteristics of common retention structures, the occurring sedimentation process is of Type I, where the sedimentation velocity depends on the diameter y density of the particle. Due to the variable size and density of particles in storm waters, the mean sedimentation velocity can only be estimated if the size distributions of the particles is known. The data regarding suspended particles and its removal suggest that the sedimentation velocities are directly, proportional to the level of urbanization of the studied sites. Additionally, it is shown that a lesser content of suspended solids and higher sedimentation velocities correlate with the increase in urbanization. This could indicate that the particles in urbanized areas present a higher density, which could cause partial precipitation in the case of low turbulences in the runoff. The sedimentation velocities based on time steps (g/m(3)/min) indicate high sedimentation rates at the beginning for the samples taken in Cd. Juarez following a significant decrease at 32 and 128 minutes for the sites PEMEX and MORELIA, respectively In the other sites, the measured precipitation velocities are low, which indicates the presence of particles of low density, which have to be treated with an agent to initiate the precipitation of the suspended solids.

AB The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of France requested CIRAD to coordinate a study of contemporary trends in management of protected areas and their living resources in order to develop a new strategy for sustainability and international cooperation(2).
   The foundations of the strategy are based on a renewed vision for protected areas, which are destined to serve as sites vital to the implementation of policies for sustainable development. These policies simultaneously address challenges to protect the environment, fight against poverty, and promote social justice. The study concludes that the concept of "protected areas" remains valid. Support to these areas has frequently had limited results in improving their management and dealing creatively with new and different actors in this field. Another perspective is emerging that joins the objectives of conservation of biological diversity and sustainable development within an integrated approach to regional land-use ("amenagement du territoire" in French). The justification for such areas is thus no longer uniquely focused on the protection of wild species or threatened landscapes. In order to succeed, protected areas management must be implemented over the long term and at different biological scales, ranging from the circulation and distribution of genes to the influence of human and climatic factors on landscapes. The scales also vary, moving from the local to the global. Unfortunately, international support is generally allocated from a short or mid-term perspective. A viable strategy must incorporate such support into a much wider vision adapted to the intrinsic environmental and social characteristics of protected areas and their peripheries.

AB The Cul-de-sac du Marin, with its 11 km(2) surface area, is the largest indentation along Martinique's southern coast. Bordered to the North by Pointe Borgnesse and to the South by Pointe Marin, this haven was formerly a real plant and wildlife sanctuary. By the end of the 1970s, and especially in the beginning of the 1980s, the creation of an irrigated perimeter enabled the development of market gardening on the adjacent watersheds; since these are quite steep, fragile and scarcely covered with vegetation, the kinetic energy of the raindrops had a direct effect on them. Substantial volumes of sediment were transferred from the watersheds towards the coast. Such considerable volumes of sediment consist mainly of granuliferous and mineralogical clay, and for the most part, gather along the coastal fringe. Based on diachronic charting as well as on satellite imagery, accretion of the coastal outline has been estimated at 15 m, which corresponds to an increase of approximately 25 hectares. Despite heavy silting, this cul-de-sac is particularly polluted since readings reveal the presence of cadmium, copper and lead. Although these metals are present in the natural environment, the measured rates in the cul-de-sac greatly surpass traditionally admitted standards. The impact of the anthropogenic factor on land is all the more harmful on the marine environment since it is sustainable and highly polluting for the trophic chain.

ID PTEROCARPUS-OFFICINALIS; NODULATION
AB In Guadeloupe, traditional taro monoculture (Colocasia escidenta) is conducted under partial, natural shade in the Pterocarpus swamp forest. The impact of this original agroforestry practice on forest structure, soil and flora was investigated on inventory plots totalling 4006 m(2) within the MAB reserve, in the Bay of the Grand Cul-de-sac Marin. Taro cultivation was responsible for important qualitative and quantitative changes of vegetation and, to a lesser extent, soil characteristics. Stem density decreased by 80%, and a number of weeds invaded cultivated stands while several shade-tolerant understorey species were eliminated. However. such disturbances were confined to the landward forest edge, and forest recovery appeared to be efficient on formerly cultivated stands. Regarding the development of conservation strategies applicable to the Pterocarpits swamp forest, and providing that complementary studies on especially endangered species be conducted, we believe that this sustainable agroforestry system could be a useful tool in the building of effective "buffer zones".

AB The fish communities of the seagrass beds of Thalassia testudinum were studied in the bay of Fort-de-France (Martinique) and the lagoon of the Grand Cul-de-sac Maria (Guadeloupe) over a period of two years. Fishes were collected using a seine net in two stations in Martinique and three stations in Guadeloupe. These stations were located near the coastal mangroves and seawards. An overall total of 88 species of fishes was collected in both islands, respectively 64 species in Martinique and 77 species in Guadeloupe. Furthermore, fish abundance was found to be greater in Guadeloupe than in Martinique (2.6 times for number of individuals and about 1.7 for biomass). Correspondence and cluster analyses revealed a different fish community structure in the two types of seagrass beds in both islands: one assemblage is settled near mangroves and another one in the seaward seagrass beds. In number of species, fish abundance and biomass, the fish community was richer near the coast than seawards. In the two types of seagrass fish community, juveniles characterized the majority of the species, including those of commercial interest. These latter represent an important part of the community with higher proportions near mangrove areas (75.5% in numbers and 69.3% in biomass) than seawards (41.6% in numbers and 43.3% in biomass). These results confirm the role of nursery played by Thalassia testudinum beds in the West Indies and show the necessity to protect that habitat for a sustainable management of resources for coastal fisheries.

AB A theoretical, representative-agent economy with a depletable resource stock, polluting emissions and productive capital is used to contrast environmental policy, which internalises externalised environmental values, with sustainability policy, which achieves some form of intergenerational equity. The obvious environmental policy comprises an emissions tax and a resource stock subsidy, each equal to the respective external cost or benefit. Sustainability policy comprises an incentive affecting the choice between consumption and investment, and can be a consumption tax, capital subsidy or investment subsidy, or a combination thereof. Environmental policy can reduce the strength of the sustainability policy needed. More specialised results are derived in a small open economy with no environmental effects on utility.

AB A framework is developed for analyzing national income accounting using a revealed welfare approach that is sufficiently general to cover, both the standard discounted utilitarian and maximin criteria as special cases. We show that the basic welfare properties of comprehensive national income accounting, previously ascribed only to the discounted utilitarian case, extend to this more general framework. In particular, under a wider range of circumstances, it holds that real NNP growth (or, equivalently, a positive value of net investments) indicates welfare improvement. We illustrate the applicability of our approach in the Dasgupta-Heal-Solow model of capital accumulation and resource depletion.

AB The GIS (Geographic Information System) Central Europe, in support of the Alpine-Balkan-Carpathian-Dinarides (ABCD) GEODE Project, is composed of spatially referenced geographical, geological, geophysical, geochemical and mineral deposit thematic layers, and their respective attribute data. It has been created to establish insights in the region's mineral potential and its past and future mining activities, and to determine parameter combinations that control the spatial-temporal distribution of the ore deposits. To contribute to the sustainability of the mining industry, environmental data are also integrated in the information system, allowing a regional scale risk assessment for old and new mining projects.
   The data analysis and synthesis, required to arrive at the different thematic layers, already highlight parameters that may be tentatively linked to ore deposit formation and localization. The assessment and compilation of heat flow data show a large anomalous area of high heat flow, located within the Pannonian basin, adjacent to the east Carpathians with anomalously low heat flow values. Such high contrasts in the thermal regime in the crust may play a role in the ore genesis. The compilation of multisource gravity information has returned enhanced gravity maps, Bouguer and isostatic anomalies, gravity gradients and gravity discontinuities. Linked in with the earthquake epicenter distribution, these layers contribute to a better understanding of the crustal structure, regionally with the topo-isostatic anomaly map and more locally with the vertical gradient anomaly map. The present-day structure of the crust, completed by the structure of the lithosphere, e.g. with the 3-D seismic tomography visualization, allows to verify the region's geodynamic evolution. The 3-D visualization (and the correlation with the heat flow thematic layer) reconfirms the preferred positioning of Neogene (Au) deposits above shallow low velocity bodies. The visualization also suggests that (subducted) lithosphere underlying these low velocity bodies obstructs the emplacement of the deposits (e.g. Aegean arc and mainland Greece), unless this subducted lithosphere has been positioned at/around the 660 km discontinuity (Rhodope and Apuseni regions). Geodynamically this observation can be explained by the insufficient influx of asthenospheric heat in the narrow mantle wedges above shallow subducted lithosphere. In relation to the geodynamic setting certain ore deposit types mark the tectono-magmatic evolution of the Tethys and the Carpatho-Balkan arc. Oceanic type mineralizations (chromite, Cu massive sulphides) formed during the oceanic rifting from Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous, and hydrothermal-porphyry types (base- and precious-metal mineralizations) formed during two major stages, during the Cretaceous to Paleogene, and subsequently during the Neogene.
   Linked in with information on materials processing (waste production and management, toxicity information), land use, infrastructure in/around mining districts, and other socio-economic information help the GIS to evolve towards a modern tool for the sustainable management of mineral resources in southeastern Europe.

AB The tremendous social and political changes that culminated in the Soviet Union's dissolution had a great impact on the Russian science community. Due to the Russian transformation to a market economy a new model of R&D emerged on the basis of the higher education system (R&D in universities). This paper is part of a project, the main goals of which were to analyse the impact of competitive funding on R&D in provincial universities, the distribution of funding by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research, and the level of cross-sectoral and international collaboration. This paper gives a descriptive overview of R&D conducted at the 380 provincial universities, looking at 9,800 applications, 1,950 research projects, 19,981 individuals, and more than 29,600 publications for the period 1996-2001. Our data demonstrated a positive tendency in demographic statistics in the provinces. A map of intra-national collaboration taking place in 1995 2002 in provincial universities situated in different economic regions was designed. Our data show a strong collaboration within the regions, which is an important factor of sustainability. Publication output grew by a factor two or two-and half in six years. The share in output on mathematics was the highest at about 45%, physics and chemistry had equal shares of about 20% each. Researchers from the Ural and Povolzh'e regions were more active in knowledge dissemination than their colleagues from the other nine economic-geographic regions. Bibliometric analysis of more than 1,450 international collaborative publications for 1999 2001 demonstrated a strong shift in collaboration partners from Former East Block and former USSR countries to Western Europe, USA and Japan. Among the regions, Povolzh'e, Ural, Volgo-Vyatsky and Central Chemozem'e demonstrated a stronger tendency to collaborate. This collaboration depends heavily on financial support from foreign countries.

AB The coastline of Scotland is extremely long and varied. It comprises most of the major types of coastal environment and includes machair, a sand dune system that is unique to the western seaboard of the British Isles. Such variety has its roots in the geology and sea level inheritance of Scotland and demonstrates that long-term processes still exert a profound influence on coastal form and functioning. Understanding how these processes affect the coast and influence such diversity is essential to efficient coastal management, although it is also imperative that the vision, strategy and political will to deliver such management are also in place.

TI Contesting land, creating community, in the Highlands and Islands,

SO SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE land; community; crofting; identity; Scotland
AB This paper draws on research in four communities in the Highlands and Islands, Scotland, to explore how the notion of community and community identity are re-worked in the political spaces created as communities claim collective rights to land. In the cases of the Assynt Crofters' Trust, the Bhaltos Community Trust, and Laid, this has concerned land under crofting tenure; in the case of the claim of the North Sutherland Community Forestry Trust, the land on which the Naver Forests stand is the responsibility of the Scottish Ministers and is managed by Forest Enterprise. The four case studies differ with respect to membership and institutional practices and thus provide fertile ground on which to examine, comparatively, collective struggles for the land and the search for sustainable futures.

TI Readiness for modal shift in Scotland
SO SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper examines the readiness for modal shift in Scotland from car use to more sustainable modes of transport. National statistics show the scale of car ownership and the extent of car use in Scotland. Findings from a number of recent studies are used to place car use in the context of other transport mode use, to examine reasons for non-use of the car or avoiding driving, to distinguish between those car users unable and those unwilling to reduce their car use, and to assess the likely impact on car users of policy measures to encourage modal shift. It is concluded that there is readiness for modal shift amongst substantial segments of car users in Scotland.

TI Travel choices? The Central Scotland Transport Corridor Studies
SO SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB The Central Scotland Transport Corridor Studies (CSTCSs) were announced in 2001 to investigate means of addressing problems of congestion along the A8, A80 and M74. The studies were to be undertaken on the principle of the English multi modal studies, wherein the search for 'solutions' to traffic congestion problems involved considering a range of modal options on an equal footing. This paper reviews the outcome of the multi modal studies and, against this background, analyses the decisions arising from the CSTCSs. It suggests that, although the amount of funding to be spent on road schemes - around 76% of the total budget - is undoubtedly high, the Scottish Executive's decisions should probably receive a cautious welcome, even in the context of the 'sustainable' transport agenda set out by UK ministers shortly after Labour's election to power in 1997.

TI Transport and tourism: Some policy issues
SO SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE tourism; transport; policy; Scotland
AB This paper seeks briefly to explore some of the major policy issues relating to tourism-related transport in Scotland, with particular reference to stated policy objectives of sustainability. Sustainability issues are often in the forefront of academic, and to some extent public, discussion, in both the transport and tourism policy arenas. Yet only limited synergy or complementarity seems to have been achieved between the transport and tourism debates on such issues of common concern as the impacts of transport externality costs borne by host populations and environments in tourism destination areas.

TI 100-seed test for desiccation tolerance and germination: a case study on
   eight tropical palm species
SO SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SEED; SURVIVAL; EMBRYO
AB A test was devised for seed desiccation tolerance, the crucial first step in the ex situ preservation of germplasm and its sustainable use. Its unique attribute is the maximum characterisation of seed lots using the minimum number of seeds. Data recorded includes seed dimensions, fresh and dry weight, moisture content, relative humidity. germination total and rate in one environment before and after desiccation with silica gel. Seeds of eight tropical palms from the genera Phoenix and Syagrus were studied. Six were found to be desiccation tolerant, a trait that matched closely the natural habitat of the species; two species, Phoenix roebelenii and Syagrus schizophylla, are provisionally classified as having desiccation sensitive, Type II or III seeds. In general, germination was observed to be rapid, being complete in one to two months. Two species exhibited an increase in germination during short-term (weeks) moist storage, probably indicative of a progression in embryo development. The results show that the 100-seed test can be used as an efficient and effective first screen for potential storage of seeds from diverse species and can support the rapid production of seed biology checklists for species conservation and sustainable use.

AB We measured nutrient distribution of Picea likiangensis (Franchet) E. Pritzel var. balfouriana trees growing in a plantation by field investigations, sample tree and plot harvest in West Sichuan, Southwest China. Based on the results in this study, the total biomass of plant compartments in plantation ecosystem was 114829.1 kg ha(-1). Tree, shrub, herb, bryophyte and litter layers accounted for 93.9%, 0.9%, 0.02%, 0.04%, 5.2%, respectively. The total biomass of tree layers was 107 817.1 kg ha(-1). Needles, branches, stem wood, stem bark and roots accounted for 13.2%,19.7%, 42.3%, 10.0% and 14.8%, respectively. The concentration of the nutrients was generally highest in the actively growing parts of the trees (e.g. needles) and lowest in the structural and not actively growing parts (e.g. stem wood). On the other hand, the concentrations of N, P, K and Mg were generally higher in the current year needles and branches than in the older needles and branches. These nutrient concentrations were also higher in the upper stem wood and bark than in the lower stem wood and bark, and in small roots than in large roots, whereas the opposite patterns were observed for the concentration of Ca in these compartments. The results will be helpful in understanding the nutrient behavior in a highly productive forest plantation and thereby providing decisive information for their sustainable management.

AB The objective of this paper is to discuss approaches and issues related to modelling stand dynamics for multi-cohort forest management in eastern Canadian boreal forests. In these forests, the interval between wildfires can be rather long, and the development of natural forest stands may include the establishment, growth and mortality of several cohorts of trees. Later cohorts are characterised by increasing structural complexity, including spatial heterogeneity and irregular tree size distribution. A multi-cohort forest management framework has been proposed to maintain this complexity, and associated biodiversity, on the landscape. Multi-cohort forest management planning requires forecasts of the development of stands with complex structure in response to silvicultural treatment and to natural disturbance, but current stand dynamics models in the region are applicable mainly to even-aged mono-specific stands. Possible modelling approaches for complex stands include i) the adaptation of current whole-stand growth and yield models, ii) distance-independent, empirically-derived individual-tree models, such as the USDA Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator, and iii) distance-dependent, empirically-derived or process-oriented individual-tree models. We conclude that individual-tree models are needed because observational data for fitting whole-stand models are not available for the full array of silvicultural treatments and natural disturbances encompassed by multi-cohort forest management. Predictive accuracy is a concern with individual-tree models, and the incorporation of coarse-scale constraints into these models is a promising means to control error.

AB Loss of life and property from earthquakes is extensive and continues to grow in developing societies. On the other hand culture and social change have become key concepts in studies of mitigation of both natural and human-made disasters. The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the impact of knowledge in terms of risk information on what people have thought and done to be prepared for the next probable earthquakes in both the USA and Turkey. In this cross-cultural comparative study, similar data to those from the Mileti's Bay Area study (1995) have been collected and analyzed. The present study revealed that for risks, knowledge alone is not sufficient and societal factors - along with the urgent need for cultural change in accordance with sustainable development - should be taken into consideration.

AB Different types of forest management systems in the study area are analyzed, followed by an assessment of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) use systems and collection practices under the government and community-managed systems, and their implications for the status of forests and NTFPs. Confronted with severe poverty arising from small landholdings and scarce nonfarming employment opportunities, villagers in the upper portion of the watershed have benefited considerably from the income derived from NTFPs. Findings indicate that various components of a common forest resource can be managed differently and undergo degradation at different rates. NTFPs are undergoing degradation more seriously than timber under both government and community forest management systems. However, NTFP degradation is more serious in government forests than in community forests. Such degradation is due primarily to a lack of proper institutional arrangements, including the lack of a comprehensive government policy framework for sustainable use and management of NTFPs.

AB Corn (Zea mays L.) stover is a potential biofuel; however, removing this stover from the land may increase the risk of erosion and reduce soil organic matter (SOM). Land application of corn stover fermentation by-product, which is about 70% lignin, may reduce the environmental risk from biofuel harvest by helping to stabilize soil structure. A column study, with soil collected from a toeslope (noneroded, Svea; fine loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Hapludoll) and a shoulder slope (severely eroded, Langhei; fine loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Eutrudepts) was conducted to evaluate the effect of fermentation by-product on soil properties. Soil was either not amended (control) or amended with corn stover or by-product at 0.75, 3.0, and 6.1 g kg(-1). Soils were incubated for 123 d at ambient temperature in a laboratory, with an initial water-filled pore space (WFPS) of 0.6 m(3) m(-3) and drying cycles to 0.35 m(3) m(-3) WFPS. Compared with the control, amending soil with 6.1 g by-product kg(-1) increased CO2 flux by 68% and increased soluble C and microbial biomass C by about 20%. In the severely eroded soil, humic acid concentration (r(2) = 0.97,p = 0.009) and aggregate stability (r(2) = 0.98, p = 0.005) increased linearly with increased by-product concentration. Water-holding capacity, bulk density, and aggregate distribution were not changed by soil amendments. Careful management of stover removal (avoiding eroded or erosion prone areas) and selective placement and rates of the by-product will contribute to a sustainable use of corn stover for ethanol production.

AB Soil C dynamics are not only important to both productivity and sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems, but also contribute significantly to global C cycling. Adjacent natural forest (NF), and first (IR) and second rotation (2R) hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Aiton ex A. Cunn.) plantations in southeast Queensland, Australia, were selected to investigate the effects of conversion of NF to hoop pine plantations and forest management (harvesting and site preparation of plantation) on the size and the nature of C pools in surface (0-10 cm) soils using chemical extraction, laboratory incubation and C-13 cross-polarization with magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (C-13 CPMAS NMR). Conversion from NIT to hoop pine plantations not only led to the reduction of soil total C (by 19.8%), water-soluble organic C (WSOC) (by 17.7%), CaCl2-extractable organic C (by 38.8%), and hot water-extractable organic C (HWEOC) (by 30.9%) and bioavailability of soil C (as determined by CO2 evolved in the incubation), but also to a change in chemical composition of soil C with lower O-alkyl C and higher alkyl C under the 1R plantation compared with NF. Harvesting and site preparation did not significantly affect total soil C and most labile C pools (except for a decrease in WSOC), but led to a lower signal intensity in the alkyl C spectral region and a decreased alkyl C/O-alkyl C (A/O-A) ratio in the soil under the 2R compared with the 1R plantation. The shifts in the amount and nature of soil C following forest conversion may be attributed to changes in litter inputs, microbial diversity and activity, and the disturbance of soil during harvesting and site preparation.

AB in the discussion of environmental architecture, we are conjoining two disciplines, the subject of architecture and that of ecology. At their best, green buildings are examples of applied ecology, where designers understand the constitution, organization, and structure of ecosystems, and the impacts of architecture are considered from an environmental perspective. By utilizing the concepts, methods, and language of ecology, designers can create architecture that intentionally engages the natural systems of a site.
   The establishment of assessment criteria implies the definition of building design criteria. If we establish criteria that are based on our best scientific understanding of environmental capacity, we will begin to develop a building stock that is sustainable. To do this we must quantify the link between the resulting environmental impacts and their cause in building production and use. This is not done in traditional building environmental impact assessment methods, which are based on quantifying assumed negative impacts of man-made interventions on the natural environment, typically using a code compliant reference building as a standard to improve upon. These indexes lack an ecologically derived baseline, or standard of measure, under which sustainable developments can be analyzed and compared on a universal basis.
   An ecologically derived baseline can be used to measure negative impacts as well as positive impacts of buildings. It also allows vastly different project types, sizes and locations to be compared on an equal basis. This study extends the concept of ecological capacity into an architectural context, and develops carrying capacity as a time and area dependent tool to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental building design. The ecosystem services criteria study uses an objective metric of carrying capacity as an ecologically derived baseline (hectare/years) to assess building sustainability. The farmhouse, a low energy, biological material based building located in Boulder, Colorado is evaluated to show the application of this method. The relative ecological impact of energy and materials for this project is described, as well as identification of effective strategies for reducing environmental impacts of typical buildings.

AB The photovoltaic market is booming with over 30% per annum compounded growth over the last five years. The government-subsidised urban-residential use of photovoltaics, particularly in Germany and Japan, is driving this sustained growth. Most of the solar cells being supplied to this market are 'first generation' devices based on crystalline or multi-crystalline silicon wafers. 'Second generation' thin-film solar cells based on amorphous silicon/hydrogen alloys or polycrystalline compound semiconductors are starting to appear on the market in increasing volume. Australian contributions in this area are the thin-film polycrystalline silicon-on-glass technology developed by Pacific Solar and the dye sensitised nanocrystalline titanium cells developed by Sustainable Technologies International. In these thin-film approaches, the major material cost component is usually the glass sheet onto which the film is deposited. After reviewing the present state of development of both cell and application technologies, the likely future development of photovoltaics is outlined. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB "We recognize the importance of renewable energy for sustainable development, diversification of energy supply, and preservation of the environment. We will ensure that renewable energy sources are adequately considered in our national plans and encourage others to do so as well. We encourage continuing research and investment in renewable energy technology, throughout the world".
   Communique from the G8 Leaders' Summit, Genoa, July 2001.
   The Third Assessment Report of the IPCC confirmed that the Earth's climate is changing as a result of human activities, particularly from energy use, and that further change is inevitable. Natural ecosystems are already adapting to change, some are under threat, and it is evident that human health and habitats will be affected world-wide. Such climate changes could also affect the present supplies of renewable energy sources and the performance and reliability of the conversion technologies. This paper concentrates on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and the role that the global renewable energy industry might play in this regard. (The five other major greenhouse gases are given less emphasis here.) The paper compares the costs of renewable energy systems with fossil fuel-derived energy services and considers how placing a value on carbon emissions will help provide convergence. The move towards a de-carbonised world, driven partly by climate change science and partly by the business opportunities it offers, will need to occur sooner rather than later if an acceptable stabilisation level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is to be achieved. Government policy decisions made now will determine the sort of future world we wish our children to inherit. The renewable energy era has begun. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study was carried out from February to December 2003 to analyse goat milk production and processing in the districts of Thies and Mbour located in the Sahelian area, 70 km from Dakar. Among the suppliers of the three processing units identified, 45 milk producers were identified and surveyed. 45 milk samples from farmers and 30 cheese samples from a processor were collected and submitted to chemical and microbiological analysis. The flock sizes averaged 45 animals per household and were equally owned by men (51.1%) and women (48.9%). Feeding was based on extensive grazing under the control of a shepherd. Only 17.7% of the farmers fed agricultural by-products (beans and groundnut haulm) to lactating goats; 4.5% dewormed their animals. The lactating goats were milked once a day, 77.8% by women, 20% by men and 2.2% by children. Average daily milk production was 0.54 +/- 0.12 L for the duration of a lactation of 3.6 months. The processing units collected the milk 2-3 times per week and the price paid (350-400 FCFA) was higher compared to cattle milk (300-350 FCFA). Two types of cheese were produced and sold to supermarkets and hotels. The processing yield was 12-15%. The chemical composition of milk (dry matter: 169.7 +/- 9.56 g/L, protein: 50.5 +/- 1.1 g/L, fat: 69 +/- 14.2 g/L) was good. The low-input dairy goat system contributes to household income. It is recommended that possible management improvements and interventions be examined to increase the efficiency of production in a sustainable manner. Small changes in feeding and milking management may lead to significant improvements.

AB Feasibility of prolonged frozen-storage of goat milk cheeses is extremely important for profitability and sustainability of the dairy goat industry. Extended frozen-storage can be detrimental to the cheese texture and flavour compounds including organic acids. The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of six months of frozen-storage compared to fresh control on organic acid profiles of soft goat cheese. Three lots of plain soft goat cheeses were purchased and each lot of the cheeses was subdivided into four treatment groups as fresh-unfrozen control (UFC), frozen-thaw control (FZC), 3 and 6 months frozen-storage (3FZ and 6FZ). All samples were subjected to ageing at 4 degrees C for 0, 14, 28 days. Organic acid concentrations for all known standards ranged 0.01 - 13.0 mg/g cheese. Significant effects were observed for most of the known acids, indicating that some variation in manufacturing parameters might have occurred during cheesemaking. Effects of storage treatments (UFC, FZC, 3FZ and 6FZ) were highly significant for most organic acids, except for orotic and a few unknown acids. Ageing at 4 degrees C for 4 weeks had little influence on all organic acids except butyric acid. Concentrations of butyric, lactic, propionic, tartaric and uric acids were significantly elevated as the frozen-storage period advanced. The UFC cheese had the highest malic and unknown-11 acids, compared to the three frozen groups. A companion study of sensory properties on the same cheeses revealed that practically no differences existed in sensory values among different storage treatments at 0 day of ageing at 4 degrees C. Prolonged frozen-storage up to six months may be feasible since no apparent deterioration occurred in sensory scores of the goat cheeses although elevations occurred in several organic acid contents.

TI Biological control in the management of invasive alien plants in South
   Africa, and the role of the Working for Water programme
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID WEEDS
AB The first biological control project against invasive alien plants in South Africa was in 1913. Initially, invasive cactus species were the only plants in South Africa targeted for biological control. By the early 1960s, the emphasis expanded to include problem plants that threatened the 'Fynbos' blome, and latterly to invasive species in other types of natural habitats. Many of the South African projects have been innovative, for example: the use of gall-forming and seed-feeding insect species that have not been used elsewhere; the emphasis on weeds in conservation areas; and the predominance of woody invaders that have been targeted for biological control. Most of these woody plants originated as forestry or agro-forestry introductions, which has created a relatively high incidence of conflicts of interest between conservationists and growers. Recent benefit:cost analyses have demonstrated exceptionally high returns on investment for biological control, even for the least successful of the projects. The inception of the Working for Water programme in 1995 has significantly enhanced biological weed control in South Africa. The benefits include: sustainable funding; investment in research on emerging weeds; a well-organized implementation programme that has increased the impact of biological control in the field; improved international cooperation, particularly in Africa, in concert with the NEPAD initiative; and the recent re-organization of research personnel into cooperative teams that include entomologists, plant pathologists, resource economists and plant ecologists.

TI The clearing of invasive alien plants in South Africa: a preliminary
   assessment of costs and progress
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper provides estimates of the costs of clearing important species of invasive alien plants, as well as of progress made with clearing, based on data from a recently developed GIS-based project information system. Before the deployment of the system, managers were unable to record, in any detail, information relating to the costs associated with areas cleared at different densities for a range of species. As a result of this, only superficial estimates of the impact of the Working for Water programme have been possible hitherto. While the system is not yet in full operation, data for about 60% of project expenditure from the 2002/03 financial year were available, and we used this information on which to base our analysis. These data show that the costs of clearing rise sharply with the density of invasion, reaching more that R2000/ha in some cases. These amounts do not include expenditure on herbicides, which can reach over R1000/ha for dense infestations of sprouting species. A large proportion (57%) of the costs was incurred in clearing large trees, which are perceived to have a significant influence on water resources. Large sums were also justifiably spent on species that probably are not substantial water users, including lantana, triffid weed and cacti. These plants affect biodiversity, catchment stability, and the agricultural potential of land. Some of the species on which large amounts have been spent , however, are arguably not a priority. Good progress has been made with clearing certain species. At current rates of clearing, however, many other species will not be brought under control within the next half century. This underscores both the importance of biological control as a sustainable, effective and inexpensive solution to the most intractable of the invasive alien plant problems, and the need for landowners to share the responsibility for clearing. Our estimates are preliminary, given the incomplete data on the project management system, and should be treated as such.

AB Pedometers are simple and inexpensive body-worn motion sensors that are readily being used by researchers and practitioners to assess and motivate physical activity behaviours. Pedometer-determined physical activity indices are needed to guide their efforts. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the rationale and evidence for general pedometer-based indices for research and practice purposes. Specifically, we evaluate popular recommendations for steps/day and attempt to translate existing physical activity guidelines into steps/day equivalents. Also, we appraise the fragmented evidence currently available from associations derived from cross-sectional studies and a limited number of interventions that have documented improvements (primarily in body composition and/or blood pressure) with increased steps/day.
   A value of 10 000 steps/day is gaining popularity with the media and in practice and can be traced to Japanese walking clubs and a business slogan 30+ years ago. 10 000 steps/day appears to be a reasonable estimate of daily activity for apparently healthy adults and studies are emerging documenting the health benefits of attaining similar levels. Preliminary evidence suggests that a goal of 10 000 steps/day may not be sustainable for some groups, including older adults and those living with chronic diseases. Another concern about using 10 000 steps/ day as a universal step goal is that it is probably too low for children, an important target population in the war against obesity.
   Other approaches to pedometer-determined physical activity recommendations that are showing promise of health benefit and individual sustainability have been based on incremental improvements relative to baseline values. Based on currently available evidence, we propose the following preliminary indices be used to classify pedometer-determined physical activity in healthy adults: (i) <5000 steps/ day may be used as a 'sedentary lifestyle index'; (ii) 5000-7499 steps/day is typical of daily activity excluding sports/exercise and might be considered 'low active'; (iii) 7500-9999 likely includes some volitional activities (and/or elevated occupational activity demands) and might be considered 'somewhat active'; and (iv) greater than or equal to10 000 steps/day indicates the point that should be used to classify individuals as 'active'. Individuals who take >12 500 steps/day are likely to be classified as 'highly active'.

AB Eye injuries in squash have the potential to be severe. Although these injuries can be prevented through the use of protective eyewear, few players wear such eyewear. The aim of this paper is, to outline the behavioural principles guiding the design of a squash eyewear promotion initiative, the Protective Eyewear Promotion (PEP). Ecological principles of behaviour change were used to provide a comprehensive perspective on intrapersonal factors, policies and physical environmental influences of protective eyewear use. Results of baseline player surveys and venue manager inter-views were used to provide relevant and specific intervention content. At baseline, protective eyewear was not found to be readily available, and players' behaviours, knowledge and attitudes did not favour its use. The main components of PEP involved informing and educating both players and squash venue operators of the risk of eye injury and of appropriate protective eyewear, as well as assisting with the availability of the eyewear and offering incentives for players to use it. A structural strength of PEP was the strong collaborative links with the researchers of different disciplines, the squash governing body, eyewear manufacturers, squash venue personnel, as well as players.

AB Turnover of catecholamines, representing the constant loss and replenishment of neurotransmitter by synthesis, is usually considered to be driven exclusively by catecholamine release. This is incorrect. An important contribution of intraneuronal metabolism of norepinephrine to turnover, and dependence of this on leakage of norepinephrine from vesicular stores, was originally proposed by Kopin in 1964. Several years later, Maas and colleagues concluded that at least 75 % of norepinephrine turnover is due to intraneuronal metabolism without prior release at sympathetic nerve endings. More recently it was shown in the resting human heart that about 12% of norepinephrine turnover is due to extraneuronal uptake and metabolism or loss of the transmitter to the circulation, 15% is due to intraneuronal metabolism after re-uptake, and 73 % is due to intraneuronal metabolism of norepinephrine leaking from storage vesicles. Thus, contrary to usual depictions, vesicular stores of catecholamines do not exist in a static state simply waiting for exocytotic release. Rather, these stores exist in a highly dynamic equilibrium with the surrounding cytoplasm, with passive outward leakage of amines counterbalanced by inward active transport under the control of vesicular monoamine transporters. The large contribution of leakage to catecholamine turnover may seem inconsistent with cellular economy. In fact, this contribution provides an important mechanism for "gearing down" the requirement for increases in catecholamine synthesis to match increases in catecholamine release, and thereby provides sympathetic nerves with a capacity for a more extended range of sustainable release rates in response to stress than would otherwise be possible.

AB Modern society is based on the use of electrical energy. Electricity blackouts, which have occurred in some countries in recent years, have revealed how dependent society is on electrical energy. The unpredictability of oil prices and the fact that fossil fuels will be exhausted in the future, force mankind to investigate new energy sources, which must be sustainable, cheap and environmentally friendly. Wind is an example of such an apparently inexhaustible energy source. The exploitation of wind energy is technologically possible. Wind power plants are already included in the electro-energy systems of Denmark, Germany, the USA, Spain and many other countries. In Slovenia, electricity is not yet produced from wind energy. The purpose of this article is to examine whether the wind energy available in the windiest part of Slovenia, the Coastal region, is sufficient to allow economical electricity production using wind power plants.

AB Knowing that humans overexaggerated extracting nonrenewable natural sources which caused nonequal quality of life lead to the awareness that energy and mass flows generated by mankind should be decreased drastically. Only than the sustainable development on the planet could be achieved. Slovenia also expresses commitment to the sustainable development. The grade approaching to the final goal can be measured only by an appropriate method. In the last years the environmental footprints become wide used. In the paper the method is described and first time used for calculation of environmental footprints of Slovenian inhabitance. It was found out that current development is non sustainable because environmental footprints of Slovenian are greater than local and global bio-productive space. The influence of the current energy use on the environmental footprints is analyzed and prediction of the future environmental footprints caused by the use of energy predicted in most important national strategic documents and EU Directives up to year 2020 are presented.

AB The article discusses and summarizes a learning resource to facilitate praxis tools for systemic governance and creative problem solving. The conceptual tools are provided as a basis for addressing challenging and complex problems through participatory design, planning and decision-making processes that strive to be socially and environmentally just. The paper draws on earlier work on tools for ethical thinking and caring. The participatory learning process aims to promote better transdiciplinary and cultural understanding and thus to promote sustainable praxis outcomes. The learning outcomes are to develop problem-solving ability and better governance (in the broad sense used by Vickers and White) through appreciation of the whole system and the value positions through which it is perceived.

AB Typically, firms decide whether or not to develop a new product based on their resources, capabilities and the return on investment that the product is estimated to generate. We propose that firms adopt a broader heuristic for making new product development choices. Our heuristic approach requires moving beyond traditional finance-based thinking, and suggests that firms concentrate on technological trajectories by combining technology roadmapping, information technology (IT) and supply chain management to make more sustainable new product development decisions. Using the proposed holistic heuristic methods, versus relying on traditional finance-based decision-making tools (e.g., emphasizing net present value or internal rate of return projections), enables firms to plan beyond the short-term and immediate set of technologies at hand. Our proposed heuristic approach enables firms to forecast technologies and markets, and hence, new product priorities in the longer term. Investments in new products should, as a result, generate returns over a longer period than traditionally expected, giving firms more sustainable investments. New products are costly and need to have a durable presence in the market. Transaction costs and resources will be saved, as firms make new product development decisions less frequently.

   America
SO TELEMEDICINE JOURNAL AND E-HEALTH

ID HEALTH-CARE; TELEMEDICINE SERVICES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; SYSTEM
AB Access to appropriate healthcare services continues to be a major challenge in rural America. Telehealth technologies offer an opportunity to bridge gaps in health services in rural and remote areas and possibly support rural economic development. Lack of access to healthcare services to a growing population may create barriers to recruitment of businesses and economic growth. Several rural-oriented programs have attempted to leverage these emerging distance technologies, but success has varied despite the application of considerable federal, state governmental, and private resources. Barriers to adoption and sustainability of rural telehealth embody several factors that must be considered when planning, developing, implementing, and evaluating a rural telehealth program. New Mexico, the fifth largest:state in the United States, represents many of the issues related to the potential benefits and challenges in developing a telehealth system to serve its rural communities. The Center for Telehealth at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center has been supported in large part by state and federal funding. Through our experiences, successes, failures, and lessons learned, we have developed approaches to overcoming barriers to adoption and sustainment of telehealth applications, including the establishment of partnerships with economic development projects in the state. This article describes these experiences and identifies and provides strategies for planning, development, implementation, and sustainment of telehealth in a rural program.

TI The elimination of iodine deficiency in the Czech Republic: The steps
   toward success
SO THYROID
LA English
DT Article
ID ENDEMIC GOITER; SUPPLEMENTATION
AB The Czech Republic has a long history of iodine deficiency. Salt iodization was introduced in 1947, followed by a progressive correction of iodine deficiency. The present study reports the changes in the status of iodine nutrition and of thyroid function in the country from 1994 to 2002. The study included 29612 individuals, aged 0 to 98 years, including 5263 individuals randomly selected from the general population and 24349 individuals who attended the Institute of Endocrinology of Prague (hospital population). Urinary iodine was determined in all individuals. Measurements of serum thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT(4)), free triiodothyronine (FT(3)) and thyroglobulin (Tg), were taken in 8544 to 19060 individuals. The iodine content of table salt was measured in 1130 samples. The median urinary iodine in the general and hospital populations were not significantly different. They progressively increased with time, starting from values indicating mild iodine deficiency (88-95 mug/L) prior to 1997, reaching the critical threshold of 100 mug/L in 1998, and optimal values between 120-140 mug/L since 2000. There was only a low and not significant positive correlation between the iodine content of salt and the urinary iodine. In contrast, urinary iodine showed marked seasonal changes, with the highest values during winter, when livestock were supplemented by mineral tablets containing iodine. Variables exploring thyroid function were all situated within the normal range in adults but another study (results not reported) has shown the persistence of slightly elevated TSH in neonates. The correction of iodine deficiency was not accompanied by unfavorable side effects. In conclusion, the Czech Republic has achieved sustainable elimination of iodine deficiency. Salt iodization has been a determining, but not the only, factor responsible for the success. Iodine supplementation of livestock and increased consumption of milk rich in iodine have probably played a determining role. Neonatal thyroid screening could constitute the major monitoring tool in order to insure sustainable elimination of iodine deficiency in the Czech Republic.

AB Subject of the investigation: In this review the most common endo- and ectoparasitic diseases of the small mammals rabbit, guinea pig, ferret, chinchilla, rat, gerbil and mouse are presented. Object/posing the problem: Related techniques for diagnosis and different therapeutic approaches are given and discussed. Clinical relevance: Most important parasitoses of small mammals are coccidiosis, encephalitozoonosis and ear mange in the rabbit, infestations by mites and mallophages in the guinea pig, ear mange in the ferret, giardiosis in the chinchilla, and mite or lice infestations in rodents. Various highly efficient drugs kill these parasites rapidly and in a sustainable manner, leading to a quick disappearance of gastrointestinal disturbances or of pruritus and the corresponding skin lesions. Possible contraindications and specialities of dosage in certain animal species have to be respected. Conclusions: Increasing importance of small mammals in small animal practice requires adequate knowledge about their parasitoses in order to have a sufficient approach to diagnosis and treatment of those infections/infestations.

AB Although generally distinct from continental environments, and therefore of interest in their own right, island environments have been generally misunderstood, misinterpreted, and mismanaged. The main reason is that they have been interpreted for management purposes largely by continent-trained observers. An example of views towards island size is given. It is argued that the pejorative label 'small' should no longer be used to characterise islands. The ways in which island environments have been impacted by humans and their commensals is given. Questions of the sustainable development of island environments are also considered, including for whom these should be sustainable, how extraneous threats like sea-level rise are best incorporated into such plans, and what threats are posed to the rest of the world by mega-tsunami from certain island environments. Island environments are best managed by persons who understand their distinct character and who are committed to their future.

AB Electroplated tin deposits are used as etch resists during the processing of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). The tin coating protects the copper tracks during etching but is subsequently removed (stripped), to expose the defined copper circuitry. The commonly used stripping solutions are based on nitric acid and after use they represent a very acidic waste product with a high metal content. The disposal of these spent strippers is typically via offsite neutralisation and precipitation followed by subsequent landfill. This is clearly a non-sustainable waste of valuable resources and a practice that is increasingly undesirable as environmental legislation becomes more stringent. This paper outlines the results of a scoping study carried out into current industry practices for tin- stripping and details components of a potential integrated treatment system for these stripping solutions. Individual technologies for such an integrated system incorporate the recovery of the tin oxide by filtration, the concentration and re-use of nitric acid solutions by diffusion dialysis and the reclamation of other metals, i.e., copper by electrowinning.

AB Since the late 1990s, more than 25 U.S. shared-use vehicle programs - including carsharing and station cars - have been launched. Given the presumed social and environmental benefits, the majority of these programs received some governmental support, primarily in the form of start-up grants and subsidized parking. As of July 2003, 15 shared-use vehicle programs were in existence, including 11 carsharing organizations, 2 carsharing research pilots, and 2 station car programs. Over the past 5 years, membership in U.S. carsharing programs has experienced exponential growth. Despite this expansion, the social and environmental impacts and long-term sustainability of these services remain unclear. As part of a U.S. shared-use vehicle survey (August 2002 to July 2003), market growth and trends as well as limited, systematic evaluation of program impacts were documented. Although 80% of shared-use programs implement internal customer surveys (initially or as follow-up), few independent studies have been conducted to date. Across organizations, participant use and program benefits are measured with various study tools and metrics. Given current shared-use vehicle growth and the ongoing interest of policyrnakers and governmental agencies in this concept, a longitudinal monitoring approach to better understand market developments, social and environmental impacts, and targeted policy strategies is recommended. Furthermore, it is concluded that coordinated, programwide data collection (consistent survey instruments and performance measures) could enhance overall market awareness and the credibility of shared-use vehicle organizations in leveraging additional public support.

DT Article
AB In industrialized countries, the number of studies and surveys in the field of urban goods movement (UGM) has increased considerably over recent years. This paper compares the objectives, methods and results in this sector and focuses on nine industrialized countries of Europe, America and Asia. This non-extensive review shows that in spite of different framework methods and models, similar trends emerge at the economic and environmental levels, It is necessary to take into account urban logistics in the broadest meaning of the term. Cooperative action seems to bear fruit providing that information and dialogue take place in the long-term with all the operators involved. The development of intelligent transport systems (ITS) and better management of urban facilities may improve these attempts. We present our viewpoint in order to shed light on research oriented towards the sustainable management of urban logistics.

AB Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) is increasingly gaining recognition by the transportation community as an indispensable practice if the sustainability of its infrastructure systems is to be realized. The product of a 3-year study that assessed the LCCA practice in state highway agencies (SHAs) is presented. The study examined how LCCA practice changed in two decades, surveyed the way LCCA is practiced currently at SHAs in the United States, and reviewed how this evaluation technique is deliberated by the academics and researchers in the engineering and economics domains. Results of this study prove noteworthy in the inspection of an observed gap between the state of the practice and state of the art of LCCA. After all, that gap set up grounds for the noted mistrust in the credibility of LCCA. In addition to study results, an analysis of the observed gap and its causes is presented as well as recommendations for what can be done to bridge that gap. It is hoped that this will prove valuable for practitioners conducting LCCA, for policy makers, and for researchers carrying out studies on various topics related to LCCA.

AB Many efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of a transportation demand management (TDM) project focus on either (a) the ability to get information to travelers to have them consider switching to more sustainable modes or (b) the impact of mode changing on travel and air quality. The former type of evaluation is sometimes called soft evaluation (awareness of services offered, inquiries for information, etc.), and the latter is called hard evaluation (trip, vehicle miles of travel, and emission reduction). A large-scale demonstration program funded by the European Commission, called mobility strategies for the next decades (MOST), developed a standardized monitoring and evaluation toolkit (MET) to aid those implementing "mobility management" projects in evaluating all types of impacts and project results. This was achieved by enumerating assessment levels that ranged from awareness to system impacts. The state of the practice in TDM evaluation is discussed; the MOST-MET is introduced; an example of its use with a specific TDM project evaluation is provided; and then the transferability of the MET and its assessment levels to other types of TDM evaluation (beyond pilot projects) is considered.

AB Sprawl is a significant concern in southern California, where continuous growth on undeveloped land contributes to heavy congestion, poor air quality, long travel times, and costly infrastructure development. By 2030, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) anticipates an additional 6 million people living in the six-county region of Los Angeles, Riverside, Ventura, San Bernardino, Imperial, and Orange Counties. To plan for this growth in a way that does not deteriorate the region's quality of life, SCAG is working with its 14 subregions on a growth visioning project called the Southern California Compass. Complementary growth visioning efforts have been conducted by SCAG subregions including the westside cities of Beverly Hills, Culver City, Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and a number of unincorporated communities in western Los Angeles County. This study describes the westside cities' growth visioning project and focuses on performance measures, community aspirations, and strategies to accommodate projected growth in a manner specific to the subregion. Performance measures developed with population, household, and employment projections revealed a high jobs-housing ratio and high inbound and outbound commuter traffic levels. Projected growth scenarios will further strain housing, transportation, and community services. Information from performance measures and community input was combined to identify policy options to potentially accommodate growth in the westside cities subregion, in line with the SCAG growth visioning principles of mobility, livability, prosperity, and sustainability.

AB Trust plays an important role in social life as well as in cyberspace. Trust establishment in cyberspace relies on human beings as well as digital components. Trusted computing platform (TCP) was proposed to improve the trust between users and their devices. However, current TCP lacks solutions for trust sustainability among TCPs, so that trust relationship might be broken after a period of time. In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a mechanism for sustaining trust among TCPs. The mechanism builds up the trust relationship based on the root trust module (RTM) at a trustee and ensures the trust sustainability according to pre-defined conditions approved at the time of trust establishment and enforced through the use of the pre-attested RTM until the intended purpose is fulfilled. The paper also presents the applicability of the trust sustainability mechanism in several application areas.

SO TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY
LA English

   system
AB Urban development and the need for new facilities have led to an increase in the use of urban utilities. These various utilities are generally located under the public highway. Therefore, underground space is limited by the width of the public highway. Because of the increase in urban utilities, the need for maintenance of these utilities and the lack of space, the underground is now very often saturated. Sometimes, the situation is so inextricable and so anarchic that the implementation of a new urban network becomes hardly possible. In addition, trench digging due to work on existing networks or on the addition of a new network generates much traffic interruption. To solve this problem, an urban utilities tunnel can be used. In this case, all the urban utilities are located in a single tunnel. Thus, saturation of the underground space decreases, there are fewer errors in the zone plan used, maintenance is easier, there is no traffic interruption and it is possible to add a new urban network without disrupting the public highway. However, the urban utilities tunnel is expensive compared to classical solutions. Because decision-makers only work based on economic criteria, this solution is rarely chosen. Therefore, to promote the urban utilities tunnel in France, a national research project was created. One of its goals is to develop a multicriteria method integrating the following criteria: safety, sustainable development, economy, maintenance, risk analysis, development facilities... Moreover, the sewer network seems to induce most of the constraints. Thus, another goal is to study the influence of the drainage network location (inside or outside the tunnel) on the general cost of the urban utilities tunnel. This paper details both problems.

AB This study was conducted between March 2001 and February 2002 to investigate the size composition, growth characteristics and stock size of the pikeperch. Sander lucioperca (L. 1758), population of Lake Egirdir. In the population, the rate of individuals more than 2 years of age and 20 cm was very low. The average length and weight of the commercial catch were also low. The length-weight relationship and von Bertalanffy growth equation were W = 0.006 L-3.148 and L-t 95.4*(1-e(-0.0841(t+1.5638))), respectively, and the average condition factor was 0.992. This last value is higher than those reported in other studies on the pikeperch population of this lake in the last 30 years. The total mortality and exploitation rates were 71.9% and 0.85, respectively. During the study, the annual catch of pikeperch was 50.2 t. In the lake, the stock of pikeperch over 14 cm in length was estimated as 601,299 individuals and 53.4 t in biomass. The present fishing effort should be decreased by 60% for maximum sustainable yield (MSY). in this way, 82.8 t of pikeperch could be obtained from the lake and the biomass of this species in the lake would be increased up to 350 t.

DE Cape Town Case Study (CTCS); biosphere reserve
AB The Cape Town Case Study (CTCS) was a multi-institutional collaborative project initiated by CUBES, a knowledge networking initiative of UNESCO's Ecological Sciences Division and the Earth Institute at Columbia University. Cape Town was selected as a CUBES site on the basis of its high biological and cultural significance, together with its demonstrated leadership in promoting urban sustainability. The CTCS was conducted by the Cape Town Urban Biosphere Group, a cross-disciplinary group of specialists drawn from national, provincial, municipal, and civil society institutions, mandated to examine the potential value of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve concept as a tool for environmental management, social inclusion, and poverty alleviation in Cape Town. This article provides a contextualization of the CTCS and its collaborative process. It also reviews the biosphere reserve concept relative to urban sustainability objectives and proposes a more functional application of that concept in an urban context. A detailed analysis of key initiatives at the interface of conservation and poverty alleviation is provided in table format. Drawing on an examination of successful sustainability initiatives in Cape Town, specific recommendations are made for future application of the biosphere reserve concept in an urban context,

AB The UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves (WNBR), while not originally conceived to include urban areas, was intended to include sites representing all significant ecosystems with the goal of support for sustainable development locally and globally. Drawing on the example of the New York Metropolitan Region (NYMR), which has a population of 21.4 million, it is argued here that the eventual inclusion of the largest of the world's cities in WNBR not only is within the logic of the biosphere reserve concept, but would also benefit the network and its goals. The ecological significance of the NYMR, its role as a driver for global environmental change, as well as the efforts under way in the city to improve urban environmental management and governance are all examined. Potential added value to the WNBR of including megacities such as the NYMR is considered, in particular, regarding the sharing of best practices, lessons learned, and the strengthening of links between megacities and their global natural resource bases.

AB The article presents the main tenets of the UNESCO Programme on Man and Biosphere (MAB), launched by the United Nations at the beginning of the 1970s. The program aimed at supporting applied research and scientific knowledge for managing natural resources in a rational and sustainable way. The implication of the full ecological perspective, typical of the MAB, for promoting multidisciplinary and integrated approaches in the study of environmental issues is briefly outlined. In particular, we point out the role of the MAB, through the biosphere reserve concept, in supporting the collaboration between natural-biological and social-behavioral sciences when dealing with biodiversity conservation problems and with urban ecosystems. Then, the specific UNESCO-MAB Project on the city of Rome, launched at the end of the 1980s, is briefly presented, together with the recent project of the Department of the Environment of the Rome Municipality to propose Rome's urban and periurban green areas as a new UNESCO-MAB Biosphere Reserve. The results of the main research activities conducted therein are summarized. In particular, the specific research lines of the environmental psychology research group, involved in the MAB-Rome Project for approximately two decades, are presented. These research lines dealt with various aspects of residents' environmental perceptions and behaviors in the city of Rome. The practical implications of these results are also briefly discussed.

AB In 1996, a coalition of diverse and determined organizations launched a new initiative in the Chicago region. Our vision? Chicago Wilderness: a thriving mosaic of natural areas, connected by greenways and wildlife corridors, embedded in the nation's third largest metropolis. In this vision, the region's human communities reclaim a cultural tradition of protecting and restoring the globally outstanding natural communities that enrich our lives. Today, more than 170 organizations join forces to transform this vision into reality. A regional biodiversity recovery plan, the result of 3 years of assessment and planning by scientists, land managers, educators, and policy strategists, sets priorities and determines the lines of action for the coalition. This regional agenda stems from our vision and recovery goals for each ecological community; it encourages targeted research initiatives that focus on characterizing our native biological diversity and on analyzing elements critical to its recovery. Ultimately, though, the long-term survival of our natural wealth rests on the support from the public. Although the challenges to conservation educators and communicators are many, Chicago Wilderness allows us to work together in understanding our audiences, channeling our resources, and creating novel approaches to engage the widest public in our conservation efforts.

AB Some precepts of the urban sustainability movement derive from the premise that economic expansion, population growth, and physical sprawl lead to a decline in quality of life, ecological damage, and eventual unsustain ability. But what about cities that are failing-losing population, losing investment, losing infrastructure, even losing land? This article challenges conventional sustainability concepts, usually derived from the experiences of ascending cities, with the notion of survivability that confronts declining cities. Should troubled cities, such as New Orleans, located on the eroding Gulf of Mexico coastal region of the state of Louisiana, be held to different sustainability standards? Could urban expansion, in some cases, actually stem environmental degradation and enhance survivability?

AB Sustainable development of a city not only is determined through the amount of protected areas, but it is also an important task to integrate sustainable development in urban energy planning. In the last 10 years, many new areas for offices and residential buildings have been developed in Frankfurt am Main. In this context, the municipality has taken over a new role as organizer for the integrated energy planning. This article gives an overview of the achievements.

AB We used a broad-scale model based on observations of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) or their sign, calibrated to reported putative death rate, to appraise current habitat conditions in the Cabinet-Yaak region of Montana. Habitat capability (i.e., potential grizzly bear densities) and regional human population sizes had the greatest effects in this model. We predicted the effects of (1) human population increases (+150% anticipated by 2023), (2) changes in lethality of humans (i.e., the probability that a human would kill a bear given an encounter), and (3) differences in the ratio of unknown to known bear deaths on the extent and location of potential source areas. We predicted densities of 1.0 and 2.1 grizzly bears/100 km2 with and without human impacts, respectively. Under our baseline scenario (3% sustainable mortality and 1:1 ratio of unknown to known bear deaths), we predicted that 2 source areas totaling 9,156 km2 and potentially supporting 123 bears occurred in our study area. With projected human population increases, potential source areas and bear populations declined by 33% and 45%, respectively. A spatially uniform increase of 1% in annual death rate (as a surrogate for increased human lethality) reduced potential source areas and bear numbers by 41% and 36%. Source areas and bear numbers declined by 39% and 34% if the ratio of unknown to known grizzly bear deaths was 2:1 versus 1:1. We obtained the best match with current population estimates (about 35 bears) assuming a 2:1 ratio of unknown to known deaths and a very low sustainable death rate of 2%. This implies either high levels of illegal human-caused mortality and low birth and recruitment rates or a population smaller than currently estimated. We conclude that human numbers and human lethality will likely govern the fate of grizzly bears in this region.

ID PROGRAMMING APPROACH; SYSTEMS; INCINERATORS
AB The aim of this work is to present the structure and the application of a decision support system (DSS) designed to help decision makers of a municipality in the development of incineration, disposal, treatment and recycling integrated programs. Specifically, within a MSW management system, several treatment plants and facilities can generally be found: separators, plants for production of refuse derived fuel (RDF), incinerators with energy recovery, plants for treatment of organic material, and sanitary landfills. The main goal of the DSS is to plan the MSW management, defining the refuse flows that have to be sent to recycling or to different treatment or disposal plants, and suggesting the optimal number, the kinds, and the localization of the plants that have to be active. The DSS is based on a decision model that requires the solution of a constrained non-linear optimization problem, where some decision variables are binary and other ones are continuous. The objective function takes into account all possible economic costs, whereas constraints arise from technical, normative, and environmental issues. Specifically, pollution and impacts, induced by the overall solid waste management system, are considered through the formalization of constraints on incineration emissions and on negative effects produced by disposal or other particular treatments.

AB The purpose of this paper is to review the types of models that are currently being used in the area of municipal waste management and to highlight some major shortcomings of these models. Most of the municipal waste models identified in the literature are decision support models and for the purposes of this research, are divided into three categories-those based on cost benefit analysis, those based on life cycle assessment and those based on multicriteria decision making. Shortcomings of current waste management models include that they are concerned with refinements of the evaluation steps (e.g. stage four of AHP or the improvement of weight allocations in ELECTRE) rather than addressing the decision making process itself. In addition, while many models recognise that for a waste management model to be sustainable, it must consider environmental, economic and social aspects, no model examined considered all three aspects together in the application of the model.

   A stoichiometric model building for the case study on Palermo
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper aims to calculate the energetic and environmental effects of an integrated solid waste management system in Palermo, Italy. In particular, the thermal treatment of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) with energy recovery is assessed. The current characterization at the local scale is taken into account. Two different options of collection are taken into account: (1) unselected wastes; and (2) sorted collection, according to the current Italian regulation. Combustion process is analyzed and the following features are calculated: (1) stoichiometric content of air and air excess; and (2) temperature and enthalpy of flue gases. Energy recovery is performed in the hypothesis of Him cycle both with steam condensation to produce only power, and with bleeding cycle for the combined production of power and thermal energy. Total electric efficiency is assumed as representative index of the technological level of the assessed plant. Results show that the thermal treatment of selected MSW, associated with a cogenerative recovery of energy, represents a relevant sustainable strategy of waste valorization as an alternative to fossil fuels.

TI Cryo-comminution of plastic waste
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Recycling of plastics is a big issue in terms of environmental sustainability and of waste management. The development of proper technologies for plastic recycling is recognised as a priority. To achieve this aim, the technologies applied in mineral processing can be adapted to recycling systems. In particular, the improvement of comminution technologies is one of the main actions to improve the quality of recycled plastics. The aim of this work is to point out suitable comminution processes for different types of plastic waste. Laboratory comminution tests have been carried out under different conditions of temperature and sample pre-conditioning adopting as refrigerant agents CO2 and liquid nitrogen. The temperature has been monitored by thermocouples placed in the milling chamber. Also different internal mill screens have been adopted. A proper procedure has been set up in order to obtain a selective comminution and a size reduction suitable for further separation treatment. Tests have been performed on plastics coming from medical plastic waste and from a plant for spent lead batteries recycling. Results coming from different mill devices have been compared taking into consideration different indexes for representative size distributions. The results of the performed tests show as cryo-comminution improves the effectiveness of size reduction of plastics, promotes liberation of constituents and increases specific surface size of comminuted particles in comparison to a comminution process carried out at room temperature.

TI Maximising household waste recycling at civic amenity sites in
   Lancashire, England
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ATTITUDES; SCHEMES; UK
AB In the UK, all local authorities have been set statutory performance standards for the recycling and composting of household waste. As part of their strategy for achieving these standards, Lancashire County Council (LCC) has made a number of alterations to the layout and facilities available at civic amenity sites (renamed Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRCs)) in the county and tried to create a more positive image of the sites for members of the public. This study consisted of two surveys carried out in order to establish how to maximise household waste recycling at the 26 HWRCs in Lancashire.
   A telephone survey was carried out amongst all Lancashire's HWRC attendants in order to establish the effects of recent site improvements and to provide an indication of overall customer satisfaction. An on-site questionnaire survey was conducted amongst HWRC customers on five selected sites, over three separate seasons, incorporating comparative weekend and weekday surveys at each site. This survey investigated public opinion of HWRCs in Lancashire, as well as exploring effective methods that would assist customers in maximising the amount of recycling at HWRCs.
   The attendants' survey revealed that site attendants were actively encouraging customers to segregate waste more efficiently at the HWRCs, and that a recycling-related bonus scheme had provided an incentive towards this effort. Site attendants have a key role in educating the public about waste segregation and the effective use of HWRCs.
   Lancashire HWRC users were mostly male, used private cars to transport waste and showed high levels of customer satisfaction. Practical changes to encourage more recycling at HWRCs were clearly identified in the customers' survey; these include longer opening hours and the provision of boxes to enable pre-separation of waste. The study has clearly shown how the results of user surveys can provide practical assistance in the development of improved sustainable waste management strategies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Under the Government of Canada's Great Lakes Program, the Great Lakes Sustainability Fund and its predecessor programs (the Great Lakes Cleanup Fund and the Great Lakes 2000 Cleanup Fund) were established to implement cleanup actions and strategies that would contribute to the restoration of beneficial uses in environmentally degraded areas (known as Areas of Concern) in the Great Lakes basin. The Great Lakes Sustainability Fund is administered by Environment Canada on behalf of eight Government of Canada departments. Contributing to impaired beneficial uses are municipal wastewaters generated from the urban centres in the Great Lakes Areas of Concern. These municipal wastewaters include treated sewage and wet-weather discharges of combined sewer overflows and stormwater runoff. This paper provides an overview of the Municipal Wastewater Program of the federal government's Great Lakes Sustainability Fund and highlights the progress made to date under the program towards wet-weather flow management and the Program's role in developing and demonstrating sustainable approaches and technologies in the Great Lakes Areas of Concern.

AB Municipal water distribution maintenance is very important for sustainable urban development. Water pipe-breaks result not only in disrupting service but also in significant loss of water, which otherwise could have been sold to the consumer. In countries where water is scarce, such as South Africa, water losses can be detrimental to the living standard of people. Water pipe-breaks can furthermore cause extensive damage to nearby lower-lying properties.
   Existing decision support systems available in the field of water distribution system maintenance mainly focus on leak detection and pipe rehabilitation/replacement strategies. These existing systems, however, do not address the actual causes of pipe-breaks.
   This paper reports on the development of a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for pipe-break susceptibility analysis. The engineer (or public works administrator) can apply the SDSS to model the complex pipe-break phenomena in a municipal water distribution system in order to identify pipes susceptible to breaking. This should promote more informed decision-making on preventative maintenance measures to be taken and their prioritisation.
   The SDSS has already been successfully applied to the water distribution system of Paarl (a medium-sized town in South Africa).

TI Wastewater disposal at safari lodges in the Okavango Delta, Botswana
SO WATER SA
LA English
DT Article
DE Okavango Delta; wastewater disposal; field bacteriological screening
AB Many safari lodges in the Okavango Delta obtain their water supply from boreholes in near surface aquifers while disposing of their wastewater via soak-aways, creating a potential risk of contamination of their water supply. Most islands in the Delta contain sites where the groundwater has become salinised as a result of transpiration by island vegetation. This study of wastewater disposal at such a site on Chitabe Island, which involved surveying of the water table, measurement of groundwater salinity, field bacteriological screening and groundwater flow modelling has revealed that although water disposal has created a recharge mound, the depression in the water table induced by transpiration by island vegetation is such that pollutants will remain confined to the region of maximum groundwater depression. Although the soils are sandy, they exhibit significant filtration effects on bacteria. The field assay used in this study was unable to detect coliform and E. coli bacteria in grounwater within a distance of 20 m from the disposal point. Modelling of groundwater flows indicates that boreholes located on the outer fringes of the island are secure from contamination. The study suggests that disposal of wastewater into areas where the groundwater is salinised provides a sustainable solution to the problem of wastewater disposal in the Okavango Delta.

AB The Khayelitsha Pressure Management Project has been well documented and widely publicised since it was commissioned towards the end of 2001. The project has received numerous national and international awards for technical excellence as well as for environmental awareness and community involvement. The initial water saved by the project was estimated to be in the order of 9 million m(3)/yr representing approximately 40% of the original 22 million m3/yr supplied to the area.
   In many examples of WDM interventions, the initial savings achieved by the project are not always sustainable and the true savings several years later are often significantly lower than those originally achieved. It is for this reason that the project team and the Client responsible for the Khayelitsha pressure management project decided to produce a final paper documenting the results and actual savings two years after the completion of the installation.
   The paper presents details of the initial savings suggested by the project team and compares them to the latest savings estimated by the Client. Problems associated with the installation experienced by the Client and consumers are discussed as well as any lessons learned by both the design team and the Client's team. It is through such feedback that future pressure management installations can be designed and commissioned with confidence in areas as large or even larger than Khayelitsha.

SP Water Inst S Africa
AB The preparation of the Durban Metro Sewage Disposal Bylaws forced a closer investigation with respect to metals in the different sewer catchments in the then Durban Metro area. The status in 1999 found few Metal Finishing Industries complying with all environmental regulations and principles, high heavy metal concentrations in some of the sewage work sludges and illegal discharges of untreated heavy metal industrial effluents to the receiving environments.
   This paper describes the implementation and uses of hybrid pollution control techniques to regulate the metal finishing industries to reduce their environmental impact. The techniques used are a combination of environmental auditing tools, cleaner production, formation of and co-operation between industry associations and the local authority, waste minimisation groups, cost based incentives and structured enforcement of the bylaws and agreements.
   These techniques have been developed and used over the last four years, and have shown success in reducing the environmental impacts and improving relationships between industry and the municipality. This allowed for a better participative approach to setting new standards to be achieved and a more sustainable environment in which both the metal finishing industries and municipality can operate.

ID DRINKING-WATER; REGROWTH
AB The Alice Water Treatment Plant (AWTP) has several operating problems, which often result in poor turbidity removal and inadequate disinfection residual. Some progress has been made in upgrading the skills of plant operators, but the plant performance has failed to improve because of faulty equipment, a shortage of maintenance staff and treatment chemicals that are not delivered in time. The coagulant-dosing pump was found to be malfunctioning for an extended period of time resulting in overdose problems. The self-backwashing filters were no longer backwashing as per design and were producing poor quality filtrate. This in turn increased the chlorine demand and combined with frequent failure of the chlorinators, the plant was producing poor microbiological quality final water. The storage system in the bulk distribution system was investigated and it was found that adequate chlorine residual could be achieved, provided the plant problems were rectified. The difficulties experienced in training and retaining adequately skilled people to run water treatment plants in impoverished rural municipalities have been among the major hurdles to providing acceptable water services in these areas. However a partnership between the Universities and the AWTP came up as a possible solution to these problems. It is therefore recommended that rural municipalities consider this approach and strengthen this relationship, as it played a large role in plant improvement.

AB The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) is currently carrying out detailed hydrogeological studies within the northern Sandveld area, Western Cape, South Africa. In addition, preliminary studies funded by DWAF, have also been carried out in the area assessing hydrological, ecological and botanical components. The area is receiving much attention due to its environmental uniqueness (part of the area is a Ramsar site) and its significant groundwater resources, which are being utilised for agricultural purposes and municipal water supply. In certain areas this groundwater abstraction is impacting on surface water flows, groundwater and associated ecosystems.
   In order to gain an understanding of the systems and their inter-relationships within the area, it is necessary to carry out water balance calculations. In carrying out such calculations, the quantification of the "input" component and associated temporal and spatial variability is important to address. With special emphasis on groundwater recharge, the area may be receiving both direct groundwater recharge, (as a consequence of precipitation), and distant groundwater inflow, via the large faults that transect the area, which may be importing groundwater from the inland recharge areas (i.e. the Cederberg Mountains).
   Earlier groundwater recharge studies within the area and in geologically similar settings indicate a wide range in recharge values. With special reference to the primary aquifers, earlier conservative recharge values indicate 8% recharge, with values as high as 15% being obtained. The current study indicates direct recharge values in the region of 0.2 to 3.4%. Assessment of water balance calculations indicate these recharge values are more realistic. The groundwater recharge quantification has huge significance for the Resource Directed Measures that are also being carried out in the area, in line with the requirements of the South African National Water Act of 1998. The Resource Directed Measures are aimed at ensuring water resource use and development is balanced by protection measures thereby guaranteeing the sustainable use of the resource.

   environmental performance
AB Nine wineries and a water bottling plant situated in the Franschhoek Valley, South Africa, have decided to lead the way towards creating a safer and more sustainable environment in the Valley. As part of the Vignerons de Franschhoek ECO Association (VFEA), they adopted a multi-site approach and obtained, in December 2003, the first ISO 14001 multi-site certification in South Africa. This proactive approach allows them better overall environmental performances through mutual motivation, information sharing and comparison of practices by the different participating organisations of the Valley.
   At the initiation of the project, the major concerns were associated with a lack of sound environmental management and training of employees. Of particular concern was also the lack of monitoring and measurement of environmental performance key indicators, especially in water consumption and wastewater disposal areas. Although the system is still in its juvenile stage, it already showed some effluent quality improvements through better wastewater management, better control over chemical stores as well as definite improvement in water management and increase in solid wastes recycling. The latter improvements will definitely entail long term cost savings should the system be continually and properly maintained.
   It is the intention of the VFEA to create a more environmentally friendly Valley by convincing others to be more environmentally responsive and expanding the ISO 14001 principles to other areas of the organisations including the farms, to other wineries and ultimately to the whole Franschhoek Valley.

AB President Thabo Mbeki stated in his inaugural speech of 27 April 2004 that in our land of gold and diamonds the one which is born poor must not die poor by decree. The purpose of our lives is not just the accumulation of wealth. He made us aware of our higher purpose of life. The challenge of this paper is to propose possible solutions for eradication of that poverty in an institutional, systematic and sustainable manner through a basic/essential commodity of life: "WATER". With the following Founding Principle: "To find a practical institutional arrangement to address the provision of adequate, affordable, and reliable supply of water to be made available for water services, particularly for poor rural and peri-urban settlements, as well as water for local economic development (LED) of the previously disadvantaged rural areas of South Africa (possibly through cross-subsidisation, loans and leveraging funding for water services infrastructure in rural areas)"
   "...viewing mankind as one entity" we must "subordinate every particular interest, be it personal, regional or national, to the over-riding interests of the generality of mankind, knowing full well that in a world of interdependent peoples and nations the advantage of the part is best to be reached by the advantage of the whole, and that no lasting result can be achieved by any of the component parts if the general interests of the entity itself are neglected..." (Shoghi Effendi, The Promised Day is Come, p.vi).

AB It is well known that South Africa is a water scarce country and that return of high quality effluents to the water resources is essential. In terms of the National Water Act, 1998 (Act 36 of 1998) the National Government has public trusteeship of the nation's water resources and therefore, acting through the Minister, must ensure that water is protected, used, developed, conserved, managed and controlled in a sustainable and equitable manner, for the benefit of all persons and in accordance with its constitutional mandate. For this reason and the sensitive nature of South Africa's water resources, it is necessary that water care works for both potable and wastewater treatment be managed to ensure that stipulated water quality standards are adhered to.
   Regulation No. 2834, in terms of the Water Act, 1956 (Act 54 of 1956) for the erection, enlargement, operation and registration of water care works, was promulgated in an attempt to ensure that operators with relevant qualifications were running the different classes of water care works. This regulation had its' shortcomings however, in the fact that it focussed more on qualifications and not competence and skill of process personnel. With the promulgation of the National Water Act of 1998 (Act 36 of 1998) it was felt that changes to the regulation were necessary.
   In terms of the South African Qualifications Authority Act of 1995 (SAQA) and the Skills Development Act of 1998 (SDA) persons must be trained and assessed using unit standards generated for each particular sector. In light of this unit standards have been developed to take into account recognition of prior learning as well as qualifications and competencies. This means that when a person achieves a unit standard the persons' ability to do a certain task is tested together with the persons understanding of the theory that underpins the task being done. The paper to follow sets out a draft regulation for both the classification of the Water Care Works as well as their process personnel.

AB In wastewater treatment plants with anaerobic sludge digestion, 15-20% of the nitrogen load is recirculated to the main stream with the return liquors from dewatering. Separate treatment of this ammonium-rich digester supernatant significantly reduces the nitrogen load of the activated sludge system. Two biological applications are considered for nitrogen elimination: (i) classical autotrophic nitrification/heterotrophic denitrification and (ii) partial nitritation/autotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). With both applications 85-90% nitrogen removal can be achieved, but there are considerable differences in terms of sustainability and costs. The final gaseous products for heterotrophic denitrification are generally not measured and are assumed to be nitrogen gas (N-2). However, significant nitrous oxide (N2O) production can occur at elevated nitrite concentrations in the reactor. Denitrification via nitrite instead of nitrate has been promoted in recent years in order to reduce the oxygen and the organic carbon requirements. Obviously this "achievement" turns out to be rather disadvantageous from an overall environmental point of view. On the other hand no unfavorable intermediates are emitted during anaerobic ammonium oxidation. A cost estimate for both applications demonstrates that partial nitritation/anammox is also more economical than classical nitrification/denitrification. Therefore autotrophic nitrogen elimination should be used in future to treat ammonium-rich sludge liquors.

AB The sustainable anaerobic nitrogen removal and microbial granulation were investigated by using a laboratory anaerobic granular sludge bed reactor, treating synthetic (inorganic and organic) wastewater and piggery waste. From inorganic synthetic wastewater, lithoautotrophic ammonium oxidation to nitrite/nitrate was observed by an addition of hydroxylamine. Also, the results revealed that the Anammox intermediates (particularly, hydrazine) contents in the substrate would be one of the important parameters for success of the anaerobic nitrogen removal process. The results from organic synthetic wastewater show that if the Anammox organism were not great enough in the startup of the process, denitritation and anaerobic ammonification would be a process prior to the Anammox reaction. The anaerobic ammonium removal from the piggery waste was performed successfully, probably due to the Anammox intermediates contained in the substrate. This reactor shows a complex performance including the Anammox reaction and HAP crystallization, as well as having partial denitritation occurring simultaneously. From the activity test, the maximum specific N conversion rate was 0.1 g NH4 -N/g VSS/day (0.77 g T-N/g VSS/day), indicating that potential denitritation is quite high. The NO2-N/NH4-N ratio to Anammox is 1.17. The colour of the biomass treating the piggery waste changed from black to dark red. It was also observed that the red-colored granular sludge had a diameter of 1-2 mm. The settleability assessment of the granular sludge revealed that the granular sludge had a good settleability even though it was worse than that of seed granular sludge.

AB This paper presents the existing philosophy, approach, criteria and delivery of environmental engineering education (E3) for developing countries. In general, environmental engineering is being taught in almost all major universities in developing countries, mostly under civil engineering degree programmes. There is an urgent need to address specific inputs that are particularly important for developing countries with respect to the reality of urbanisation and industrialisation. The main component of E3 in the near future will remain on basic sanitation in most developing countries, with special emphasis on the consumer-demand approach. In order to substantially overcome environmental problems in developing countries, E3 should include integrated urban water management, sustainable sanitation, appropriate technology, cleaner production, wastewater minimisation and financial framework.

AB Serving the world population with adequate drinking water and sanitation is an important prerequisite, not only to hygienic safety, but to prosperity and political stability as well, and will foster the adaptive capacity of the societies in the developing countries and beyond. To avoid hygienic and political disasters impacting the world economy, investment in water supply and sanitation must urgently be made. Whether the classical system of urban water supply and sanitation is appropriate to satisfy the needs of the developing world, however, and whether this system meets the general criteria of sustainability is questionable. The costs and the time needed for installation of sewers and wastewater treatment plants are tremendous. In water shortage areas, the amount of tap water required to transport pollutants to the treatment plant is hardly affordable. Recovery and re-introduction of valuable substances, including water, into the urban cycle of materials is impossible because of mixing and dilution effects inherent in the system. Decentralized water and wastewater management should be seriously taken into account as an alternative. Source separation of specific fractions of domestic and industrial wastewater, separate treatment of these fractions and recovery of water and raw materials including fertilizer and energy are the main characteristics of modern high-tech on-site treatment/reuse systems. Mass production of the key components of the system could reduce the costs of the treatment units to a reasonable level. On-site units could be installed independently of the development stage of the urban sewer system. In conjunction with building new housing complexes a stepwise improvement of the hygienic situation in urban and peri-urban areas could be achieved, therefore. Remote control of the satellite systems using modern telecommunication methods would allow reliable operation, and comfort for the users. Intensive research is required, however, to develop this system and bring it to a standard allowing efficient application worldwide.

AB Sewage sludge is a serious problem due to the high treatment costs and the risks to environment and human health. Future sludge treatment will be progressively focused on an improved efficiency and environmental sustainability of the process. In this context a survey is given of the most relevant sludge treatment options and separate treatment steps. Special attention is paid to those processes that are simultaneously focused on the elimination of the risks for environment and human health and on the recovery or beneficial use of the valuable compounds in the sludge such as organic carbon compounds, inorganic non-toxic substances, phosphorus and nitrogen containing compounds. Also, a brief assessment is given of the specific future technological developments regarding the various treatment steps. Furthermore, it is discussed how to assess the various pathways which can lead to the required developments. In such an assessment the technical and economic feasibility, the environmental sustainability, the societal acceptance and the implementation route are important factors. The optimal approach also strongly depends on the local and regional situation of concern and the relevant current and future boundary conditions.

AB The high nitrogen content of animal waste provides opportunities for processing to marketable byproducts and challenges for proper management to avoid harmful impacts. Technologies are being developed to conserve and utilize nitrogen as well as other valuable constituents in animal waste. Advanced treatment technologies are also being developed for housing/waste management systems that address public concerns and protect soil, water and air quality. Smithfield Foods, Premium Standard Farms and Frontline Farmers have entered into an agreement with North Carolina to develop environmentally superior technologies that meet these goals. The 18 candidate technologies are identified and three with the longest operating period, and thus most data to date are discussed. Methods for distributing this information for implementation of cost-effective technologies through the Curriculum Project and the National Center for Manure and Animal Waste Management will be presented. This work supports priority goals to conserve and utilize valuable animal waste constituents while also protecting against negative impacts.

AB Environmental engineering education at universities is a rapidly changing field globally. Traditionally it has resided in the civil engineering program addressing water and wastewater quality, treatment, design and regulatory issues. In recent years environmental engineering has become a much broader field encompassing water, wastewater, soil pollution, air pollution, risk assessment, ecosystems, human health, toxicology, sustainable development, regulatory aspects and much more. The need to introduce environmental engineering/green engineering/pollution prevention/design for the environment concepts to undergraduate engineering students has become recognized to be increasingly important. This need is being driven in part through the US Engineering Accreditation Commission Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology criteria 2000. Thus there has been a major shift in environmental engineering education and it no longer resides only within the civil engineering discipline. This paper focuses on the development of innovative curricula for a brand new engineering program at Rowan University that integrates environmental education for all engineers. A common course known as "engineering clinic" was developed for all engineering students throughout their eight semesters of engineering education. One of the clinic goals is to integrate engineering design and the environment. The program, in its seventh year, indicates successful implementation of environmental education in all four engineering disciplines in their course work and clinics.

AB Policies on sludge (or biosolids) management vary widely, particularly when decisions must be made on what to do with the final product. This paper examines the two principal rationales with which such decisions are made, and through which scientific knowledge is included in the process. These rationales are risk analysis (risk assessment and management), and the criterion of sustainability. Both are found to be potentially arbitrary due to the difficulty in defining the individual constituents necessary to relate environmental phenomena to,environmental policy. To place the difficulties in a practical context, this paper presents research results from three recent projects concerned with contaminants in sludge (phosphorus, flocculant polymers, and polymer-surfactant aggregates), and uses the findings to exemplify the dilemma encountered in policy making. A path forward is proposed.

AB Given the current world state of affairs, striving for sustainability and the consequent paradigm shift: growth-to-sustainable development, correction-to-prevention and options selection-to-options generation: the corresponding paradigm shift in science-technology-environment-society (STES) education is unavoidable. Accordingly, the essence of the current reform in STIES education, worldwide, is a purposed effort to develop students' higher-order cognitive skills (HOCS) capability; i.e., question-asking, critical system thinking, decision making and problem solving, at the expense of the "delivery" of lower-order cognitive skills (LOCS)-oriented knowledge. This means a paradigm shift from the contemporary prevalent LOCS algorithmic teaching to HOCS evaluative learning and HOCS-promoting courses, curricula, teaching strategies and assessment methodologies, leading, hopefully to evaluative thinking and transfer. Following the formulation of selected relevant axioms, major paradigm shift in STES research and education for sustainability have been identified. The consequent shift, in the STIES context, from disciplinary to inter- and transdisciplinary learning, in science technology and environmental engineering education is discussed, followed by selected examples of successfully implemented HOCS-promoting courses, and assessment methodologies. It is argued, that transferable "HOCS learning" for sustainability can and should be done.

AB Drawing on experiences in New South Wales from 1950 to 1980 in modeling and re-use techniques in the development of desalination technology and its application in fresh water production for potable use, the paper describes how Australia realized its responsibilities in developing participative and sustainable approaches to land use and water resources management. An analysis of the lessons from the operation of the Bayswater zero-discharge power station significantly contributed to the debate on sustainable approaches, highlighting that no management policy of a water basin can be implemented without a model based on reliable data from all sectors (including the environment), and no management model can be implemented without the participation of all stakeholders. These ideals were reflected in the conception and establishment of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. The Commission succeeded in bringing together all major stakeholders in this huge basin, though it took more than 15 years to do so. While widely recognized as one of the most advanced and successful experiences in integrated management of a drainage basin, it has still not achieved the reversal of many unsustainable agricultural practices, giving a clear indication of the difficulties and time required for producing sustainable solutions.

AB The ideals of sustainability have a longer history than is sometimes realised, as they can be traced back to the insights of Von Carlowitz in 1713. However in the intervening centuries early successes in sanitation based on the "flushing sewer" led engineers to focus too much on sewerage-based solutions that are increasingly uneconomic and unequal to the challenges arising from population growth and urbanisation. The future strategy for globally sustainable sanitation will surely involve source separation and recycling and reuse: these are the technologies that environmental scientists and engineers should now be addressing.

AB Whilst valuable debates about how best to plan, promote, and evaluate sustainable futures for our communities are conducted by governments and NGOs at global gatherings, there is an equal, and possibly more pressing, need to inspire and equip engineering graduates with the means to design and implement the required solutions. However, incorporation of sustainability as a subject into existing syllabi is problematic, primarily because of the need for students to acquire both holistic and context specific skills. This contribution first considers the reasons why we should be concerned with the integration of sustainability concepts into graduate and post-graduate curricula. We then go on to discuss the significance of cross-disciplinary thinking and skills as a key element of sustainability relevant knowledge. Finally, we report the design and deployment, within a water engineering degree course, of a post-graduate module in "Process design for sustainability". The implications of our experiences for the theory and practice of engineering education are examined and suggestions made concerning best practice.

AB More than for any other biome, freshwater biodiversity is increasingly imperiled, particularly due to poor stream flow management and increasing demand for water diversions. The adoption by the world's governments of targets to extend water services to the poor and at the same time to conserve biodiversity increase the need to better direct investments in freshwater management. In this paper WWF draws on examples from its work to identify areas where investment can be focused to assure efficient water use and improve stream flow management, namely:
   Prioritize and target those river basins and sub-catchments that are most critical for conservation of freshwater biodiversity to maintain stream flows;
   Link strategic field, policy and market interventions at different scales in river basins to maximize the impact of interventions;
   Implement the World Commission on Dams guidelines to minimize investment in large scale and costly infrastructure projects;
   Apply market mechanisms and incentives for more sustainable production of the world's most water consuming crops
   Enhance statutory river basin management organizations to draw on their regulatory and financial powers;
   Implement international agreements, such as the Convention on Wetlands;
   Integrate environment and development policies.

DE agriculture; aquatic environment; fertilisers; nitrate leaching; organic
   manure; policy measures
AB In Denmark, the first Action Plan for the Aquatic Environment (1) was introduced in 1987. The target was a 50% reduction in nitrogen emissions to the aquatic environment by 1993. Measures were directed towards the individual farmer and included the establishment of slurry tanks with 9 month storage capacity and obligations to grow winter crops on 65% of the area. In the early 1990s, it was obvious that agricultural practice had not changed towards a more efficient use of manure and fertilisers. Therefore, the Action Plan for Sustainable Agriculture was adopted in 1991, the reduction target being postponed until 2000. The plan set out restrictions on the actual utilisation of fertilisers and manure, obligations for the farmers to submit nitrogen accounts to the Ministry of Agriculture, and a levy system. However, the implemented measures were still insufficient to reach the reduction target. A second Action Plan for the Aquatic Environment (11) was adopted in 1998 and the reduction target was again postponed until 2003. This plan contained a range of measures, including reduced nitrogen standards for crops. The results from the Danish action plans confirm the need for an effective control body, and a continuous monitoring and evaluation programme.

AB The National Hydrological Plan Act was passed after the publishing of Community Directive 2000/60/EC. Officially, the Act has taken the existence of the Directive into account, but its handling of the regulation of the Ebro transfer ignores fundamental issues of the Directive, in that it does not envisage the principle of cost recovery, does not clearly determine the uses to which the transferred waters will be put, and it is not orientated towards sustainable development. Furthermore, Spanish public contract law is not in line with Community Law, and this may have repercussions in the practical aspect of possible European subsidies for carrying out the transfer.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Best practice in drainage basin management requires consultation and stakeholder engagement in the formulation and implementation of plans. The water management professional, engaging with the political world, is on risky ground, thanks to many stakeholders' accidental or chosen unwillingness to accept science-based advice. Technical specialists produce good advice, yet progress is inhibited because they do not connect effectively with politicians, administrators and managers.
   A series of short case studies from three countries in different but related fields provides evidence of the problems that are encountered. Professionals may be cut off from the political world within comfort zones defined by the cultural norms and behaviours of bureaucracy, their profession or their preferred communications style.
   The consequence of the professionals' lack of engagement in the political world can be that scarce money and effort is wasted on low priority issues, and the case for sound, sustainable environmental management is discredited. Stakeholder support is worth winning, because it can bring positive benefits in the effectiveness of environmental management programmes. Where outside help is needed to bring about this result, it should be provided by advisers who are sensitive to the culture, at the national, professional and organizational level, of the recipients.

AB By means of a modelling tool an analysis was made of the local variation in the use of pesticides in the province of Utrecht in The Netherlands, and the potential environmental impact of pesticide emissions on the aquatic ecosystems. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the major sources of pesticide use and environmental impact, taking the regional variation of pesticide use into account. The analysis was targeted at different levels: detailed (individual active substances, individual agricultural crops, civil land-use types, hydrological catchment basins) and globally covering agricultural use, non-agricultural use (some civil sectors) and recreational shipping. The results can be used for the (re)design of environmental monitoring programmes of pesticides in surface waters and for the development of region based policies towards sustainable pesticide use. The analysis tool that was developed is considered to be applicable for other regions as well.

AB Highlights of a multidisciplinary research program on innovative weed control are presented and discussed in this paper. The program was carried out from 1999 to 2002, and dovetailed most fundamental-strategic and applied research aspects in The Netherlands in that period with respect to weed management. The program was focused on both developing and implementing sustainable weed control strategies for agricultural and non-agricultural areas. Some projects in the program were on (1) developing and improving weed preventive and non-chemical methods, (2) methods that allow the farmer to apply lower dosage of herbicides than indicated on the label, e.g. the so-called "Minimum Lethal Herbicide Dose method" (MLHD), and (3) rational weed control on hard surfaces. The main results of these projects are presented. A successful development and implementation of new methods and systems of weed control that use considerably less herbicides, is determined by many factors. The role that these success factors played in the aforementioned projects is shortly discussed.

AB There is increasing evidence that global climate variability and change is affecting the quality and availability of water supplies. Integrated water resources development, use, and management strategies, represent an effective approach to achieve sustainable development of water resources in a changing environment with competing demands. It is also a key to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. It is critical that integrated water management strategies must incorporate the impacts of climate variability and change to reduce vulnerability of the poor, strengthen sustainable livelihoods and support national sustainable development. UNDP's strategy focuses on developing adaptation in the water governance sector as an entry point within the framework of poverty reduction and national sustainable development. This strategy aims to strengthen the capacity of governments and civil society organizations to have access to early warning systems, ability to assess the impact of climate variability and change on integrated water resources management, and developing adaptation intervention through hands-on learning by undertaking pilot activities.

AB The Greater Moncton Sewerage Commission's 115,000m(3)/d advanced, chemically assisted primary wastewater treatment facility located in New Brunswick, Canada, has developed an integrated, long term, sustainable, cost effective programme for the management and beneficial utilization of biosolids from lime stabilized raw sludge. The paper overviews biosolids production, lime stabilization, conveyance, and odour control followed,by an indepth discussion of the wastewater sludge as a resource programme, namely: composting, mine site reclamation, landfill cover, land application for agricultural use, tree farming, sod farm base as a soil enrichment, topsoil manufacturing. The paper also addresses the issues of metals, pathogens, organic compounds, the quality control program along with the regulatory requirements. Biosolids capital and operating costs are presented. Research results on removal of metals from primary sludge using a unique biological process known as BIOSOL as developed by the University of Toronto, Canada to remove metals and destroy pathogens are presented. The paper also discusses an ongoing cooperative research project with the Universite de Moncton where various mixtures of plant biosolids are composted with low quality soil. Integration, approach to sustainability and "cumulative effects" as part of the overall biosolids management strategy are also discussed.

DE anaerobic digestion; household waste; mesophilic; sludge; thermophilic
AB Anaerobic digestion of sludge has been part of the treatment plant in Malmo for many years and several projects on optimisation of the digestion process have been undertaken in full scale as well as in pilot scale. In order to facilitate a more sustainable solution in the future for waste management,solid waste organic waste is sorted out from households for anaerobic treatment in a newly built city district. The system for treatment of the waste is integrated in a centralised solution located at the existing wastewater treatment plant. A new extension of the digester capacity enables separate as well as co-digestion of sludge together with urban organic waste from households, industry, restaurants, big kitchens, food stores, supermarkets, green markets etc. for biogas production and production of fertiliser. Collection and pre-treatment of different types of waste are in progress together with examination of biogas potential for different types of organic waste. Collection of household waste as well as anaerobic digestion in laboratory and pilot scale has been performed during the last year. It is demonstrated that organic household waste can be digested separately or in combination with sludge. In the latter case a higher biogas yield is found than should be expected from digestion of the two materials separately. Household waste from a system based on collection of organic waste from grinders could be digested at mesophilic conditions whereas digestion failed at thermophilic conditions.

AB The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a new legislative framework to manage, use, protect, and restore surface water and groundwater resources and coastal waters in the European Union (EU). The aim is to ensure sustainable water management and to reach good water quality by 2015. The assessment of the ecological status and setting of the practical management goals require several steps. The process has started with the characterisation of the river basins including identification of surface water bodies and types, and identification of significant anthropogenic pressures and impacts. The water bodies will be classified in five quality classes (high, good, moderate, poor, bad) based on the Ecological Quality Ratio, which is a ratio between reference conditions and measured status of the biological quality elements. The normative criteria for high, good and moderate ecological status described in the WFD need to be made operational because those will be used to set the practical quality targets for surface water management. National ecological assessment systems and classifications will be harmonised through the WFD intercalibration exercise in order to ensure an equal level of ambition in achieving good surface waters status all over Europe.

DE asphalt infiltration; metals policy; runoff; traffic
AB Road traffic is a diffuse source of heavy metals and oil that leads to pollution of verges and surface water in areas immediately surrounding roads. The Commission for Integrated Water Management (CIW) has drawn up a policy document addressing methods for managing this type of pollution. The document is based on results from numerous studies in The Netherlands targeting pollution caused by traffic. The Commission concludes that measures at the source are the only way to realise sustainable solutions. For example, attention should be devoted to the issue of zinc emissions from car tyres and crash barriers. The concept of controlled infiltration is recommended for combating pollution caused by spray and runoff from roads. This includes periodic chemical inspection of verge pollution and, where necessary, replacement of the verge's top layer. The application of porous asphalt on highways in The Netherlands has also proven highly effective in limiting pollution caused by traffic, with far less pollution caused by spray from the highway and runoff as compared to traditional asphalt.

AB The endeavour towards a sustainable society has led to an interest in the recovery and recirculation or reuse of phosphorus from wastewater among environmentalists and politicians. In a recent interdisciplinary investigation commissioned by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, an attempt was made to evaluate different possibilities to recover phosphorus from wastewater or its fractions; systems based on source separation of urine or of combined toilet wastes, on the extraction of phosphorus from sludge, from ashes after incineration of sludge or from wastewater as well as the direct recirculation of hygienised digested and dewatered sludge were studied. Aspects like technology, environmental effects, resource economy, economy, markets, organisational aspects and user aspects were studied. In this overview the potential and possibility to recover and recirculate phosphorus from wastewater is discussed, mainly based on the findings in this investigation.

AB There is. a considerable practical interest in phosphorus recovery from water authorities, elementary P-industry, fertilizer industry and regulators in a number of countries. Due to a handful of full-scale plants worldwide, P-recovery can be seen as technically feasible. However, the economic feasibility of P-recovery from sewage can still be judged as dubious. The most important reason for this is that the prices of the techniques (in /tonne P) are much higher compared to the prices of phosphate rock. In this paper an analysis is given to recover phosphate from municipal wastewater for the elementary P-industry Thermphos International B.V.. and the fertiliser industry Amsterdam Fertilizers B.V. in The Netherlands. Several scenarios are evaluated and the end products of these scenarios are compared to the quality required by both industries. From a Dutch study it became clear that all end products from the final sludge treatment do not provide a good source of secondary phosphate. As a consequence of this, the most preferred possibility for P-recovery is to extract phosphate before sludge goes to the final sludge treatment. Different scenarios can be selected based on the position of P-recovery in the WWTP configuration, the type of P-recovery product, and the precipitation technique. Local conditions will determine which scenario is the most expedient. Because it is more realistic to judge a practical situation instead of theoretical estimations based on literature, some local situations have to be assessed in sufficient detail to gain more feeling for the expenses and possible savings of P-.recovery. One important actor that should be involved in the process management around P-recovery, is the national government. Especially, the Government have the responsibility for sustainable development and should have attention for some stimulation of P-recovery in The Netherlands. Water authorities and the P- and fertilizer industry made already some good steps.

AB Technically, most people agree that conserving soil organic matter and completing nutrient cycles by applying animal manures, treated organic wastes and biosolids to land is the most sustainable option in the majority of situations. It is also generally the least expensive. There has been a huge amount of research into the hazards,and this has concluded that the risks can be managed to acceptable levels. But there has been insufficient attention to communicating this knowledge, as so often in the scientific and technological arena. Perception is reality. Nowadays compliance with regulations (whilst essential) is not enough; public and stakeholder attitudes can be of decisive importance. Sometimes policy-makers speculate what public attitudes might be without really asking them. This paper will describe an initiative to create a partnership open to anybody with an interest in the use of organic materials on land to develop consensus on good practice and to share knowledge. It summarises an attitude survey of more than 140 organisations, which was then debated at a workshop in July 2002. The conclusion from this study was that all parties considered a partnership is essential to share knowledge, build mutual trust and agree practices that are welcomed by all in the food chain. The paper will describe the steps to establishing a partnership organisation, its aims and objectives, the work to date and the plans for,the future. The Environment Agency considers this very important and has largely funded the work to date. The consequences of failing to establish welcomed practices would be loss of the facility to use organic resources on land.

ID SEWAGE-SLUDGE
AB Worldwide, unsanitary conditions are responsible for more than three million deaths annually. One of the reasons is the low level of sanitation in developing countries. Particularly, sludge from these regions has a high parasite concentration and low heavy metal content even though the available information is limited. Different issues needed to achieve a sustainable sludge management in developing nations are analysed. Based on this analysis some conclusions arise: sludge management plays an important role in sanitation programs by helping reduce health problems and associated risks; investments in sanitation should consider sludge management within the overall projects; the main restriction for reusing sludge is the high microbial concentration, which requires a science-based decision on the treatment process, while heavy metals are generally low; adequate sludge management needs the commitment of those sectors involved in the development and enforcement of the regulations as well as those that are directly related to its generation, treatment, reuse or disposal; current regulations have followed different approaches, based mainly on local conditions, but they favour sludge reuse to fight problems like soil degradation, reduced crop production, and the increased use of inorganic fertilizers. This paper summarises an overview of these issues.

AB For many of the poorest people in the world, water transport is the only means of mobility and access to basic services. Improvements in rural water transport (RWT) technologies, infrastructure, and services can help eliminate poverty and reduce isolation. Yet in a transport climate dominated by motorized vehicles and roads, traditional waterways have been neglected and deprioritized. The importance of RWT in the lives of the rural poor is explored by examining the results of the International Forum for Rural Transport and Development's Waterways and Livelihoods networked research project. Why RWT has become a marginalized issue is discussed. A new networking and information resource that promotes the integration of RWT through improved policy and practice both within the transport sector and in the wider development community is introduced. The lack of integration of RWT in mainstream transport and development planning is manifest in the deterioration of traditional waterways and infrastructure and in conflicts between waterway use and land transport (or other) interventions. The consequences of this lack of integration are lost opportunities for poor people to improve their livelihoods and lost potential to develop ecologically and financially sustainable transport technologies. Why has RWT been neglected? The Waterways and Livelihoods research identified a lack of positive visibility as the prevailing factor, including poor perceptions of RWT as outmoded and unsafe, a dearth of reliable statistical information on the sector, and an "unfair playing field" on which RWT suffers in comparison with other transport options.

AB The exotic saltcedar occupies headwater, transitional, and depositional watershed portions, and revegetation strategies can be quite different depending on these locations. Regardless of specific socioeconomic or biological needs (or both), sites must often be revegetated after control to avoid reinfestation or invasion by other exotic species. Where natural riparian hydrologic processes continue to function, natural regeneration can be used as an effective restoration mechanism. However, in altered river systems, harsh environmental site characteristics may occur that severely limit revegetation potential after control, particularly in depositional areas. Because of high costs associated with saltcedar control, revegetation, and follow-up management, specific treatment areas should be evaluated and prioritized based on revegetation potential. Specific consideration should be given to the establishment of sustainable plant communities for long-term exclusion of saltcedar and other exotics.

AB Ecological resistance refers to the biotic and abiotic factors in a recipient ecosystem that limit the population growth of an invading species. Although there is interest in applying this concept to the management and restoration of habitats influenced by damaging, invasive species, practical difficulties in restoring resistance have inhibited its broad-scale incorporation. Also, some ecologists have argued that resistance is unimportant in generating landscape pattern casting doubt on its potential usefulness in large-scale management. In this study, we argue that despite temporal and spatial fluctuations in resistance being the norm, the concept provides a valuable foundation for a more sustainable approach to long-term weed management. This goal should be achievable through identification and manipulation of successional processes in natural communities.

AB Although vehicle-induced mortality of wildlife is well known on roads throughout Australia, few empirical studies describe the extent of this mortality or assess the potential effects on wildlife populations. We recorded 529 roadkills of 53 vertebrate species along a 100-km circuit of three major roads during 20 weekly surveys across winter, spring and summer. This equates to 0.3 road-kills km(-1) week(-1) or one road-kill every 3.8 km week(-1). The most frequently killed native species were the northern brown bandicoot ( 4 per week), the mountain brushtail possum ( 2 per week) and the Australian magpie ( 2 per week). These values are underestimates because our survey technique could not detect all road-kills and similar to 40% of those left on the roadside disappeared within 7 days. Detailed study of the local population of the brown bandicoot is needed to determine whether such a level of road mortality is sustainable.
   A logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether any of 10 road and landscape attributes were closely associated with the presence of specific groups of road-kills. Bandicoots were not associated with any measured attributes. Possums were more likely to occur along roads on mid-slopes and ridge-tops. Magpies were associated with roads on ridge-tops. Canopy-dwelling birds were more likely to be killed on 3-lane roads surrounded by dense vegetation.
   Road-kill surveys such as this are needed to identify species for which road mortality is unsustainable, to determine the influence on threatened species, and to identify important crossing points where road-kills are high. The frequency of road-kill of many ground-dwelling or arboreal mammal species in this study highlights the importance of impact mitigation by road authorities.

AB Sooty shearwaters (titi, muttonbird, Puffinus griseus) are highly abundant migratory seabirds, which return to breeding colonies in New Zealand. The Rakiura Maori annual chick harvest on islands adjacent to Rakiura ( Stewart Island), is one of the last large-scale customary uses of native wildlife in New Zealand. This study aimed to establish whether the rate at which muttonbirders can extract chicks from their breeding burrows indicates population trends of sooty shearwaters. Harvest rates increased slightly with increasing chick densities on Putauhinu Island. Birders' harvest rates vary in their sensitivities to changing chick density. Therefore a monitoring panel requires careful screening to ensure that harvest rates of the birders selected are sensitive to chick density, and represents a cross-section of different islands. Though harvest rates can provide only a general index of population change, it can provide an inexpensive and feasible way to measure population trends. Detecting trends is the first step to assessing the long-term sustainability of the harvest.

AB Market segmentation techniques were applied to identify and describe potential consumer clusters with highest hypothetical willingness to pay (WTP) for certified wooden furniture. Representative samples of the British and Norwegian population were surveyed by telephone and asked to choose between two profiles of wooden furniture, where one was eco-labeled and more expensive. The eco-labeled would certify that the wood originated from sustainable forestry. The survey data allowed for substantiating the attribute segmenting with the hypothetical choice behavior between eco-labeled and unlabeled wood and logit model estimates of WTP. The statistical method to identify the segments was k-means cluster analysis, principally using stated importance of product attributes and estimated WTP for eco-labeling as grouping variables.
   One segment profiled as an "eco-segment" was confirmed by placing a higher value on the dimensions (values) of environmentalism-trusting environmental and outdoor organizations regarding information about forestry and environment, and having a higher rate of membership in environmental organizations. This "eco-segment" amounted to more than (1)/(4) of the samples. The British eco-segment could be described as relatively "greener" than the Norwegian. The British also had higher estimated WTP for eco-labeling compared to the Norwegians. The eco-segments had their media interest directed more towards intellectual issues than the other segments. Demographically, the eco-segments did not differ significantly from the other segments, except that the British had a greater female majority.

AB This paper examines a number of key issues concerning agricultural land expansion, resource booms and economic growth in Latin America. The structural characteristics of agricultural development, represented by cropland share of total land area, agricultural export share of total exports, and cereal yields, appear to influence agricultural land expansion in the region. Long-run agricultural land expansion may also be correlated with a "boom and bust" pattern of economic development. Contributing factors include distorted land and resource markets, ineffective property rights, and the failure to target policies to improve the efficient and sustainable management of natural resources.

AB The influence of mineral nitrogen fertilisation and mowing frequency on a Cirsium arvense population was investigated in a 3-year grass-clover/winter wheat rotation. The field experiment was carried out from 2000 to 2003, following a long-term study (1988-1999) on the same field. In the unfertilised treatment, sprout numbers increased, while in the moderately fertilised treatment sprout numbers remained stable. Fertiliser application in established thistle stands led to a rapid decrease in sprout density as well as patch area within two years. Sprout numbers were reduced in the grass-clover mixture in both fertiliser treatments, but one year of grass-clover was not enough for a sustainable limitation of thistle spread in the unfertilised treatment.

AB SYD 11'460 H- an innovative solution for control of broad-leaved weeds and annual grasses in maize
   SYD 11'460 H, a novel maize herbicide containing terbuthylazine and mesotrione, has been evaluated under field conditions in Germany and Austria after post-emergent application in the 2002 and 2003 seasons in maize. Important innovation as compared to other terbuthylazine-containing herbicide combinations is the active ingredient mesotrione for control of triazine-resistant weed biotypes and some annual grasses. 1.5 1/ha SYD 11'460 H in maize control a wide spectrum of annual broad-leaved weeds including triazine-resistant biotypes, Poa annua as well as Echinochloa and Digilaria species. Application of SYD 11'460 H occurs post-emergent to crop and weeds at 1-6 leaf stage of maize, to grasses until mid tillering at the latest.
   After post-emergent application, mesotrione offers predominantly foliar activity on sensitive plants, terbuthylazine both foliar and root activity. Both compounds are taken up by root and shoot. The synergistic interaction of two independent modes of action results in a more than additive enhancement of efficacy on a broad weed spectrum including some grasses, enabling a significant reduction of use rates as compared to single use of both active ingredients. SYD 11'460 H has reliable and quick foliar and root activity; its duration of efficacy enables sustainable weed control during the critical early growth stages of maize.
   The herbicide combination SYD 11'460 H is suitable as a residual basic herbicide for post-emergent use in maize, performing an excellent crop tolerance. It offers an innovative contribution for consistent and highly flexible control of a wide broad-leaved weed flora including some of the most important annual grasses in Central European maize cropping systems.

AB Long-term effects of selected farming measures on weed infestation in cereals
   The present study is based on long-term trials which have run over 8, and sometimes 17, years. The experiments investigated the influence of crop rotation, tillage and nitrogen fertilization, combined with different levels of intensity of herbicide use or harrowing of cereal fields, on weed infestation. Crop rotation, tillage and nitrogen fertilization influence both weed density and dominance structure of the weed flora in the long run. Negative effects of these factors can be decreased but not prevented by situation-related herbicide use.
   Long-term effects are recognised after 5 years at the earliest.
   A period of up to 20 years seems adequate to elaborate concepts and strategies for successful, sustainable, and environmentally friendly weed control.

AB A soil physics theory of solute movement through a drained saturated zone underlying agricultural land is introduced into a long-term economic analysis of farm-level irrigation management; this is an alternative to the immediate, homogeneous blending assumption employed in previous studies as a base for calculating changes in drainage salinity over time. Using data from California, the effect of drainage salinity evolution is analyzed through a year-by-year profit optimization under the requirement of on-farm drainage disposal. Paths of optimal land allocation among crop production with fresh surface water, saline drainage reuse and evaporation ponds appear to depend on the relative profitability of the first two; that of reuse is affected by the trend of drainage salinity. Tile spacing and environmental regulations associated with evaporation ponds affect the timing of evaporation pond construction. The system converges into a solution involving both drainage-disposal activities; this solution includes an outlet for salts and is therefore sustainable. Following this strategy, the system is asymptotically approaching a steady state that possesses both hydrological and salt balances. Economic implications associated with land retirement programs in California are discussed.

ID MICROMORPHOLOGY; GENESIS
AB The Llanos de Moxos is one of the largest wetlands in the world (more than 100,000 km(2)) due to seasonal floods. The soil parent materials are fine Quaternary sediments brought by tributaries of the Amazon River. Forests cover some areas, although the dominant vegetation is a pastured savannah and backswamps. At present, the main land use is a very extensive rangeland, and slash and burn agriculture in minor areas.
   We have studied 15 profiles from several sample areas between Trinidad and San Ignacio. Field and laboratory studies have been carried out in order to elucidate the soil-forming processes taking place and to gain basic knowledge for a sustainable land management.
   Coarser soils are located near the present river system or in former riverbank areas, often under forest; textures here are loam or silty loam, silty clay loam being dominant. Finer soils may have up to 85% clay and are usually under savannah cover. Illite is the dominant clay mineral in all soils, followed by smectite and kaolinite; vermiculite is absent. Quartz is present in a very significant amount in the clay fraction of all studied soils. Goethite and lepidocrocite are present in all soils, lepidocrocite being a good indicator of poor drainage conditions.
   Soils are mainly acid, but there are soils with calcium carbonate accumulation in the subsoil, or even saline soils (salitrales). Soils are flooded for a significant period (3-6 months) and bypass flow is very active. Hydromorphic processes are always present and morphologies include hard and soft iron-manganese concretions with diffuse boundaries within peds, impregnative Fe coatings and Fe depletion hypocoatings along pore walls. The micromorphological study shows different degrees of hydromorphism, some of them associated to the present pore system and some with a palaeo character, often disturbed by active slickensides. Microsparite nodules are also present in some low-lying soils. The soils present several morphological features related to the mobility of the fine fraction that can be related to drainage conditions, as recent clay coatings, clay and silt infillings and coatings and clay-depleted hypocoatings. The most clayey soils show striated b-fabrics and frequent slickensides, and some others point to ferrolysis as iron-depleted hypocoatings and low crystallinity clay coatings along pores, although this is not supported by mineralogical data. A moderate cation supply probably prevents strong acidification. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Groundwater: the processes and global significance of aquifer
   degradation
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE groundwater; aquifer degradation; resource depletion; groundwater
   pollution; resource protection
AB The exploitation of groundwater resources for human use dates from the earliest civilizations, but massive resource development has been largely restricted to the past 50 years. Although global in scope, the emphasis of this paper is on groundwater-based economies in a developing nation context, where accelerated resource development has brought major social and economic benefits over the past 20 years. This results from groundwater's significant role in urban water supply and in rural livelihoods, including irrigated agriculture. However, little of the economic benefit of resource development has been reinvested in groundwater management, and concerns about aquifer degradation and resource sustainability began to arise.
   A general review, for a broad-based audience, is given of the mechanisms and significance of three semi-independent facets of aquifer degradation. These are (i) depletion of aquifer storage and its effects on groundwater availability, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; (ii) groundwater salinization arising from various different processes of induced hydraulic disturbance and soil fractionation; and (iii) vulnerability of aquifers to pollution from land-use and effluent discharge practices related to both urban development and agricultural intensification.
   Globally, data with which to assess the status of aquifer degradation are of questionable reliability, inadequate coverage and poor compilation. Recourse has to be made to 'type examples' and assumptions about the extension of similar hydrogeological settings likely to be experiencing similar conditions of groundwater demand and subsurface contaminant load. It is concluded that (i) aquifer degradation is much more than a localized problem because the sustainability of the resource base for much of the rapid socio-economic development of the second half of the twentieth century is threatened on quite a widespread geographical basis; and (ii) major (and long overdue) investments in groundwater resource and quality protection are urgently needed. These investments include appropriate institutional provisions, demand-side management, supply-side enhancement and pollution control.

AB Humanity shapes freshwater flows and biosphere dynamics from a local to a global scale. Successful management of target resources in the short term tends to alienate the social and economic development process from its ultimate dependence on the life-supporting environment. Freshwater becomes transformed into a resource for optimal management in development, neglecting the multiple functions of freshwater in dynamic landscapes and its fundamental role as the bloodstream of the biosphere. The current tension of these differences in worldview is exemplified through the recent development of modern aquaculture contrasted with examples of catchment-based stewardship of freshwater flows in dynamic landscapes. In particular, the social and institutional dimension of catchment management is highlighted and features of social-ecological systems for resilience building are presented. It is concluded that this broader view of freshwater provides the foundation for hydrosolidarity.

AB The paper has its focus on water's key functions behind ecosystem dynamics and the water-related balancing involved in a catchment-based ecosystem approach. A conceptual framework is being developed to address fundamental trade-offs between humans and ecosystems. This is done by paying attention to society's unavoidable landscape modifications and their unavoidable ecological effects mediated by water processes. Because the coevolution of societal and environmental processes indicates resonance rather than a cause-effect relationship, humanity will have to learn to live with change while securing ecosystem resilience. In view of the partial incompatibility of the social imperative of the millennium goals and its environmental sustainability goal, human activities and ecosystems have to be orchestrated for compatibility. To this end a catchment-based approach has to be taken by integrating water, land use and ecosystems. It is being suggested that ecosystem protection has to be thought of in two scales: site-specific biotic landscape components to be protected for their social value, and a catchment-based ecosystem approach to secure sustainable supply of crucial ecosystem goods and services on which social and economic development depends.

AB Water, the bloodstream of the biosphere, determines the sustainability of living systems. The essential role of water is expanded in a conceptual model of energy dissipation, based on the water balance of whole landscapes. In this model, the underlying role of water phase changes-and their energy-dissipative properties-in the function and the self-organized development of natural systems is explicitly recognized. The energy-dissipating processes regulate the ecological dynamics within the Earth's biosphere, in such a way that the development of natural systems is never allowed to proceed in an undirected or random way. A fundamental characteristic of self-organized development in natural systems is the increasing role of cyclic processes while loss processes are correspondingly reduced. This gives a coincidental increase in system efficiency, which is the basis of growing stability and sustainability. Growing sustainability can be seen as an increase of ecological efficiency, which is applicable at all levels up to whole landscapes. Criteria for necessary changes in society and for the design of the measures that are necessary to restore sustainable landscapes and waters are derived.

AB This paper quantifies the eco-hydrological challenge up until 2050 of producing food in balance with goods and services generated by water-dependent ecosystems in nature. Particular focus is given to the savannah zone, covering 40% of the land area in the world, where water scarcity constitutes a serious constraint to sustainable development. The analysis indicates an urgent need for a new green revolution, which focuses on upgrading rain-fed agriculture.
   Water requirements to produce adequate diets for humans are shown to be relatively generic irrespective of hydro-climate, amounting to a global average of 1300 m(3) cap(-1) yr(-1). Present food production requires an estimated 6800 km(3) yr(-1) of consumptive green water (5000 km(3) yr(-1) in rain-fed agriculture and 1800 km(3) yr(-1) from irrigated crops). Without considering water productivity gains, an additional 5800 km(3) yr(-1) of water is needed to feed a growing population in 2050 and eradicate malnutrition. It is shown that the bulk of this water will be used in rain-fed agriculture.
   A dynamic analysis of water productivity and management options indicates that large 'crop per drop' improvements can be achieved at the farm level. Vapour shift in favour of productive green water flow as crop transpiration could result in relative water savings of 500 km(3) yr(-1) in semi-arid rain-fed agriculture.

AB Interlinked crises of land degradation, food security, ecosystem decline, water quality and water flow depletion stand in the way of poverty reduction and sustainable development. These crises are made worse by increased fluctuations in climatic regimes. Single-purpose international conventions address these crises in a piecemeal, sectoral fashion and may not meet their objectives without greater attention to policy, legal, and institutional reforms related to: (i) balancing competing uses of land and water resources within hydrologic units; (ii) adopting integrated approaches to management; and (iii) establishing effective governance institutions for adaptive management within transboundary basins. This paper describes this global challenge and argues that peace, stability and security are all at stake when integrated approaches are not used. The paper presents encouraging results from a decade of transboundary water projects supported by the Global Environment Facility in developing countries that test practical applications of processes for facilitating reforms related to land and water that are underpinned by science-based approaches. Case studies of using these participative processes are described that collectively assist in the transition to integrated management. A new imperative for incorporating interlinkages among food, water, and environment security at the basin level is identified.

ID BODY-MASS
AB The principles and tenets of management require action to avoid sustained abnormal/pathological conditions. For the sustainability of interactive systems, each system should fall within its normal range of natural variation. This applies to individuals (as for fevers and hypertension, in medicine), populations (e.g. outbreaks of crop pests in agriculture), species (e.g. the rarity of endangerment in conservation) and ecosystems (e.g. abnormally low productivity or diversity in 'ecosystem-based management'). In this paper, we report tests of the hypothesis that the human species is ecologically normal. We reject the hypothesis for almost all of the cases we tested. Our species rarely falls within statistical confidence limits that envelop the central tendencies in variation among other species. For example, our population size, CO2 production, energy use, biomass consumption and geographical range size differ from those of other species by orders of magnitude. We argue that other measures should be tested in a similar fashion to assess the prevalence of such differences and their practical implications.

AB For the transition to the hydrogen economy, hydrogen must be produced sustainably, e.g., by the fermentation of agricultural material. Continuous fermentative production of hydrogen from an insoluble substrate in nonsterile conditions is yet to be reported. In this study hydrogen production using mixed microflora from heat-treated digested sewage sludge in nonsterile conditions from a particulate co-product of the wheat flour industry (7.5 g L-1 total hexose) at 18- and 12-hour hydraulic retention times, pH 4.5 and 5.2, 30degreesC and 35degreesC was examined. In continuous operation, hydrogen yields of approximately 1.3 moles hydrogen/mole hexose consumed were obtained, but decreased if acetate or propionate levels rose, indicating metabolism shifted towards hydrogen consumption by homoacetogenesis or propionate producers. These shifts occurred both at pH 4.5 and 5.2. Sparging the reactor with nitrogen to reduce hydrogen in the off-gas from 50% to 7% gave stable operation with a hydrogen yield of 1.9 moles hydrogen /mole hexose consumed over an 18-day period.

AB A comparative analysis of 23 populations of the Brazil nut tree ( Bertholletia excelsa) across the Brazilian, Peruvian, and Bolivian Amazon shows that the history and intensity of Brazil nut exploitation are major determinants of population size structure. Populations subjected to persistent levels of harvest lack juvenile trees less than 60 centimeters in diameter at breast height; only populations with a history of either light or recent exploitation contain large numbers of juvenile trees. A harvesting model confirms that intensive exploitation levels over the past century are such that juvenile recruitment is insufficient to maintain populations over the long term. Without management, intensively harvested populations will succumb to a process of senescence and demographic collapse, threatening this cornerstone of the Amazonian extractive economy.

AB With industrial development and economic growth, conflicts over use and allocation of water have been increasing. Though diverse efforts have been made toward resolving conflicts through computer-based models, its clear understanding is prerequisite for models to be effective. A systems view illuminates how people think and consequences of their thoughts and actions on results and thus helps to achieve sustainable solutions. This paper presents a systemic approach to assist stakeholders in two different jurisdictions in a hypothetical water resource system to resolve a potential water-sharing conflict. A causal loop diagram developed provides an understanding of the conflict dynamics and feedback nature. A system dynamics simulation model developed fitting the causal diagram offers a significant opportunity to explore conflict's behavior and resolution with respect to final water allocations and time necessary to reach an agreement. The impact of initial aspiration, influence on system and struggle of stakeholders is discussed in detail.

TI Impact of localized badger culling on tuberculosis incidence in British

SO NATURE

DT Article
ID MELES-MELES; POPULATION; MOVEMENT
AB Pathogens that are transmitted between wildlife, livestock and humans present major challenges for the protection of human and animal health, the economic sustainability of agriculture, and the conservation of wildlife. Mycobacterium bovis, the aetiological agent of bovine tuberculosis ( TB), is one such pathogen. The incidence of TB in cattle has increased substantially in parts of Great Britain in the past two decades, adversely affecting the livelihoods of cattle farmers and potentially increasing the risks of human exposure. The control of bovine TB in Great Britain is complicated by the involvement of wildlife, particularly badgers (Meles meles), which appear to sustain endemic infection and can transmit TB to cattle(1). Between 1975 and 1997 over 20,000 badgers were culled as part of British TB control policy, generating conflict between conservation and farming interest groups(2). Here we present results from a large-scale field trial(3-5) that indicate that localized badger culling not only fails to control but also seems to increase TB incidence in cattle.

AB Sustainability has become a major issue in most economies, causing many leading companies to focus on product recovery and reverse logistics. This research is focused on product recovery, and in particular on production control and inventory management in the remanufacturing context. We study a remanufacturing facility that receives a stream of returned products according to a Poisson process. Demand is uncertain and also follows a Poisson process. The decision problems for the remanufacturing facility are when to release returned products to the remanufacturing line and how many new products to manufacture. We assume that remanufactured products are as good as new. In this paper, we employ a "push" policy that combines these two decisions. It is well known that the optimal policy parameters are difficult to find analytically; therefore, we develop several heuristics based on traditional inventory models. We also investigate the performance of the system as a function of return rates, backorder costs and manufacturing and remanufacturing lead times; and we develop approximate lower and upper bounds on the optimal solution. We illustrate and explain some counter-intuitive results and we test the performance of the heuristics on a set of sample problems. We find that the average error of the heuristics is quite low.

AB Even faced with serious numbers of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other infections among injection drug users (IDUs), Argentina lacks large-scale harm reduction programs at national, state, and local levels. We describe the strong relationship of IDUs with the HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic in Rosario. We discuss a 2-year-long ongoing experience of drug-related harm reduction actions developed at a public health center, which began as a response to a spontaneous demand for needles and syringes and became a permanent and sustainable set of health actions for a group of nearly 50 IDUs, a larger number of drug users who do not inject, and their contacts. These actions comprise voluntary testing and counseling for HIV and other infections, reproductive counseling, condom promotion and distribution, and needle and syringe distribution without needle exchange. This experience, amenable to replication, shows that public health teams can engage successfully in harm reduction actions.

AB The model EFIMOD 2 was developed for the description of tree (stand) growth and biological turnover of elements in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. The model has the following features. (i) It is a spatially explicit stand-level simulator for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) and Pendula birch (Betula pendula L.) on different forest soils growing under different climatic conditions in Europe; each stand consists of individual trees for which growth is modelled depending on the tree's position within the stand and local light, water and available nutrient conditions. (ii) The model has a tree-based submodel for total biomass distributed between several biomass compartments. (iii) The calculations include natural regeneration as well as ground vegetation dynamics. (iv) The soil submodel (ROMUL) is used to assess organic matter dynamics and nitrogen availability for tree growth as a function of soil temperature, soil moisture content and litter quality. (v) EFIMOD 2 calculates nitrogen cycling and accounts for atmospheric nitrogen deposition, nitrogen fixation and leaching, vegetation uptake, litter fall and nitrogen redistribution within and between trees and soil horizons. (vi) Monte-Carlo simulations are done to simulate the extent of naturally oscillating variability.
   EFIMOD 2 allows for short-term and long-term simulations of natural and managed forest ecosystem dynamics over a wide range of forest sites, climatic conditions and silvicultural regimes. The model calculates dendrometric parameters for every tree, including undergrowth and seedlings, total growing stock, and pools of coarse woody debris and soil organic matter, with special reference to carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The model is effective for assessing wood productivity and evaluation of forest management regimes to meet criteria and indicators of Sustainable Forest Management. This includes a general evaluation of biodiversity and soil sustainability. The model system allows for the direct use of standard forest inventory data. Output variables include carbon and nitrogen pools in the stand and soil, CO2 emissions, and tree (stand) growth and yield. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Photocatalytic oxidation over titanium dioxide is a "green" sustainable process for treatment and purification of water and wastewater. A dimensionless model for steady-state, continuous flow, thin-film, slurry (TFS) photocatalytic reactors for water purification using solar radiation and UV lamps is presented and validated. The model is applicable to TFS flat plate and annular photoreactors of (a) falling film or (b) double-skin designs, operating with three ideal flows: (1) falling film laminar flow (FFLF), (2) plug flow (PF) and (3) slit flow (SF). Model parameters can be estimated easily from real systems, and solutions can be obtained with modest computational efforts. A modified two-flux absorption-scattering model models the radiation field in the photoreactor. Model simulations show that at a scattering albedo higher than 0.3, radiation scattering can significantly affect conversions obtained at different values of optical thickness. However, at lower values, the effect of scattering on conversions is negligible. The conversions with the idealized flow systems follow the sequence FFLF > PF > SF. SF operation should always be avoided. The model estimates the optimum value of optical thickness that maximizes conversion in a photocatalytic reactor. Optimal design of TFS photocatalytic reactors using the photocatalyst TiO2 Degussa P25 requires an optical thickness in the range from 1.8 to 3.4 depending on flow conditions and reaction kinetics.

AB An efficient procedure is described for the epoxidation of electron-deficient olefins, in particular Vitamin K-3 and analogues, with aqueous basic solutions of hydrogen peroxide in different ambient temperature ionic liquids (ILs) [bmim(+)][X-] {[bmim(+)] = 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium; [X-] = [BF4-], [CF3SO3-], [PF6-] [N(CF3SO2)(2)(-)]}. Various factors affecting epoxide yield (in the range 80-99%), reaction rate and reproducibility have been examined. The almost quantitative extraction of the epoxides from the reaction media has been obtained with supercritical CO2. The ionic liquid was then recovered and reused in subsequent cycles.

AB Numerous cell-to-cell signals tightly regulate CTL function. Human fibroblasts infected with HSV type 1 or 2 can generate such a signal and inactivate human CTL. Inactivated CTL lose their ability to release cytotoxic granules and synthesize cytokines when triggered through the TCR. Inactivation requires cell-to-cell contact between CTL and HSV-infected cells. However, inactivated CTL are not infected with HSV. The inactivation of CTL is sustainable, as CTL function remains impaired when the CTL are removed from the HSV-infected cells. IL-2 treatment does not alter inactivation, and the inactivated phenotype is not transferable between CTL, distinguishing this phenotype from traditional anergy and T regulatory cell models. CTL inactivated by HSV-infected cells are not apoptotic, and the inactivated state can be overcome by phorbol ester stimulation, suggesting that inactivated CTL are viable and that the signaling block is specific to the TCR. HSV-infected cells require the expression of U(S)3, a viral protein kinase, to transmit the inactivating signal. Elucidation of the molecular nature of this signaling pathway may allow targeted manipulation of CTL function.

AB In the automotive industry, tranotechnology applications are manifold. They reach from power train, light-weight construction, energy conversion, pollution sensing and reduction, interior cooling, wear reduction, driving dynamics, surveillance control, up to recycle potential and much more. Additionally, visions of "nano in cars" reach from contributions for CO2-free engines, safe driving, quiet cars, self-healing body and windscreens, up to a mood-depending choice of colour and a self-forming car body. All this will meet the present society trends and customer demands for improved ecology, safety and comfort, often summarised by the term sustainability. For automotive components nanoparticles, -dots, -pores, -fibers, -tubes, -whisker, -layers, either dispersed within a matrix material and called "nanocomposites", or arranged on surfaces or used as a discrete material and then called "nanostructures", offer exclusive potential. Volume effects like diffusion, absorption and mechanical strength might be tailored, furthermore surface effects like adsorption, hardness, and catalytic reaction. Self-organisation of structures will play an essential role in growth, deposition and etching. We will present an overview about existing nanotechnologies in cars already on the market, applications with short-term and medium-term potential as well as long-term applications such as light-weight construction using nano-carbon nanotubes which are presently investigated in research labs worldwide and have a high potential if they can be used for automotive bodies.

DT Article
AB The proposition that natural resources need protection from the destructive actions of people is widely accepted. Yet communities have shown in the past and increasingly today that they can collaborate for long-term resource management. The term social capital captures the idea that social bonds and norms are critical for sustainability. Where social capital is high in formalized groups, people have the confidence to invest in collective activities, knowing that others will do so too. Some 0.4 to 0.5 million groups have been established since the early 1990s for watershed, forest, irrigation, pest, wildlife, fishery, and microfinance management. These offer a route to sustainable management and governance of common resources.

AB Attaining sustainability will require concerted interactive efforts among disciplines, many of which have not yet recognized, and internalized, the relevance of environmental issues to their main intellectual discourse. The inability of key scientific disciplines to engage interactively is an obstacle to the actual attainment of sustainability. For example, in the list of Millennium Development Goals from the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, 2002, the seventh of the eight goals, to "ensure environmental sustainability," is presented separately from the parallel goals of reducing fertility and poverty, improving gains in equity, improving material conditions, and enhancing population health. A more integrated and consilient approach to sustainability is urgently needed.

AB Phenotype- based selective harvests, including trophy hunting, can have important implications for sustainable wildlife management if they target heritable traits(1 - 3). Here we show that in an evolutionary response to sport hunting of bighorn trophy rams ( Ovis canadensis) body weight and horn size have declined significantly over time. We used quantitative genetic analyses, based on a partly genetically reconstructed pedigree from a 30- year study of a wild population in which trophy hunting targeted rams with rapidly growing horns(4), to explore the evolutionary response to hunter selection on ram weight and horn size. Both traits were highly heritable, and trophy- harvested rams were of significantly higher genetic ' breeding value' for weight and horn size than rams that were not harvested. Rams of high breeding value were also shot at an early age, and thus did not achieve high reproductive success(5). Declines in mean breeding values for weight and horn size therefore occurred in response to unrestricted trophy hunting, resulting in the production of smaller- horned, lighter rams, and fewer trophies.

TI Introducing criteria based audit into Ugandan maternity units
SO BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Problem Maternal mortality in Uganda has remained unchanged at 500/100 000 over the past 10 years despite concerted efforts to improve the standard of maternity care. It is especially difficult to improve standards in rural areas, where there is little money for improvements. Furthermore, staff may be isolated, poorly paid, disempowered, lacking in morale, and have few skills to bring about change.
   Design Training programme to introduce criteria based audit into rural Uganda.
   Setting Makerere University Medical School, Mulago Hospital (large government teaching hospital in Kampala), and Mpigi District (rural area with 10 small health centres around a district hospital).
   Strategies for change Didactic teaching about criteria based audit followed by practical work in own units, with ongoing support and follow up workshops.
   Effects of change Improvements were seen in many standards of care. Staff showed universal enthusiasm for the training; many staff produced simple, cost-free improvements in their standard of care.
   Lessons learnt Teaching of criteria based audit to those providing health care in developing countries can produce low cost improvements in the standards of care. Because the method is simple and can be used to provide improvements even without new funding, it has the potential to produce sustainable and cost effective changes in the standard of health care. Follow up is needed to prevent a waning of enthusiasm with time.

AB Marine sponges (Porifera) possess an extraordinary diversity of bioactive metabolites for new drug discovery and development. In vitro cultivation of sponge cells in a bioreactor system is very attractive for the sustainable production of sponge-derived bioactive metabolites; however, it is still a challenging task. The recent establishment of sponge primmorphs, multicellular aggregates from dissociated mixed-cell population (MCP), has been widely acknowledged to hold great promise for cultivation in vitro. Here we present a new method to establish an in vitro sponge primmorph culture from archaeocyte-dominant cell population (ADCP) enriched by a Ficoll gradient, rather than a mixed-cell population (MCP). Our rationale is based upon the totipotency (the ability of a cell to differentiate into other cell types) of archaeocyte cells and the different biological functions of various sponge cell types. A sponge, Hymeniacidon perleve collected from the China Yellow Sea was used as a model system for this investigation. Distinct dynamics of primmorph formation were observed while significant increases in DNA synthesis, cell proliferation (up to threefold), and cell growth (up to fourfold) were achieved. Furthermore, a time-dependent spiculogenesis was clearly demonstrated in our longterm culture, indicating high metabolic activity of primmorphs from the ADCP. This new method represents an important step forward to advance sponge cell culture in vitro that may lead to commercial exploitation of sponge-derived drugs. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ID LASER-PULSES; SCATTERING
AB We study the quantum dynamics of a linear polar molecule subjected to electromagnetic pulses. For a sequence of half-cycle pulses we derive, from a simplified analytical model, conditions to induce a molecular orientation sustainable for hundreds of picoseconds. The predictions are confirmed by full numerical calculations for the molecule NaI. Analyzing the effect of finite temperatures we conclude that the process of maintaining the molecular orientation is robust to the thermal average. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Prosopis has one of the world's most dimensional stable lumbers. More than 100,000 t of Prosopis alba logs are being harvested annually in the Chaco Province, Argentina for the furniture industry. A growing luxury furniture industry has developed in southwestern USA with wholesale prices of US$ 1600 m(-3). As the production arises from unmanaged, non-certified native stands it will be important to initiate plantations to guarantee the sustainability of this resource. This economic analyses was developed to quantify the profitability of Prosopis plantations and was based on published values for basal diameter growth of unmanaged and managed native Prosopis stands, and plantations derived from seed and improved clones. The economic model assumed that the rotation lengths necessary to achieve 100 trees ha(-1) with 40 cm diameters containing 15.4 m-3 of sawn lumber per hectare were: 100 years for unmanaged native forests at 707 mm rainfall, 24 year in plantations with improved seed at 707 mm rainfall, 15 year with clones at 734 mm rainfall, 17 year from seed at 1000 mm rainfall and I I year using clones at 1000 mm rainfall. Using a lumber price of US$ 800 m-3 and after deducting a custom sawing rate of US$ 107 m(-3), and when the land value was not included in the economic analysis, the internal rate of returns (IRRs) were 5.3 and 3.1% for the unmanaged native stand and ranged from 11.8% (24 years, 707 mm rainfall) to 34.8% (11 years, clones, 1000 mm rainfall) and from 11.0% ( 24 years, 707 turn rainfall) to 32.5% (11 years, clones, 1000 turn rainfall) for the plantations in Argentina and the United States, respectively. The corresponding values when the land value was included were: 3.5 and 10.0-27.8% (Argentina), and 1.9 and 7.0-18.5% (USA). To simulate the scenario of selling logs and not custom sawing the timber, the price for logs in Argentina was used (US$ 33 t 1). Under these conditions the IRR of the plantations was found to range from 1.3 to 10.0%, when land value was not included in the analysis. Thus, due to the lower productivity of semi-arid forests, it is necessary to convert logs into sawn lumber to achieve economically viable IRRs. Shortening the rotation from 24 to 15 years with clones (even with a 3-fold increase in planting stock cost) doubled the IRR while nearly a 4-fold increase in price was necessary to double the IRR. Clones cannot be commercially produced by rooted cuttings, but can be by grafting. High variability exists in P. alba clones for rooting ability and research is needed to develop systems for rooting cuttings. Inclusion of complimentary grazing, commercial wildlife, intercropping and pod production showed little increase in the IRR over plantations alone. Prosopis plantations had IRRs equivalent to many other commercial hardwood and softwood plantations suggesting that for the first time, commercial forestry may be possible in the world's and zones that are in urgent need of reforestation and economic development.

TI A new climate-vegetation equilibrium state for tropical South America
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS

AB The existence of multiple climate-vegetation equilibria in Tropical South America is investigated under present-day climate conditions with the use of an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a potential vegetation model. Two stable equilibria were found. One corresponds to the current biome distribution. The second is a new equilibrium state: savannas replace eastern Amazonian forests and a semi-desert area appears in the driest portion of Northeast Brazil. If sustainable development and conservation policies were not able to halt the increasing environmental degradation in those areas, then land use changes could, per se, tip the climate-vegetation system towards this new alternative drier stable equilibrium state, with savannization of parts of Amazonia and desertification of the driest area of Northeast Brazil, and with potential adverse impacts on the rich species diversity in the former region and water resources in the latter.

AB There is a need for sustainable fuels for diesel engines and fuels containing particles will function as a fuel in diesel engines. Some microalgae such as Chlorella vulgaris are unicellular and 5-10 mum in size, which is suitable for combining in an emulsion fuel. An emulsion consisting of transesterified rapeseed oil, a surfactant and a slurry of C. vulgaris was used as a fuel in an unmodified single cylinder diesel engine. The fuel consumption and emissions of this fuel was determined and although the carbon monoxide levels were higher the NOx emission was lower than that of diesel. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB Genetically modified (GM) crops have been widely adopted by American farmers. Mainly two traits, herbicide resistance and insect resistance, constitute the area of GM crops. The commercial success of these crops derives from benefits in farm management and more generally from greater efficiency in production. European population surveys continue to show widespread opposition to GM crops and other applications of gene technology in food production. Danish focus group interviews reveal general concerns that seem to form the basis for the negative perception of GM crops. The aim of the paper is to explain why American farmers and European citizens adopt opposing attitudes to GM crops. It is argued that there is a clear conflict of interest between the two groups. At present GM crops provide no genuine benefits to the consumer, who is therefore unwilling to run even very small risks arising from the use of gene technology in food production. European citizens also connect GM crops with intensive agricultural practices, which are perceived as unsustainable. Here values may diverge, but discussion about sustainable agriculture is not primarily about GM crops: it is much broader.

AB The objective of the present paper was to investigate Granger causality between export expansion and economic growth and draw implications for sustainable job creation strategies. Several statistical tests were undertaken (unit root, cointegration and Granger causality). The results suggest that despite the absence of cointegration between export and economic growth, there is a feedback relationship between export and economic growth. Moreover, the results also indicate no cointegration between the labour variable and export, public expenditures and economic growth variables.

AB Water availability is a major factor that limits grain yield in the Loess Plateau of China. As competition for water intensifies between the agricultural and industrial sectors, it is essential to improve the agricultural water use efficiency (WUE) in the region. This requires the development of alternative irrigation schedules that maximize WUE. A field experiment was conducted for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during the period 1995-1998 to calibrate and test a biophysically based model WAVES in terms of grain yield and WUE predictions. Different irrigation treatments were carried out and the data collected included water and energy balance components, biomass, and grain yield. The model was run for 3 years with the measured meteorological data and grain yield was modeled using two different formulations. Comparisons between the measurements and the model predictions were made with 3 years of independently measured data. The results showed that the simulated grain yield and WUE based on biomass and harvest index are in better agreement with the measurements than those based on transpiration and harvest index. The model is sensitive to different irrigation treatments, and in reasonable agreement with field measured data. Results from both the field experiments and model simulation showed that evapotranspiration was greatest in the highest irrigation treatment, but the grain yield was not the highest and WUE was relatively low. Appropriately limited irrigation could improve the grain yield and WUE. Therefore, the WAVES model can be used to simulate grain yield and WUE of winter wheat in the Loess Plateau. A better irrigation scheme should aim for maximum WUE and any attempts to solely increase grain yield in the region would not be sustainable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In northeast Thailand, the sustainability of rainfed lowland rice-based systems, the dominant land-use system (LUS) in the region, is a concern for the welfare of the population in this relatively poor region. Poor soil fertility and low inputs are seen as major causes of this lack of sustainability. In this context, the assessment of nutrient budgets is seen as a powerful tool for the assessment of critical components of the sustainability of this particular LUS. Biophysical, socioeconomic, and management-related data on the farming systems were collected for 30 farms in Ubon Ratchathani Province, northeast Thailand. A relational database system (RDBS) was developed to manage and analyze the data. The RDBS includes a calculation procedure for the semi-automatic generation of partial nutrient balances. Partial nutrient balances are good indicators for some critical components of sustainability, and important for decision support on soil fertility management when considered with the additional factors that are required for a full nutrient balance.
   For the rice-based systems of 30 farms, mean partial balances were 12 kg N ha(-1), 8 kg P ha(-1), and 7 kg K ha(-1) per year. Large variations in partial N, P, and K balances exist among different farms and, even more so, for different land utilization types (LUTs). The LUTs are distinct cropping system-management combinations that occur down to the subfield level. Many of the partial balances assessed were negative.
   Farmers manage nutrients for similar parcels of land in very different ways. This results in the observed large variation in partial nutrient balances, even for the same type of land use within the same farm. These results confirm the high inter-farm and intra-farm variability for partial balances of N, P, and K of several preliminary studies. Farmer interviews and field surveys revealed that different socioeconomic factors appear to be related with inter-and intra-farm variability in nutrient budgets. In addition, the socioeconomic component of the case study revealed that diversification of income sources, particularly off-farm employment, had a larger impact on household income than rice production. Furthermore, while many less well-off households had a greater reliance on rice production, many farms with high off-farm and non-rice farm income had a higher total production of rice.
   The nutrient balance approach, starting with partial nutrient balances, may become an important component of a dynamic and site-specific decision support tool (DST) for nutrient management, and a relational database of the form used in this study may become a key element.

AB Leguminous cover crops have the potential of making cropping systems in the tropics sustainable if they would not deplete resources such as soil water and nutrients to the detriment of companion crops. Therefore, a study was carried out at Alabata, Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria, to evaluate the effects of leguminous cover crops on soil water suctions in 1993 and 1994 in order to assess the possibility of integrating them into the farming systems of the savanna zone of West Africa. In 1993, 13 leguminous cover crops (Aeschynomene histrix, Centrosema brasilianum, Centrosema pascuorum, Chamaecrista rotundifolia, Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria verrucosa, Crotalaria ochroleuca, Lablab purpureus, Mucuna pruriens, Psophocarpus palustris, Pseudovigna argentea, Pueraria phaseoloides and Stylosanthes hamata) were planted in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Maize and natural fallow (mainly Chromolaena odorata and Imperata cylindrica) were included as comparisons. Only six of the legumes (A. histrix, C. pascuorum, C. cajan, C. ochroleuca, M. pruriens, and P phaseoloides) were included in the measurements in the 1994 new plots. Soil water suctions at various stages of legume growth were measured at daily or weekly intervals (depending on the frequency of rainfall events) using tensiometers installed at 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil depths. Soil water suctions exceeding 10 kPa (theoretical field capacity) were observed mainly between 6 and 12 weeks after planting (WAP), and by 20 WAP when cover crops had matured and rainfall frequency was very low. Soil water suctions were significantly related (r(2) > 0.80) to dry matter between 8 and 10 WAR The studied cover crops were classified in three groups which can be used as a guide for choosing the legumes in tropical farming systems. Soil water depletion was markedly influenced by growth characteristics of legumes and distribution of rainfall during the rainy season. Leguminous cover crops conserved soil water after their growth needs were satisfied. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Phosphorus (P) is one of the main limiting plant nutrients in most tropical soils. Acquiring quantitative information on soil P status is essential for evaluating its sustainable management in agroecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate how land-use shifts from semi-permanent food crop systems (CF) to plantations of tea (Camellia sinensis) (TP) and Eucalyptus grandis (EP) impact on both organic and inorganic P species. Determination of phosphorus status combined a P sequential fractionation procedure and 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Sequentially extracted pools included available P by 0.5 M NaHCO3, Al/Fe-P by 0.1 M NaOH, Ca-P by 0.5 M HCl and residual P by 0.5 M H2SO4 after ignition at 550degreesC. Soil total P (STP) varied significantly across land uses (P < 0.05) with the lowest mean value (1025.6 +/- 23.1 mg kg(-1)) occurring under CF and the highest (1698.0 +/- 86.1 mg kg(-1)) under TP. The largest P-pools were NaOH-P (47-51% of total soil P) and H2SO4-P (25-32%). NaHCO3-P-i under fertilized land uses (CF and TP) was greater than 12 mg kg(-1) indicating that these systems were sustainable. Unfertilized EP was P-deficient, probably as the result of organic-matter accretion and subsequent P immobilization in organic forms. P-31 NMR revealed that 88-89% of P compounds in NaOH extract were organic with monoester-P accounting for 59.1-60.8%. This was followed by diester-P (9.8-12.4%), teochoic acid (8.4-10.1%), orthophosphate (8.8-9.7%), unknown compounds (7.4-8.4%), pyrophosphate (1.1-4.6%) and phosphonate (0-1.3%). EP had higher diester-P and no phosphonate compound whereas CF had substantial amount of pyrophosphate (4.6%) and less orthophosphate and teochoic acid. These results indicate that these last P compounds are easily mineralizable P forms participating actively in plant P nutrition. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports on the influence that residue and fertilizer management have on nutrient balances, soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics, and crop yields of a flooded rice system in northeast Thailand (1992-1997) and a wheat-forage legume rotation in eastern Australia (1992-1998). Both soils had been subject to at least 18 years of cultivation and had lost up to 90% of the original labile (C-L) and 85% of the total carbon (C-T).
   For the rainfed rice cropping systems of northeast Thailand, a system is described in which small applications of leaf litter from locally grown trees are applied annually to rice paddy soils prior to transplanting. Annual applications of 1500 kg ha(-1) of leaf litter from different locally grown shrubs for five seasons resulted in increases in rice grain yield in 1997 of between 20 and 26% above the no-leaf litter control. Nutrient balances, determined by the difference between the inputs (fertilizer and added leaf litters) and outputs (grain and straw), indicated net positive balances of up to 457 kg N ha(-1), and 60 kg N ha(-1), after five seasons of leaf litter applications. Sulfur and potassium balances resulted in net deficits of up to -13 kg S ha(-1) and -52 kg P ha(-1), where no leaf litter was applied and rice straw was removed following harvest. Soil carbon (C) concentrations increased significantly only where higher fertilizer rate and rice stubble retention were combined.
   The poor management of fertilizers and crop residues, and excessive cultivation has also resulted in large soil fertility losses in the grain growing areas of Eastern Australia. After five wheat and two legume/fallow crops, negative N balances of up to -303 kg ha(-1) were calculated for the treatments where wheat stubble was not retained and bare fallow leys were used. The balance of nutrients such as K, which are contained in larger proportions in stubble, were found to be up to -362 kg ha(-1) on the straw-removed treatments and up to +29 kg ha(-1) on the straw-retained treatments. Forage legume leys resulted in short term increases in CL and the carbon management index (CMI).
   Sustainable farming systems require that crop yields are stable through the maintenance of soil fertility and the balance of nutrients in the system. Increases in soil C levels require sustained periods of balanced fertilizatibn and residue retention. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Four on-farm experiments examined whether modest applications of fertilizers in combination with prunings from native agroforestry trees would be an alternative to maintain the fertility of ferralitic soils in Benin. An application of about 1.9 t ha(-1) dry matter of mulch of Senna siamea combined with 30 kg N ha(-1) 22 kg P ha(-1) and 25 kg K ha(-1) as compound fertilizer was compared with (1) 60 kg N ha(-1), 43 kg P ha(-1) and 50 kg K ha(-1) as compound fertilizer alone, (2) mulch of S. siamea alone (about 3.2 t ha(-1) dry matter), and (3) a control treatment. Criteria were soil properties, yields, nutrient uptakes, and nutrient budgets. Application of sole mulch had no significant effects (P > 0.05) on maize yields, while combined application of prunings and NPK fertilizers or sole NPK increased yields significantly (P < 0.05). The most limiting nutrient was P. The local maize cultivar was efficient in P uptake, but not in internal nutrient utilization efficiency; mulch increased significantly the internal P utilization efficiency (P < 0.05). Soil properties were interpreted with the QUEFTS (quantitative evaluation of the fertility of tropical soils) computer program. The predicted and measured yields were almost the same for maize without NPK. The measured responses to NPK were much lower than the responses calculated by QUEFTS. The calculated nutrient budgets were split into balances for available nutrients and for those not immediately available (NIA). Nutrient budgets were negative for the control and sole mulch treatments, and positive for the NPK treatments. Mulch improved the balances of NIA nutrients. The present experiment could not prove that combining NPK with mulch is the best option for sustainable agriculture. It may be more economical to apply lower rates of fertilizer to local maize than those applied in the two NPK treatments in the present study. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable resource management is the critical agricultural research and development challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. The accumulated knowledge on soil management gathered over the last 10 years, combined with solid crop improvement and plant health research at farmers' level, has brought us to a stage where we can now address with confidence the intensification of cereal-grain-legume-based cropping systems in the dry savanna of West Africa in a sustainable and environmentally positive manner.
   Two sustainable farming systems that greatly enhance the productivity and sustainability of integrated livestock systems have been developed and implemented in the dry savanna of Nigeria. These are: (i) maize (Zea mays L.)-promiscuous soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotations that combine high nitrogen fixation and the ability to kill large numbers of Striga hennonthica seeds in the soil; and (ii) miflet [Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaerth] and dual-purpose cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.]. Improvement of the cropping systems in the dry savanna has been driven by the adoption of promiscuously nodulating soybean varieties (in particular TGx 1448-2E) and dual-purpose cowpea. The rate of adoption is very high, even in the absence of an efficient seed distribution system. The number of farmers cultivating the improved varieties increased by 228% during the last 3 years. Increased production of promiscuous soybean has been stimulated by increased demand from industries and home utilization. Production in Nigeria was estimated at 405,000 t in 1999 compared to less than 60,000 t in 1984. Economic analysis of these systems shows already an increase of 50-70% in the gross incomes of adopting farmers compared to those still following the current practices, mainly continuous maize cultivation. Furthermore, increases in legume areas of 10% in Nigeria (about 30,000 ha in the northern Guinea savanna) and increases of 20% in yield have translated into additional fixed nitrogen valued annually at US$ 44 million. This reflects, at the same time, an equivalent increase in land-use productivity, and with further spread of the improved crops, there are excellent prospects for additional economic and environmental benefits from a very large recommendation domain across West Africa.

AB Mountainous vegetation in general, and especially in subpolar regions, is sensitive, compared to vegetation in lowland areas, as mountainous vegetation has low resilience and low productivity. Mountainous areas have been perceived as being sensitive to mechanical damage. Quick methods with a high degree of accuracy are needed for the monitoring of mountainous areas and for planning the sustainable use of resources. The aim was i) to investigate if the dry dwarf shrub heath on hummocky moraine in the southern part of the mountains with a maritime climate and in open areas used for summer grazing, is susceptible to change; and ii) to test if high-resolution IKONOS-2 satellite data can, with a high degree of accuracy, be used for detection, and for quantification and mapping of erosion patches in montane vegetation. In which case, these data can substitute color infrared aerial photos for the early detection of changes. For the detection of changes, visual interpretations on high-quality printouts of IKONOS-2 satellite images from 2000 and of color infrared aerial photographs from 1975 were carried out and the results compared. Interpretations were verified in the field. The results show that for the period 19752000, erosion was in process on and around wind heaths, indicating that the wind heath and surrounding dry dwarf shrub heath in this landscape type of hummocky moraine are sensitive to mechanical damage by trampling and grazing, and thus susceptible to change. Most of the wind heaths and changes found were small (50-1000 m(2)). The results show that it is possible to detect, with good accuracy, detailed changes in the size and distribution of erosion patches and wind heaths by visual interpretation in single images of IKONOS-2 data. This implies that for monitoring these kinds of changes, these high-resolution (4 x 4 m pixel resolution) satellite data can substitute for color infrared aerial photographs.

AB The maintenance of biodiversity by securing representative and well-connected habitat networks in managed landscapes requires a wise combination of protection, management, and restoration of habitats at several scales. We suggest that the integration of natural and social sciences in the form of "Two-dimensional gap analysis" is an efficient tool for the implementation of biodiversity policies. The tool links biologically relevant "horizontal" ecological issues with "vertical" issues related to institutions and other societal issues. Using forest biodiversity as an example, we illustrate how one can combine ecological and institutional aspects of biodiversity conservation, thus facilitating environmentally sustainable regional development. In particular, we use regional gap analysis for identification of focal forest types, habitat modelling for ascertaining the functional connectivity of "green infrastructures", as tools for the horizontal gap analysis. For the vertical dimension we suggest how the social sciences can be used for assessing the success in the implementation of biodiversity policies in real landscapes by identifying institutional obstacles while implementing policies. We argue that this interdisciplinary approach could be applied in a whole range of other environments including other terrestrial biota and aquatic ecosystems where functional habitat connectivity, nonlinear response to habitat loss and a multitude of economic and social interests co-occur in the same landscape.

TI Price ceilings as focal points for tacit collusion: Evidence from credit

SO AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW

   COMPETITION; DEMAND; WARS
AB We test whether a nonbinding price ceiling may serve as a focal point for tacit collusion, using data from the credit card market during the 1980's. Our empirical model can distinguish instances when firms match a binding ceiling from instances when firms tacitly collude at a nonbinding ceiling. The results suggest. that tacit collusion at nonbinding state-level ceilings was prevalent during the early 1980's, but that national integration of the market reduced the sustainability of tacit collusion by the end of the decade. The results highlight a perverse effect of price regulation.

ID MOVEMENT
AB The Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture (PASA) is a grassroots organization that facilitates the exchange of sustainable farming practices among its members, creates marketing opportunities for local farmers, and promotes consumer awareness and support for sustainable agriculture. Interviews with PASA's board members and staff, content analyses of PASA's literature, and a mail survey and spatial analysis of PASA's members-who include both farmers and members who do not farm-were used to examine members' characteristics, why they value being members, and the philosophies and strategies that guide the organization's successes. Results indicate that by embracing a broad definition of sustainable agriculture, PASA promotes profitable and environmentally sound farming practices to a diversity of farmers. Networking with a broad cross-section of local and regional organizations and institutions has enabled PASA to use the expertise of community leaders and share fundraising to develop marketing opportunities for farmers. Linking sustainable agriculture with priorities of community economic development has brought farmers to urban planning tables, increased inner city access to fresh, local food, and increased the economic viability of local farmers. PASA's experiences exemplify the opportunities and tensions involved with networking with mainstream institutions to gain greater support for the sustainable agriculture community. PASA provides one model of how sustainable agriculture organizations can play an integral role in supporting sustainable agriculture.

ID CHICKEN PRODUCTION; AFRICA
AB Despite efforts to develop intensive poultry production, family poultry (FP) is still very important in low-income, food-deficit countries (LIFDCs). In LIFDCs, the keeping of poultry by local communities has been practiced for many generations. FP is an appropriate system for supplying the fast-growing human population with high-quality protein. It can also provide additional income to the generally resource-poor small farmers, especially women. Although requiring low levels of inputs, FP contributes significantly to food security, poverty alleviation and ecologically sound management of natural resources. FP is also a source of employment for underprivileged groups and less-favored areas in LIFDCs. Developing schemes that aim to promote and improve the FP sub-sector in a way that is sustainable must not underestimate the roles and contributions of women. However, getting new information to the front line of production requires more gender-disaggregated data. This paper stresses the need to design, implement, monitor and evaluate FP development programs by taking into account socio-cultural, especially gender, issues.

AB The traditional farming system (TFS) in the Ghouta has been an integral part of the social life and has contributed to the food supply of Damascus for millennia. Very little is known about this traditional and sustainable system, considered by many as a hindrance to development. This study is an attempt to analyze the economic performance of this system. The objective is to evaluate the economic performance of the TFS and its impact on system viability. Three farms, representing the three different agricultural strategies in this area, were selected for data collection. Participant observation was used to derive estimates of labor, costs and revenues, which are not recorded by farmers. These three farms formed a base for continuous contact with other farmers in the Ghouta. The average values, after cross-checking with these estimates and other farmers, were used in the economic analysis at three levels: production, family and market level. The production system of the Ghouta is adaptable to economic forces of a major city as the high level of market orientation of the TFS stimulates diversity of farms. It is concluded that the diversified farms managed by farmers in this area provide a satisfactory income, which is in harmony both with the social values and with preserving the system, the overall objective of the farmers.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AGRICULTURE

DT Article
DE ecological agriculture; biodiversity; conservation
AB Agricultural landscapes are essential for preserving biodiversity, even though agricultural activities are the leading cause of habitat degradation worldwide. About half of the Earth's productive land area is farmed or grazed, whereas only about 6% of the total land area is protected for native species and ecosystems. The ecological services of healthy ecosystems are fundamental to agriculture, and these services depend upon a large number of species interacting with each other and with inorganic nutrient cycles. Likewise, the quality of ecosystems between reserves is critical to the persistence of species and ecological processes within reserves. Thus, conservation-oriented farming methods are critically important for both agriculture and biodiversity. Three examples illustrate agricultural practices that benefit the farmers, the local ecosystem and the landscape: (1) In Minnesota, rotational grazing, evaluated by the collaborative research of farmers and scientists, improved soil, pasture and stream quality, and boosted the confidence of the farmers in developing more sustainable grazing practices. (2) Predator-friendly ranching in Montana, in which nonlethal methods are used to protect livestock from depredation by native predators, benefited the ranchers with premium prices for wool and meat. The persistence of native predators, many of which have been on endangered species lists for years, benefited the regional ecosystem. (3) Shade-grown coffee in Latin America, in which coffee shrubs grow under an intact forest canopy, often looks and behaves ecologically like native forest and may house high levels of native biodiversity. This system benefited farmers, as long as they received a price premium for shade-grown coffee. The economic viability of these conservation-oriented practices depends upon farmers receiving price premiums for their products and by society rewarding farmers for their practices. A vision of ecological farming as the dominant form of agriculture is presented, with benefits at the scale of the farm, the landscape and society.

AB Based on a 6 year monitoring of the dynamics of a mixed dipterocarp forest in East Borneo (1990-1996), we built a matrix model to predict the sustainable cutting cycle in relation with the extraction and damage rates. Plots were ordered according to three main groups of damage and logging intensity. The first group G1 gathered slightly damaged plots with a remaining basal area greater than or equal to80% of the original (mean logging intensity = 6 trees ha(-1)). Plots belonging to G2, had a remaining basal area varying between 70 and 79% of the original one (mean logging intensity = 8 trees ha(-1)). Finally, G3 gathers highly damaged plots with a remaining basal area < 70% of the original one and a high logging intensity (mean = 14 trees ha(-1)). The mean sustainable cutting cycles predicted in the three groups were significantly different and equal 27, 41 and 89 years in G1, G2 and G3 respectively. However, the respective mean annual extracted volumes were similar: 1.6, 1.8 and 1.4 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1), respectively in G1, G2 and G3. The model suggests that a 40 year cycle, extracting 8 trees ha(-1) (60 m(3) ha(-1)) and an annual volume of 1.5 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) is the best option to preserve ecological integrity of the forest, to ensure yield sustainability and, according to existing cost analysis, economic profitability. This result is also consistent with other studies which already demonstrated that logging damage reduction using RIL techniques could be only significant with a moderate felling intensity not exceeding 8 trees ha(-1). This felling intensity threshold can be easily achieved by applying simple harvesting rules.

ID CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; FOOD CHOICE
AB Nutritional behaviour is framed by biological, anthropological, economic, psychological, socio-cultural, and home economics related determinants and it is shaped by the individual situation. From a public health point of view, the outcome is often unsatisfactory, because it is associated with preventable cases of various diseases. This situation evoked the founding of the German Association for Nutritional Behaviour (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Ernahrungsverhalten, AGEV) which celebrated its 25th anniversary within the scope of the 10th Food Choice Conference in the summer of 2002 with a plenary session on 'Sensible policies for nutrition and life-style intervention'. One might assume that the many determinants of nutritional behaviour provide a whole set of means to intervene into people's food choices. But closer deliberations make clear that there are two important aspects that tend to hinder dietary changes: on the one hand, nutritional behaviour is characterized by many conflicts of its related determinants. In order to cope with them, people develop individual guiding strategies for food choice situations which are quite stable as soon as they proved their suitability. On the other hand, any dietary modification leads to certain gains (like increased health), but losses, as well (like decreased palatability). Thus, a sustainable change can only be expected, if its gains are evaluated higher than its losses. These aspects need to be carefully considered when designing nutrition and life-style related intervention concepts. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB By the approval of the European Bird Directive (79/409/EEC) in 1979 and the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) in 1992, nature protection has become an important part of European law with direct consequences for land use, industrial development and agriculture. If a member state reclaims an area that is protected by these directives, it has to take compensational measures. When such an area includes saline grasslands that require very specific abiotic conditions, a place with similar conditions must be available to re-establish those grasslands at another location in a sustainable way. This will limit the number and extent of possible sites for compensation.
   In the conflict between economy and ecology in the Schelde polders, Flanders has chosen to expand the port of Antwerp in the polders at the left Schelde bank and destroy a protected saline grassland site. As a consequence, it has to compensate for this loss. Therefore, we made a detailed study of the hydrology, geology and soil conditions of the endangered saline grassland site. The same was done in four possible compensation sites, all situated in nearby polders. We found that the presence of upwelling groundwater flowing through a saline peat layer is necessary for the occurrence of saline grasslands. Only in one of the four possible compensation sites, called Muggenhoek, we found such conditions. So, we indicate this place as a possible site for the re-creation of saline grasslands and give some recommendations for their development.

AB Throughout the Mediterranean region, vegetation dynamics are affected by human activities which are either 'stresses' or 'disturbances', depending on their frequency, intensity and spatial distribution. To minimize or reduce anthropogenic degradation caused by land use and other disturbances, it is necessary to understand and predict the various responses of plant communities to disturbances. In particular, detailed but integrative approaches are required to assimilate large databases on vegetation and to make them directly useful for managers and restorers.
   We describe two case studies undertaken to evaluate the effects of logging or overgrazing on plant species diversity in pine forests of southern France and steppe ecosystems of southern Tunisia. Both studies employed the same methodology to identify plant functional traits (morphological, life history and regeneration traits) associated with community response to disturbance. The results of these analyses allowed us to develop state and transition models that could be used to plan and predict ecosystem trajectories, assess ongoing degradation processes and monitor community and ecosystem responses to management and restoration practices. We discuss the relevance and the use of plant functional types (PFTs) as tools for ecosystem management and planning and for monitoring restoration in southern Europe, northern Africa and elsewhere. Using this approach it is possible to improve management strategies for the conservation, restoration and sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and of ecosystems.

TI Growth and reproductive performance of broodstock shrimp reared in a
   biosecure recirculating aquaculture system versus a flow-through pond

AB Over the past decade, viral pathogens have caused mass mortalities of fanned shrimp throughout the major shrimp farming regions of the world. In addition, the global shrimp farming industry has been criticized for negatively impacting coastal environments. These issues have raised concerns about the sustainability of traditional shrimp farming practices, and have prompted farmers and researchers to develop biosecure technologies that promote a sustainable industry. Current technologies include the use of specific pathogen free (SPF) shrimp that are grown to market size in recirculating systems that rely on pathogen exclusion. Inherent in this approach is the need to produce SPF broodstock under biosecure conditions. However, there is a paucity of information on broodstock growth and reproductive performance when they are reared in recirculating systems. The present investigation compares shrimp growth and reproductive performance, in two trials where shrimp were cultured from market size (similar to20 g) to broodstock size (similar to40-60 g) in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) versus a flow-through earthen pond (EP). In trial 1, mean growth rates of males and females in the RAS were 0.83 and 1.33 g/week, respectively. In the EP, males and females grew 1.07 and 1.48 g/week, respectively. In trial 2, mean growth rates of males and females in the RAS were 0.90 and 1.53 g/week, respectively, whereas in the EP, males and females grew and 1.24 and 1.78 g/week. Slower growth rates in the RAS may be attributed to the lack of natural productivity, which provides supplemental nutrition to the shrimp. In addition to growth rates, reproductive performance of broodstock reared in the RAS was compared with historical reproductive performance of broodstock reared in the EP. Data on spawning success and production of viable nauplii revealed no significant differences (P > 0.05) between broodstock shrimp reared in these two systems. These results indicate that broodstock shrimp can be cultured in a biosecure RAS while maintaining good growth and high survival. In addition, reproductive performance of broodstock shrimp reared in a RAS is not compromised when compared with broodstock shrimp reared in a conventional, flow-through pond. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a combined low-protein, low-phosphorus diet supplemented with limiting amino acids and microbial phytase on performance, nutrient utilization and carcass characteristics of late-finishing barrows. 4 x 8 crossbreed barrows were continuously housed in metabolism cages from 70 - 110 kg BW and were fed diets, either conventional (A) or protein reduced (B) or protein and phosphorus reduced diets (C) based on barley, maize and soybean meal. Diet A (positive control) contained in air dry matter 13% and 10% CP as well as 0.49% and 0.42% P at growth phases I (70-100 kg BW) or II (100-110 kg BW), respectively. Diet B was low in CP (11.3%, 8.4%), diet C low in CP and low in P (CP: as B, P: 0.36%, 0.30%). To diet B the limiting amino acids lysine, methionine, threonine and trypthophan were added to meet the levels in diet A. To diet C the limiting amino acids and 800 FTU/kg Aspergillus- phytase were supplemented. At the end of the balance periods the barrows were slaughtered, the carcasses scored and loin chops, ham and Phalanx prima IV were analysed for nutrients and minerals. The CP or P reduction in diets B and C did not generally negatively affect growth, feed efficiency, absolute nitrogen retention or overall carcass performances of the pigs. With the low CP diets B and C, N excretion per unit BWG was decreased by about 23%. The addition of microbial phytase (diet C) increased apparent total tract digestibility of P by about 20%. In spite of 30% reduction of P intake (diet C), the absolute P retention related to 1 kg BW did not differ between treatments. Thus, phytase supplementation in diet C reduced P excretion per unit BWG by about 33%. Phytase raised apparent digestibility of Zn by about 20% but not Ca digestibility. Generally the carcass traits and meat characteristics were not affected by any of the diet strategies. Mineralization of the Phalanx prima IV was also similar in all treatment groups. However, phytase supplementation led to significantly increased zinc concentration in bones (25%). In contrast, Fe incorporation into the Phalanx prima IV was not affected. In general, the feeding regimen introduced in this experiment offers substantial benefits in maintaining a sustainable environmental-friendly pork production even at the stage of late-finishing barrows.

AB This paper provides an analysis of some current trends in political ecology and then illustrates the intermingling of politics and ecology using a case study of the exploitation and conservation of Prunus africana in Cameroon. It argues that political ecology is still a lively field, but that some recent attempts to chart a way forward for this perspective risk shifting it away from its liminal position in relation to natural and social science by being disinclined to engage with ecological processes. The case study draws attention to the strengths and shortcomings in existing attempts to weave political and economic analysis into environmental debates over the sustainable management of this tree species, which has been incorporated into phytomedical markets in Europe. The fortunes of the tree reflect its botany and ecology as well as the trajectories of the local economy, intercontinental markets for alternative health products, the policies and practices of the Cameroonian state and the politics of international aid.

AB Bushmeat is a large but largely invisible contributor to the economies of west and central African countries. Yet the trade is currently unsustainable. Hunting is reducing wildlife populations, driving more vulnerable species to local and regional extinction, and threatening biodiversity. This paper uses a commodity chain approach to explore the bushmeat trade and to demonstrate why an interdisciplinary approach is required if the trade is to be sustainable in the future.

AB The bulk of the world's goat population is found in South-East Asia and Africa, where goats are the major source of meat production. Unfortunately, lack of an organized goat meat industry and marketing structure in developing countries is primarily responsible for their poor export earnings compared to those in developed countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Goat meat is leaner than meat from other domestic red meat species as well as being comparable in terms of its nutritional constituents. Furthermore, there are few, if any, religious or cultural taboos limiting the consumption of goat meat. Development of a carcass grading system and a suitable infrastructure in developing countries are some of the key requirements needed to establish a sustainable goat meat industry in the world. With an increase in demand by consumers for low-fat red meat alternatives, the future of the goat meat industry looks promising.

AB A Community Approach to Nuclear Safety Consequences for Plant Operation and Decommissioning Activities
   The safety of nuclear installations, their dismantling, and the management of radioactive waste are the main areas of public interest with respect to the peaceful use of nuclear power. They must be discussed in a transparent and credible fashion in order to achieve acceptance of nuclear power as an option for future energy supply. The European Commission is convinced that a common legal approach should constitute the framework for member countries within which to take individual decisions about the national role of nuclear power. This requires a number of measures to be taken, especially with regard to public interest.
   The EU Commission therefore put the so-called Nuclear Package up for discussion. The Nuclear Package contains proposals for a Community framework of legislation on nuclear safety in an enlarged European Union.
   The Nuclear Package deals with five main items:
   - The safety of nuclear installations and facilities in the present and the enlarged European Union.
   - Ensuring decommissioning and dismantling of nuclear installations by means of a fund solution.
   - Sustainable and safe management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste.
   - Focusing on optimum research and development of new technologies, including new approaches to waste management.
   - Trade in nuclear material and enrichment services between the EU countries and Russia.

   organisational responses in the 21st century
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION

DT Article
AB This article examines the forces of change that have been operating on a state agriculture department over recent decades. These forces of change include pressures for the department to meet community expectations on issues such as animal welfare and ecological sustainability - issues which were not emphasised in its former focus on agricultural production. The article then goes on to look at the responses that have occurred in a public sector agency to these forces and what these may mean for the future of this traditionally conservative arm of government in terms of changes to what have been its primary client groups and its most important priorities.

AB Many areas of heathland in Europe have seen a decline in the area and condition of Calluna vulgaris (heather)-dominated vegetation, with subsequent declines in the associated faunal interest. Grazing, alongside burning, is still the predominant means of managing heathland vegetation, and, therefore, it is by manipulating this management that cost-effective improvements in vegetation condition can be made. This paper investigates the suitability of different grazing treatments for rehabilitating degraded 'dry heath'. Treatments varied in the intensity (0-1.9 sheep ha(-1) year(-1)) and timing (summer vs. winter) of sheep grazing. These treatments were compared with the behaviour of vegetation outside the fenced area kept under the previous management (open access all year round). As rabbits were common on the site, fences were erected to prevent access to the sheep grazed plots. Vegetation composition remained stable outside the fenced area, whilst all the fenced treatments showed a decrease in heather utilisation and an increase in the relative frequency of heather over the 5 years of the experiment. The increase was in proportion to the reduction in stocking rate, with only slow increases in relative frequency observed in the high grazing treatments (winter and summer). Other species that benefited from reducing grazing included Empetrum nigrum and Vaccinium myrtillus, whilst declines were observed for Agrostis capillaris and total monocotyledonous species. Only small overall differences were observed between the winter low, summer low and no sheep grazing treatments. However, a difference in response was present between the sheep exclosures and the sheep + rabbit exclosures, indicating that rabbits were having a noticeable effect on heather recovery at this site. On this degraded 'dry heath' system, imposing a reduction in stocking density improved the condition of the dwarf shrubs present and reduced the grass component of the vegetation. There was little effect of the timing of grazing, such that a reduction in sheep numbers to 0.8/0.9 sheep ha(-1) year(-1), to give utilisation levels of below 20%, can achieve the desired result of improving vegetation condition whilst still achieving some economic return from grazing. However, the wide range of 'sustainable' stocking densities for different heathland systems highlights the need to base effective management on measured utilisation rather than on stock numbers.

AB Namibian cheetahs have suffered, and continue to suffer, high levels of removal due to conflict with local farmers, and it is important to understand the demography of this population in order to determine its likely persistence. Examination of cheetahs reported live-trapped or killed by local farmers, combined with subsequent information from radio-telemetry, allowed demographic parameters such as sex ratios, age and social structure, litter size, interbirth intervals and survivorship to be estimated for cheetahs on Namibian farmlands. Cub mortality was relatively low, but adult mortality was high, particularly for males, and peaked at 5-6 years of age. Neither marking nor relocating cheetahs seemed to affect survivorship, and there was no difference in survivorship between the sexes. Time spent in captivity did not appear to affect survival after release. These findings will be useful in formulating recommendations regarding the conservation and sustainable utilization of cheetah populations outside protected areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Harvesting, local trade, and conservation of parrots in the Northeastern
   Peruvian Amazon
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE conservation; harvest; pet trade; parrots; Peruvian Amazon
AB In some places of the northeastern Peruvian Amazon the harvesting and local trade of parrot nestlings is still a common practice (loreada) that takes place every year between February and April, despite being banned by the national laws. Between 1996 and 1999, 1 monitored the use of these birds in 3890-ha of Mauritia flexuosa-palm swamps, located close to the village of Victoria (Loreto, Peru). Seven species of parrots were collected by local poachers in the study area, with Amazonia amazonica (61.1% of the captures) and Ara ararauna (25.9%) the most commonly harvested. The total number of nestlings taken during the 4-year study period was 1718, ranging from 680 birds harvested in 1996 to 166 in 1998. The two methods used to collect nestlings, cutting down the nesting tree or opening a hole in the trunk to reach the nest cavity, are not sustainable because nest-trees become useless and the next generation is completely removed. The analyses of demographic data and annual harvest rates suggest that at least three species (Ara ararauna, Ara macao and Amazona amazonica) are being over-harvested and may be seriously threatened in the long term.

AB Objective To recognize and assess the impact of the South-to-north Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) on the ecological environment of Xiangfan, Hubei Province, situated in the water-out area, and develop sound scientific countermeasures. Methods A three-layer BP network was built to simulate topology and process of the eco-economy system of Xiangfan. Historical data of ecological environmental factors and socio-economic factors as inputs, and corresponding historical data of ecosystem service value (ESV) and GDP as target outputs, were presented to train and test the network. When predicted input data after 2001 were presented to trained network as generalization sets, ESVs and GDPs of 2002, 2003, 2004... till 2050 were simulated as output in succession. Results Up to 2050, the area would have suffered an accumulative total ESV loss of RMB104.9 billion, which accounted for 37.36% of the present ESV The coinstantaneous GDP would change asynchronously with ESV, it would go through an up-to-down process and finally lose RMB89.3 billion, which accounted for 18.71% of 2001. Conclusions The simulation indicates that ESV loss means damage to the capability of socio-economic sustainable development, and suggests that artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide a feasible and effective method and have an important potential in ESV modeling.

AB Neither biologists nor nonbiologists in today's society are paying adequate attention to the escalating ethical issues raised by the human predicament, and the expertise of biologists seems to demand they make additional contributions to environmental ethics, broadly defined. Massive environmental destruction and the development of biological and nuclear weapons have changed the world; cultural evolution of ethics has not kept pace. "Bioethics" must be expanded from its focus on medical issues to consider such things as the ethics of preserving natural capital for future generations and those of dealing with overconsumption. Bioethics should examine issues as diverse as the ethics of invading Iraq to increase the role of the rich in generating climate change and the ethics of the Lomborg affair. Achieving a sustainable global society will require developing an agreed-upon ethical basis for the necessary political discourse, and the time to start is now.

AB OBJECTIVE To review evidence from literature on type 2 diabetes pertinent to physical activity and diet and lifestyle modification, and to determine the relevance of this evidence to clinical practice.
   QUALITY OF EVIDENCE Direct level I) evidence supports interventions for physical activity and diet modification for primary prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Few studies examine the effectiveness of primary health care providers' making such interventions.
   MAIN MESSAGE Family physicians have an important role in identifying people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes and managing those diagnosed with the disease, yet they struggle to deliver practice-based interventions that promote sustainable behaviour change among their patients.
   CONCLUSION It is evident that supporting patients to make changes in their physical activity and dietary habits can prevent onset of type 2 diabetes. Translating this finding into effective recommendations for clinical practice requires further effort and evaluation.

AB We tested the assumptions and predictions of a foraging model for drift-feeding fish. We used three-dimensional videography to describe the foraging behavior of brown trout, Salmo trutta, mapped water depth and velocity in their foraging area, sampled invertebrate drift to determine length class specific drift densities, and captured trout to determine the size composition of their diet. The model overestimated the fish's prey capture rate and gross energy intake rate by a factor of two. Most of this error resulted from the fact that prey detection probabilities within the fish's foraging area averaged only half the expected value. This was the result of a rapid decrease in capture probability with increasing lateral distance from the fish's focal point. Some of the model's assumptions were accurate: equations for predicting reaction distance and minimum prey size supported reliable predictions of the shape and size of the fish's foraging area and the size composition of the diet. Other assumptions were incorrect: fish detected prey within the predicted reaction volume, not on its upstream surface as expected, fish intercepted prey more slowly than the expected maximum sustainable swimming speed, and fish captured about two-thirds of their prey downstream of their focal point, rather than upstream.

DT Article
AB This article undertakes a discourse analysis of sponsoring agencies of the Nuevo Bordado Maya Comercial. In the name of the rehabilitation of cultures that have faced discrimination and of the respect of Indigenous women's rights, these agencies act on the frontiers between the local and the global, between the public and private, between ethnicities and between genders. An examination of such terms as sustainable development, empowerment, Maya woman, and Mayan culture and worldview reveals the co-existence of contradictory ideologies (that are not devoid of essentialism) in relation to development, women and the construction of a transnational, pan-Mayan identity.

DE delta civilization; artificial wetland ecosystem; butterfly effect; the
   Changjiang River Delta
AB Based on the theory of geo-eeonomy, under the new situation of global economy, information network and China's entry into WTO, also with the holding of APEC (in 2001) and the International Exposition in the near future, the Changiiang (Yangtze) River Delta is striding toward the spectacular international multi-polar situation and becomes one of core regions with high-speed development. Facing the ocean and world all along, leading the progressive tides of the age and scintillating the splendor of the nation, she does advance with time. Through a long period of irrigation projects construction and intensive operation of lands in previous agricultural society, the artificial wetland ecosystem with a positive cycle had ever been formed in this region. At present, environmental pollution and urban expansion resulted from post-industrialization are being rectified. The delta will be the paradigm of industrial and agricultural modernization along the sustainable development road. With the rapid development of urbanization, she has been one of the regions with the highest density population and high urbanization level. Taking the Changjiang River estuary and the Hangzhou Bay as two parts, she is continuously strengthening and adjusting her interior structure, expanding mothball space and constructing the oriental modem "logistics center" to link the whole world. The butterfly-style urban system of the Changiiang River Delta is flying, probably engendering earthshaking "butterfly effect".

DE water resources; sustainable utilization; China
AB This paper discusses the constraining factors to sustainable utilization of water resources in China, and the countermeasures to realize sustainable water utilization. The result of comprehensive analysis shows that constraining factors to sustainable utilization of water resources in China are complicated, including physical geographical factors and socio-economic factors, such as uneven distribution of water resources at temporal and spatial scales, inappropriate institutional arrangement and non-water-saving and non-water-conservation production and life mode. The countermeasures against constraining factors to water resources sustainable development are put forward as follows: 1) using wetlands and forests, and through spatial conversion to realize temporally sustainable supply of water resources; 2) transferring water between basins and areas and developing various water resources in water shortage area; 3) establishing water-saving society; 4) strengthening water pollution control and water resources protection; and 5) establishing unified water resources management mechanism.

AB The indiscriminate traffic of the areas cultivated with coffee plants has become worrysome due to the possibility of dissemination of the soil compaction, which may cause productivity reduction. The objectives of this study were: to determine the soil management and traffic effects on the structure sustainability models of a Red Latosol cultivated with coffee plants. The experiment was carried out, in Patrocinio County (MG), using the following management systems: conventional cultivation of coffee plant (CCC) for 27 years, coffee plant cultivation no conventional (CCNC) for 10 years, conventional cultivation for 3 years and conventional cultivation and irrigated by central pivot, for 6 years. The undisturbed soil samples were sampled in the coffee plant skirt projection and in the traffic line of the equipments. The preconsolidation pressures were obtained from the compression curves. The structure sustainability models were influenced by the soil management, depth and soil sample position. In the coffee plant skirt projection, in general, the CCC was the most susceptible system to soil compaction, while the C3A was the most resistant. In the traffic line, in general, the C3A was the most susceptible system to soil compaction, while the CCC was the most resistant. In the Irrigated Coffee system the addition of water through irrigation proved an alleviation of the preconsolidation stress turning this system the most susceptible to soil compaction in depth.

AB The use of agriculture machinery in the Cerrado region is changing its physical properties, causing soil structure degradation and as a consequence soil compaction. The objective of this study was to develop structure sustainability models (load support capacity models) for a Red Latosol cultivated with coffee plants, as a function of the preconsolidation pressure and moisture for the conditions in the skirt of the coffee plant projection and in the traffic line of the equipments. The experiment was carried out, in Patrocinio County (MG), using the following management systems: conventional cultivation of coffee plant (CCC) for 27 years, coffee plant cultivation no conventional (CCNC) for 10 years, conventional cultivation for 3 years and one with conventional cultivation and irrigated by central pivot, for 6 years. The preconsolidation pressures were obtained in the compression curves using the compressibility test. The undisturbed soil samples were sampled in the skirt of the coffee plant projection and in the traffic line of the equipments. The structure sustainability models of the Red Latosol showed the necessity of using specific models for each soil management, in every depth and position.

AB Storm water overflow from a combined sewer system might result in a sudden devastating impact to part of the urban region and the local ecosystem in an urban river environment. In order to assess the overflow pollution load during tropical rainfall events and provide a capacity of real-time emergency response planning, a web-based share vision modelling system is designed for different decision-makers based on environmental and ecological information, knowledge, vision, and concepts simultaneously. The study area covers the estuarine region in the Love River system in South Taiwan. It aims at the development of a generic platform that allows decision-makers in cooperation with other stakeholders to carry out disaster management duty during storm events. The main task of the platform concerns the management of rain/runoff; the assessment of water quality impacts, and the control of interceptor system along the river corridor. The architecture of such a Decision Support System (DSS) requires applying, integrating, and linking the web-based database, two water quality simulation models, and one optimisation model in an Internet Geographic Information System (IGIS) environment. By properly sharing information, knowledge, vision, concept, and modelling outputs among different levels of decision-makers via a web-based platform, it clearly indicates that a more efficient emergency management action is achievable during relentless storm events in response to mitigating possible ecological risk in the estuarine rehabilitation process. This would also contribute to a sustainable development plan within the urban region in the long run.

AB Nature-based tourism activities have been developing over the last decade, but it is still difficult to manage these activities sustainably. This sector is increasingly focusing on whales and dolphins in coastal communities, but the exact effects of these tourism activities are unclear. Markov chain modeling may help researchers assess the effects of tourism activities on the behavioral budget of small cetaceans. Matrix models have been used widely in population ecology to provide successful management guidelines. From June 2000 to August 2001, I collected information on the behavioral state of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops spp.) schools from a population residing in Doubtful Sound, Fiordland, New Zealand. In addition, I recorded the occurrence of boat and dolphin interactions. I then calculated the transition probabilities of passing from one behavior to another by using a first-order, time-discrete Markov chain model. Behavioral transitions during which a boat-dolphin interaction occurred were compiled in an "impact" chain. All other transitions were tallied in a control chain. I then quantified the effect of boat-dolphin interactions during behavioral transitions by comparing the behavioral transition probabilities of both chains. Socializing and resting behaviors were disrupted by interactions with boats to a level that raises concern. Both the duration of bouts and the total amount of time spent in both these behavioral states were substantially decreased. Dolphins were significantly more likely to be travelling after an interaction with a boat. However, the overall behavioral budget of the population was not significantly affected. Therefore, the bottlenose dolphin population seems to be able to sustain the present level of boat interactions because of its low intensity. More effort is needed to develop prognosis analyses in order to understand how the effect of boat interactions on dolphins changes with variations in intensity.

AB Although deforestation and habitat loss are considered the main causes of wildlife depletion, the bushmeat trade is one of the foremost threats to biodiversity conservation in central Africa. In 1997 and 1998, we set up a bushmeat trade monitoring program in the town of Gamba to assess the pressure exerted on wildlife by the human population attracted by the oil industry in the Gamba Protected Areas Complex. During 279 days of observations, we recorded 19 mammal species, 4 bird species, and 7 reptile taxa, for a total of 2845 animal carcasses with an estimated weight of 189,728 kg. Even though the bushmeat trade is illegal in protected areas, calculation of annual production levels and hunting yields showed that this trade is not sustainable for some species. We calculated the ratio of bushmeat found in the markets of Gamba to the human population. Compared with other Gabonese towns, Gamba had the highest ratio in the country. We suggest that the oil industry is another contributor to the bushmeat crisis in central Africa. It is important to recognize the role of oil companies in the current crisis in order to heighten the awareness of the public and of oil companies and to seek ways of lessening the impact of the oil industry on the bushmeat trade in central Africa.

AB Farming in the Austrian Alps is small in scale and involves a high degree of manual labor. In the face of structural changes in agriculture, alpine farms are finding it increasingly difficult to remain economically viable. Organic farming presents a promising alternative for alpine farmers because it receives considerable financial support under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. Recent years have seen an increase in the number of organic farms in Austria in general, and in alpine areas in particular. Using data from an empirical study carried out in the alpine area of Solktaler, Austria, this paper examines the issues of how closely the regulations and principles of organic farming match farmers' perspectives on sustainable agriculture and whether or not organic farming is capable of building social-ecological resilience for local farms. Qualitative interviews and a series of workshops were used to learn about farmers' "desired system state" with regard to their region, disturbances to this system, and their perspectives on organic farming. The desired system in Solktaler as formulated by the farmers depicts a vivid farming community that manages a diverse traditional agricultural landscape and performs a number of ecological services. The desired system and the principles of organic farming have several aspects in common, and many management practices and features of the social system support social-ecological resilience. The vulnerability of farms increases, however, when farmers must deal with structural changes in agriculture, the erosion of traditional ecological knowledge, and societal transformation. In conclusion, organic farming is a tool that can be used to build social-ecological resilience for Solktaler farms, because it secures economic funding for the area and makes it possible to sustain environmentally benign practices. What remains is the question of whether the farming community is capable of reorganizing the social system under the pressures of modernization so that the desired system state can be reached.

AB The quest for an appropriate system of management for tropical ecosystems necessitates that ecologists consider the accumulated experiences of indigenous peoples in their long-term management of local resources, a subject of current ethnoecology. This paper provides data and empirical evidence of an indigenous multiple-use strategy (MUS) of tropical forest management existing in Mexico, that can be considered a case of adaptive management. This conclusion is based on the observation that some indigenous communities avoid common modernization routes toward specialized, unsustainable, and ecologically disruptive systems of production, and yet probably achieve the most successful tropical forest utilization design, in terms of biodiversity conservation, resilience, and sustainability. This analysis relies on an exhaustive review of the literature and the authors' field research. Apparently, this MUS represents an endogenous reaction of indigenous communities to the intensification of natural resource use, responding to technological, demographic, cultural, and economic changes in the contemporary world. This transforms traditional shifting cultivators into multiple-use strategists. Based on a case study, three main features (biodiversity, resilience, and permanence) considered relevant to achieving adaptive and sustainable management of tropical ecosystems are discussed.

AB If, like other ecosystems, the variable and dynamic ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest exhibited cycles and unpredictable behavior, particularly when humans were present, the indigenous societies of that region had to have been resilient in order to persist for such a long time. They persisted for two millennia prior to contact with people from the "old world." The Resilience Alliance (2002) proposes that social and ecological resilience requires three abilities: the ability to buffer, the ability to self-organize, and the ability to learn. This paper suggests that the characteristics of the potlatch system among Indians on the Northwest Coast, namely property rights, environmental ethics, rules of earning and holding titles, public accountability, and the reciprocal exchange system, provided all three required abilities. The resulting resilience of these societies confirms the validity of many of the ideas now being discussed as important components in providing successful and sustainable relationships between humans and their ecosystems. That so many separate ideas seem to have been linked together into resilient systems in the Pacific Northwest suggests that social ecological resilience is complicated.

ID SUSTAINABILITY; STRATEGIES
AB The paper describes experiments with FEARLUS, an agent-based model of land use change. The agents are satisficing (rather than optimizing) decision-makers. The paper focuses on the effects of varying agents' aspiration threshold: the economic return an agent requires from a parcel of land to persist with the current land use. If the threshold is not reached, the agent chooses a land use at random to apply to that parcel in the next year. It is shown that the optimum level for the aspiration threshold is affected by environmental heterogeneity and the level of return required to break even.

TI Making long-term economic growth more sustainable: evaluating the costs

LA English

ID NATURAL-RESOURCES; ENVIRONMENT; VULNERABILITY
AB Currently, traditional development issues such as economic stagnation, poverty, hunger, and illness as well as newer challenges like environmental degradation and globalisation demand attention. Sustainable development, including its economic, environmental and social elements, is a key goal of decisionmakers. Optimal economic growth has also been a crucial goal of both development theorists and practitioners. This paper examines the conditions under which optimal growth might be sustainable, by assessing the costs and benefits of growth. Key environmental and social aspects are considered. The Ecol-Opt-Growth-1 model analyses economic-ecological interactions, including resource depletion, pollution, irreversibility, other environmental effects, and uncertainty. It addresses some important issues, including savings, investment, technical progress, substitutability of productive factors, intergenerational efficiency, equity, and policies to make economic growth more sustainable-a basic element of the sustainomics framework. The empirical results support growing concerns that costs of growth may outweigh its benefits, resulting in unsustainability. Basically, in a wide range of circumstances, long term economic growth is unsustainable due to increasing environmental damage. Nevertheless, the model has many options that can be explored by policy makers, to make the development path more sustainable, as advocated by sustainomics. One example suggests that government supported abatement programs are needed to move towards sustainable development, since the model runs without abatement were infeasible. The optimal rate of abatement increases over time. Abatement of pollution is necessary to improve ecosystem viability and increase sustainability. Further research is necessary to seek conditions under which alternative economic growth paths are likely to become sustainable. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The tidal energy subsidy hypothesis postulates that the high primary productivity of coastal salt marshes is the result of an energy subsidy provided by the tides. The sediment component of this subsidy is especially important in contributing to the elevation increase of the marsh surface, a process essential for the sustainability of salt marshes during periods of sea level rise. This research tested the hypothesis that sediment subsidies have an ameliorating effect on sea level rise-induced impacts to salt marsh vigor. We assessed the plant structural and soil physico-chemical responses to different intensities of sediment subsidy in a salt marsh experiencing a high rate of relative sea level rise. Sediments were hydraulically dredged with a high fluid to solids ratio (85%:15%) from the Gulf of Mexico and dispersed into a Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh. Approximately 2 years after this fluid-sediment-enrichment, maximum sediment elevation did not exceed 30 cm above ambient and both plant cover and aboveground biomass responded positively. Sediment subsidy increased soil mineral matter, and, in turn, soil fertility and marsh elevation, and thereby reduced nutrient deficiency, flooding, and interstitial sulfide stresses. Thus, sediment subsidy generated a more favorable environment for plant growth and potentially, marsh sustainability. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB I studied the uses of the African cherry (Prunus africana) by four ethnic groups who live near the Kilum-Ijim Forest Preserve on Mount Oku, Cameroon. Prunus africana is valued for its timber, which is used for tool handles and for,fuel, and it is an important wildlife food. However, its greatest value is for traditional medicines. Healers use the bark and leaves to treat more than 30 human ailments and several animal diseases and it is the most important plant used in their practices. This study is the first to document this importance, particularly for animal medicines. I also examined the growing worldwide herbal use to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. Market demand has caused resource depletion and an erosion of traditional resource protection practices. Preservation of the species will depend on sustainable harvesting methods and on cultivation.

SO ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PINCH TECHNOLOGY; REFINERY; MILL; COST
AB The MIND (Method for analysis of INDustrial energy system) method has been developed for multiperiod cost optimization of industrial energy systems. Existing industrial processes can be represented at the desired level of accuracy, i.e. one modeling unit may represent a part of the production process or the whole plant. The optimization method includes both energy and material flows. Nonlinear relations, energy conversion efficiencies and investment costs are linearized by mixed-integer linear programming. A flexible time-scale facilitates the performance of long- and short-term analyses. In order to meet the requirements with regard to sustainable development, the recycling of energy and material flows is becoming more common in many industrial processes. The recycling or reuse of energy and material is managed by feedback loops, which are incorporated into the original MIND method to improve the model and reduce the calculation time. The improved MIND/F method (MIND method with feedback loops) model is applied to a pulp and paper mill in Sweden. A comparison between the original MIND method with manual handling of the feedback loops and the MIND/F method gives highly satisfactory results. Cost optimization using the improved MIND method is well within the given accuracy and computer time and manual calculation time are both reduced considerably. The reuse of energy and material resources is not only an economic advantage, but also implies a reduction of the environmental impact. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   passive house
AB A passive house is a cost-efficient building that can manage throughout the heating period, due to its specific construction design, with more than 10 times less heat energy than the same building designed to standards presently applicable across Europe. Its extended thermal insulation and enhanced air-tightness removes the need for temperatures higher than 50 degreesC. This makes renewable energy sources particularly suitable for heating, cooling and domestic hot water production. Modeling of renewable energy usage for space heating requires as a preliminary stage the detailed description of the building structure, of the HVAC equipment and of the internal heat sources. This paper shows the main data used to model the thermal behavior of a passive house. Details about Pirmasens Passive House (Rhineland Palatinate, Germany) are given, as for example, the internal heat sources, including electric appliances, heat and humidity released by human bodies, thermal internal facilities as hot and cold water pipes. All these are quantified by using statistically derived data. A detailed time schedule for a standard German family with two adults and two children was prepared.

ID SOLAR ABSORPTANCE
AB The evaluation of renewable energy used to increase the environmental friendliness of passive houses (PH) is the topic of this paper. A time-dependent model of passive house thermal behavior is developed. The heat-transfer through the high thermal inertia elements is analyzed by using a 1D time-dependent conduction heat-transfer equation that is solved numerically by using a standard Netlib solver (PDECHEB). Appropriate models for the conduction through the low thermal inertia elements are used, as well as a simple approach of the solar radiation transmission through the windows. The model takes into account in a detailed fashion the internal heat sources. Also, the operation of ventilation/heating system is described and common practice control strategies are implemented. Three renewable energy sources are considered. First, there is the passive solar heating due to the large window on the facade oriented south. Second, the active solar collectors system provides thermal energy for space heating or hot domestic water preparation. Third, a ground heat exchanger (GHE) increases the fresh air temperature during the cold season. The model was applied to the Pirmasens Passive House (Rhineland Palatinate, Germany). The passive solar heating system provides most part of the heating energy during November, December, February and March while in January the ground heat exchanger is the most important renewable energy source. January and February require use of additional conventional energy sources. A clever use of the active solar heating system could avoid consuming classical fuels during November, December and March. The ground heat exchanger is a reliable renewable source of energy. It provides heat during all the day and its (rather small) heat flux is increasing when the weather becomes colder. The air temperature at heater exit is normally lower than 46 degreesC. This is a good reason for the use of renewable energy to replace the classical fuel or the wood to be burn in the heater.

   development
AB Jiangsu is one of the provinces in China that have great population density and fast economic development. Therefore it is important to ensure large quantity of stable and high-quality energy supply for its development. With the development of the economy, the demand for energy is increasing very fast while the energy supply is going short. The supply of the local primary energy is only 23% of the demand. The final energy consumption reaches 78 Mtce (1 tce = 7,000,000 kcal), among which the industry and construction account for 78%. Though the total consumption is large, the energy consumption per capita is only 1.13 tce ,the electricity consumption per capita 1017kW, and the household electricity consumption per capita is 138kW. Coal accounts for about 76% of the total energy consumed. This paper discusses utilization ratio of energy and the serious pollution caused by energy consumption. (C) 2002 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Slash-and-burn is a widespread agricultural system practised by more than 250 million people in tropical regions. It is sustainable when fallow periods allow for the restoration of organic matter and nutrient losses that occur during the cropping phase. However, fallow periods have been reduced in most slash-and-burn systems as population density has increased. The consequent landscape structure modification occurring throughout this process can affect several ecological processes. As a first step in understanding these modifications, the present study aimed to test the effects of fallow period reduction on landscape structure by examining a total of 34 lots of 25-250 ha each in the north-east of the Brazilian Amazon. Sixteen lots with long fallow periods (about 10 years) were compared with 18 lots where fallow periods were reduced to c. four years. The reduction in fallow period created a more homogeneous landscape, largely dominated by agricultural and young secondary vegetation. The main mechanism leading to this homogenization was a more intensive use of initial secondary vegetation for agriculture. On average, the percentage of land used more intensively for agriculture was four times higher in short fallow period areas than in long-period areas. The increase in agricultural area is related to both an increase in the number of agricultural fields and also to an increase in the area of these fields. The proportions of forest and old secondary vegetation in the landscape were reduced as a consequence of a reduction in patch size, without significant fragmentation or patch losses. These structural changes appeared to be more usual in large properties belonging to several families. Further studies are needed to understand the consequences of these modifications for landscape functioning, but it is possible to speculate, based on previous studies, that these structural changes can lead to a reduction in the speed of regeneration processes.

AB In recent years, wildlife policies that consider the participation of stakeholders have been promoted. An understanding of the stakeholders' attitudes towards conservation and existing policies are critical in designing new policies or sustainable conservation strategies. This paper examines stakeholders' (local people, park staff and professional hunter guides) attitudes, towards the Benoue Wildlife Conservation Area (BWCA) and towards Cameroonian wildlife policy. The BWCA encompasses the Benoue National Park and its surrounding hunting concessions that also include some villages. Both the Park and the hunting concessions are two categories of protected areas. Data were collected using informal interviews and questionnaires administered to 114 households from three communities, 17 park staff and seven professional hunter guides. Local people's attitudes towards protected areas depended on the management category of the particular protected area. Local people were positive towards the existence of the Park, but negative towards the system of hunting concession areas. There was local variation between communities concerning these attitudes. Local people were generally positive to maintaining the present Park area, but preferred a reduction in the size of the hunting concessions. Both Park staff and professional hunter guides expressed concern about present management strategies and the extent of illegal resource exploitation. Despite having poor knowledge of the current Cameroonian wildlife policy, most of the local households expressed support for it, but called for increased local involvement in management, off-take and the harvesting of benefits from both Park and hunting concession activities. The Park staff were sceptical about local participation in this context and saw such endeavours as a threat to a sound biodiversity management scheme. The findings indicate the need to strengthen current wildlife policy, promote the involvement of local people and empower the Park staff, both in terms of resources and in terms of skills in interacting with local people. The revised policy should be designed so as to vary according to the category of protected area and allow site-specific adaptations. Local people must experience reduced incurred costs and increased incomes from the Park. An environmental education programme is recommended to extensively disseminate the policy to user groups in the area.

AB There are many environmental and socio-economic concerns about the shrimp aquaculture industry. This study, based on interviews, direct observations and literature reviews, shows that the Indian hatchery industry is heavily dependent upon the continuous support of natural resources and ecosystem services generated by marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. The mangrove ecosystem support area ('ecological footprint') needed to supply the hatcheries with Penaeus monodon shrimp broodstock, and the aquaculture grow-out ponds with postlarvae, exemplify the dependence on external ecosystems. Each hectare of mangrove in the Godavari River delta generated an annual fisheries catch of 0.8-1.5 P. monodon spawners (gravid females), valued at US$ 92-184. The entire Godavari mangrove delta had a partial gross economic value of US$ 3.0-6.0 million per year for the provision of shrimp spawners alone. The average hatchery, producing 75 million postlarvae annually, had an ecological footprint of 534 ha mangrove for the life-support input of shrimp spawners. The ecological footprint of intensive shrimp ponds was up to 11 times the pond area for postlarval input alone. The shrimp ponds in the State of Andhra Pradesh needed 35000-138000 ha of mangroves to satisfy the spawner requirement to hatcheries, and this implied a need to appropriate mangroves in other regions. Hatcheries were prepared to pay up to US$ 2000 for a single shrimp spawner, which also illustrated that the mangrove support areas regionally available were too small. Other concerns about the industry are the net loss of employment if hatcheries replace wild postlarvae collection, the extensive use of groundwater creating direct resource-use conflicts, by-catch problems in broodstock fisheries, and pollution by effluents. The risk of hatcheries introducing, amplifying and propagating disease affecting both cultured organisms and wild biota is another concern that can, and should, be addressed.

AB Selective logging applied in tropical forests is based on one universal criterion: a minimum diameter cutting limit for all commercial timber species. Minimum diameter cutting limits in mixed dipterocarp forests of the Malesia region lead to high felling intensities (10-20+ trees ha(-1)). Such extraction rates create massive stand damage (> 50% of the remaining tree population), which has a negative impact on the regeneration and growth of many harvested dipterocarp, species. As such, the minimum diameter cutting limit approach is seldom compatible with sustainable forest management. Where basic ecological characteristics of the commercial species are considered in timber harvesting prescriptions, mixed dipterocarp, forests appear capable of sustained timber yields, habitat conservation, and providing other goods and services. This paper first presents the main silvicultural systems developed in mixed dipterocarp, forests of Western Malesia and then reviews current knowledge of dipterocarp, biology to finally develop guidelines aimed at improving the ecological sustainability of production forests of Western Malesia. These guidelines, a pragmatic reflection of science and 'best guess' judgement, include: (1) integration of reduced-impact logging practices into normal management operations; (2) cutting of eight trees ha(-1) or less (with a felling cycle of 40-60 years to be determined according to local conditions); (3) defining minimum diameter cutting limits according to the structure, density and diameter at reproduction of target species; (4) avoiding harvesting species with less than one adult tree ha(-1) (diameter at breast height [dbh] greater than or equal to 50 cm over an area of 50-100 ha); (5) minimizing the size and connectivity of gaps (< 600 m(2) whenever possible); (6) refraining from treatments such as understorey clearing; and (7) providing explicit protection for key forest species and the ecological processes they perform. Further refinement is encouraged to allow for local conditions, and for other forest types.

AB What impact does ecological uncertainty have on agents' decisions concerning domestic emissions abatement, physical investments, and R&D expenditures? How sensitive are the answers to these questions when we move from exogenous to endogenous technical change? To investigate these issues we modify the ETC-RICE model described in Buonanno et al. ( 2001) by embedding in it a hazard rate function as in Bosello and Moretto ( 1999). With this model at hand we run numerical optimisations focusing our attention on the control variables of the representative agents, i.e., domestic abatement rate, investments in physical capital, and R&D spending, as well as on the endogenous patterns of GDP level and CO2 emissions. Our results show that uncertainty strongly influences agents behaviour; in particular, agents slow down their emissions in order to maintain a more sustainable growth path. In addition, R&D expenditures trigger the "engine of growth" exclusively when environmental technical change is formalized in an endogenous fashion. However, even if environmental uncertainty may stimulate technical change, long-run growth it turns out to be negatively affected by the former, as also predicted by Clarke and Reed ( 1994) Tsur and Zemel (1996) and Bosello and Moretto (1999).

AB Since the publication of the report entitled, Our Common Future, under the auspices of the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), also known as the Brundtland Commission, it has been generally acknowledged that the increasing use of non-renewable resources to support an increasing population has created an unsustainable situation. Should this rate of use be maintained, two dire consequences will follow: first, the future generations will be unable to maintain a high standard of living, and second, developing countries will have less of an opportunity to bring their living standards to a level comparable to that of the affluent West. The practice of chemical engineering, perhaps more than any other technical discipline, involves the use of natural material and energy resources for the production of value-added articles and services of commerce. It is critically important that chemists and chemical engineers incorporate the ideas of sustainability into process and product design, manufacturing, and value chain management for the purpose of minimizing resource utilization and adverse environmental impact. This paper deals with the ideas of sustainability, and what chemists and chemical engineers can do to prevent the consequences of unsustainable resource utilization.

AB Today's business climate demands significant shifts in how organizations deliver products and services to customers. Firms in many industrial sectors are effectively using management systems and life cycle assessments to understand and improve their operations, products, and services. But, a more comprehensive approach is needed to significantly reduce the pressure on natural systems, and to successfully respond to the increased complexity of business decision-making in the 21st century. This paper discusses life cycle management as an effective business strategy that can continually respond to these unique new challenges.

TI LCC - The economic pillar of sustainability: Methodology and application
   to wastewater treatment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB Industrial applications of supply chain cost management, along with life cycle costing of goods and services, are increasing. Several industrial sectors, in particular the automotive, electronics, and primary materials, have engaged in programs to coordinate upstream and downstream activities to reduce environmental burdens. At the same time, there is an increasing need to pass on information on product, material, and energy flows along the supply chain, as well as to provide data on the use and end-of-life phases of goods and services. Therefore, methods to analyze, assess, and manage these flows, from an economic as well as an environmental perspective, are of essential importance, particularly in established large-scale industries where suppliers are increasingly challenged to provide comprehensive cost and environmental information. in this context, a life cycle costing analysis (LCC) conducted aspart of life cycle management activities, can provide important opportunities. Therefore, this paper focuses on a life cycle assessment (LCA)-based LCC method, which utilizes an LCA model as a basis for cost estimations in product development and planning. A case study on life cycle costing of wastewater treatment illustrates the practical use and benefits of the method.

ID GREEN CHEMISTRY; HYDROCARBONS; CATALYSIS; METRICS
AB Chemical and engineering research over the past several years has seen a dramatic increase in activity in the area of green chemistry. As these developments continue, it is reasonable that some of these chemistries or technologies have the potential to be implemented on the plant scale. With this in mind, a new green technology will most certainly have a potential impact on the sustainability of a process. It should also be noted that although a "green" technology may appear environmentally friendly, there currently is no all-inclusive methodology for assessing the actual sustainability of the chemical reaction or process. In order to assess a process, a set of sustainability indicators, or metrics, are required.
   Research within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has laid the foundation for an indicator model, GREENSCOPE (Gauging Reaction Effectiveness for the ENvironmental Sustainability of Chemistries with a multi-Objective Process Evaluator), that evaluates a particular reaction or process for sustainability in the following areas: Environment, Energy, Efficiency, and Economics. These four Es provide a quantitative definition of process sustainability, and allow for a direct comparison between two similar processes with differing reaction chemistries or process technologies. These aspects of sustainable chemical research will also be of importance as bench processes are scaled up to sustainable industrial processes.

TI Do bio-based products move us toward sustainability? A look at three
   USEPA case studies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB The movement to buy "environmentally-friendly" products was recently reinvigorated by the signing of the 2002 Farm Act that requires all federal agencies to give preference to products made, in whole or significant part, from bio-based material. This paper addresses the reality behind widely held beliefs regarding "green" issues, and shows bow complex it can be to choose among alternative products. Examples are presented in which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) used different approaches, all based on life cycle assessment (LCA), to evaluate the environmental trade-offs of bio-based alternatives. These examples incorporate various combinations of life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA).
   The first example presents results of a USEPA Office of Research & Development (ORD) project called the Framework for Responsible Environmental Decision-Making (FRED). The FRED framework uses a set of impact categories in an LCIA. Motor oil, wall insulation, and asphalt coating alternatives were all studied using FRED. The second example is a pilot study in the USEPA's Environmentally Preferable Purchasing program. Using a mix of LCI and LCIA, transformer oil and bard surface cleaner alternatives were evaluated. Finally, the paper presents preliminary LCI results of another ORD effort comparing fuel additives ethanol and MTBE. These examples demonstrate that the move to bio-based products is not an across-the-board "win" for the environment. While LCAs cannot, at this time, provide a definitive answer as to the prefer-ability of bio-based products, it is the best tool to identify environmental trade-offs, thereby providing additional information to support decision-making.

AB Canada is on a journey toward sustainable development. From early steps in the 1900s to better protect and manage our water resources, through to today's international negotiations to address complex global challenges, such as loss of biodiversity, poverty, and climate change, the journey continues.

AB Today's environmental problems are associated, to a great extent, with the industrialized world's consumption of goods and services. Consumption leads to different kinds of environmental impacts from all parts of a product's life cycle: raw material extraction, production, use, recovery, and final disposal, including transportation throughout the cycle. Working with products embraces many different environmental problems, instruments and mechanisms, stakeholders, various policy areas, etc. The current structure of industry and the considerable amount of international trade requires a strategy that takes these conditions into account in advancing sustainable production and consumption. The European Union has developed an Integrated Product Policy, built on life cycle thinking, in order to reduce resource use.
   The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) was commissioned by the Swedish Government in 2001 to develop the Integrated Product Policy (IPP). The aim of IPP is to minimize the impact of products on human health and the environment throughout their life cycles, from cradle-to-grave, to improve sustainable production and consumption, and advance the government's environmental quality objectives. SEPA studied how instruments and mechanisms can work together and be made more effective, and what new instruments and mechanisms might be needed to achieve the goals laid down in IPP. This paper presents the results of the study.

TI Germany's strategy for sustainable development
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article
AB In April of 2002, the Federal Government of Germany outlined its "Strategy for Sustainable Development." It includes 21 targets and indicators for sustainable development, and outlines perspectives for a 21st century Germany, that is sustainable into the future. The aim of this strategy is a careful balance between the needs of today's generation and the life perspectives of future generations. This paper presents the main thrusts behind Germany's plans to maintain that balance. Adapted from a press release issued announcing the strategy, it identifies seven "priority action" areas, where "changes of course" are needed to achieve a system of sustainable development. These focus points represent, in concrete form, principles of sustainable development relevant to actions of the Federal Government and other players.

AB We are interested in three related questions: ( 1) How should accounting prices be estimated? ( 2) How should we evaluate policy change in an imperfect economy? ( 3) How can we check whether intergenerational well-being will be sustained along a projected economic programme? We do not presume that the economy is convex, nor do we assume that the government optimizes on behalf of its citizens. We show that the same set of accounting prices should be used both for policy evaluation and for assessing whether or not intergenerational welfare along a given economic path will be sustained. We also show that a comprehensive measure of wealth, computed in terms of the accounting prices, can be used as an index for problems ( 2) and ( 3) above. The remainder of the paper is concerned with rules for estimating the accounting prices of several specific environmental natural resources, transacted in a few well known economic institutions.

TI EcoWorx, Green Engineering Principles in Practice
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The 12 Principles of Green Engineering have been proposed as a framework within which to examine existing products and guide their redesign as well as to evaluate new product designs. The EcoWorx system represents a recyclable carpet tile product that is assessed using the 12 Principles of Green Engineering and cradle-to-cradle design principles to evaluate environmental, qualitative, and economic performance as compared to existing Shaw carpet tile products. The product design strategy embodies life cycle considerations of a cradle-to-cradle product that puts technical nutrient recovered materials into repeated use. EcoWorx offers a unique opportunity for Shaw to utilize the 12 Principles to analyze and optimize new products and processes for the additional capacity needed to meet rising demand for sustainable carpet products. The analysis of the EcoWorx system demonstrated the value of the 12 Principles in verifying and formalizing the experience and intuition of product designers. This suggests that the mistrial and error reliance on experience could be enhanced with this formalized approach and hence lead to more widespread success of design practices that result in sustainable products.

AB A case is made for growth of a new metadiscipline of sustainability science and engineering. This new field integrates industrial, social, and environmental processes in a global context. The skills required for this higher level discipline represent a metadisciplinary endeavor, combining information and insights across multiple disciplines and perspectives with the common goal of achieving a desired balance among economic, environmental, and societal objectives. Skills and capabilities that are required to support the new metadiscipline are summarized. Examples of integrative projects are discussed in the areas of sustainability metrics and integration of industrial, societal, and environmental impacts. It is clear that a focus on green engineering that employs pollution prevention and industrial ecology alone are not sufficient to achieve sustainability, because even systems with efficient material and energy use can overwhelm the carrying capacity of a region or lead to other socially unacceptable outcomes.

AB Pursuit of sustainable development requires a systems approach to the design of industrial product and service systems. Although many business enterprises have adopted sustainability goals, the actual development of sustainable systems remains challenging because of the broad range of economic, environmental and social factors that need to be considered across the system life cycle. Traditional systems engineering practices try to anticipate and resist disruptions but may be vulnerable to unforeseen factors. An alternative is to design systems with inherent "resilience" by taking advantage of fundamental properties such as diversity, efficiency, adaptability, and cohesion. Previous work on sustainable design has focused largely upon ecological efficiency improvements. For example, companies have found that reducing material and energy intensity and converting wastes into valuable secondary products creates value for shareholders as well as for society at large. To encourage broader systems thinking, a design protocol is presented that involves the following steps: identifying system function and boundaries, establishing requirements, selecting appropriate technologies, developing a system design, evaluating anticipated performance, and devising a practical means for system deployment. The approach encourages explicit consideration of resilience in both engineered systems and the larger systems in which they are embedded.

TI Industrial applications using BASF eco-efficiency analysis: Perspectives
   on green engineering principles
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Life without chemicals would be inconceivable, but the potential risks and impacts to the environment associated with chemical production and chemical products are viewed critically. Eco-efficiency analysis considers the economic and life cycle environmental effects of a product or process, giving these equal weighting. The major elements of the environmental assessment include primary energy use, raw materials utilization, emissions to all media, toxicity, safety risk, and land use. The relevance of each environmental category and also for the economic versus the environmental impacts is evaluated using national emissions and economic data. The eco-efficiency analysis method of BASF is briefly presented, and results from three applications to chemical processes and products are summarized. Through these applications, the eco-efficiency analyses mostly confirm the 12 Principles listed in Anastas and Zimmerman with the exception that, in one application, production systems based on bio-based feedstocks were not the most eco-efficient as compared to those based on fossil resources. Over 180 eco-efficiency analyses have been conducted at BASF, and their results have been used to support strategic decision-making, marketing, research and development, and communication with external parties. Eco-efficiency analysis, as one important strategy and success factor in sustainable development, will continue to be a very strong operational tool at BASF.

AB The built environment, defined by the facilities and civil infrastructure systems that people use, is the fundamental foundation upon which a society exists, develops, and survives. As the main provider and the life cycle custodian of the built environment, the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry plays a critical role in determining the quality, integrity, and longevity of this foundation. In the execution of these two roles, provider and custodian, the AEC industry has had a major direct and indirect impact on the natural environment, contributing both directly and indirectly to natural resource depletion and degradation, waste generation and accumulation, and environmental impact and degradation. These impacts are not unique to the AEC industry. Other industries face similar challenges, and for many years, a wide range of constituencies within them have been attempting the implementation of the concept of sustainability within what these industries do, how they do it, and with what as a possible mechanism to slow, reduce, eliminate these impacts, and even restore conditions to a better state. In the pursuit of sustainability, the AEC industry faces challenges posed by the unique attributes and characteristics nature of facilities and civil infrastructure systems, the complexities of the current processes for their delivery and use, and the diverse set of resources required for both their delivery and their use. This paper offers a road map and an initial set of principles to implement built environment sustainability as a starting point for an ongoing, industry-wide dialogue and debate.

AB We define key research questions as a stimulus to research in the area of industrial ecology. The first group of questions addresses analytical support for green engineering and environmental policy. They relate to (i) tools for green engineering, (ii) improvements in life cycle assessment, (iii) aggregation of environmental impacts, and (iv) effectiveness of a range of innovative policy approaches. The second group of questions addresses the dynamics of technology, economics, and environmental impacts. They relate to (v) the environmental impacts of material and energy consumption, (vi) the potential for material efficiency, (vii) the relation of technological and economic development to changes in consumption patterns, and (viii) the potential for technology to overcome environmental impacts and constraints. Altogether, the questions create an intellectual agenda for industrial ecology and integrate the technological and social aspects of sustainability.

AB To achieve sustainability, resource consumption and waste generation must be drastically decreased. For societal acceptance, preservation of both quality of life and corporate profits are essential. One promising approach is to shift the source of value from the amount of product sold to the quality of services the product provides. This paper describes the need for redesigning recycling systems from a manufacturing perspective and then discusses the possibility of this "servicification" of products, describing our experience with prototype development. We discuss development of product prototypes and their business, using consumer facsimile machines as an example of "service-oriented products". Traditional thought presumes that only products comprising new materials and components are valuable. Consideration of a service-oriented product can serve as a stimulus to revise this mode of thought and to control delivery and quality of disposed products. This paper also provides a life cycle simulation of the developed service-oriented business. Simulation results indicate that service-oriented business can potentially reduce environmental impact while extending business opportunities from the viewpoint of whole product life cycles.

AB The number of light vehicle registrations is forecast to increase worldwide by a factor of 3-5 over the next 50 years. This will dramatically increase environmental impacts worldwide of automobiles and light trucks. If light vehicles are to be environmentally sustainable globally, the automotive industry must implement fundamental changes in future automotive design. Important factors in assessing automobile design needs include fuel economy and reduced emissions. Many design parameters can impact vehicle air emissions and energy consumption including alternative fuel or engine technologies, rolling resistance, aerodynamics, drive train design, friction, and vehicle weight. Of these, vehicle weight is key and will translate into reduced energy demand across all energy distribution elements. A new class of vehicles is needed that combines ultra-light design with a likely hybrid or fuel cell engine technology. This could increase efficiency by a factor of 3-5 and reduce air emissions as well. Advanced lightweight materials, such as plastics or composites, will need to overtake the present metal-based infrastructure. Incorporating design features to facilitate end-of-life recycling and recovery is also important. The trend will be towards fewer materials and parts in vehicle design, combined with ease of disassembly. Mono-material construction can create vehicle design with improved recyclability as well as reduced numbers of parts and weight.

AB We examine the possibilities for a "greener" car that would use less material and fuel, be less polluting, and would have a well-managed end-of-life. Light-duty vehicles are fundamental to our economy and will continue to be for the indefinite future. Any redesign to make these vehicles greener requires consumer acceptance. Consumer desires for large, powerful vehicles have been the major stumbling block in achieving a "green car". The other major barrier is inherent contradictions among social goals such as fuel economy, safety, low emissions of pollutants, and low emissions of greenhouse gases, which has led to conflicting regulations such as emissions regulations blocking sales of direct injection diesels in California, which would save fuel. In evaluating fuel/vehicle options with the potential to improve the greenness of cars [diesel (direct injection) and ethanol in internal combustion engines, battery-powered, gasoline hybrid electric, and hydrogen fuel cells], we find no option dominates the others on all dimensions. The principles of green design developed by Anastas and Zimmerman and the use of a life cycle approach provide insights on the key sustainability issues associated with the various options.

TI Plastics disassembly versus bulk recycling: Engineering design for
   end-of-life electronics resource recovery
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PRODUCT; MODEL; METHODOLOGY
AB Annual plastic flows through the business and consumer electronics manufacturing supply chain include nearly 3 billion lb of high-value engineering plastics derived from petroleum. The recovery of resource value from this stream presents critical challenges in areas of materials identification and recycling process design that demand new green engineering technologies applied together with life cycle assessment and ecological supply chain analysis to create viable plastics-to-plastics supply cycles. The sustainable recovery of potentially high-value engineering plastics streams requires that recyclers either avoid mixing plastic parts or purify later by separating smaller plastic pieces created in volume reduction (shredding) steps. Identification and separation constitute significant barriers in the plastics-to-plastics recycling value proposition. In the present work, we develop a model that accepts randomly arriving electronic products to study scenarios by which a recycler might identify and separate high-value engineering plastics as well as metals. Using discrete event simulation, we compare current mixed plastics recovery with spectrochemical plastic resin identification and subsequent sorting. Our results show that limited disassembly with whole-part identification can produce substantial yields in separated streams of recovered engineering thermoplastics. We find that disassembly with identification does not constitute a bottleneck, but rather, with relatively few workers, can be configured to pull the process and thus decrease maximum staging space requirements.

AB Groundwater is a strategic resource due to its usually high quality and perennial availability. However, groundwater management all over the world often lacks sustainability as evidenced by falling water tables, drying wetlands, increasing sea-water intrusion and general deterioration of water quality. As groundwater cannot be renewed artificially on a large scale, sustainable management of this resource is vital. A number of scientific tools are available to assist in his task. Three items are discussed here. They include methods for the determination of groundwater recharge, groundwater modeling including the estimation of its uncertainty, and the interfacing to the socio-economic field. Generally the quality of water management work can be largely enhanced with new tools available, including remote sensing, digital terrain models, differential GPS, environmental tracers, automatic data collection, modeling and the coupling of models from different disciplines.

AB Two political geographers survey Kyrgyzstan's increasingly less democratic trajectory over the 12 years since independence in 1991, despite initial promises of fair government, open media, and a liberal economy accessible to all groups within the country. Although Kyrgyzstan is increasingly racked by poverty as well as regional, ethnic, and religious rivalries, the paper demonstrates that the country has some of the most active and dynamic social movements in Central Asia. The authors examine the level and type of non-governmental organizations as an index of civic engagement, one of the foundations of sustainable democracy. Their survey of NGO activists revealed a group that strongly supported democratic norms but also revealed significant distrust of many governmental institutions.

AB Input Output Accounting systems (IOAs) can be used to identify farming practices which are not 'environmentally neutral' and thus unlikely to be sustainable in the long term. In an EU sponsored project, European countries were surveyed and over 50 farm level IOAs identified. The subjects covered by the IOAs included nutrients, pesticides, energy, soil/habitat, conservation, wastes (e.g. packaging and tyres) and other items such as veterinary products. Nearly half the IOAs covered more than one subject and nutrient budgets were the most commonly included (91% of the IOAs studied). Looking at the 30 single subject systems, most (26) were nutrients with only three pesticide and one energy based system. In total 50 systems covered nutrients. Overall, where specified, nutrient budgets covered nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in 13 cases, N and P in 12 cases, N only in nine and P only in four cases. The most common indicators for nutrient budgets were calculation of a balance followed by nitrate leached. The method by which indicators were evaluated and presented to farmers varied. Farming sectors were not equally represented with systems for the arable, dairy and pig sectors the most common. Farmers received a detailed interpretation of their results in two thirds of the systems, most commonly related to official limits or targets. Most of the systems were developed to reduce adverse environmental impacts and 65% of the systems were considered by the respondents to have had a positive environmental impact by reducing surpluses or improving waste disposal. Use of five of the systems could lead to a marketing advantage via certified produce with a recognised quality label. Where factual evidence as to effectiveness was available, the benefits varied between subject types (nutrients, energy and pesticides) and between sectors. Farmers' responses to the systems were generally positive and they appear to be a useful way of raising awareness of environmental problems. However, economic issues need to be considered, if the costs to the farmer outweigh the benefits, uptake will not be sustained. The type and nature of the interpretation is also important as the most successful IOAs in terms of continued use and interest appeared to be those where there was regular technical input from an adviser. Overall IOAs could offer a useful too] for voluntary improvement in agri-environmental performance on topics that are not already strongly regulated. But more studies are needed to ensure that farmers in reality change their behaviour and to develop the use of reference values. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One aim of this paper was to present flows and balances of K, P, and Zn at a barn level for an organic and a conventional farming system, and compare the systems with respect to agronomic sustainability. A second aim was to identify internal on-farm flows of major concern for the environment. We define barn balance as the balance between element flows entering and leaving the barn. The flows of potassium (K), phosphorus (P), and zinc (Zn) through the barn compartments were separated between an organically and a conventionally managed farming system. The study comprised 1 year. The area of the organic system was 59 ha and that of the conventional system 45 ha, with 50 dairy cows in each system. Feed, bedding, tap water, and milk were recorded and sampled monthly. The manure and urine were sampled in conjunction with spreading. In comparison with the organic system, the conventional system produced more milk per cow and per hectare, but to reach that target, the conventional system was more dependent on land outside the farm for feed production than the organic system. As a consequence, the total internal flows from feed crop production were larger in the organic system. The concentration of K in organic silage was significantly lower than that in conventional silage. The concentrations of K, P, and Zn in the other materials studied did not differ between systems. The barn balances of the two systems were similar to each other. The study showed a large internal flow of K, equal flows of P, and smaller internal flows of Zn within a dairy farm as compared to the animal-associated flows through the farm gate. For K, about 70% of the total amount in farm feed crops and purchased feed was recovered in recorded outputs. For P the recovery was close to 100%, whereas for Zn, more of the element was found in the outflow than in the inflow. The imbalances of K and Zn represented flows that would not have been recognised in a farm-gate balance, but which could have a considerable impact on soil accumulation, long-term soil fertility, and losses to the surrounding environment.

AB Accumulation of heavy metals in agricultural soils may cause serious problems for soil quality, groundwater and food chains. Based on the databases of the Swiss agricultural statistics and on data from experimental farms, we modelled regional-scale mass balances of phosphorus (P), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) and their uncertainties for a large number of arable and dairy farms in the northwest of Switzerland using the model PROTERRA-S. Large differences in P fertilization characteristics between these farm types were found. Crop demand for P on arable farms were primarily met through additions of inorganic fertilizers and sewage sludge, while on dairy farms the largest P input was provided by animal manure. Average model calculations predicted an enrichment between 0.8 and 1.9 g ha(-1) per year for Cd and between 76 and 525 g ha(-1) per year for Zn for soils of arable and dairy farms, respectively. Hence, according to our analyses, current agricultural land use is not sustainable in terms of soil quality standards. Predicted accumulation of Cd in soil was larger for arable crops than for grassland, while the opposite was true for Zn. Analyzing scenarios of changes in P fertilization management showed that Cd and Zn enrichment in soil was more sensitive to decreasing net P inputs to arable farms than to dairy farms. When uncertainty of input data was taken into account, large variances of the calculated accumulation rates were found. Coefficient of variation of the net fluxes ranged between 56 and 162% for Cd, and between 46 and 82% for Zn, and distribution functions of the net fluxes indicated that in some soils, particularly under grassland, also a depletion of Zn and Cd may occur. Hypothetical steady-state soil concentrations of Cd were estimated to exceed average soil threshold concentration on arable farms, while steady-state Zn concentrations in soils of dairy farms were on average below the corresponding threshold value. However, if the uncertainty of these Zn estimates was considered, a significant part of the distribution exceeded the threshold value. The results of our study demonstrate that information on variation in element balances is beneficial. Average flux balances alone do not provide sufficient information for an adequate assessment of sustainable land use. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Element balances are widely used and are incorporated within national action programs to combat nutrient emissions from agriculture to the environment. They rely on data that are readily available at farm-gate and field level, and the information generated is easy to communicate to farmers and policy makers. This may have contributed to high expectations on element balances as a tool for optimising agricultural nutrient use efficiency and thereby reducing nutrient losses. Element balances are potentially useful as a screening tool across Europe provided the methods to calculate them are standardised, their limitations and usefulness defined and appropriate target values are established by which they can be compared. It is difficult to establish straightforward relationships between nutrient management, surplus, losses and environmental impact. Simple farm-gate and field balances need to be complemented by a better understanding of the processes regulating nutrient dynamics, and their spatial and temporal variability. Hence, agronomic and environmental reference or target values need to be established for different production systems, geographical areas and elements. Proper instruments and tools as well as training and educational programmes have to be developed for a successful implementation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the search for sustainable agricultural methods for industrial crops, peppermint (Mentha piperita) was strip intercropped with soybean (Glycine max). Intercropping peppermint with soybean resulted in yield and quality increases in the essential oil, compared to sole peppermint cultivation. The yield was higher by about 50% on an equal land area basis and higher percentages of menthol and lower percentages of menthofuran and menthyl acetate improved the quality of the oil. Intercropped peppermint leaf number per node, leaf area, perimeter and leaf area index (LAI) were greater along with the internode length and thickness, when compared to monocultured plants. Total leaf peltate trichome number was higher in intercropped peppermint plants and was positively correlated with greater essential oil productivity. Leaf and stem dry weight were higher in intercropped peppermint. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid content also increased in intercropped peppermint plants, whereas no variation was found for total soluble protein. In peppermint, no significant differences were found in the CO2 compensation point between the two cropping systems, whereas intercropped plants showed a higher stomatal conductance at low CO2 concentration. The relationship between primary and secondary peppermint plant metabolism was also discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A perspective on marine reserves as a fishery management tool
SO FISHERIES
LA English
DT Article
ID GULF-OF-MEXICO; CONSERVATION; POPULATIONS; SHARK
AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) are portions of the marine environment which are protected from some or all human activity. Where extraction of living resources is forbidden, these MPAs are best referred to as marine reserves. Often these are proposed as a safeguard against collapse of fish stocks, although reserves may have numerous other beneficial purposes. However, as a tool for fisheries management, where optimal and/or maximum sustainable yield is the objective, I submit that reserves are generally not as effective as traditional management measures, and are not appropriate for the vast majority of marine species. This is because most marine species are far too mobile to remain within a reserve and/or are not overfished. However, in the United States, of those marine fishes that are experiencing overfishing or are overfished, most have come under management within the last decade, employing more traditional fishery management measures, and are experiencing recovery. For those few species which could receive benefit, creation of reserves would have an adverse effect on harvest potentials of sympatric forms.

AB Non-equilibrium production models were used to provide guidance/information on the exploitation level of the main deep-water crustacean fishery in the western Mediterranean. Annual catch and effort (engine horsepower) data from 1957 to 2001 were used to compute a long data series of catch per unit effort (CPUE) as kg/HP. Furthermore, a sampling program on-board the trawl fleet in the Balearic Islands was carried out between 1991 and 2001 to estimate the annual CPUE in kg/h. Both CPUE data series were used to fit non-equilibrium production models. Process-error estimators were applied to the Fox model and observation-error estimators to the Schaefer model. Parameter estimates obtained from the short CPUE data series were unreliable and highly uncertain for both models, mainly due to insufficient contrast in the data between 1991 and 2001. The parameter triplet k, r, and q (i.e. the carrying capacity, intrinsic rate of biomass increase and catchability coefficient), as estimated with the CPUE (kg/HP) data series from 1957 to 2001, gave 1814 t, 0.327 per year and 0.054 for the Fox model and 3656 t, 0.226 per year and 0.019 for the Schaefer model. These results were used to calculate biological reference points. Maximum sustainable yield, Y-MSY, was estimated at 218 t (Fox) and 210 t (Schaefer). Parameter estimates were less variable for the Schaefer model and these were therefore used for management recommendations. Currently, catches are 30% below the Y-MSY, suggesting that red shrimp (RS) is slightly under-exploited. A precautionary fishing effort was estimated taking into account W, uncertainty of the parameters. Consequently, a fishing effort corresponding to a biomass level of 60% of the carrying capacity,f(60%k), was adopted. At the current fishing effort, catches in 2002 remain at recent levels. Nevertheless, taking into account the precautionary approach in the fisheries, it is recommended that catches in 2003 should not exceed approximately 100 t, so that the long-term catch would correspond to f(60%k), which is estimated to be around 200 t.
   Despite the simplifying assumptions of production models, the correct use of these models can provide an insight into species/fishery dynamics and can be used to analyse the effect of changes in the level of fishing level on catches. It should be noted, however, that the perception of the exploitation level of RS presented in this study should be further validated. It is recommended that the sampling program to collect data on fishing effort (fishing hours) should be continued allowing the non-equilibrium production models, both with frequencist and Bayesian approaches, to be applied to a longer CPUE (kg/h) data series.

AB Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the performance of a size-structured stock assessment method of the type commonly employed to assess rock lobster populations in Australia and New Zealand. The simulations consider the impact of measurement error and process error in catchability and the length at 50% selectivity, as well as the implications of pooling data across populations that differ in terms of growth rate. The ability to estimate the virgin biomass depends critically on having catch-rate or size-composition data for earliest years of exploitation; in the absence of such data the estimates can be highly biased and imprecise. Several of the reference points commonly reported for assessment purposes (e.g. the biomass at which maximum sustainable yield is achieved) are, however, based on the estimate of the virgin biomass. Estimation performance (bias and precision of estimated quantities) deteriorates with increasing process error. For most of the scenarios examined, the expected benefits of increased precision arising from pooling data across spatial zones are not realized and better performance can be achieved by conducting assessments at the level of population and subsequently aggregating results spatially.

AB The US Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act mandates precautionary management to attain near maximum sustainable yield (MSY)-producing stock and exploitation levels on a long-term basis. Various biological reference points (BRPs) have been suggested as surrogates for MSY-producing instantaneous fishing mortality (F-MSY) and total stock biomass (SSB(F-MSY)), which are largely derived from finfish biological and fisheries characteristics, for poorly understood stocks. BRP estimation for some crab fisheries has been complicated by the fact that only males are harvested and that recruitment, in many instances, is largely driven by environmental factors rather than density-dependent responses. For managing Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands crab stocks, instantaneous natural mortality (M) is used as a proxy for F-MSY, and mean annual total mature stock biomass during 1983-1997 is used for SSB(F-MSY). In this paper, harvest rate- and biomass-based BRPs were determined using crab-specific parameters for Bristol Bay red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus). Effective spawning stock biomass-per-recruit for combined sexes was estimated by length-based analysis and used in conjunction with Beverton-Holt and Ricker stock-recruit (S-R) models for various parametric values to explore the trends in MSY-producing legal male harvest rate at the time of the fishery (E(F-MSY)), as a proportion of stock harvested; log(10) of (F-MSY/M) ratio; and total mature stock biomass ratio SSB(F-MSY)/SSB(0), where SSB(0) was the virgin total mature stock biomass. The F-MSY exceeded M for most cases. For a plausible S-R shape parameter (tau) range = 0.3-0.5, M = 0.3, handling mortality proportion = 0.2, and instantaneous bycatch mortality = 0.01; the SSB(F-MSY) ranged from 58 to 74% of SSB(0) for the mating ratio 1:1, and 40-55% of SSB(0) for the mating ratio 1:3. The E(F-MSY) ranged 16-35% for the mating ratio 1:1, and 40-79% for the mating ratio 1:3. The E(F-MSY) was more sensitive to mating ratio and handling mortality than bycatch mortality. Considering the uncertainty in stock parameters and recruitment, a precautionary legal male target harvest rate below 18% was suggested to rebuild the stock equal to or above 66% of the pristine total mature biomass.

AB Making forest policies that help bridge from the current situation to a sustainable future requires sound scientific information. Too often, scientific information is available, yet policy makers do not use it. At a workshop in Costa Rica, attendees from the Americas reviewed 16 case studies where forest science influenced forest policies and identified six reasons. Two reasons related to the content of research programs and four to personal characteristics of researchers. Research programs that practice continuous innovation and adaptive management retained their relevancy to policy makers. Market-based and incentive approaches work better than regulatory ones, so economic and social sciences are critical parts of the research portfolio. Key attributes of influential scientists include an understanding of the policy process and how it differs from the science process; a willingness to engage in the policy arena and bear the associated risks, an adeptness at communicating early and often, matching the means and message to various audiences; and a penchant for collaboration that builds the trust essential to influence policy.

ID S-AND-T; INNOVATION
AB During the 1990s, a number of major changes occurred in forest policy in British Columbia. The Forest Practices Code was enacted in 1994, based largely on the best available science at the time. The Code was highly prescriptive, and is believed to have substantially increased the costs of forest operations in the province. Following criticisms of the Code and the financial burden it imposed, some revisions were introduced. In the same period (the second half of the 1990s). the provincial government announced a number of programs ostensibly aimed at introducing innovation to the forest sector, but in reality more closely associated with creating employment. Three forms of pilot projects were started: the innovative Forest Practices Agreements, the Results-based Forest Practices Code Pilot Projects and the Community Forest Pilots. To date, these have met with limited success, although it is possible that with time, they may generate the type of information sought by the government. Unfortunately, links to research have sometimes been weak. reflecting a declining investment in forestry sector research and development in the province. Closer links between research and the stimulation of innovation would lead to greater chances of success for the programs attempting to improve the scientific basis of forest management in British Columbia.

AB The different sectors of the economy, and the forest sector in particular, must create innovations in order to survive and to be competitive. Scientific knowledge should be introduced and institutionalized into the forest processes, but also knowledge derived from other sources such as user producer relationships and others should be incorporated. A new concept is emerging that considers that the economy should learn not only from the new scientific knowledge but also from the rest of the processes. This concept is National Systems of Innovation (created in 1985 in the Scandinavian countries), however, here the concept is broadened of a Sustainable System of Innovation. This approach of sustainable systems of innovation (SSI), considers that the sources for innovation towards development, particularly sustainable development, are formal organisations (universities, research centres, or so), the productive structure (the economy). the institutional set-up (patterns of behaviour), the economy-ecology relationships (potential and limitations of the ecosystem for production) and the policies of the sector. Each one of these factors interact and feed each other. They cannot be seen independently nor static; on the contrary, they are dynamic and evolutionary, without any doubt including the ecosystem. Then, the process of learning from all these sources, which is the base for SSI, may produce 'greener' innovations, greener technologies and greener institutions. Innovations related to forest services from Costa Rica will illustrate these ideas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB From a conceptual point of view, national forest management standards in Latin American countries have progressed significantly in recent years. Examples include the Costa Rican Standards and Procedures for Sustainable Forest Management and Certification, developed by the National Commission for Forest Certification and in Nicaragua, the National Institute of Forestry proposal of principles, criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management. In line with general approaches worldwide, these national standards primarily focus on the fulfillment of sound forest practice. There is comparatively little emphasis on the assessment of management outcomes or changes in key components of the eco- and social-systems that result from management impacts. Essentially, there is little emphasis on adaptive management, though arguments that management cannot be sustainable if it is not adaptive are persuasive. This study sought to contribute to the development of standards that include elements for adaptive management that define. communicate and evaluate sustainable forest management in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Elements from the national standards and the CIFOR generic C&I template (predominantly focused on forest management outcomes) were used as a starting point. The basic research process consisted of three phases of evaluation (in-office, desk and field). The evaluations were carried out by multidisciplinary, international groups of experts in forest ecology, management and policy. This study demonstrated the value of forums and workshops that facilitate exchange between forest scientists and policymakers; the innovation and application of a practical, applicable and scientifically based methodology for developing national level CI; and acceptance of this methodology by key players in the fields of forest management and policy. These experiences and the resulting proposals of C&I for the evaluation of ecologically sustainable forest management are expected to be used as points of reference for future development of forest policy in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and to contribute to the overall understanding of C&I development processes in the region.

AB Numerous efforts around the world are underway to apply the Montreal criteria and indicators to assess the sustainability of temperate and boreal forests. In this paper, we describe a logic-based system for evaluating the sustainability of forests at regional and national levels. We believe that such a system can make evaluation of sustainability more consistent and transparent. This effort also makes two points abundantly clear: (1) a systematic way to organize expert judgment about ecological, economic, social and institutional relationships (here, using 'fuzzy logic') is crucial to building such a system and (2) that the structure of this logic-based system reflects a policy framework and a series of decisions about values and what is meant by 'sustainability'.

AB Multicriteria decision analysis is applied to ecosystem management planning in a forest landscape. Ten alternative action plans were evaluated employing five criteria. For some criteria, cardinal measures with their associated uncertainties were obtained. For other criteria, only ordinal (ranking) information was available. The Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis with Ordinal criteria (SMAA-O) method was used, as it accommodates both cardinal and ordinal data. This is the first application of SMAA methods to forest management. SMAA-O represents inaccurate or uncertain cardinal criteria measurements by a joint probability distribution. Ordinal data is converted into stochastic cardinal data by simulating mappings between ordinal and cardinal scales that preserve the given rankings. At the same time, the unknown or partly known preferences of the decision maker are simulated by choosing weights randomly from appropriate distributions. The main results of the analysis are "acceptability indices" that describe the variety of different weights that support an alternative for a given rank. The special characteristics of SMAA-O are best utilized in problems involving uncertainty and where both cardinal and ordinal data are to be employed. It also serves well as an analysis tool in interactive planning processes, especially when criteria weights are not known or they are difficult to assess. FOR. SCI. 49(6):928-937.

AB 1. The pattern of responses of adult trees of Mountain Birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) to an outbreak of a folivorous insect (Epirrita autumnata) causing approximate to90% defoliation was studied over 8 years in a subarctic area in northern Sweden.
   2. Tree recovery was monitored in terms of the numbers, area, mass and nitrogen content of leaves, the numbers of leaf-carrying long and short shoots, and the widths of annual tree rings in stems.
   3. The most prominent characteristic of defoliated trees was a threefold increase in the proportion of long shoots 1 year after defoliation. These shoots subsequently produced many new leaf-carrying short shoots, resulting in shoot populations approximate to50% larger than those of control trees. Thereafter the most strongly defoliated trees showed decreasing leaf area.
   4. Defoliated trees produced more female catkins but fewer male catkins than control trees.
   5. Released apical dominance did not result in any overcompensation in terms of growth or leaf area production. However, it presumably increased the rate of recovery from herbivory. For the most strongly defoliated trees, the benefits from increased production of long shoots was not sustainable.

AB Tunisia is a marginal country hydrologically and it has adopted a number of distinctive methods of water management for agriculture. The central region supports modern dam irrigation, whilst traditional rainwater harvesting is practiced in the south. These contrasting techniques are described and evaluated in terms of sustainability using empirical field data and secondary literature for two study sites. Research focuses primarily on the physical environment, but socio-cultural and economic viability are also examined. Analysis indicates that traditional water management advantageously partitions the continuum dividing hazards and resources through subtle manipulation of the environment. A potentially hazardous environment is rendered secure by resourceful water management based on community action and cumulative knowledge. This practice minimizes community dependency and local economic imbalance. With dam irrigation, carrying capacity is established more forcibly by centralized control in order to place society within world markets. An almost total break from environmental variability is made in the short term, but this can lead to disequilibrium over longer durations. Additionally, the spatial and social distributions of development are uneven. In Tunisia, maintenance of traditional methods can reduce the negative impacts caused by modern programmes and support their positive characteristics. A mix of both methods offers a foundation to sustainable water supply in the new millennium.

AB Today's working society obviously develops from industrial production to knowledge-intensive service. In service-oriented working conditions, the importance of the human being as a main performer of economic success increases. Thus, the development leads to a changing spectrum of occupational health risks. Together with socio-demographic developments, individual strain-oriented health disorders connected to one's occupation might endanger an enterprise's capacity of performance and innovation as well as its sustainable enterprise development.
   Only healthy, motivated and qualified employees are able and ready to keep their creative and customer-oriented potential harnessed and thereby work to the best of their ability. Consequently, occupational health gains a more important role within the enterprise. Although in many enterprises the benefit contribution of preventive work design has not yet been considered that relevant, enterprises have realised that a preventive health-oriented work design might help to better manage current business challenges.
   An up-to-date definition of health includes the goals of health improvement, personality development as well as a comprehensive well-being. Health is a prerequisite and result of a productive reflection upon the conditions and challenges of work. Business practice shows that a preventive work design should involve an economic benefit for the enterprise. If occupational health is seen as a characteristic of quality and a prerequisite for sustainable enterprise development, economic potentials of preventive work designs will expand considerably.
